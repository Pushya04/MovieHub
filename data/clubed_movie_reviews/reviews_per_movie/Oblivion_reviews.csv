"naysayers are right, but I still liked it","Reading through the previous reviews, I find myself agreeing with the negative reviews in one sense, but still disagreeing overall. I walked away quite liking this movie.Most of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.Re stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.For me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.Given that theme, the movie's style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.Be careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.But still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.Sure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.To me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.But that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.Plus the drones looked really really cool.Re copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own. I saw and loved Moon (which granted is the better movie), but I enjoyed this one for what it was.I think it helped for me to not see any trailers, and to come in with low expectations after hearing about bad reviews.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A memorable sci-fi fantasy world with a human heart at its core.,"If there is a soul, it is made from the love we share.There are many ways to describe Oblivion, but the softly spoken afterword by Tom Cruise's character really makes you feel the human heartbeat of this sci-fi epic.As always, the trailer is full of explosions and set pieces. Oblivion the movie is an entirely different beast that values a human story and characters that are driven by common purpose. While the cast is tiny, I found much to enjoy from Cruise, Riseborough, Freeman and that Nordic guy from Headhunters who is showing up more frequently in Hollywood blockbusters. Aside from unusually limited screen-time, Morgan and other supporting cast are effective and memorable.The threads of the plot are well-woven and I won't give anything away, so what I will tell you is to prepare for a powerful journey into the unknown where nothing is what it seems. Explosive set pieces take a backseat for sci-fi philosophy with twists to spare.Oblivion ticks all the boxes for correct use of literary devices and establishes enough original cannon to stick in your mind long after the credits start rolling. It is a distinct success among the largely abysmal offerings of 2013 so far, don't miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

much better than expected !,"The trivia tells us that this is based on a comic book that director joseph kosinski wrote in 2005 but was never published. The story takes place in 2077, just after the ""memory wipe"" that jack (cruise) describes for us. And the invasion by space travelers, which destroyed most of the cities and made living on the surface mostly impossible. Some great special effets. The control panels, the copter, even the wrecked surface of the planet. Jack is tasked with protecting the structures that support the floating living quarters for the remaining population. I LOVE the mini moto that jack rides around on... kind of like a george jetson briefcase that folds and unfolds. Google it. Some beautiful scenery of iceland, and various film locs in the united states. When another human from the past crash lands, we're not sure what her mission is, or who's side she is on. Some really good suspense, while we wait for answers. Especially when morgan freeman is involved. Really good sci-fi stuff!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You are part of the problem.,"Primarily a tale of disinformation, ""Oblivion"" tackles myriad issues that are relevant to our time: Do you know who you are? Who do you trust to inform you? What is true intimacy? And will Artificial Intelligence rule over mankind? To be frank, the true great villain in ""Oblivion"" is the human race itself: We are enslaving our own people, destroying our own planet and exterminating each other. But, to be even more precise, the true villains are the people in wealth and power (as portrayed here by sentient artificial intelligence). The millionaires and politicians are the ones who pay to keep us in the dark and on our hamster wheels, feeding them resources at the cost of all life on the surface of the Earth. In our reality, just like in the movie, mankind is engaged in repetitive tasks, staying alive and oblivious to its truth; living in superficial relationships with no real love and allowing the planet to be consumed. As such, you and I ARE the protagonist in this movie: A puppet on strings, fighting against itself and serving an evil, selfish and vampiric power that is corrupting the planet. We are living in the clouds and need to touch grass.To get the plastic point across, Director Joseph Kosinski employs wonderful vistas of our planet. The photography and prop design in this movie is truly something special (thank you, Claudio Miranda). The color palette also gets the plot across by driving in the difference between conscious and unconscious, earthly and artificial thru black, brown and green versus cream and grey. Thru an exaggerated script, (one which can be frustrating, especially during the first minutes of the film), we see that the ideal life our repairman leads is both luxurious and supposedly meaningful... but something is afoot; it doesn't feel natural! Our protagonist has been fed false information, the same way we are told whatever suits the agenda of today's media outlets. We notice in the movie that those who cannot accept the truth, refuse to engage with the planet; they live in the sky and are not ""down to Earth"". These people exist in real life, and can usually be found in wealthy circles who are far removed from any struggle, conflict or life difficulty. Because of this, they perceive others as inhuman or below them, when the truth is the exact opposite.In conclusion, whether it was Joseph Kosinski's intention or not, ""Oblivion"" asks you to wake up and realize: You are overseeing the destruction of your human soul and are participating in the looting of planet Earth. But what do you do now? The film offers no other solution to this issue of the machine, other than to join a Jihad and bomb the system to kingdom come. As such, ""Oblivion"" may strike some users into consideration, but mostly passes off as a good time and is quickly forgotten in a sea of other consumables.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion - A look back.,"Oblivion is nine years old as I write this, and in perusing the reviews written when it opened, they have aged far less well than the movie.Those reviews are mostly concerned about whatever the hell Tom Cruise was going through at the time, or obsessed with obscure symbolism in the production design.For whatever reason, it appears the reviewers couldn't get over themselves enough to just watch the movie and evaluate it on its merits.On the off chance this film has escaped your attention, it is well worth two hours of your time. It is solidly acted and produced, has first class effects, and a spectacular location. The story combines some emotional heft with a clever and satisfying twist at the end.I watched it again, but this time with my SciFi hating wife. She protested initially, watched the entire thing, and then thanked me for getting her to watch it afterwards.That's as good as it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Are you an effective team?,"A provocative story kernel in its own right, yet it pulls fragments from too many genre greats making it a clichéd mosaic pastiche of a post apocalyptic world where everything is not as it seems.The opening third is intriguing and well played with a strong three-way dynamic between Jack, Victoria and their mysterious video-comm handler; it piques interest and poses many questions. Jack's questioning nature and feeling that something is 'off' contrasts with the 'happy clappy', following orders vibe from Victoria.This dynamic is enhanced with the addition of a fourth character Julia, who is already in Jack's dreams - a fabulous performance from Olga Kurylenko. From there though, the movie loses its charm and becomes completely generic.Fabulous cinematography uses distinct color palettes to denote time and location, admirably supported by excellent effects. The soundtrack is also strong with carefully selected music.Overall this is a good watch, but flatters to deceive. With more self-confident writing this could have become a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't know why this movie didn't make it,"I have now watched this movie 3 times, and each time have liked it more than I did the first time, and even then I still enjoyed it a lot. I look at the litany of trash on the screen that DOES make a profit and am dismayed that this one was so unsuccessful. First, it's a GORGEOUS movie, and it definitely has a beating heart. I found the acting quite good, the story involving, and was quite moved more than once. And the technical staff was amazing! I suspect that it will do well on home video and cable and that one day we'll look back on it and wonder why in the world it did so poorly in its initial run. I applaud director Kosinsky and his fine team of actors and the legion of other professionals involved in bringing this to the screen. I REALLY enjoyed this movie!31Jan14: Months later and I've watched it at least once more from my Blu-ray plus find it almost impossible to NOT watch it when I stumble across it on HBO, and I continue to find it absorbing and I STILL can't watch the end of it without crying!

"""I am Jack Harper and I am Home""","For decades it has been an accepted fact of life in Hollywood that, no matter how good the movie, endings are a write-off.Hollywood has learned the hard way that, no matter how good the film (or the book on which it is based) it is impossible to do an ending which satisfies the writer, the director, the producers, the critics, the audience and (duh!) reviewers like this one.That is why, for literally as long as there have been movies, endings are changed at the last minute; and often even multiple endings are shot so that survey groups can be brought in to make the final choice.The reason I gave this brief lecture on the importance of endings is simple -- going into the last 20 minutes, this was a rock solid film with a rock solid script and rock solid performances.But the ending was ... perfect.And perfect endings are so rare these days that I needed to write a review for posterity that does nothing except note this for future readers and future viewers.Are we still an effective team???????????",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Visually amazing, very enjoyable.","'Oblivion' was a film that kept me gripped from the 1st minute. The set is just visually amazing, everything about it is stunning. The way the Earth looks, the vehicles, the bubble ship (where Jack lives) all just looked brilliant. The special effects were amazing too. I really am struggling for words to describe just how good it did look.The cast all done a great job, Tom Cruise was pretty much perfect in the lead role and then there was Morgan Freeman, who I wish could have had more screen time. Then there was two lesser known actresses, Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko who both gave very good and believable performances.I thought the plot was good and as I said before, it got your attention right from the start. The action scenes were breathtaking and extremely fast paced when they happened. Some have said that they felt the film was too long, I personally felt it was the right length because it enabled the characters to develop. It was a little bit predictable at times and did get a bit confusing when there was a twist, although it all made more sense in the end.Overall, this was a very enjoyable film that is just simply stunning on the eye.8/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Among The Gorgeous Exteriors,"Oblivion feels like a homage to the old science fiction films where it explores around its world, shows off its landscapes, soar all the ships that used to be made out of cardboard, and let the characters scrutinize until the plot finds the actual conflict. The film features plenty of amazing concepts and spectacular visuals that could be intriguing. There seems to be a theme at the first half but all the questionable twists made the plot convoluted. It's disappointing when it hits to that point. It still can be entertaining and the technical work is indeed a splendor. There's plenty of potential around but there is still something missing in the end.The film reminiscence a lot of popular sci-fi films. It has the exteriors of Planet of the Apes and a plot that runs and remind you of Alien, Total Recall, and I Am Legend(I don't want to spoil the next film that resembles). The first act is totally gripping by introducing its high concept. When it proceeds to the actual story, there is suppose to be even more mindblowing than it was shown. It throws away some intriguing twists, but the film doesn't bother explaining enough what's the point about it. There's also an interesting pathos of Jack missing the old less-broken world at the beginning, but the story easily ignores it. Many would think it doesn't matter, but that might possibly bring some soul to the picture. It's centrally about finding the protagonist's identity. The romance is ought to be important for his journey but this relationship wasn't develop much, leading as a typical love subplot. The performances are just typical for the actors. Tom Cruise plays his usual hero roles. It's fine for the film's character though. Morgan Freeman once again serving up details of the plot. The only thing what's different is he wears a costume that looks pretty good to him.Despite of the underwhelming storytelling, we still get to see some rich futuristic details. The film has its own style and creates a marvelous world. Other than the whimsically designed rubble of the destroyed earth, all the weapons, ships, and costumes are quite snazzy to appeal for those who seek for eye catching stuff. If there's one thing Joseph Kosinski has improved then that would be the suspense. Tron: Legacy actually had none of them, this one knows the aesthetics of a sci-fi horror thriller. Those thrills are just limited, though. He's still in his comfort zone by only caring for the pretty visuals and the techno soundtrack.Oblivion is almost better than it was expected. It would have been as good as it looks like if only it was eager to put more explanation about the intrigue, and soul to the story. It leaves the audience thought provoked. The bright side is it's not one of those generically loud modern sci-fi films. It's one of those basic, yet classic style of science fiction. It's a great thing especially for this era of blockbusters. Everything in the film looks stunning and breathtaking. It's terribly entertaining as well if we don't mind those flaws. Again, the film offered something remarkable but fails to execute because of its pretension. We get it, the visuals and the soundtrack are the best part of the film, but I think it deserves better than those. Honestly, Oblivion can be a classic if it adds something smarter and much meaningful. For now, all the beautiful landscapes that were featured will be the only thing that would spellbind the audience throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If you like Sci Fi, you'll love this!","I hadn't really heard of Oblivion before I watched it, but I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise and his films, as he is such an excellent actor. Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.The characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.The special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.As I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.The overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.It's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

If anyone doubts that she can act, they should watch this one again.If you enjoy a movie with an actual story and not just an expensive CGI affair, this is worth your time.I rarely watch a movie more than once but this one has captured my attention a few times.

Boring and derivative,"A movie with the same twist as one recent sci fi flick (but who doesn't use it as well as the other film did) and the same ending as an older sci fi flick (again, not used to the same advantage) should laugh at itself. Instead Oblivion wallows in outdated heroism and 'gag me with a spoon' dialogue that reeks of someone who really thinks he is writing a classic, and so will be forgiven for making the actors utter the immortal words ""dream of us"" in order to be romantic.Wonderful visuals wasted on a boring story with no point. Tom Cruise is fine, so is the rest of the cast, though the waste of Morgan Freemans skills and character annoy me.Kosinski should stay away from science fiction until he has something to say, and then he should get someone else to write the script.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A unexpectedly really good movie.,"Without revealing any spoilers, I saw this movie ""out of the blue"". Never saw a trailer (I still haven't). I remember hearing the name of the movie and completely forgot about it, and just decided to take a chance and watch it on cable TV one night. It is a Sci-Fi movie with a human heart, so you don't need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy it. Also, I am not a Tom Cruise addict, but he does a great job in his usual way. In fact, all the actors portray their characters very well.There is mystery, action, a little bit of love, and some adventure. The beginning is good, there is a high point, and the ending of the movie is satisfactory in my opinion. The special effects are executed in a way not to take away from the story or the plot, and the story does not revolve around them, but rather they are just a part of the story. If you are looking for a good movie to watch, I have to say it is well worth the viewing, not too predictable. Sit back and relax, you'll enjoy this gem.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Arresting Visuals, Vague Details","The fact 2012 has passed is clearly of no concern to Hollywood. An incoming assault of end- of-the-world and post-apocalyptic pictures is nigh, with After Earth, Pacific Rim, World War Z and This Is the End keeping Earth in plenty of jeopardy. The first one up? Summertime precursor Oblivion. Set roughly a half-century into the future, the movie serves up as many immaculate shots as it does derivations from previous science fiction works.Pitching Oblivion's premise doesn't necessarily make it sound like a riveting experience; Tom Cruise leads a small cast of relatively small players (aside from one Morgan Freeman) as Jack Harper. His task is to repair drones which have been taken down and left by beings known as Scavs. Truth be told, it takes a while to reach the movie's meat, and even longer to find its funky bones. Before and in-between those points are a few stretches that could've easily been tightened for a bit less seat-shifting. Twists and turns, especially of the unpredictable kind, are seldom and infrequent.One thing Oblivion does accomplish well is a certain level of intrigue, namely after the first hour. A certain twist happens that, if unsurprising, still opens up a few questions the movie assumes we've already pondered. As the final act starts to close, a sense of eminence comes forward which, if nothing else, holds our undivided attention. Concern arises not so much with the convenient ending, but the payoff stemming from the climax. Backing details are both sparse and vague, further reinforced by a brief but jarring shift in setting.Looking past the story isn't too difficult, since there are several spectacular sights to behold. If you've ever wondered what Earth would look like after every single disaster movie, Oblivion is here to fill (or show) the gaps. Since many of these come during the first act, it means the feathery stakes can rest easy for a short while. Even when the eye candy changes to slightly more action-packed moments, we still get to enjoy concise directing. You won't feel the raised stakes so much as witness them, but at least the ongoings are discernible.As our key tour guide, Tom Cruise delivers another solid performance. Most of the time, the entire movie falls on his shoulders. Thankfully, he's versed and competent enough to handle this without stumbling or overreaching. And since this is Mr. Cruise, it just wouldn't look right for him to not have at least one attractive lady beside him. In the case of Andrea Riseborough, we have a better take on what would normally be a simple caricature. Some of her emoting feels unnatural, but the unease her character goes through is pleasantly convincing. This is more than what can be said for Olga Kurylenko who, though not bad, doesn't have enough material to work with. Most of her scenes seem forced in. As for Morgan Freeman, who comes in rather late, he really doesn't have to act to convince the average audience member. That said, he works out just a bit more than the character would if portrayed by anyone else.Other than the visual quality, what will probably stand out to film enthusiasts is just how much Oblivion borrows from other sci-fi movies. 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Independence Day and even Armageddon merely lead an all-too-obvious list. Thankfully, while Oblivion can't stand half as high as some, it does exceed the lesser works.While the true juggernauts of 2013 still haven't been released, Oblivion isn't necessarily a minuscule player. Those who have yet to verse themselves with most fundamental sci-fi films might walk away feeling floored. Other, more acquainted viewers will want to see this as a homage to its forefathers, which is touched upon at certain points. Keep your expectations modest and the end results might be enough for you to afford it a recommendation.www.recaphub.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion To Remember,"For something, which obviously belongs in the department of mainstream entertainment, this movie is actually quite dense with meaning and even possesses some real drama. Though it begins as just another superficial sci-fi flick, soon enough a series of twists, which are there not to simply add to your amusement but to tell a story that is meant to convey some significant message, transforms the initially ordinary plot completely. And also, if not fully justifies, but at least thoroughly explains apparently perfunctory performances.The rest is up to you to see and understand - the movie is, in fact, pretty rich in metaphor. And despite its post-apocalyptic futuristic setting it's not an escapist fairy-tale. It's about us today. It's about people who've accepted the mode of existence when you do ""not ask too many questions"". When you simply ""do not want to know"". When your ""job is to not remember"". And you choose, as one prominent character from another, even more poignant, sci-fi feature put it, ""living your lives oblivious"". But it can be termed differently - you choose sleepwalking into an abyss. So to really appreciate this movie do not expect just a piece of pop-corn entertainment.Unfortunately, the movie has some totally unnecessary supplement at the very end that seriously diminishes the dramatic effect and dents the way in which it expresses its overall message. But if you get out of the theater right after the first phrases of the main character's afterword you'll indeed have enough to think and feel about long after. The questions this movie poses are serious: do we live to forget, to refuse to know or to look for the truth? And when we ourselves are on the brink of becoming just a memory - do we want to make it fighting or crawling?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great movie, not all potential filled","While Tom Cruise's acting in the film was good, I think Jack should have been portrayed by a new face to eliminate that recognition of Jack as Tom Cruise and to allow the viewers to perceive him as an unknown person now referred to as ""Jack"". The overall acting in the film was very well done. Morgan Freeman was excellent and somehow didn't interfere with meeting his new character.The Post-apocalyptic scenery is jaw dropping and really gives the sense of exploration and adventure while watching. The drones were perfect in their visual appearance and sound design, with each drone noise your heart skips a beat and they project intenseness and power, as were the towers and power stations, the visual and graphic work is truly something to admire.The story contains great thinking and ideas that can be developed and explored creatively to produce a true masterpiece of the mind and since the writer is the director, he would have projected this creativeness on screen. But I can't get rid of that feeling that Oblivion is a work in progress and not a completed story ready to be put into the world of visual story telling. It just lacks some of the depth and detail that could be included in it, or perhaps is only in the graphic novel. It felt very short.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The start was a little slow, but still threw in some moments of concern to keep one on the edge. As the film settled on, it kept moving at a good pace. Story was a basic love story, mixed in with morality, but basically, love story.Cgi was amazing, cinematography was brilliant, stunning even. All the main characters were easy on the eye too, always making it easier to want to watch.Plot wasn't sophisticated, probably described as feel good, but frankly, it was perfect.

"Beautifully shot, never boring, but...","Excellent cinematography, if maybe a bit too much on the ""euro"" style (instead of the over saturated colors we see lately). Story is good, but it tries too hard to present you with shocks and twists that can either be seen a mile away or are not significant enough to bring anything interesting to the movie as a whole. Tom cruise is solid as usual, and the rest of the cast supports him accordingly, althou talents like Morgan Freeman and Nicolas Koster Waldau are largely underwritten and underused. Sadly the script sometimes seems borrowed, and as a result the movie reminds you of so many other science fiction movies that it looses its own identity to an otherwise decent reimagining of a ""post- disaster"" future earth. I did enjoy the movie, it is by no means a waste of your time and/or money, it only leaves that idea in your mind that by tweaking it a little more, or maybe even by shortening it and pacing it a little bit faster, a much stronger movie could have emerged. Anyhow, i'm hoping to see Joseph Kocinsky's next directorial effort as soon as possible (TR30N?), I'm becoming a fan pretty fast.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually excellent though slightly too long,"This movie is - without a doubt - one of the most visually spectacular that I have ever seen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder in that department with the likes of Watchmen, Prometheus, Sunshine and Kosinski's preceding effort - TRON: Legacy. Also (like TRON) the soundtrack is excellent and very well used throughout, enhancing the action and adding depth to some - at times - distinctly average acting performances.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise but that's not a bad thing in this case, in fact his natural charisma carries the movie through some of its slower sections. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman though he's really not on screen for long enough to influence the movie one way or another. Olga Kurylenko's statuesque profile is unfortunately not matched by her acting ability and I often found it difficult to believe in her character's actions and emotions. Andrea Riseborough turns in maybe the best performance, convincing as the sad and confused Victoria, unwilling - or perhaps unable - to confront the disturbing truth.At over 2 hours I think that it's too long by about 20 minutes. A shorter cut would tighten up the story and eliminate some of the slower sections which I think hurt the movie's overall rhythm and flow.Overall, I would definitely recommend going to see this movie in the cinema, on the biggest screen that you can find. It just won't be the same on TV. The visual appeal alone is reason enough, but combined with a clever (if not entirely original) script, a thumping soundtrack and some exciting action, you should be entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion reaches for the stars – and almost makes it,"Based on an unpublished graphic novel written by director Joseph Kosinski, Oblivion is set in the year 2077, on an Earth rendered mostly uninhabitable due to sixty years of war with alien invaders known as 'Scavs'.Most of humankind has migrated to Titan, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are stationed on Earth to maintain drones that service gigantic power reactors which supply energy for the new colony. From station Tech 49, Jack flies down to the surface to locate and repair the drones, while Victoria monitors him from the station, hundreds of feet above the surface of the planet.Due to security protocols, Jack and Victoria's memories have been wiped, and their only human contact, albeit by radio, is with Sally (Melissa Leo), who is based on the orbiting space station the 'Tet'. Although Jack's memory has been wiped, he continually dreams of a young woman in a New York untouched by war.When a drone goes missing, Jack descends to the surface to locate it, but what he finds makes him question everything he believes in.Oblivion is visually stunning. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda - who won last years' Oscar, and also worked with director Joseph Kosinski on 'Tron Legacy' – has done an amazing job in his first sci-fi movie.The script, written by Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt is solid, also attempting to be as accurate as possible concerning the science involved within the story. An important element for many sci-fi fans.Tom Cruise does a fine job as Jack. No matter what you may think of Cruise personally, he is a fine actor, and one of the few that can easily make the transition between drama and action and pull it off successfully. Or, as in the case of Oblivion do both.He is ably supported by the rest of the cast which besides Riseborough and Leo also includes Olga Kurylenko as Julia, and Morgan Freeman as Beech.Joseph Kosinski has done a fine job of bringing his graphic novel to the big screen. Although the film is a sci-fi flick, there is enough drama and twists in the plot to appeal to a broader audience.Oblivion may not be the best sci-fi movie ever made, but it holds its own compared to many in this genre, and is a highly entertaining couple of hours. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spoiler-free review, the less you know the better you'll enjoy it","I really wanted to see this movie from the first time I saw the movie trailer a long time ago. I came up with all sorts of fun endings in my own mind based on the trailer and eventually my curiosity caused me to read too much and I read some spoilers that I wish I hadn't. I still enjoyed the film immensely, but wish I hadn't read the spoilers and suggest you shy away from all potential spoilers, reading as little as possible before seeing the movie. So when you're done with this review, don't read anymore, just go see the movie.I had the good fortune of watching this movie at an advance screening on a smaller IMAX screen and I really enjoyed it, as did the huge audience, judging by the lively and jovial banter as people exited. The movie follows Jack Harper who is a drone repair tech in a future earth that has been ravaged by an alien invasion. He has a by-the-books eye-in-the-sky (literally) assistant named Victoria (nicknamed Vika) who watches out for Jack and reports to Central. They live together in a sky platform to avoid the alien scavs who come out at night. Jack is keeping the drones repaired to defend huge energy machines from being attacked by the scavs. Once enough energy has been stored up from the world's oceans by the energy machines, the remaining survivors of earth hope to leave in a few short weeks for the safety of a new base on Saturn's Titan. To protect certain things, Jack and Victoria's memories have been erased before their present situation. Jack is confused about why they have to leave earth, whereas Vika is ready to go, but they both cherish and respect each other. Then Jack meets Malcolm Beech who tells Jack that things are not exactly how they seem, which sets off a series of events that eventually lead to the end of the movie.Some critics have mentioned something like ""we've seen these ideas before"" in other movies. While it's true that there's nothing totally new in this movie per se, that doesn't make the movie less appealing, IMO. Thinking back to when I was much younger and saw the trailer for the movie Independence Day in the theatre, I remember thinking that the movie looked really fun despite the fact that there've been a zillion alien invasion movies before, but I still hoped they'd do a great job with it because the trailer for the movie was awesome. Was there anything earth-shatteringly new about the movie? Not really, but it was still excellent entertainment. That's how I feel about Oblivion. To me, it's great entertainment.The only minor complaints I had was that the volume of the music while Jack and Vika were in the pool was too much and sometimes things dragged ever so slightly between action sequences. Overall though, this movie was definitely a remarkable treat.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A visually wonderful adventure,"If you are a fan of spectacle and fun science fiction, Oblivion is the movie for you. While it isn't a masterpiece of cinema, it is highly entertaining, a fun ride, and never lets the audience down.I went into Oblivion with a relatively open mind. I had seen trailers for it months ago, but it looked like a mindless action movie/summer blockbuster, which is not my favorite genre at all. Hence I didn't know anything about it except that Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman were in it. Now that I've seen it, I can honestly tell most other movie goers that it is a wonderful ride. It has everything you could hope from an action movie: plot twists, adrenaline rushes, mystery, good acting, and just enough explosions to be awesome but not overdone.The biggest problem with the movie is that there is a rather pointless narration for the first few minutes. Narrations are one of my biggest film pet peeves. If I wanted someone to read to me, I'd get a book on tape—surely there are a million better ways of presenting exposition in a film. In fact, most of the information in the narration is presented within the next twenty minutes, and Oblivion would perhaps gain from forcing the audience to form connections implicitly. While talking about story, it may help to point out that the plot is not the main focus of Oblivion. Unfortunately, the story seems almost incidental to the sheer spectacle. Yes there are a few plot twists, but they are mostly predictable, especially to experienced sci-fi fans.But the sheer spectacle is certainly something that Oblivion does right. From start to finish, it is visually stunning. One gets a genuine feeling of awe when swooping over beautiful vistas, or through ruined cities. With so many beautiful shots of nature, the man-made props and sets are given a high standard, but they are equal to the task. Equally dramatic is the musical score, which conveys a sense of adventure and drama, and occasionally soars into emotional territory. Few dramatic action films manage to be pure entertainment without resorting to semi-comedic one-liners, and over the top action highlighted by overblown CGI, yet Oblivion pulls it off. It never takes itself too seriously, but also never feels forced.While nothing extraordinary, Oblivion is a more than decent film that fully lives up to its own promise. Hardcore movie buffs may be disappointed by the lack of originality, but no one who can kick back and enjoy the ride will be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good movie that is worth seeing but seemed like a big collage of every other sci-fi movie ever made. I say B+,"""I can't shake the feeling that Earth, in spite of all that's happened, Earth is still my home."" Jack Harper (Cruise) is one of the last inhabitants of Earth. Years after a war decimated the planet him and his partner are left to protect the machines taking the water for use on the new home world. One day while he is out investigating something strange happens that changes his life and way of thinking. I was looking forward to this movie not because of Tom Cruise but because it looked interesting. While this is a very good movie and well worth seeing I had to laugh a few times. I don't want to give anything away but this movie is pretty much a mix of every single sci fi movie ever made. Each scene you think they did that in that one movie, or I saw that in that other movie. Serioulsy, think of a sci-fi movie and there is something in this one from that. The movie did have a kind of 80's feel to it which was cool and it is worth seeing but it's really just a collage of sci-fi from 2001 to After Earth (yes the movie that hasn't come out yet is even ripped off). Overall, well worth seeing and a fun game guessing what movie this scene is from. I give it a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Exciting visuals and twists,"Just finished watching the film for a second time through. First time through at an extreme screen cinema and the second at home. At both locations the film was fantastic in terms of visual and sfx. The film was very well directed with a range of creative and visually pleasing shots and film techniques. The storyline itself was great with plenty of exciting twists and turns in the storyline. Admittedly, the first hour is not as exciting and the second - however it worked to explain the storyline which was one of the greatest aspects of the film. Definitely a must see - even after my second viewing I was able to enjoy and learn more about the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion - Proper SF despite a couple of pretty serious mistakes,"Summary: The world was attacked by the Scavengers. They destroyed the moon, which caused many natural disasters across the planet. The war was eventually won by the humans after deploying nuclear weaponry, but afterward the planet was mostly uninhabitable. The humans now live on Titan, a moon of Saturn, apart from a few who stayed behind in a large space station, or on earth, where large machines now harvest water for fusion energy. Some remaining Scavengers continue to disrupt that process. Drones defend the machines, and a few humans remain to repair the drones if they get damaged.Jack (Cruise) is such a repairman. Assisted by his communications partner and girlfriend Vika (Riseborough) he finds damaged drones and repairs them, or takes them back to his base/home if he doesn't have the parts to repair them on the spot. Jack often dreams of a woman (Kurylenko), and is haunted by several ""memories"" that he is not supposed to have because of a memory wipe he had to undertake for security reasons. This causes him to question the things around him, and gets him into trouble. I will stop here, because otherwise I will reveal too much.Oblivion is a post-apocalyptic SF movie with a couple of upsides and a couple of downsides. Let me start with the downsides, so I can end on a positive note. ;-)1. The movie contains lots of plot ideas that were already used in other movies. It's not a one on one copy of another SF movie, but there are many things that are not very original.2. The movie is pretty predictable. There were many plot twists that I saw coming, even though I am pretty naive when I am watching movies. I didn't really mind this, but I am sure some will.3. There is a pretty extensive list of mistakes they made in the movie. Some of them bothered me a bit, most of them not really, but if you are a severe critic when watching movies, they might stop you from enjoying the movie. Other reviews reveal that this is a serious possibility.4. The acting isn't perfect. Cruise does a decent job, but the problems arise with the supporting cast. They just don't seem to get the chance to have their characters develop properly. Freeman should have had way more screen time, and Riseborough also doesn't get the chance to make Vika grow on us. Kurylenko does get quite some time to have her character develop, but she seems to just underperform. Not sure who is to blame here though. Might be the director's fault instead of Kurylenko's.Now, enough with the criticism. Time for some upsides! And the movie deserves a positive end note, because I enjoyed watching it a lot, despite of its flaws.1. Visually, the movie is spectacular! The large machines look great, the destroyed moon looks great, the action scenes are really nice and the combat drones are outright frightening. Their speed and efficiency are really impressive. The landscapes from the destroyed planet Earth are also very beautifully made.2. The plot, though somewhat unoriginal and containing many errors, is actually really interesting. The starting point is nice, and there are many twists that I liked. An SF fan should definitely not be disappointed by it. If we compare this plot to say Star Trek (2009) or the Transformers movies, it is quite a relief to finally watch a proper story again.3. The speed of the movie is very good! If you read other reviews, you will find that some thought the movie was slow. Perhaps they liked the speed of the last Total Recall movie, but normal movie fans will find one big roller-coaster of action sequences and special effects just tiring and pointless. The slower pace in Oblivion helps us familiarize with the characters and the story. If the movie would have been any faster than this, the story would have become one big mess and we would not at all have been able to enjoy character development (which I feel was already lacking a bit in the current pace).Conclusion: I would rate this movie a 7/10. Yes, there are many flaws, but I enjoyed the movie a lot, and there is lots to enjoy about it. Most SF movies have plot errors, but that's what you get if you make a movie with a complex plot, action sequences, special effects, a love story and so on. SF movies are never perfect, and this one is a solid effort. To a general audience I would say 'mildly recommended'. For SF fans it's a must see, though it probably won't become your all time favorite.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent Sci Fi. Don't listen to the negative reviews!,"I just finished watching Oblivion, and once again, the ratings and reviews were mostly unhelpful. This seems to be a growing trend here. Movies have actually been getting better in the last half decade and yet audiences are getting more cynical. Oblivion is so much better than the 7/10 it's currently rated at on IMDb. Yes, there are some familiar ideas contained within the plot, but it definitely stands on its own, and the film is a visual masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Oblivion is better than all the modern Star Wars movies put together. I don't know what it takes to satisfy people, because I don't know how anyone can walk away from this film without feeling thoroughly entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A lot of artificial reviews propping this turkey up...,"This film drags. The story is poor, fails to engage and the dialogue is absolute drivel. The film is a VERY poor mans Total Recall. The special effects are excellent, as you might expect, but the film is an absolute turkey. The average rating will drop right down over the coming months; I can only assume a lot of Cruise fans or Scientologists are being VERY generous - an all too common phenomenon these days. Avoid like the plague; or better still - go and watch some paint dry, or grass grow.The whole I lost my memory, I'm living with someone who isn't my wife, my real wife randomly turns up and I turn vigilante for the rebels has been done to death and far, far better. Its almost farcical watching how EVERY single shot is shot to make Cruise look tall - I mean, you only get head shots upper torso or legs - no close-up full boy in the entire movie. There are so many plot holes, you just want to sigh at the screen and shake your head. I'm generally a Cruise fan - no really - but this is not a good vessel, not a good story and sure as hell not a good film. For effect junkies, you'll enjoy the CG - but that's literally all.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fantastic visual effects ensure a gripping and entertaining film,"Before seeing this film in theaters it was tough to know what to expect. It immediately grasped my attention as the storyline was so different than anything I have seen as of late. Tom Cruise is the perfect man for the lead role, and does not fail to deliver a good performance. If you are a relatively simple person with a short attention span you may become a bit dazed and confused as to why certain components of the film are occurring, but it adds up in the end beyond measure. Although 'Oblivion' forces you to work slightly harder than usual in understanding the plot and each twist that it takes, it all comes together very well in this thrilling yet slightly confusing film. No doubt one of Kosinski's best so far.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worth a Watch!!!!,"I can boldly say Oblivion is much better than Ridley Scott's Prometheus.Joseph Kosinski(so called visionary director)is known for his stunning visuals and he proves it again in Oblivion.Visuals are brilliant.Do watch it in theater with a decent projection otherwise you cant appreciate it.The movie is inspired from a graphic novel edited by radical comics.Its really tough to bring a graphic novel on screen.Only few have succeeded.I can clearly say Oblivion has not achieved full success.Few twists are misplaced,some aren't clearly explained (Movie needs trimming) but there are few good moments which makes us involved .Some of the background scores are rip of Hans Zimmers's work.Though there are lot of negatives but Tom Cruise and the stunning visuals sets this movie apart from recent sci-fi movies.Surely worth a watch!!!

Nothing new.,"This film shouldn't be rated anything more than 4/10.

If Tom Cruise wasn't in this film, it would have struggled to make it to DVD.Very Disappointed.Jordan",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not brilliant, but moving and exciting nevertheless.","It's been my experience that when someone says ""I hate Tom Cruise movies"" it's because they read too many trashy mags and have formed a negative opinion of the man himself; which invariably leads to a blind dislike of his output, regardless if its good, bad or somewhere in between. Well, Oblivion is the latest motion picture from Cruise - after the admittedly superior Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol - that many will unfortunately deny themselves the joy of viewing. It's not the world-beating sci-fi epic it so desperately aims to be (there's obvious nods to 2001, The Omega Man and even Total Recall), but that doesn't stop this futuristic tale from being thought-provoking, visually beautiful and largely entertaining. A sagging middle period slows proceedings down after the opening act so capably sets the tone, yet a rousing and surprisingly affecting climax ensures it finishes on a very strong note. The Cruiser is solid as curious drone maintenance man Jack Harper, so too Olga Kurylenko as a mysterious human whose space-pod crash lands onto the dilapidated Earth and Andrea Riseborough as Jack's straight-as-an-arrow co-worker and lover; it's Morgan Freeman who lets the side down in a clichéd and predictable role as leader of the underground resistance. The film's greatest asset though? The superb techno score that, coupled with Daft Punk's phenomenal musical work on Tron: Legacy, proves director Joseph Kosinksi knows how important a memorable beat is in these visionary worlds of his. Moments of brilliance outshine the sporadic flaws to establish this as a moving, exciting and worthy sci-fi yarn.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Seen It Before, but Beautifully Shot and Well Acted","Tron: Legacy director, Joseph Kosinski's latest, is a sci-fi flick based on his own graphic novel, starring Tom Cruise, called Oblivion.After Earth was attacked by aliens, humanity had no choice but to use nukes, in so doing they won the war but made Earth uninhabitable. Cut forward to 60 years later, where we meet Tom Cruise's Jack Harper, a drone repairman living on Earth in a glass tower high up in the sky. His job is to repair the drones that protect the machines harvesting Earth's remaining water for the humans that moved to Saturn's moon, Titan. However, when a mysterious spacecraft crashlands on Earth, Jack finds human survivors in the wreckage, spurring everything to change.Harking back to 1970's science fiction films like Logan's Run or THX 1138, nothing in Oblivion is ever what it seems. There are so many twist and turns to this movie, it would be very easy to get lost, if you didn't see every one of them coming. Almost every twist has been done before in other sci-fi films, with far more realistic thinking as to what the repercussions of such discoveries truly would have on a person. Of course a big part to this is that the script just doesn't give enough information. They often gloss over things in one line that needed to be explained to be understood fully, and that might have made a few more of the character's actions make sense. Even with all of this said, there is a lot of good about Oblivion.The cinematography by Claudio Miranda is just hauntingly beautiful. Miranda and Kosinski's use of the Icelandic landscapes standing in for ruined America, were expertly used to create a scope that has been sorely lacking from almost every other sci-fi film over the past few decades. Not to mention the design work of this film, which is architecturally stunning, just like Kosinski's Tron: Legacy was. As well, even though the plot twists often murk up the story, the characters are always so likable and intriguing, you keep going along with them, and a large part of that is due to the good performances of its cast. Tom Cruise is easy to root for in this movie, but the write home performance is Andrea Riseborough, who plays Jack's partner up in the sky tower, Victoria. Riseborough makes simple three word lines of dialogue have far more weight than the script gave them because one can tell that she is always applying subtext through the tone of her voice and her facial mannerisms. Riseborough truly deserves more international notice of her talents.Ultimately, while you've seen everything in Oblivion before, and done with more satisfying results, Oblivion is still a good, enjoyable sci-fi film worth seeing on the big screen thanks to great performances from its cast that make the most of their characters and the gigantic canvas that the film is set against.I give Oblivion a 7 out of 10!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Collage of Sci-fi,"Sci-fi is a popular stable of fiction and we have seen many great stories in the genre. It is a genre that has many avenues to explore and Joseph Kosinski's Oblivion certainly uses as many sci-fi elements and tropes as possible.The year is 2077 and it has been 60 years since Earth was invaded by an alien race, known as Scavengers, who blow up the Moon. Humanity repealed the invasion but it was a pyrrhic victory, as most of the planet has become uninhabitable and humanity now lives on a space colony on Titan.Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are a mop up crew on Earth, with mission to maintain drones to protect sea based power generators from the reminding 'Scavs'. They are two weeks away to finishing their mission and go to Titan. But despite Jack having his memory erased he keeps having dreams about a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko). He is soon thrown into a conspiracy when the 'Scavs' try to capture Jack and make a signal to bring down cryo-pod in space contending the woman of Jack's dreams, a Russian woman called Julie Rusakova.Oblivion is compilation of sci-fi films and fiction and if you played a drinking game about spotting each of these sci-fi references: you would suffer liver failure by the end of the film. The clearest parallels are with Moon, following its set up, the plot points, the reveal and conspiracy, the other being Total Recall as Jack suffers from confessing memories, not knowing what is real sense of reality is and ending joining the rebel forces. Other sci-fi elements used include the manipulation of reality by a distance Big Brother like entity who creates a common enemy like in Nineteen-Eighty Four, to ideas and scenes used in I, Robot, Independence Day, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The 6th Day. Even the art direction within the tower shares a look with white clear look of I, Robot, Star Trek (2009) 2001: A Space Odyssey and Portal and the imagery of the destroyed Earth looks like it was influenced by The Road and Planet of the Apes.Like Kosinski's previous film Tron Legacy, Oblivion is impressive to look at, with excellent action and lush production design, but the film never fully fleshes out its ideas. It was clear that Kosinski was committed to the film, it was based on his own unpublished graphic novel. He wanted to make more then a sci-fi actioneer and make something more thoughtful as it looks at themes of reality, identity and manipulation. It was certainly a noble attempt but Kosinski lets his film drag and it is a little too easy to think about other sci-fi films during the proceedings.Oblivion certainly felt like it kept to its graphic novel origins: it had grand images, designs and concepts and its strong action. The reveal about who the Scavs really are would worked better on the page but that is because in a comic book it is harder to see what is coming then in a film because of the why they are promoted. Some of the dialogue also felt too comic book like, being very clunky and unnatural.The major fault with the film is it does drag and has at times a slow pace. This is of course a part of the attempt to make Oblivion into a more meaningful film then being an action film. But it does not bring anything new to the table and many of the plot points are predictable, especially if you have seen Moon. Oblivion's editor needed to be a little more ruthless.Whilst Kosinski needs to work a bit more at bringing out his themes and fleshing out idea, he's an accomplished visualist. He does give us a stark view of an empty, destroyed Earth, crumbling away and contrasting it to the ultra-modern, clean look of the tower. Kosinski knows how to shot impressive action sequences and he gives us a lot, from aerial dog fights to gun battles to fist fights. One of the best moments is when the camera follows a drone causing carnage during a battle.Oblivion certainly has a top cast. Cruise continues to show off his leading man credentials and he is a solid presence throughout the film; though he gets to be with two women who are nearly 20 years his junior. It is good to see Riseborough finally getting a major role in a Hollywood film and she gave a really good, quiet and naturalistic performance throughout. Morgan Freeman too looked like he was having fun with his supporting but pivotal role. But Game of Thrones star Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was wasted and underused in his role.Like Tron Legacy, Kosinski brings a major French band, this time M83, to provide the score. Whilst there are some similarities to the score for Inception, it still is a fine score.Oblivion borrows too many ideas and concepts from sci-fi and does not create enough of its own. It is still a solidly entertaining film with its action and intrigue it creates and the actors were certainly demanded to give good performances during the film.A final note, Oblivion offers a true cinematic rarity; they play a Led Zeppelin song!

Good movie which could have been great,"Just recently coming out from the theater, I have mixed feelings regarding this movie. Most things about Oblivion are good, very good actually. The cast is excellent, they all bring personality into their respective roles. The cast is not actually very large, but no more are needed. Visually, Oblivion is stunning. Beautiful scenery and good-looking special effects. It does feel a bit spartan as a whole, but it does fit the theme. The music is also great, adding to the feel of epicness to the movie. I would really recommend watching this movie in the theaters, it is definitely that kind of a movie.With all of these aspects of greatness, there is a major one on which Oblivion fails to deliver. Unfortunately, its the story part. It is a bit thin. While the story is not bad, its not good either so it sums up to merely okay. And for this epic kind of movie, this is a let down.In summary, Oblivion is an epic movie which could have been great had there been more depth to it.

Oblivion - Love Story 2077,"Oblivion is the second feature for Joseph Kosinski which is an adaptation of his unpublished graphic novel of the same name. Set in the remains of the earth after a nuke war by the aliens, Jack Harper(Cruise) a tech and his partner Victoria(Andrea Riseborough) work as an effective team to take care of the drones, hydro-generators and to attack rogue aliens who are called Scavs.Set in the year 2077, Jack is a tech guy who's the last man on earth stationed along with Victoria. The rest of the humans are in Saturn's largest moon Titan and the story majorly happens in the final two weeks before Jack and Victoria return to their station TET before abandoning the earth. TET is their ultimate command center which monitors Jack and Victoria who in turn monitor the hydro-generators which draws energy to be used as fuel for Titan.The story takes a contortion when Jack meets Olga whom he rescues from the wreckage of a space shuttle Odyssey. Jack happening to be the only person who has faint memories of the earth before war and Olga triggers back the memories. Jack and Olga are being captured by the Rogue aliens who are actually humans in disguise and Jack joins them to save what's remaining of the earth.Tom's character as Jack has been built up well and he's adorable in every frame which he appears, specially when he enacts the Superbowl which happens in 2017. Jack's a NY Yankee's fan, that's what I inferred from his cap. He has a bubble ship which looks like a dragonfly made out of glass, the ship has a bobble head on its dash and its the only way for him to vent out. He rides a kind of dirt bike, he has a plant grown out of a tin can. He sets out into the woods and listens to music. He has a collection of books and reads out from The Lays of ancient Rome by Lord Macaulay. He quotes from the poem ""Then out spake brave Horatius, the Captain of the Gate: To every man upon this earth, Death cometh soon or late"".Andrea as Victoria fairs well as a visually appealing colleague of Jack, She shares the bed with him and they swim together but the lady is the one who gives all the command. She's a robot like woman who goes by the commands. Victoria has an aurally alluring British accent that one would forget that there's a Morgan Freeman in this movie. Olga Kurylenko as Julia is namesake role who plays the wife of Jack, whenever she smiles she kind of reminds Lara Dutta. Morgan Freeman, Nilolaj Coaster-Waldau and Zoë Bell are there only to fill up the cast and they aren't even worthy of the supporting cast.The script originally written by Joseph Kosinski and William Monahan , rewritten by Karl Gajudesk and was finally rewritten by Michael Arndt. With so many drafts written by academy award winners the script fails in many parts and seems to be a long boring Sci-Fi towards the end. At places it even reminds you of other Sci-Fi movies, but Kosinski stated that Oblivion is a tribute to all Sci-Fi movie of 1970's.Guess he thought its better to be told before to be found out. It was actually a beautiful love triangle story which was later ruined by action scenes only because its a Sci-Fi movie and dollops of action scenes are highly required. The ""Waking Up"" soundtrack by M23 is very Hans Zimmerish and if you close your eyes and listen you'll mistake it for a Chris Nolan movie.On the whole Oblivion works out well for major portion of the movie. Its certainly to be watched on an IMAX screen to savor the visual spectacle and at the same time one should be happy that it wasn't released in 3-D as a considerable amount of your money is saved. Oblivion tag-lined as ""Earth's a memory worth fighting for"" is a movie worth watching for Tom Cruise fan-boys.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great story, amazing visuals, but not the polished article","I really wanted to like this. An intelligent story that despite the sic-fi setting would be welcomed by even non-fans of the genre. The production design and the visuals, particularly on the wide, landscape shots are just breath-taking and the future Earth is also well-depicted. Cinematography by Claudio Miranda was just gorgeous (had to look up afterwards who shot it, it was that good)! Alas, the final product felt a bit cold and empty for me and despite really wanting to like it, I wasn't as emotionally drawn to it as I would have liked. The issues for me stemmed from the choice of actors.Tom Cruise was really good, but I felt I was watching Tom Cruise, the star, not the actor who has worked on projects before where you believed the character was doing all the stuff, not Tom Cruise, the star e.g.. Tropic Thunder, Magnolia, Jerry Maguire etc. As much as I wanted to believe his role and his character, it left me slightly cold. When you are not invested in your central character all the way, that becomes a huge problem.Olga Kurylenko was an absolute waste for me. Not for a second did I believe that if that was me, I would be ready to give up my life for her! Her character was well-written, she was gorgeous and had that vulnerability about her, but her acting chops let her down big time.Andrea Riseborough, take a bow. Probably the strongest performance for me. In her small screen time, you totally invested in her character and her motivations. An absolute revelation and I would love to see more of her in future projects.Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau could have been combined into the one single character and that would have been much better. Didn't really see the point of two separate characters for these two.Overall, a great story. Could have been something special e.g.. Gattaca, Moon etc. but unfortunately not quite for me. Kudos to Kosinski and Tom Cruise for giving it a go. Great to see a refreshingly different take on the sic-fi genre. This, despite its flaws, is still worthy of 2 hours of your time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Earth is a memory worth fighting for"" and ""Oblivion"" is a movie worth paying for.","I'm not gonna reveal any plot details about this movie and if you want my opinion don't read the spoilers.Oblivion is a sci-fi movie with amazing CGI and great performances. The story is well delivered to the spectators and there are moments in this movie that will make your jaws to drop.The performance of Tom Cruise as Jack is outstanding and Morgan Freeman as a supporting character did a great job. I loved Andrea Riseborough's performance and i enjoyed Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau playing something else except Jaime Lannister. I never admired Olga Kurylenko as an actor and it is my firm belief that i never will, but to be honest with you she did a great job too.As i said the CGI was great and the music selected for ""Oblivion"" was marvelous. The director's vision about the after-war Earth gives you awe and the camera in moments of action is well placed.Joseph Kosinski did his magic!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much Better Than Expected,"After reading a handful of very negative reviews for this film, I decided to give it a look just to kill a few hours on an off day. I went in with low expectations, expecting a brainless Tom Cruise action flick with pretty much nothing memorable. These assumptions turned out to be very wrong, as Cruise's latest movie is actually an aesthetically pleasing, well-crafted, and well written drama that will engage you completely.Oblivion opens with a brief introduction into the world 60 years in the future. Earth has been ravaged by nuclear war, alien invaders have destroyed the moon, and a large group of human survivors are planning an emergency evacuation to Titan, one of Saturn's larger and more hospitable moons. The visual effects here are absolutely stunning; even without 3D, I was truly blown away by how crisp and beautiful the massive landscapes were in this film. Also of note here is the score, which really breathes life into the desolate remains of Earth.It's difficult to talk about much more in this film without giving anything away. The plot has a few interesting twists and turns, the characters are all acted well-enough (Cruise is particularly good), and the last few minutes of the film are magic.I imagine that the reason I enjoyed this film is because I had no expectations. I would definitely recommend this film, but go in with an open-mind and try not to rip apart the story for whatever plot-holes it may or may not have. Also, this movie is NOT an action movie. It's a long, slow moving drama that is well worth your time if you're in the right mood.Overall, it's good, just good.RATING: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Orgasmic Audio-Visual Fair!,"Here's a fine example of a film that may have an inconsistent and a familiar screenplay, but still makes up for an exciting watch due to its director Joseph Kosinski's extra-ordinary sense of creating spectacles that feel like breathing artworks. The effective background music makes them feel even grander. I think Kosinski's creative process starts basically from the music. It's essentially an orgasmic audio-visual fair, just like Kosinski's previous and debut film- Tron:Legacy. He's more ambitious here, and more passionate. Although, you can't help but recognize the influences behind the story-which are some sci-fi epics I won't name here-and feel deja-vu; it still never stops being exciting and interesting. Oh, BTW I suggest to listen to Oblivion OST by M83 (amazing shoegaze/electronica band) before going for the film. Really! M83's soundtrack feels like Hans Zimmer-Daft Punk-M83 all together at once. And that's effing awesome!I wait for the day when Kosinski is handed an ambitious and promising screenplay. That day, I believe, he will make a master-piece worth savoring for lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Predictable and Drawn Out, but a Visual Feast","As far as I can tell, OBLIVION is MOON (the awesome Duncan Jones science fiction film from 2009) for people who need their sci-fi with more firefights and explosions. For anyone who hasn't seen MOON and doesn't know what I'm talking about, stop wasting time here and go watch it. It's awesome. OBLIVION is science fiction with a classic vibe and a more mainstream mentality. The premise is a combination of a handful of popular sci-fi tropes mashed together with Tom Cruise in the lead, Morgan Freeman as a mysterious figure, and a couple beautiful women for Cruise to cavort with while saving the world. It's a film loaded with beautiful imagery but a tendency to try to force a sense of grandiose complexity that it never really achieves. The movie is set in a distant future where the world has been ravaged from war against an alien species that ended with the destruction of the moon. Most of humanity has evacuated the planet for the moon of Titan in orbit of Saturn. Tom Cruise is Jack, an engineer left behind to repair aerial drones that protect salt-water harvesters from a scattering of remaining aliens intent on sabotaging the operation. Jack operates from a home perched on a Sky Tower miles above the ground with his partner/wife Vika (Andrea Riseborough) while they await the end of their contract and their chance to join the rest of the human race on Titan. As the time approaches, complications arise when an escape pod crash-lands on Earth carrying a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and a powerful secret to reveal about Jack's existence.Probably the first thing anyone will notice about OBLIVION is that it looks amazing. No matter what negative opinions people might offer about the movie, no one can complain that it looks shoddy. Everything here looks fantastic. The landscape is far-reaching and barren with occasional artifacts rising up from the desert to signify the society that once thrived there, whether it be a grounded ocean freighter or a surviving piece of New York's iconic skyline. The home sitting at the top of the Sky Tower is a pseudo-futuristic style where everything is spotless and streamlined. There are windows on every side of the home to provide an awesome 360-degree view. I love the design of the drones and I especially love the fact that they were shot practically when the filmmakers were able to give them a sense of realism. There is a fantastic shot about halfway through the movie or so with a drone slowly hovering through a shattered window, pushing through flaming curtains for a sinister reveal. Fantastic stuff. And then there's the bubble ship. The bubble ship is an atmospheric flyer and primary form of transport for Jack, with a gyroscopic bubble cockpit allowing for some pretty wicked flight shots. Visually, this movie is a perfect 10 but there's still the little matter of the plot and such. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but it just doesn't live up to the quality of the film's style.Anyone who's seen their share of science fiction will see right through this film from the start. There's a major reveal a little more than halfway through the film that I won't reveal here for anyone who hasn't watched it yet, but I'm going to admit that I saw most of it coming within the first ten minutes of the film. Jack and Vika report each day to their mission control, based out of an orbital station known as the Tet. The Tet issues their daily assignments and provides support for their mission (the water harvesters). From the first video conversation between Vika and Sally (Melissa Leo, their contact aboard the Tet), I had this movie pegged and knew what to expect. This isn't to say the plot is weak or the twist is stupid. Actually, I think it's pretty entertaining. I've just seen enough movies of this nature to know where they were going with it. There were a few surprises in there that I wasn't able to see coming. The movie is well done. It's just very familiar. The cast is mostly superb. I'm probably one of Tom Cruise's few real film fans left, it seems. I'll agree that he has a tendency to do a lot of the same in each of his movies and he doesn't always disappear into his character, but he does well and he's a fine action star for his age. I thought he was great in OBLIVION. Andrea Riseborough and Morgan Freeman do a great job as well (though you don't really expect any less from Freemanthe dude's awesome). Olga Kurylenko is fine, though she doesn't seem to have a whole lot to work with here. I'm not entirely sure what I feel about Kurylenko as an actress. She's definitely gorgeous but she's never really turned in a performance that stood out to me. Here, she's fine.For people that need more 'splosions with their sci-fi, OBLIVION delivers. It's a more mainstream science fiction film that incorporates plenty of action to keep audiences riveted between drawn-out, plot-driven scenes. If OBLIVION has one major flaw, it'd be that it drones on a little longer than necessary. It feels as if director Joseph Kosinski is trying to emphasize an epic scale that the movie hasn't earned when he would've been a better off tightening it down a bit. So, OBLIVION in a nutshell: predictable and drawn out, but visually amazing with an effective cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This Year's 'The Black Hole',"For some unknown reason I keep going to Tom Cruise films. I think because of the false hope that he might eventually turn out something good. But really he is becoming the Steve Martin of action films. We all remember that they used to turn out good films, but slowly it dawns that it's ten years since 'Minority Report', twenty since 'A Few Good Men'.This film is confusingly bad. The nearest description I can think of this this years ""The Black Hole"". I would have walked out but I was stuck in the middle of a full row. I did see others leave but they had sat beside the aisle. Smart.The only good thing you can say is that Tom looks great for a 50 year old. It pays to look after yourself. And I'd like to visit Iceland, interesting landscape.Just remember to sit near the aisle if you watch a Tom Cruise film from now on.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cruise is back to save the Earth or at least what's left of it,"The Tom Cruise that we know chases Russians, performs some aerobic insanity out of the tallest building on earth and saves the globe in the last seconds. Well, he doesn't have to worry about saving the earth in this movie because it is already dealt with.The movie starts with a brief story of our moon's end, resulting catastrophe, shifting the entire planet to Titan (Saturn's largest moon) and the ongoing fight with the so-called Scavengers, all narrated by Cruise himself.Clearly Cruise himself agrees that his memory has been wiped after the war to protect the classified information from falling into the wrong hands. Everything goes like clockwork until a shuttle crashes and what happens next makes Cruise doubt everything.If I add word more than that, you will curse me for this review. So I will keep the surprises unspoiled. This movie is a unique blend of various emotional coefficients like Love, Self realization, Sacrifice & Poetry (Yes, in a Tom Cruise movie).The visual effects have been the heart and soul of this movie. You will find the ruins of Empire State, Golden Gate Bridge and if you have your eyes peeled, you may even notice the torch of the Statue of Liberty (in the canyons in the chasing sequence). Since this is a post apocalyptic script, grey dominates more than any other color, but you won't get the irritation out of it because it is well balanced by the High Tech gadgets, drones and a house which everyone wants to put their name on.The cast have done a pretty decent job and as a result the movie looks even more presentable. With some neat twists at the end, this flick is definitely worth the time and money spent.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I really do think motorbikes like the one Jack has will happen, and as for his aircraft and 'loft apartment', well just wow! The film grabs your attention immediately, with the fantastic score by M83 perfectly fitting the bill. However, underneath all the tech and action sequences is a very good story with a nice twist. Let's just say all is not as it seems. The cast are perfect and the acting is good, making the characters believable.

Visually stunning Science fiction,"The new film from the director Joseph Kosinski who directed 2010's Tron Legacy, has two things going for it, his brilliant visual style and a brilliant score this time provided by M83 rather than Daft Punk who scored Tron Legacy. The film is rapturously beautiful, it was filmed with 4K cameras which is definitely the way in which to see it as it was stunning. The film stars Tom Cruise who can make anything watchable (as he did with Knight and Day, barely) and he brings a familiar face for somewhere completely foreign territory, as the world has been devastated by a war for earth. He is joined by Morgan Freeman who does not feature as much as the poster would have you believe, also Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko. The best thing about the film is the action which works very well and we have a Texan Melissa Leo at mission control who is a figure of mystery and plays to some of the more interesting parts of the film such as who creation and the feeling of home, which Cruise does. The film has the tag-line ""Earth is a memory worth fighting for"" and this film is definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen with the best projector possible.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Needs more love and appreciation!,"This one is probably one of the most misconstrued, misunderstood sci-fi thrillers of the last decade!Perhaps the audience back then had a very different set of expectations that weren't fulfilled, or the script had failed to convince them of the story and what it wanted to showcase. Whatever the reasons, they subsequently resulted in a scarcity of love and admiration for this dystopian feature.I, too, was a part of this bandwagon who were critical of the movie at the time of its release, and now that I have experienced it again almost ten years later, my perception as it seems, has drastically changed! Not only did I find plenty of things to show appreciation for, but I also happened to enjoy this commentary-heavy ride with futuristic insinuations.The screenplay, for the most part, is gripping and grabs your attention from the very first sequence and never lets go of it (barring the final act, where it loosens up and misses out on the intensity factor).The visuals looked terrific as it successfully built a post-apocalyptic rendition of our planet in incredible detail, and the neat sound design complemented the pictorial splendidness. So did the performances, I reckon, especially from Andrea Riseborough, who has indisputably stolen the show! I wanted to see more of her, to be honest. She has always been excellent in her roles, and this was no exception.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A lot of plot holes..(Spoiler Alert),"First off, it was a good movie with great effects, casting, and acting. The story line was also great, but there are so many plot holes that make this movie that could have been an 8 or 9 down to a 5. 1.) Jack 49 somehow knows the outcome of the 2017 Superbowl, when in the flashback, the original Jack says he doesn't want Sally to ruin the outcome for him. 2.) When Jack and Julia meet, Julia wants to get the flight recording back from the remains of the ship. We later find out that the remains of the ship are from the ""escape pod"" part of the ship, while Jack and Victoria were flying in the cockpit. Why would the flight recording be in the pod and not the cockpit? 3.) Julia describes her mission. The thing is, how could Julia know the mission was reassigned, if she was in Delta sleep so she could get to Titan? 4.) At the end of the movie, Jack 52 finds Julia at the cabin after 3 years. With some of the memories the original Jack had and memories of Jack 49. Does this mean thousands of the Jacks will show up at the cabin? 5.) How in the heck did Julia give birth alone? Surely she didn't have to rip the umbilical cord with her bare hands. 6.) What happened to all the other clones on Earth? They would have been paranoid thinking that all the life that was going to be transported to Titan from the TET. was destroyed and they were the only humans left, stranded on the planet. 7.) One question I'm sure everyone is asking. Where did the TET. come from? Was it an alien-made space-ship and grew a terrible conscience or what? Is it a species and are there more of them out there?",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Failed on so many levels!,"When I went to watch this movie I didn't expect the story to blow my mind but I expected the effects to be amazing (cue: Tron Legacy) However, Not only was the story horrible but the effects were garbage!!

The story was really complicated and most of the people who saw it were not sure they understood it, however don't think its because the story was too intellectual (it wasn't) its because it lacked depth and things happened to fast at the end!Character development was so poor, I don't even know why they bothered hiring Morgan Freeman, he had a very small role and there was no background or depth on his character.The only saving grace was Tom Cruise (and I'm not even a Tom Cruise fan)Final words, Go to this movie with absolute zero expectations and you will have a great time!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It appears that the script was written by a committee who did nothing but sit around a table referencing scenes from other, much better movies.

Let's list the movies that Oblivion ripped off: 2001 a Space Odyssey, Planet of the Apes, Independence Day, Star Wars, War of the Worlds, I Robot, Terminator 3, The Matrix, and Caddyshack.

Great Looking But Dull Story and Characters,"Oblivion (2013)** (out of 4)Decades after the Earth had to battle an invasion, the people there were forced to leave because the planet just wasn't able to be lived on. A veteran officer (Tom Cruise) and his partner (Andrea Riseborough) stay behind to keep an eye out for the remaining resources but soon he starts to question everything he's been told. OBLIVION is a terrific film to sit back and look at but sadly the story itself is just so boring and the direction so lacking that one will be fighting a major battle just to try and stay awake. To say I left the theater disappointed would be an understatement because it's rare that you get a bad film that stars Cruise. Say what you want about the man but he's given people one good film after another but sadly this here doesn't make the cut. Again, if you want all visuals then you're going to be in for a real treat as the post-apocalyptic Earth is terrific to look at and especially when we see familiar landmarks that are now destroyed. I was really impressed with how terrific the CGI is because I'm usually quite harsh on computer effects because they're always just so obvious and stand out. That's not the case with the effects here because the CGI really blends in well with the rest of the picture and everything looks real and makes you feel as if you're watching a real time and space. The performances are also good even though none of the characters are all that interesting. Cruise is good as usual as is Riseborough who nearly steals the picture. You've also got Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo in small roles and Olga Kurylenko also shines. What really killed this film for me was the direction by Joseph Kosinski. I think he did a good job with the visual look of the film but there just wasn't any drama in the story and even the action scenes were lacking. The story itself is the biggest villain because it's just not that involving. Not to mention there are a few twists that are easy to see coming early on in the picture. OBLIVION is a disappointing film that needed a major re-write in terms of the story.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Phone It In Freeman,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Oblivion (2013)Plot In A Paragraph: In the year 2077, Jack (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairmen, and is one of the last remaining humans assigned to Earth, its surface devastated after decades of war with the alien Scavs, discovers a crashed spacecraft with contents that bring into question everything he believed about the war.In the late eighties (starting with 'Street Smart' opposite Christopher Reeve) and particularly the early to mid nineties. Morgan Freeman could do no wrong in my book. A wonderful actor who brought a touch of class to every movie he made.Then something happened, every movie maker and studio caught on to the fact, and he suddenly became the 'go to' guy. Then suddenly he was everywhere releasing several movies a year, all of varying quality. Often he was in supporting roles. Some were still enjoyable (Million Dollar Baby, Bruce Almighty and Now You See Me) some were not (take your pick) and you often think ""I hope he was well paid"" as he clearly took this for the money.Oblivion is one of the latter, he turns up for his big pay check in return for small screen time, in which he pretty much sleepwalks through the movie. Cruise can rarely be accused of phoning it in, but despite the concept, this movie seemed very same old, same old from him. It was over long and I'm not 100% sure I fully understood what happened!!That said, Olga Kurylenko definitely brightens things up when she is on screen! However sadly Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jamie Lannister in Game Of Thrones) is not given as much to do as one would hope.I didn't hate this movie, it was watchable.

Better then Prometheus,"So just came back from the sinny (cinema) and i have to say its was a pretty nice and enjoyably ride. I liked the general idea ""all that humanity vs aliens"". While not spoiling anything i can say it was believable (as much as it could, considering its a sci-fi and i see sci-fi like some sort of a tale). It didn't insult my intelligence like many other sci-fi movies, it seemed that the film makers really cared about the audience and gave smth fresh, smth new in its own way (note its not super original it has ideas taken from other movies, and its not bad its how we improve). Anyways my point is, it took ideas, most of them from other films but it putted in a way nobody has done... So what it does it give a few nice twists, it makes a movie a little bit unpredictable, more interesting. You start to care more for the plot, charters etc... Secondary the sounds, music, sfx and overall atmosphere was good. Thirdly i liked the chemistry between Tom Cruise (Jack Harper) and Andrea Riseborough (Victoria)... It was short but newer less sexy and interesting... It would have been interesting to see a threesome (love triangle) explored a little bit more... I totally knew the action will be bad by just seeing the trailer, and i was totally right. The main problem was the droids. Jack Harper had to fight them during the movie and lets face it fighting a flying ball isn't a very exciting thing to watch. Design was good and really looked like smth that could work in real life, but from well penetrated sounds had nothing more threatening to offer.... Last the ending just felt unfinished, kinda rushed (like me review) and not very realistic, i didn't felt any culmination during that scene and believe i was not the only one....So!!! If you had patient to read this mess and lair full of grammar mistakes (my first review) i highly salute you! Give this movie a strong 6 (TRON would get a decent 5) And encourage you to go and see this movie, its worth it, Kosinski is worth it.

"Great Visuals, Weak Story","I originally saw this in the theaters and for some reason I thought about it the other day, only to find it in a thrift store for $2 a couple hours later. What are the odds of that? I rarely watch newer movies but I was encouraged to check it out at the time and I thought it was decent, but nothing epic. The second time around I was a lot more critical, however.First off, the good. The film kicks ass visually. I love post-nuke films and the fight scenes flying through the ruins, while derivative of Star Wars, are great and all the sets and special effects are simply top notch--there's no two ways about it and maybe that's why I didn't pick up on how illogical this film is the first time I saw it. For one thing, why did the invaders or ""bad guys"" or whatever need to go through the rigmarole of having ""Jacks"" and ""Victorias"" in the first place? Wouldn't it have been more efficient to have some sort of androids doing that work? Clearly the drones were effective and they obviously had the AI technology. This alone shoots a big hole in the premise of the whole movie. And why did they make the events leading up to the ""present"" start going down in 2017, immediately making the story implausible, as we didn't have anything close to that sort of spacecraft technology in 2013? And why would the flight recorder retrieved from the detached module containing Julia have data from the cockpit when the two sections detached before the ""bad guy"" reveal takes place, never mind that the camera angles from a stationary camera would not look like what we see in the film? Why do the drones have a soft spot in the back where you can just rip out the power supply or plow a bullet to disable it? They couldn't locate that part in some other section of the device's interior? There is other nit-picky stuff, but those four flaws kind of render this otherwise decent film kind of silly to me. Not a bad film at all, otherwise, and worth a look to be sure. If memory serves, it didn't fair to well at the box office, a fate it didn't deserve, but it has too much wrong with the story to make it excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unexpectedly and expectedly good,"Ever since the trailer came out, I have wanted to see this movie. And that for different reasons: 1. M83 was making the music to this. 2. Morgan Freeman was in it (duh) 3. It look nothing but spectacular and astonishing with great visual effects etc. All of this, only by looking at the trailer.I have not been able to see the movie before now, since I didn't reach it in the cinemas. So today I bought the DVD and have now finally seen it.Well, to say with a short sentence what I thought of the movie, here is what I say: ""I did like it a lot.""Earth has lost a battle. Well, they won the war, but only by using nuclear weapons against the aliens. In that way, humanity had to leave the so-called home. Jack and Victoria are employed to fix drones that are scanning and looking over the surface of Earth. But Jack has in a long time, wanted to stay on Earth, in which Victoria is against. One day, something unknown and old-school crash-lands in their surveillance-area that changes everything.In the beginning of this movie, it all feels like a science-fiction real-life remake of Wall-E. A Wall-E with arms, legs and an epic air-transporter. And clichés. Then things suddenly changed. In a really positive and exciting way. And the movie's pace raised noticeably.I do NOT want to spoil it to you, because, strictly speaking, after the first hour of the movie has past, it feels like it is an entirely another movie. Therefore, I do not want to talk more of the plot.Have you seen TRON: Legacy? Joseph Kosinski, who directed TRON did also write/direct Oblivion. If you remember the spectacular, mind-blowing landscapes and views from that movie, and you loved it, you will definitely love Oblivion. The way Joseph presents Earth from a past-nuclear war- view is so interestingly well made that I could watch an entire 2-hour long movie of only the landscapes of Earth in 2077. And with the incredible music of M83 underneath the spectacular visual ""orgasm"" makes the entire experience into a ""erection of both ear- and orgasm"". (Sorry, but I could not come up with any better words to describe it with.)Unfortunately, the movie had way too many clichés. From beginning to the end, the emotional scenes were way to predictable. One could easily know that they would kiss by the lake etc. That is what lowered my rating by one star.The other 2 star down was because of all the unanswered questions I got from this movie. There were so many things that I did not quite understand, that I think the crew could have worked a little bit more on for us viewers to understand.But overall, this was a REALLY good movie. It is absolutely worth the money and is really easy to enjoy by both sci-fi fans and not sci-fi fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-fi done right. Who needs explosions when all you need is atmosphere? No spoilers,"If this film was made a decade ago this would be a classic. This is a caliber ""Sunshine"" by Danny Boyle with Cillian Murphy film. In fact Oblivion shares much with Sunshine. Their 3rd act is kinda lackluster whereas both films feature fantastic memorable scenes. The strength of this film is not it's story ; the story is there i assure you. The strength of this film lies in it's atmosphere, it's fantastic memorable orgasmic soundtrack with the fantastic visual landscapes. Tom Cruise is a great actor and has contributed much to the sci-fi genre. First Minority report and now Oblivion. Tom Cruise , you sir i may dislike you but oh boy at the same time i admire your acting. The film has nothing to do with the trailer and feels fresh compared to all the 80s remakes. After all Scifi films are beginning to rise once again to Hollywood after a long time. This is not a film where action is the orientation, forget michael bay boring uninspiring stuff. Yet there is still action.If you liked Suhshine (2007) by Danny Boyle and you were amazed by Blade runner and you think Sci-fi does not need explosions but atmospheric scenes then you are going to fall in love with this film. I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not a perfect movie, but definitely a sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece!","One of the main problems of the digital special effects or CGI was, and still is, the lack of credibility in some situations. For example, in the Star Wars saga, the use of animatronics achieved much better results than CGI. Better not to speak about the wild humans of Will Smith's ""I'm Alive"", for me a fact that changed that film from being great to just entertaining.In this film the use of mentioned CGI is simply flawless. The design of the scenarios, landscape, robots is brilliant, the same as the movements and the sensation of ""solidity"" (I'm sorry, my English level isn't as brilliant as oblivion's special effects).I think that thanks to creators like Cameron, Scott and, of course, Kosinski, that technology has reached enough maturity for being considered, at last, as believable as the animatronics are plus the lot of advantages that it carries itself.Following with the plot and how the story is told, Oblivion isn't a hard sci-fi movie. It can be more considered as a light sci-fi/fantastic movie, nearer of ""Stargate"" or ""Startrek"" than ""2001"" or ""the road"". But don't get confused. Even if Oblivion bets for the classical action-adventures structure (specially in the film's second part), the first part introduces a story and a setting which invite to think and letting fly the imagination to both average viewers and hard sci-fi lovers.About the cast and their acting, even if this isn't Oblivion's strongest point, the overall result is satisfying. Jack Harper, the main character perhaps lacks of some complexity but Tom Cruise makes a great acting.In the first act and in the climax of the movie he's enormous. Andrea Riseborough makes a enigmatic and interesting acting. On the other hand, both Kurilenko and Freeman are extremely misused. For me, the worst point of the film.In conclusion, Oblivion shines and fails in the points that this kind of film has to. And that is the reason for which this movie can't be considered perfect. But, believe me, the shining points are extremely brilliant and the mistaken points are much more forgivable than in the most of this kind of movies. A must see film, fully enjoyable and entertaining (126 minutes never passed so fast) with many details of quality. A reference in technical concepts and a new classic masterpiece of the genre.P.d.

A movie that will blow the unspoiled mind.,"I admit I may be prejudiced because I am a sci-fi enthusiast yet the reason I find this movie far above average is that it succeeded in making me not want to guess the storyline before it unfolds but rather made me want to just drift along on this wave of intelligent sci-fi. The story is so well accompanied by visual prowess it will envelope the unspoiled mind. If one could see this movie without having seen any movie ever before it would stay in your mind forever. Imagine having only read books and used your imagination to play out the stories in your mind and then see this film: it would certainly blow your unspoiled mind. The acting is also far above average. The emotions are not discussed and debated and chewed up and spit out and digested again as in Woody Allen flicks, yet are held inside most of the time and are revealed visually on the characters faces. This movie goes into my top 10. For sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Love in the Time of Massive Radiation,"This is sweeping, serious sci-fi, concerning the last people on a future Earth, long since scoured by nuclear conflict. The enemy was/is a race called the Scavs. Tom Cruise plays Jack, who, along with his colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), stalks the wasteland, fixing drones and maintaining the rigs that promise to one day make the planet habitable once more. Above them is the Tet, a vast spacestation that promises to take the couple to Titan, where the rest of humanity awaits.Oblivion borrows from pretty much every sci-fi movie ever made, utopian and dystopian. Planet of the Apes. The Mad Max sequels. Late on, I glimpsed Independence Day, Sunshine and Battlestar Galactica in the space of ten minutes. Even Robocop is in there, with the drones barking like ED-209. A particular cynical viewer might suggest the film starts as Wall-E and turns into Moon. But it does have some of its own ideas, mostly with regard to the technology in which Jack and Victoria are immersed.Apart from the tech design, there is plenty to admire about Oblivion. Its plot might be derivative, and ultimately wraps itself in rather a neat bow, but it's well laid out, revealing the right bits at the right times. The music, by Joseph Trapanese, along with Anthony Gonzalez from the band M83, is suitably epic and stirring, cut from the same sonic cloth as Trapanese's work on Tron Legacy. The two key performances are those of Cruise (always game, always watchable) and more notably Riseborough, who's allowed to be alluring for once. Olga Kurylenko, as Julia, is somewhat blank as the third part of the love triangle.Tron Legacy was a poor movie because it had a poor script occupied by poor characters, and this is where Oblivion elevates itself above Joseph Kosinski's previous work. Here we have recognisable humans in the midst of drama. In particular, the fraught relationship between Jack and Victoria makes for some subtle, unspoken exchanges. The dinner between Jack, Victoria and Julia, is an expertly edited exercise in tension. And the scene where Victoria lures Jack into a transparent swimming pool is both seductive and sinister, like watching Michael Mann let loose on sci-fi.Oblivion was filmed using super-HD ""CineAlta"" cameras, all the better to do justice to the luscious visuals. We've seen it all before but never this beautifully rendered. And behind the sheen is a human heartbeat, which shouldn't be ignored. Oblivion is a fine love letter to classic sci-fi.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Predictable, but very entertaining","You will benefit a lot if you do not watch the trailer I noticed. The trailer shows too much and it makes the obvious twist in this movie even more so obvious. First lets go through the cast. Tom Cruise did an excellent job as Jack and Olga Kurylenko also delivered as Julia. Their chemistry worked in the movie and I believed in their part of the story. But other actors chiefly Morgan freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Kingslayer in Game Of thrones) were criminally underused and had just a few bits of dialogue. It would have been better to cast lesser known actors to fill their role. The story itself is very interesting yet as most people will notice, highly predictable. Still there is enjoyment in this film since it is very beautiful to look at. The cinematography is excellent and the special effects are top notch. I was never bored during the movie and there are some plot twists that surprised by the time I was done watching. It might not be the summer blockbuster you were waiting for but you will not go out of the movie theatre disappointed!My rating: 7.5",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watch Moon instead!,"Oblivion is a big budget turkey that I did not feel for, root for, relate to or enjoy from start to finish. Why, you may ask. And the answer is simple: because I have already watched this type of movie before, just far, far, far better than this poop Tom Cruise crapped out.Now, I am not a Cruise hater, I always look forward to his movies, but he delivers another major disappointment after Jack Reacher.The another movie I am talking about is Moon with Sam Rockwell. And that's because the two movies deal with the same subject. I think the main difference why Moon worked for me and not Oblivion is because the makers of Oblivion had such a big budget to spend that they just had to throw in everything to spend the money. A bit of heartless action, half baked suspense, a type of ""I am alone on Earth"" type of movie, except he is not (not a spoiler by the way), a bit of important plot references related to famous book quotes just to make the movie look like it has some kind of deeper meaning. The result, in my opinion, is that the film ends up being meaningless and direction-less. It does not know what it wants to be and that's why it felt like a torture to sit there and watch this. It promises something in one scene and then it builds your expectations, crushes them, and in next scene it decides to take another direction.But fortunately, Moon did not have a big budget to toy around with, so the makers had to keep it simple and boy, was it effective!I believe that the people who are praising Oblivion have not seen Moon. So I recommend to skip this one at the movies and rent Moon instead. You won't regret it!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent escapism,"Thankfully I saw this sci fi film without knowing much about it apart from the fact that one of the BBC's critics had dismissed it when it came out, because there's some lively plot twists right to the very end you'd be best to be er oblivious about. I'm not a Tom Cruise expert but it's the best film I've seen him in, and even though it clocks in at two hours and some think it too long I wouldn't have minded another hour.The Earth in the future is war ravaged, patrolled by robot drones and their repairmen under the control of the ultimate spy in the sky, the gargantuan spaceship Tet. Cruise plays one such repairman Jack who finds his wiped memory returning for him to question his role. And much more. The whole plot edifice is cleverly constructed and maintained, with slick and clean cgi cartoonery and graphics, supported by good performances. Although I do get fed up with pumping up the volume to compensate for pseudo-heavy guttural whisperings replacing ordinary talking - you'd think they'd all have sore throats after a days shooting. And why oh why hasn't teleportation been invented yet - it's almost as if people in the future prefer to fly enormous physical objects with innumerable moving parts, or is that just to make the game version more interesting! I see that the future still features brief(less) appearances by naked females, somethings will never change apparently. It's maybe heartwarming for oldies to surmise that the LP will survive the CD and that Led Zep will still be relevant post apocalypse but it's the plot that's more interesting after all and all I can do is recommend concentration otherwise parts of this brave new world may pass you by. I had to keep stopping and playing back to double check little things, for instance the whole section when Jack ""repaired"" Julia.There's nothing completely new here at all, just the entertaining updated cinematic way it's all been brought together from Planet Of The Apes, Silent Running, Dune, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Star Wars, Star Trek, Independence Day et al. And the end credit graphics even reminded me of the episode endings to Thunderbirds, none of these are bad things. It's the best sci fi film I've seen in years, if some of the critics don't like it just ignore them and see what you think instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

looks great but too many logic questions,"It's 2077. The Earth has been devastated after winning a war against aliens. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairman living with Vika Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) on an isolated floating outpost. It's been five years since their mandatory memory wipe.

Jack has to fight the reminent alien scavs. Despite the wipe, he has dreams of memories and collects relics from the past. He finds a crashed ship and revives Julia Rusakova (Olga Kurylenko) from status. They are captured by humans led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman).There is no denying that this movie looks great. I even like the wimpy sounds the machines make. Right from the start, things don't seem right. If this movie had any hope, the story must pass the smell test at the start. As Jack lays out the exposition, a dozen different questions come to my mind. The world doesn't make sense and it's annoying. Once the start doesn't make sense, then it's questionable why Jack can't see it. Even with a good reveal, not all the questions are answered. And the damage is done already anyways.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An under-appreciated sci-fi gem,"Do not be fooled by the premise of Tom Cruise in a futuristic post-apocalypse world: Oblivion is a sci-fi film of genuine quality and visual prowess, succeeding where a dearth of productions have tried (and failed) before. Oblivion does not require constant fight scenes and dramatic set pieces to hold the attention of the viewer, but instead delicately constructs an interesting story around the obscure history of conflict that has destroyed Earth. Jack (Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are two of the few survivors, veterans tasked with extracting the last of Earth's resources to power the remnants of humanity; however, they must also tackle the alien presence still lingering on the ground, who are intent on disrupting their efforts. When an unidentified ship crashes back on Earth without warning, the two are sent into a spiral of confusion around who can be trusted - and whether their memories have stood the test of time.Oblivion's mastery comes through their development of each character's loneliness: Jack and Victoria's only other human contact is a satellite link to their mothership off-world, amplifying the lack of empathy their job entails. The explorer of the two, Jack, has a hidden retreat in one of the safe zones on Earth (unbeknownst to Victoria); this example of the lack of complete transparency shows the seeds of doubt in both of the humans - fated to be able to trust nobody else, but still sceptical of every decision. Jack is also haunted by memories from before Earth's demise, constantly lingering but hidden from his partner. Director Joseph Kosinski's vision of a depleted Earth is hauntingly beautiful, a stark expanse awash with greys and blues, devoid of life. In direct contrast, the crew's machinery is precise and clean, bright white droids tasked with eliminating anything not perceived as human.Without giving too much away, the storyline's ability to open up and challenge the audience makes Oblivion a more rewarding film than it's given credit for; Cruise acts well throughout, exhibiting more empathy than he's known for showing. The score from French electronic outfit M83 is the ideal accompaniment for the mysterious nature of the wasteland, and does a fantastic job of building each scene without using music typical of the sci-fi genre. Oblivion will surprise those who wouldn't normally consider this their style of film, but is more than just a run-of-the-mill futuristic thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Upon reflection, this movie makes no sense.","I'm going to keep this quick. This movie makes no sense, I'm only embarrassed that it actually took a couple of days to realize it.WARNING SPOILERS.... STOP READING IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY THE FILMWhy did the super-advanced artificial intelligent entity not create a robot army to kill all humans (which still to me sounds like it takes up less water than organic clones. Which you'd think it would be conserving water since that's what it's collecting). If it HAD to be clones, why did they need their original personalities (or any at all) to repair the drones? Why would there be only two. Am I meant to believe that during the entire war with the human race it never go the chance to grab a few other genetic samples for cloning purposes. There are many other problems, but as promised I am trying to keep this short.My only conclusion it that the artificial intelligence was insane and was in fact thinking of the most circuitous way for it to steal Earth's water.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Somewhat clunky story, but Cruise is dependably solid, and the special effects are great.","""Oblivion"" launches headfirst into its seemingly complex story, and to be completely honest, I found myself struggling to keep up with the plot at first. I won't rehash it here, because other reviews will do a better job, but essentially this is an old-fashioned, '70s-styled sci-fi flick with Tom Cruise playing a drone repairmen on Earth, which has become a post-apocalyptic wasteland by 2077.The reason I say the story is seemingly complex, is that I think the director, Joseph Koskinski, who also wrote the unpublished graphic novel the film is based upon, tries to over-compensate somewhat for the fact that the story is rather derivative of other titles. While his future world can be distinct at times, it's also reminiscent of other popular science fiction fare, whether it's the obvious like ""Star Wars"" and ""2001"" to the less-renowned, like the underrated ""Moon"" starring Sam Rockwell (one of my favourite science fiction films of the last decade, I think).Cruise gets better with age, and even though his films are rarely masterpieces or acting showcases, he has a knack for choosing reliably entertaining spectacles. He carries this movie as well as you might expect him to, and though the posters showcase Morgan Freeman for added box office potential, it's really Cruise's movie, and he nails it.Kosinski, after his debut ""Tron: Legacy,"" is still struggling with the narrative side of filmmaking, but his visuals are superb. I hesitate to refer to Oblivion as a ""low budget"" movie, but it is relatively so: in a year where $130 million buys you crappy-looking flicks like ""R.I.P.D.,"" it's pretty impressive that Kosinski has made the best-looking special effects experience of the year with a budget almost half of ""Iron Man 3"" or ""Man of Steel"" (both of which were less impressive effects-wise, and less distinct in their tone).The movie isn't great, it can be a bit confusing at times due to its messy storytelling, but it's worth it for Cruise and the special effects alone. And while it may not do as good a job as ""Moon"" at raising its existentialist questions, it's still a tad more thought-provoking than most big budget blockbusters.The score by M83 is also pretty great, and one of the highlights of the picture.I recommend Oblivion based on the merits of its star and visuals, as an overall Motion Picture Experience, but hope Kosinski places a bit more emphasis on the storytelling in his future films.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Any Film + Tom Cruise = Top of the box office,"'Oblivion' is the latest Tom Cruise movie that is currently doing extremely well in both the US and UK box offices. Tom Cruise is – for some reason – one of those actors who will attract the masses to a film no one would otherwise care about.This film however is a film people will genuinely be interested in seeing regardless of Tom Cruise. Joseph Kosinski has written a fairly solid story here; it has been a while since there has been a decent sci- fi film out that hasn't been linked to a film or book series. However, the film does seem like Moon, Total Recall, The Matrix and 2001: A Space Odyssey rolled into one. There are points in the film where nothing really happens, this does not mean they should have replaced them with action sequences, because there were a decent amount of them and they were very well done. There were way too many flashback scenes that were very boring, they showed the same flashback almost a dozen times but with no extended parts that taught us anything, it was literally the same scenes over and over again. There were a lot of instances where I was bored but it was not all the fault of the writer.Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko are the blandest pair of actors ever it would seem. Andrea Riseborough's performance is fine; her character was supposed to be quite cold and tries her best here. Cruise and Kurylenko have no chemistry whatsoever and you simply do not care what happened to them. This is where the major flaw of 'Oblivion' was noticed; the story was pretty good, the effects and props were amazing – though it would seem aliens have discovered Apple – and the sets were just fantastic and really interesting to look at but the actors were just too dull! Morgan Freeman gave the best performance, his most interesting one in a while, but unfortunately had next to no screen time.Overall, 'Oblivion' is not a bad film. It was clearly made by someone who has a love and respect for sci-fi but it could have been so much better had two other actors been given the lead roles.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

High 8/10,"One of the most grounded sci-fi of all time. This movie feels natural and entirely plausible thanks to its set design and tone of the film. Most sci-fi films go above and beyond to form unbelievable set scenes and entrance us into worlds beyond. But Oblivion takes a more minimalist and clean approach. It makes the landscapes feel believable, and the science stuff seems not so far from our current technology.The story has a fantastic theme of the human psyche from the main character Jack, where we see his passion of curiosity contrary to his workmate Victoria who just wants to get the job done. I don't want to spoil much of this film, but the film may have this resounding theme. The story is by the books and mostly predictable. But it doesn't degrade the movie, thanks to the film's strong ability to fully immerse you with the world.Overall, one of the best minimalist sci-fi movies of the 2010s. It's VFX never miss. The star-power isn't really a highlight of this film, none of their performances is really oscar worthy, but they did a good job. This movie is worth watching from start to finish. There is never an unnecessary moment, a moment of action, terror, or bliss. This film is a by-the-books great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great settings and imagination...but the movie?,"Yesterday, I went to go see Oblivion. I thought I was going to see more, and in some ways I did, but, in some I did not. The settings in this movie were phenomenal, and it had better acting then I expected. It really hit heart in the ending. But, I honestly thought this movie was to slow, WAY to long, a little boring, and 100% confusing. Toward the end I started to take guesses at when it was going to end. Their was always a perfect spot to end the movie, but instead, they add on 15 more ongoing minutes that waisted my time. The ending definitely could've been better, although it was very deep. It was just how the plot worked and how everything was just all over the place you just lost focus and were not able to pay attention. As much as I want to say I loved it, or even liked it, all I can say is it's okay.Oblivion is a fresh new idea that you may like for sci-fi fans (although I am one) and do encourage you to see this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I love the music which did a lot for this film as well. To me it's my go to when I struggle to find something decent to watch. If you only viewed this movie once I suggest give it another look but clear your mind and don't compare to anything else. The story is excellent and the special effects is spot on. I love the scene where Tom's character goes to a private place and plays a record and puts on a baseball cap. The cinematography is memorable and it gives me a sense of just getting away and enjoying some true R&R. That is one of my favorite scenes.

Otherworldly high budget sci-fi with an intriguing concept and A list actors.So what failed? The story mainly. It just gets more boring and starts feeling like a waste of time. You get sucked in only to realize that no, that huge concept you think is going to blow your mind and create a memorable sci-fi movie experience you can keep coming back to is never going to happen. Sure, there's Tom Cruise and his neverending A+ acting skills, and god....those visuals.

Good CGI and Cinematography but bad acting and direction ruins a good story.,"The movie was a sci-Fi, action genre, about a post alien invasion world, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is the protagonist, initially he is well settled into his role as a drone technician, who is waiting for an extraction to an alien planet as earth is being abandoned after the alien invasion. He is assisted by his partner Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) who guides him by serving as flight report desk, as she talks with Sally (Mellisa Leo) who is overseeing the extraction mission. They are neutralizing aliens who are part of the invasion force with the help of automated weaponized drones. On a mission of scouting the area Jack sees a forced reentry of a space module, which he investigates and suddenly finds someone he has already seen in his dreams. He then goes about trying to find out who she is and uncovers all the mystery that surrounds his dreams.The movie is well paced and the action sequences are well-distributed, they have tried adding a lot of character strength to Jack Harper along the way. There were some surprising ""cameos"" by Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Costner-Waldau but felt other characters were not given clarity or screen time. The cinematography was well done with beautiful panoramic & CGI shoots of post-invasion alien world, showing grim surreal landscapes. I wish the sound effect was more complementary to the heroism and action theme but it was dull and generic. Wardrobe design was ""interesting'"" especially the wardrobe of the resistance, but I guess they were trying to stick to the comic book art ideas. The drone chases were well choreographed, there were obvious similarities to other Sci-Fi action movies but it does have sprinkled original ideas. All the action sequences of Tom Cruise has ""generic tom cruise"" action moment, cliffhanging almost falling into the ground below, escaping from a blast and is blown through the air , those ideas are getting stale for Mr. Cruise!The weakest parts of the movie was the two female leads, especially Olgo Kurylenko whose acting was sub par but both the female leads look pretty on-screen, so kudos for that. Except for Jack Harper, no other character could sink their teeth in the story line leaving too much of Jack Harper and too little of everyone else, makes me wonder why the movie was not called Jack Harper, acting is also sub par from the lead but acting is not tom cruise's identity, and almost every close framed shoot of the actors looked like they were forced into their monologues. Morgan Freeman stands out with his monologue delivery as he does a version of a Samuel L Jackson! But all actors did not bring their A-Game, especially the lead did not shine his presence on the screen. Nikolaj Costner- Waldau had a better action hero presence on the screen than Tom Cruise in the movie.The hardest part of every comic to movie adaptation is there is a sense of surreal predictability to it and only the few movies can hold it together with strong acting, soundtrack, and cast. For action movie junkies it will work fine, but for normal movie watcher they might be disappointed especially if they go in with high expectation.Rating of the Movie – 6 / 10+ —- Cinematography, Costume Design, CGI work, Morgan freeman doing a monologue!—- Acting from all the leads, sound effects.Will I ever see it again? —— NOPE!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An entertaining and thought-provoking sci-fi drama, mis-marketed as an action movie.","I truly enjoyed Oblivion. It's one of those increasingly rare sci-fi movies that takes the more courageous visual route of being ""clean and polished"" instead of the boring trend of gritty, blue-filtered futurescapes. It's post apocalyptic but it's gorgeous, the downed landmarks of the western world look like tourist attractions in the morning sunlight, the technologies and habitats look sparkling and well maintained. It's a very bright and airy movie visually and the cinematography is stunning throughout.It's not only courageous in it's visual style either. The story is balls to the wall sci-fi, unhampered by human antagonists. We're talking alien minds, memory wipes, laser guns and combat drones. I won't go so far as to call the story original - in fact it seems quite derivative of several popular sci-fi films. There are shades of The Matrix Revolutions, Moon, Total Recall, The Island, Logans Run and others. But instead of throwing these homages together into a mashup that just makes you want to watch the original films instead, it blends them seamlessly and emerges as a solid and entertaining movie in its own right.It's not perfect though. I have three gripes with it. First and foremost is that it was horribly mismarketed as a sci-fi actioner and it isn't. There are a couple of decent (but not outstanding) action set pieces but the majority of Oblivion is a moment-of-awakening drama and a love story, with thematic elements of what it means to be mortal and to die well running through it. Its going to disappoint the hell out of kids who go in looking for big bangs. This is much closer to 'Moon' in pace than something like 'Star Trek Into Darkness'.My second gripe is that, as thought-provoking as it was, I can't help but think there are some hefty plot holes in there. I would have to watch it a few times over to pull them out clearly but my gut instinct tells me they are there. Most of them are explicable if you extrapolate far enough with your own imagination, but it would have been a stronger film if the concepts, plot elements and character motivations were more watertight.Third gripe is a minor one, but significant enough for me - Morgan Freeman was massively underused. His character is a cardboard cutout cliché of a rebel leader and could have been so much more interesting and complex.The gripes aren't enough to bring a good movie down though, and Oblivion is a really good movie. A grown up, engaging, speculative tale that's stunning to look at. It will take a place on my sci-fi DVD shelf.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly well done,"Surprisingly well done. Not an entirely original concept, but the story had enough unique features to still make it compelling and interesting.I freely admit to being a bit skeptical going in with Tom Cruise as the lead role, but that was tempered by knowing that Olga Kurylenko would be there. OK, I could watch her in just about anything (and have seen almost every film she's ever been in), and was not disappointed.This is a film where you will want to pay attention to details. Understanding who (and what) Tom Cruise's character is will become apparent as the film progresses, so am not going to recite the details of that plot thread here, but it does require a willingness to follow those details as they emerge. As for Olga, this may be her best performance yet. She has progressed remarkably since her early days in films like ""the Assassin Next Door"".That's not to take anything away from Andrea Riseborough, who played the complex role of a highly intelligent woman, but one who is conflicted and confined by specific belief boundaries that had been programmed into her. Morgan Freeman, of course, fits his part exactly, as will become apparent later in the film.No spoilers here, but I might offer that in the genre' of post apocalyptic, earth is in dire peril and who we are destined to be as a type of species plot formats, this one is a bit different.There is considerably more to this production than just eye candy, though the CGI is quite well done. Unlike some films of a quasi similar genre', the CGI is beautifully done where relevant, but does not overpower the details of the plot threads as they emerge.This is one of those rare examples where the balance between technically stunning visual content and pace of story actually fit remarkably well together. Kudos to Joseph Kosinski for maintaining that balance in this well crafted production.A very solid 9 stars for this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Horrible movie.,"As someone else wrote here, this movie plot is rip off of other movies. It seems that there is nothing original about this movie. Visual effects are good, but plot of this movie evolves in a very slow pace with only few surprises. Therefore this movie is boring. I could have tell the plot of this movie to a friend in a 5 minutes. The thing is that this 5 minutes is extended to 2 hours. Such a disappointment. Not even Morgan Freeman appearance in this movie could save it and when I say appearance I mean appearance as he may be at the movie maybe for 5 minutes. Maybe a little longer. There are a few logical holes in the plot. The story of the movie was the major flaw for me. It seems like there wasn't much thought put into it. Filmmakers just patched scenes together with visual effects somehow following the story enough for this movie to be presented to the public. Previews for this movie were exciting, but the movie itself is a big failure.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
All Around Great Movie,"Oblivion is a great mixture of sci-fi, romance, drama and mystery. Talented actors, a great script and a very clever plot make this movie worth watching if you're a fan of sci-fi/mysteries.If you're big into action sci-fi, this probably isn't for you. It's much more about dialogue and following the main character's journey through out the film.What really resonated with me were the emotions he went through and the decisions he had to make. Defying authority, pursuing his own interests, etc.The addition of the love story is what really made the movie great all around. I'm a sucker for these types of romance films -- the sci-fi aspect keeps you entertained and the love story triggers emotions.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent blockbuster movie of 2013!,"'Oblivion' is a massive and stunning sci-fi movie. Joseph Kosinski as director once again entertains audience with cool and thrilling scenes which he had done it before in 'Tron: Legacy'. The plot itself is quite alike with Tron: tense at the beginning and becoming slow after the second half. There are also great stuff in cinematography, score and visual effects. The cinematography makes this movie more alive and beautiful, the score is very loud that increases the tense in this movie. The casts also not disappointing, especially Tom Cruise as leading actor though it's not his best ever performance. Tom Cruise is suitable when he acts in action movies. He is a cool and good looking guy which won't make people feel bored watching him and also give profit for this movie.At some points, 'Oblivion' is not original movie. The ideas could be coming from some movies like 'Wall-E' or 'Alien: Trilogy'. The storyline is really ridiculous and non-sense, the ending is also a little bit disappointing. Besides that thing, 'Oblivion' is still a good and entertaining action movie. So far, it's one of the best blockbuster movie this year. Definitely better than other disappointing movies recently like 'A Good Day to Die Hard', 'OZ the Great and Powerful' and 'G.I.Joe: Retaliation'.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But I did not dwell on them during my viewing, because I was engaged in the story and the visuals.I also liked the cast, though, in some ways, they were playing second fiddle to the visuals.

A Nutshell Review: Oblivion,"Written by Joseph Kosinski, KArl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt, and directed by the Kasinski, who was also responsible for bringing a new spin to the Tron legacy, Kasinski traded the dark settings of that film for the light and bright, minimalist and futuristic look at Earth some 60 years after 2017, where unknown alien forces had taken out Earth's moon, and plunging the planet into chaos with its unpredictable forces of mother nature ravaging it, followed by an invasion that took out most of the human population. The war was won, but at the expense of the planet since the nuclear fallout made it uninhabitable. So the survivors made that interplanetary migration to Saturn's moon Titan, leaving behind a skeletal crew of two - Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) - some drones, and a forward base controller (Melissa Leo) to harness energy from the oceans. And of course to mop up what's left of the alien race still down on earth.However, that's what we're lulled to believe, as we follow the typical day of Jack and Victoria, who wake up, get to work, with Jack essentially being a human Wall.E, repairing broken down drones, and patrolling their assigned territory from the skies. Jack and Victoria enjoy life as per any typical couple with not much for recreation at night, but there's something niggling in Jack's mind, being haunted by memories of a strange, beautiful female (Olga Kurylenko), something that shouldn't happen given their mind wipe, and whose unannounced, surprising presence threatens to upset their entire couple harmony, and their effectiveness as a team. Three's a crowd and making things worse is when jealousy enters the picture.To say any more would be to ruin the many surprises in store, which lead to the many revelations that when pieced together will make perfect sense, since the writers kept the cards close to their chests, revealing crucial plot points at intervals, which is frustrating yet satisfying, and well worth the wait, although sometimes at the expense of pace, or editing continuity that wasn't as smooth as it would have liked to be. But no matter. Granted that the expositions won't be anything new, with genre clichés abound that the fans amongst us would be able to predict, but it's how these elements come together so perfect that makes Oblivion such a worthwhile watch. Yes there are the sleekly designed vehicles befitting a sci-fi flick here, with the necessary attention to detail and explanation to make everything seem plausible for this apocalyptic vision of the future.But I love the emotional core that anchored the film a hell lot more, so much so that I dare say not a lot of films, and a science fiction one at that, managed to move. It deals with the longing of a normal life, which Jack had desired as he slips off the radar now and then to build that illusion of an idyllic life in a pocket of paradise he found, with reason of course to come later in the narrative. And the love triangle was well played out, where its beginnings couldn't come any simpler than a brush, a touch and a photograph, all very fleeting, to sucker punch it through to your heart. And just how all these humanity blends so well with the CG- ed technology on display, that made it unbelievably solid.Tom Cruise is a very different animal here altogether, without his usual toothy grin, and being a lot more serious, sombre and contemplative with his character, that worked wonders. No doubt the obvious hero in the film, many elements of heroism got played down to make it a simple fight for the survival of a loved one, without grandeur plans of needing to save the day at the forefront. Olga Kurylenko may be the flower vase here, but what an effective one playing opposite Cruise for the first time, with her sheer presence making it believable the extent a man would go out for her. Andrea Riseborough, being the relative rookie amongst the three, also stood her own, playing what would be a tragic character seeing her blissful future snatched from under her feet. Her subtleness in her final scene in the film, spoke volumes of her ability to say so much with so little.A couple of scenes that stood out for me, such as the black and white flashback scene involving Jack and Julia (Kurylenko) when they meet before going up the Empire State Building, communications between Victoria and Jack when their perfect teaming started to give way, together with just above every revelation that had Jack flabbergasted, and those sweeping cinematography of landscapes of a broken Earth. And what provided this film that extra dimension, is the excellent and hauntingly beautiful score by M83 that lifts this film into another emotional stratosphere altogether, that without which, the movie isn't likely going to be as memorable, or emotional, as it got made out to be.Watch Oblivion on the IMAX screen no less, for those awesome visuals to envelope right up to the peripherals of your vision, and for that crystal clear pounding of the soundscapes and soundtrack right into your aural senses. This is the modern day treatment of The Wachowski's The Matrix in a certain way without the philosophical babble, but my, I'd give it five stars and a perfect ten! A definite recommendation, and a firm entry into my shortlist as one of the best films this year so far!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A search for truth, yet no answers are provided","""A veteran assigned to extract Earth's remaining resources begins to question what he knows about his mission and himself."" That is the IMDb synopsis of Oblivion's plot. I went in expecting a science fiction movie about a protagonist that uncovers magnitudes of answers and truths that go against all his taken-for-granted knowledge.The movie started in an intriguing way, showing us the decimated world wrought by war, and the routines of the protagonist, Jack, and his partner. The visuals of the movie are very well done and it was awe- inspiring to see, ironically, the beauty of such destruction. The cinematography was very well done – I was immersed in several of scenes due to the fashion in which the movie was filmed.The storyline, however, is a giveaway. It is extremely predictable at times, and it takes the protagonist on a path for truth that leads to a puddle of answers. I expected Morgan Freeman's character to provide some answers, and I expected the characters to be more inquisitive and prying for information. However, the characters were satisfied with the face value of the truth handed to them. I wanted to learn more about the world, and I was learning about it vicariously through the characters. The lack of lore presented in the movie left me hungry for more, and I ended up walking out of the theatre empty.Overall, this movie is a rental at best. The acting and the visuals, while good, cannot compensate for the lacking story.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not bad if you have nothing better to do,"First of all, the trailer gave away a huge aspect of the movie that could've really made it better if kept secret. The very fact that Morgan Freeman's character shows up in the trailer lets you know where the movie's going. So if anyone is thinking of watching this, I'd advise not watching the trailer.Anyway, if like me you saw the trailer then you won't get any surprises, just a few deja vu moments including The Matrix, Eagle Eye and a soundtrack that reminds you of the recent Batman trilogy.Whenever there's a monologue to explain the plot to the audience, I feel like I'm being treated like a baby because the filmmakers couldn't be bothered. Victoria's character was especially wooden and soulless, but to be fair, I wasn't emotionally invested in anyone's character. My opinion is that this is because I was mirroring the lifeless drone theme of the movie.Personally, it made me ponder illuminati type conspiracy theories which was entertaining, but other than that, the movie left me feeling good because the song at the end, by M83, was good :)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The visuals are surely not prone to Oblivion,"In a vast seemingly endless landscape, Jak travels on a bike surrounded by what appears to be the remnants of the Manhattan Bridge. In another shot, Jak's Bubbleship circles a destroyed football stadium which hosted the last Superbowl before the alien invasion that destroyed earth. These are simply two of the many shots that you see in Oblivion showing a ravaged Earth circa 2077. And they're a sight to behold no matter the countless times such sights have been and shall continue to be shown on celluloid. The effects blend in seamlessly and after the initial few shots, it ceases to matter what's real and what's digital.For a futuristic sci-fi that claims to be original (and it is if Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel by the same name is considered just that: unpublished), Kosinski nails the look and atmosphere. But then, Kosinski's already done that in Tron: Legacy, his last outing, which was no less of a visual achievement by any means. Fortunately, at least for me, this one comes out to be a tad bit better than his previous attempt.Jak Harper and Victora a.k.a. Vika work as a team with Vika serving as the operator and Jak handling the drone maintenance work on Earth: repairing drones that have been programmed to destroy any alien life on sight. Earth was destroyed in an alien attack 60 years ago and while the humans won the war, the planet was sabotaged beyond habitation. On one of his routine missions, Jak encounters a flying object that crash lands on Earth. It turns out that there were five objects housing humans with one of them resembling a woman Jak has been seeing frequently in his dreams. Jak rescues her and the real story takes off from there.Joseph Kosinski takes the simple route and has the film begin with a narration by Cruise explained the aforementioned scenario. Perhaps he chose to do it because the film already has plenty of surprises in store in the second half and as such, there was no need to obscure Earth's current situation. As expected, the movie feels like a well polished product in all departments. Cruise, Olga and Andrea turn in pretty decent performances despite having no distinct character arcs to follow. Cruise in particular gives in a very, shall I say, sincere performance playing it low key. Freeman essays his cameo with ease. The Zimmerish music does get a bit repetitive and generic but manages to keep the tension at appropriate levels which suits my tastes so that'll be a plus for me. And thankfully, the movie refuses to go all out into Haloesque action mode for a long time with the action being interspersed and well spaced and most importantly, kept to as much as is required and no more.What you will take in the end with Oblivion are the visuals. Lets face it, by the time the whole movie ends, you'll realize all the plots elements have been borrowed from a flick or two in the past. But these days, its not only about an original plot but an original execution. And for a movie that's not a remake, or a sequel, or an established comic book or adapted novel, Oblivion does the job. It may not be an Avatar but Oblivion is decent enough for a one time watch. And going by the visuals, that watch is best suited for the big screen.Score: 7.5 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Vastly underrated,"One of the most underrated and sadly overlooked science fiction movies of the last 20 years. Director Joseph Kosinski and Tom Cruise collaborated closely to create a thematically complex character-driven story, set in a beautifully detailed and luxuriously rendered world. One particularly notable feature of the film are the parallels of character, set design, and other details, the first set of which is established in the first half of the movie and the mirror of which begin to emerge in the second half of the movie.I remember being rather dismissive of this movie upon seeing the trailers because it just looked like any other action sci-fi set in some dystopian future. I was wrong, or maybe the trailer wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Anyway, upon watching it several times now, including once with the commentary by Cruise and Kosinski, and watching the special features on the disc, I've developed a much deeper appreciation of so many details I missed even upon repeated viewing. In addition, Kozinski's successful effort to do as many of the effects in camera as possible, and realizing how much of what you see on screen which you might assume is CG is not in fact CG, and myriad other details, again, filled me with genuine appreciation for the artistry of this movie. Besides all of that, it's just a cracking good story.Incidentally, I highly recommend renting or buying the disc. Cruise is exceptional on commentaries. While he does not direct or edit movies, he has an absolute expert knowledge of every process and technology associated with filmmaking. He knows lenses, special effects, film history, everything. You can learn a lot about filmmaking by listening to him dialogue with directors about films they've made together. Such is the case with the commentary on Oblivion, and the making of features, which also include brief interview moments with Cruise.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Could Have Been A Great Movie,"Visually looks cool, good actors, movie had potential but the director lacked a clear philosophy for his movie. Too many ideas squeezed into one movie makes it a mess. Also, some scenes and ideas were pushed through unnaturally fast, not giving you the time and content/dialogue to process it. It just jumps from scene to scene basically, except for the intro which was more solos. Probably because the amount of ideas forced into this movie was still a low number.

Oblivion,"Tom Cruise really isn't my favorite. Although he does do some things right from time to time.Welcome to Earth: 2077. I'm not spoiling much, because we find out Earth was ravaged by nuclear attack, leaving behind nothing but an unrecognizable, desolate wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works as a security repairman of sorts, living with Vika (Andrea Riseborough) his wife, girlfriend, roommate, I'm not really sure. Essentially, they are tasked with the duty of repairing and performing maintenance on defense drones within the safe radiation zone. These drones defend several giant rig machines that harvest water or something to help store fuel for the future of mankind, which has all apparently moved off to Saturn's moon, Titan.Besides the unsympathetic and hollow defense drones, Jack and Vika are alone on Earth, or are they? The nuclear holocaust took place because a species of alien attacked Earth, called scavengers (or scavs). Sally (Melissa Leo) guides Jack and Vika through a holo-device, directing them on how to go about protecting the rigs on a day to day basis. Sally supposedly lives on an orbiting space-cube of sorts, called the Tet. Therein lives most of humanity that hasn't already left for Titan.I'm sure you are already lost reading my synopsis, and rightfully so, as it's a maze of a plot. Being a science fiction film, the maze only develops more twists and turns as we progress, until everything that we once knew as fact is no longer such.I haven't seen director Joseph Kosinski's ""Tron: Legacy"" so I'm not exactly sure if he intentionally likes to provide social commentary in his films without resolution on purpose. It's hard to not give away much by saying so, but there is a certain level of subtle (or maybe blatant) discussion here about our environment, and the rate at which the filmmakers believe we are destroying it. At another point, we are in a pristine, well-kept futuristic building, where Jack stands, covered in soot and dirt, a man who used to believe lies, now knowing the truth. A clean, spotless woman stands before him. The juxtaposition is clear, but at some point we are left wondering what it means. And it's not a moment where we actually want to know what it means either.The casting of Morgan Freeman as Beech seems to have been a wasted opportunity. Freeman doesn't have hardly any screen time, and the film's trailer gives him much more credit than is due; can I legally say such a thing about Morgan Freeman?Also, despite a few somewhat painful monologues with Jack raging about some ancient football game, or some classic literature, Cruise is truly in great form here.The highlight of ""Oblivion"" is in the soundtrack. If you are at all familiar with the electronic band M83, then ""Oblivion"" is sure to be a treat. The recurring theme from the film follows the aptly titled single, ""Oblivion"".""Oblivion"" is a fun science fiction thriller, with plenty of excitement and a fantastic soundtrack. Hollywood is falling deeply in love with post-apocalyptia these days, and being fan of it myself, I can't complain.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The audacious 'Oblivion' is a sleekly stylish, cerebral Sci-fi masterpiece.","After the brain-warping brilliance of live. Die. Repeat.' Human dynamo Tom Cruise explores no less spectacular Sci-fi realms in writer/director Joseph Kosinski's visionary Post-Apocalyptic adventure 'Oblivion' which concerns weary maintenance worker Jack Harper, and fellow 'good team' member Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), Jack's super-dilligent, borderline robotic, exquisitely beautiful 'eye-in-the-sky partner who stoically monitors his day-to-day salvage, and monotonous drone repairs, their increasingly uneasy alliance is driven to breaking point by the wholly unexpected crash-landing of a decades old NASA satellite, whose sole living survivor is Julia (Olga Kurylenko), and her extraordinary claim of her being Jack's long estranged wife expedites a tumultuous series of extraordinary, reality-wrecking events that disturbingly suggest their seemingly banal work detail has an altogether more sinister purpose!

I had seen the trailer, and was keen to switch my mind off for a few hours and just enjoy the movie.Unfortunately, I couldn't switch my mind off during this movie, as it was so filled with inaccuracies and flaws that I found it impossible to actually enjoy it. It got to a point where I could think of nothing but everything wrong that was happening.This movie, set in the much too near future for any of the technology presented to be plausible, is about Jack Harper, a man left on Earth with his assigned partner after Earth's moon has been destroyed by extra terrestrials, and although the human race has won the war, they have been forced to leave Earth and live on Saturn's moon, Titan. He travels about his futuristic helicopter, in search of damaged drones.Throughout the movie, so many painfully obvious flaws in the story line and general scientific inaccuracies are seen that I lost count. Although many sci-fi movies are lacking in scientific accuracy, Oblivion really sets a new low. It was clearly directed toward those lacking enough intelligence and common sense to realize how flawed the movie is, and yet the story line and plot was very difficult to follow and understand.Without giving any spoilers, I feel as though the writer had a very clear idea when he began writing, and then he slowly lost direction of where the movie was going, and suddenly ended it with a convenient, yet horribly disappointing ending. I believe the writer attempted to make a movie full of life-changing revelations, much like The Matrix, although lacking the intelligence that The Matrix held.However,The visual effects displayed in this film really are pleasing to the eye, and only the just make the movie bearable. This being said, stunning visual effects don't make up for stupidity.In short: My movie ticket was free, and I still regret going.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not as bad as it could have been, nor as good...","Having heard both good and bad things about this movie, it was with some conflict of heart that I sat down to watch the movie. I had no idea what to expect from the movie, as people I had talked to about it were divided into very different camps regarding the movie.Personally, well I enjoyed the movie, although I will not go as far as to say that it was a brilliant piece of masterwork. And there are some better and more impressive Sci-Fi movies available. ""Oblivion"" starts out alright and gets into a good pace rather quickly, but then it settles in that pace and never really goes beyond that. Which was a shame, because that sort of held the movie back in a monotone sort of way. And also, the movie suffered somewhat of a setback once you get past the point where they pass into the radiation zone. Without saying what happens there, I can imagine that it is the point in the movie that divides people into the ""like it"" and ""don't like it"" camps.Storywise, then ""Oblivion"" wasn't spectacular, but it was alright. There were some good moments here and there, and some good enough action scenes as well. However, what was lacking was more dialogue and more character interaction with one another. It had somewhat of a superficial glance to it. It never really challenges the audience into thinking or lead to any kind of brain activity; this is basically just switch into auto-gear, sit back and enjoy the ride.For a movie with an approximate budget of $120.000.000, then the end result is not really all that it could have been. And the ending to the movie, well it was just a downright typical predictable Hollywood ending.""Oblivion"" has its flaws, but it also has its qualities. And it does provide good enough entertainment, although it had a tendency to drag on a little bit more than necessary. It is a beautiful movie to look at, but beneath the glamour and CGI, there was little meat on the bone, so to speak.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cool Visuals and Ideas but Mediocre Plot,"This movie has some incredibly beautiful visuals. The cinematography and special effects are without a doubt the best thing about this movie. It also has some cool sci-fi ideas taken straight from other sci-fi movies like Moon and 2001 A Space Odyssey, but with that being said, the plot is just mediocre and not very well executed. The characters are flat, the movie takes a while to actually get going, and the cool ideas are not fully explored.This movie has a resistance plot with a character played by Morgan Freeman, but his character and the resistance plot isn't fully explored. It tries to build a romantic relationship but the two characters have no chemistry, and their relationship isn't fully explored. It also involves cloning, but that part of the movie isn't explored either. This movie incorporates so many cool ideas, but the filmmakers seemed too lazy to fully explore them . Instead, we're left with a mostly uninteresting plot that involves Tom Cruise wandering about, stumbling on new revelations about the plot. Also, it tries to have some huge emotional and epic ending, but I didn't care enough about the characters and plot to feel any emotion towards the movie. With the visuals and the amount of cool ideas, this would've be a masterpiece if it was in the hands of a better director and writer like Christopher Nolan or Alex Garland.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie with amazing visuals,"I have been expecting this film for a long time now. And tonight when I finally got to see it I was not let down. The film features absolutely stunning cinematography, a great cast and a very good story. This is not the color booming flick like for an example Avatar was, this is a darker more adult film in many ways. The cast performance is superb and I must say that the performance of Andrea Riseborough is at the very best. The first half of the film is great and exciting, the second half is somewhat predictable though and therefore not as exciting. But all in all i would definitely recommend this film. It could possibly be one of the best films of this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A modern Sci-fi that delivers, but drags out a bit too much.","Many probably thought they had this movie figured out from the trailers, but oh boy many of them don't. I thought i had it figured, and that the trailers spoiled to much, but i was wrong.The story takes a bit time before it is fully explored, but when it reveals itself it works. Oblivion delivers a true and smart sci-fi story that explores themes of humanity, and the confusion of not having all the information. Since i don't want to spoil anything other then this, i'll cut short here.The acting is good, and it's especially pleasing to see that Tom Cruise is still a top notch actor (after War of the World, i was kinda nervous to see him in a alien invasion movie again.) Morgen Freeman is also a strategically good choice when it comes to explaining the deeper plots in the movie.The special effects are also excellent, and there is many stunning visual shots of the post apocalyptic earth. The drones and technological parts are also beautifully visualized, and is a perfect match with the ravaged background.The movies biggest problem for me is pacing. At times it is slow. Unbearably slow. Because, let's be honest. Oblivion is a smart movie, but it's not THAT smart. It's not the kinda movie where the audience should require 20 minutes for something to sink it, yet that is mostly what you get. After every major reveal, there is like 20 minutes of dragging out, before the story progresses. Also, the only part the movie does NOT stress to drag out, is the ending. This is a huge mistake, because i instantly fell in love with what was reveal to be the main antagonist.All in all a strong 7. It's not perfect, but it has a lot strong points.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Chix Chat on Film review: Earth decimated,"Oblivion is the kind of film that once you see the trailer you have high expectations for what it will deliver. It did deliver on some spectacular images from high atop the world in Jack Harper's (Tom Cruise) sky living quarters, where he and Vicka (Andrea Riseborough) are an effective team. Visually, the look of this film was quite imaginative. This was Mr. Cruise's turn at being the 'one', that individual who is the savior of humanity. There were too many scenes that reminded me of The Matrix for me to give this film high marks in the creativity column, I seriously expected that at some point Jack would hold out his hand and fry the drones that were in pursuit. This is another film that gets segmented, but in this case it is a matter of before Julia (Olga Kurylenko) and after Julia. Before, Julia the mood of the story was a ride along with Jack as he performed his duty of drone repairs and it would be putting it mildly to say that it seemed to drone on and one, pun intended. Then after Julia the pace picks up as did my interest in what was taking place and where the plot was leading me. When Jack meets Beech (Morgan Freeman) a Morpheus-like character, again it was just so Matrix-esque he is given instruction as to how he should learn the truth about what was happening, since simply telling him would not could not possibly be accepted or comprehended. The special effects in Oblivion were more the marvel of this film than the story, which was a blending of other films of this genre that had come before it. To be able to convincingly depict a thriving metropolis as a wasteland buried under a desert was amazing, but the real star of the film was the chopper with the on board bike accessory. The maneuverability, compactness and styling of that transport is the kind of concept technology that I would love to see realized by some science geek who would. In a side note, now I understand why there was so little of Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones season two, he was off playing Sykes (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Had the before Julia storyline been as engaging as the after Julia story I would have been more inclined to go green, but alas I have to give it an amber light",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Had a meh time watching,"There were some things I liked for sure. The visuals and special effects looked great, the film was very cool to look at. I liked some of the twists and turns they threw in and the ending felt earned. It just felt like a little bit too much to go through to get to it and the film didn't convince me action-wise and with its premise in the beginning as much as it could have. Therefore it felt largely stale in a few parts and it's probably not a movie I'd watch again. Plus, there were too many convenient occurrences that made it feel more fake.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of my all-time favorite films 9.5/10,"Oblivion is not just a film; it's a profound exploration of identity, memory, and the human spirit's resilience. It masterfully blends aesthetics, narrative depth, and an unforgettable score to deliver a cinematic experience that transcends its genre. For me, it mirrors life's complexities-sometimes melancholic, but always deeply human.A Visual and Aesthetic Marvel
From its opening scenes, Oblivion captivates with its starkly beautiful landscapes. The contrast between Earth's desolate ruins and the sleek, modern aesthetic of the Sky Tower is a visual metaphor for the duality of human existence: destruction and hope, decay and rebirth. Every frame is a work of art, a testament to Joseph Kosinski's architectural precision and love for clean, minimalist design.Philosophical Undertones
At its core, Oblivion asks profound questions about what defines us. Are we merely the sum of our memories? If those are taken away or manipulated, do we lose our humanity? These existential musings resonate deeply, much like the paradoxes in life itself-where we often question our choices, our identity, and our purpose. The cyclical journey of Jack Harper echoes the human experience: the quest for truth, even when the answers are painful. Who hasn't questioned their place in the world, or felt like a stranger in their own skin?Much like Jack, I've often grappled with questions of purpose and authenticity, especially when life throws its curveballs. The film's cyclical narrative feels personal-a reminder that growth often comes from revisiting old wounds and finding new meaning in familiar places.An Emotional Parallel to Life
This film connects with me on a deeply personal level. Like Jack Harper, we often navigate through life feeling like remnants of ourselves, searching for meaning amid chaos. Some moments are tinged with sadness-loss, regret, or solitude-while others are filled with unexpected sensuality and love. Oblivion captures that bittersweet dance, reminding us that even in desolation, there is beauty and purpose.Sure, I haven't piloted a futuristic drone or fought off alien overlords (yet), but Oblivion captures the essence of navigating life's uncertainties. And let's be honest, sometimes life feels like a mission you weren't fully briefed on.Music That Resonates with the Soul
The soundtrack, composed by M83, is nothing short of sublime. It doesn't just accompany the film; it elevates it. Tracks like ""Oblivion"" and ""StarWaves"" evoke a haunting sense of wonder and nostalgia, perfectly complementing the film's themes. The music lingers long after the credits roll, much like the memories we hold dear, shaping our emotional landscape.For someone like me, whose personal playlist includes the likes of Led Zeppelin and Procol Harum, M83's ethereal compositions feel like a modern echo of those timeless sounds-evoking grandeur, introspection, and an almost cosmic melancholy. It's music that reaches into the soul, bridging the gap between classic rock's evocative spirit and the film's futuristic aesthetic.A Timeless Masterpiece
Oblivion stands out as a film that marries substance and style, a rare gem in a sea of formulaic blockbusters. Its philosophical depth, visual brilliance, and emotional resonance make it a timeless masterpiece. It's a reflection of life itself: a journey of discovery, pain, love, and ultimately, hope.For these reasons, Oblivion isn't just my favorite film-it's a cinematic mirror, reflecting the trials and triumphs of existence with unparalleled grace.For me, it mirrors my own journey-sometimes grave, sometimes lighthearted, but always introspective.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Could have been a step forward - 6,5/10","Before I say anthing, I just want to go on record and say that I haven't read the graphic novel.I saw the movie 'Oblivion' on IMAX (My first time). I was stunned by the visuals and production design that this movie had, it reminded me how good the Sci-Fi genre is. I've always been a fan of Tom Cruise, and never really understood the hate against him as an actor. In other words, I had no problem with him or any other person in the cast. The main problem with this film was the score/soundtrack, believe it or not.The soundtracks sucked up all life from the movie and at the same time tried to give it life. Here we have a movie about a post-apocalyptic earth, stunning visual effects, amazing cinematography, great production design and good actors. Now, that in it self is already epic. You don't need a score that sounds like badly composed Hans Zimmer score for 'The dark knight rises' (which it did) to make the picture more epic. And that was the main problem with the movie. If the movie had been more silent - meaning that the only thing you would hear would be the spaceships, guns etc, and less music - the movie would have been more raw and would have given a sign of ""no hope"" in it. You can't have a post-apocalyptic world with ""epic"" music that sounds like Hans Zimmer during the entire movie, and I'm not kidding when I say the entire movie. It also sucked out all life from the characters, meaning that when 'Jack' was sad, the music was extra-super-epic-sad, so you couldn't really focus on any of the acting in itself, the music did it for you. As a matter of fact, when the movie started, I wasn't quite sure if it was a trailer or if the movie really started - because of the music.I didn't have any problem with the length of the movie, there were some amazing things in it which needed time. There was a scene in which 'Jack' floated around in the spaceship near the end which I thought was just amazing. Other than that, it could have been a really great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Kosinski Too Talented for Technophobic Clichés,"I have mixed feelings about Oblivion, but I'd recommend a watch nonetheless.First, the cinematography is one of the most beautiful I've seen, perhaps the best one to date in science-fiction. It is certainly on par with Tron: Legacy, if not more spectacular even. Just for that, Oblivion is worth the entry cost. And I don't regret watching the film if it helps Kosinski to keep doing this sort of awesome visual work.On the other hand, I have some issues with the plot. At some point in the film, I thought we would get a very nice metaphysical reflection. But unfortunately, the story falls into the common traps of uninspired sci-fi writers, like technophobia. The many plot twists also tend to blur the philosophical content. The screenwriters want to tell too much and seem to lose their focus along the way.Tom Cruise deserves credit for his excellent performance in the leading role. Andrea Riseborough is very good, too. The rest of the cast is either less convincing, or underexploited.Oblivion is a good entertainment, and certainly worth watching, but I'm sure Kosinski could do even better next time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Unoriginal, Awful","This is without a doubt one of the worst movies that i have ever had the displeasure of seeing. It is completely unoriginal;- the story is a rip off of a movie called Moon (which stars Sam Rockwell and is superbly acted). While visually stunning this does not add enough value to the film given how truly dreadful the acting is- and yes i do mean cruise who looks slightly constipated throughout the movie.If you want a movie with substance that will keep you engaged, and give you food for thought this is not for you. If you want something which is thinly veiled attempt to show of CGI and relaunch Tom Cruise into the mainstream then go for. I for one would gouge out my eyeballs before sitting through this again",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Technically Oscar Worthy and Very Original,"Just saw the film today in Qatar. Wasn't expecting it to be that stunning. Acting was very very good, even smaller supporting roles. Morgan Freeman was fantastic and surprisingly, I found Melissa Leo whose role would be unexpected to many, to be really smart in this role choice. With her voice, she conveyed a lot of shades. This film is worthy of Oscar consideration, but not just in production design. Claudio Miranda's Cinematography is AMAZING – I kept wondering since the very first shot who did the cinematography and I smiled when I saw his name on the credits. The Score is fantastic and the song is superb. If I was an academy voter, I would vote for VISUAL EFFECTS ORIGINAL SCORE ORIGINAL SONG CINEMATOGRAPHY PRODUCTION DESIGN And maybeee SCREENPLAY – ORIGINAL",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Unoriginal, but enjoyable sci-fi","Despite being marketed as both ""groundbreaking"" and ""original"", 'Oblivion is neither. Joseph Kosinki's follow-up to 2010's surprisingly likable 'Tron Legacy', contains elements of so many sci-fi movies that we've seen before – there's 'Total Recall', '2001: a Space Odyssey', 'Moon', 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', 'Planet of the Apes' etc. There's a good chance that you may have seen at least one of those and thus, you will probably recognise something from them in 'Oblivion'. However, that's not to say this is a bad film by any means – it's not – but it isn't anything remotely new.In an opening voice-over, Tom Cruise's character Jack Harper outlines how a group of aliens called Scavengers (nicknamed 'Scavs') obliterated half of the moon and engaged in a war with the people of Earth, who eventually won the war with the use of nuclear weapons, which consequently damaged the planet's ecosystem. The majority of the Earth's population consequently embarked on a giant spacecraft. Jack Harper, one of only two people left on the planet, is a repairman who fixes drones to help rebuild the Earth's ecosystem. Yes, sort of like a human version of 'WALL-E'. However, when a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) falls from the sky (literally), Harper begins to question all he knew.Cruise, a perfectly fine screen presence, holds the screen very well and remains a consistently engaging figure throughout. His performance here is nothing to champion his work in 'Magnolia' or 'Born on the Fourth of July', but he makes Harper a likable lead. Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough try their best with the material, despite being given two arguably underwritten roles. Morgan Freeman unfortunately, is wasted with little more to do than act as Basil Exposition, although to be fair, no one delivers exposition quite like Freeman. Nikolaj Coaster Waldau is similarly wasted, which is a shame, given his ever-great turn as Jaime Lannister in 'Game of Thrones'.What helps the film greatly are its Claudio Miranda-shot visuals which are truly spectacular, from the pristine white of the sky tower's interior where Harper lives to the sight of the Brooklyn Bridge dangling between two sides of a chasm. The use of Iceland as the film's shooting location makes a nice change from many other sci-fi movies, with the country's natural beauty stunningly captured.'Oblivion' is on a similar level to 'Tron Legacy'; it contains solid performances and strong visuals that manage to overcome a mediocre script, however its disappointingly ordinary M83 soundtrack doesn't rival Daft Punk's scoring on the latter. Overall, it's nothing you haven't seen before (aside from the beautiful Icelandic vistas), but if you want solidly enjoyable sci-fi action that's never boring, you got it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Boring, clichéd, derivative, SF action film starring Tom Cruise.","Is this meant to be a comedy? If so it was very good. Alas, I fear it was not. It should have been made as one and if it was, it would have been more enjoyable. Perhaps instead it was a knowing Tarantino-like nod to classic films in one genre, with other genres thrown in and all referenced in the film. Perhaps not.There is nothing in this film that is original. Nothing whatsoever. Everything in this film is borrowed from some other film or some other film franchise (a term I do not like using but have to here). Most of the ideas in this film have been used in other SF films. The films cannot be named as this would constitute as major plot-spoiling. Two major film franchises have been used for source material, one massively, I dare not even name the star or the genre. Tom Cruise films have even been scavenged. At least two. Well at least that is appropriate. I count at least four SF films that have been scavenged. Romance and suspense genres have also been dipped into.Film stars Tom Cruise. He has his all-American good looks and his wry smile. Film opens with his narration and with his rambling conversations to himself and his work colleague. This gives you the background to the story of the earth being destroyed and this couple living up in the sky. All this talk is irritating but at least Cruise is believable as a somewhat lonely man, on his own a lot, who talks to himself a lot.Tom Cruise is an engineer and pilot. His colleague, played by Andrea Riseborough, works the controls back at base. This base is up in the sky and is a very clean and sanitised place, that contrasts starkly with the grim Earth below. This brave new world base is stunning. The controls stuff is boring but the domestic scenes are the best part of the film.There is much chasing, fighting and flying. All done well. This reviewer had upgraded to the tilting seats and so this probably enhanced those scenes. Feel the vibration when the plane takes off! Having said that, the chasing and flying scenes were very derivative. Praise where praise is due, all the special-effects were stunning, as were the locations. Some of the outside location-shots were truly breath-taking but again sadly somewhat derivative.The acting is good. Tom Cruise is good (OK TC). For some reason Andrea Riseborough is listed fourth in the cast. She should be second. We see a lot more of her here than we do in the recent 'Welcome to the Punch'. More, longer and more depth. A much bigger part which she fills well. With this and 'Punch' both being so unoriginal, it must be hoped that she can get the chance to be in better films. Olga Kurylenko, too, gave a moving performance. Both females were wasted though by this script in which everything was telegraphed. Words, plots, twists, all could be guessed at and predicted before they happened. All thespians old and young performed well.All problems with this film can be safely left at the door of the writer/director Joseph Kosinski. Final credits state film came from a graphic novel. IMDb states the novel idea came from Kosinski. He was born in 1974, thus is nearly forty years old but you would think he was half that age. Has he not seen any films?I was not born in 1935 but I have seen the film from that year by Alfred Hitchcock entitled 'The 39 Steps', starring Robert Donat. I have also seen the Kenneth More and Robert Powell versions. Why do I mention this? I can safely mention that a good way into the film there is a small scene which would have Richard Hanney shouting ""Been there, done that!"". I merely say that this film is just so very, very familiar.In the UK it is rated 12A. In the opinion of this reviewer, this is because nobody over the age of 12 should be allowed to see it. Even those 15-18 years-old will find it derivative.Have heard secret reports leaking out that a 4th version of 'The 39 Steps' is to be made. I look forward to Richard Hanney once more shouting out ""What are the 39 Steps?"" but that of course is another story.If you are going to see 'Oblivion' and you have never seen another film before, you will love it. Those who have seen more films will like it less. Comedies and romances must keep to the rules of their genre. Nice guys get laughed at when they are in trouble but then they get out of it. That couple who are right for each other will eventually get together. Do action films just have standard actions and plots that are endlessly repeated? This one does!At the risk of being repetitive about this deeply, deeply unoriginal film, there is nothing in this film that is original. Nothing at all. Therefore this can only be described as a fairly good to average action film and thus is marked 5/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not bad actually,"This is an OK Sci-Fi film with great scenery shots and dystopian atmosphere although the dialogue can be a little bit tiring most of the times and there is a plot twist that I would rather if it had been revealed towards the end of the film rather than the 1st hour of its runtime. The plot might be a bit confusing in the beginning so I suggest you do a few rewinds on your DVD if you prefer to understand every aspect of the story. In addition, it has good moments such as the spacecraft scene in the end which is absolutely beautiful to look at. So when it is good, it is really good.

For what? To where are pieces which neither this man nor his accomplice gets to know. Amidst the daily repairs and routine clean up, he scraps through what was not suppose to be his area!The truth is beyond the review and is something which you should watch the movie for. However, I need to state that such plots are not fresh and there is a need to install more creativity.At a level of suspense and fun, this movie is worth a watch and hence I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sam Rockwell was better.,"Oblivion is a story set years into the future; there was a war which humans won, but the earth was lost. Strange events occur with Jack (Tom Cruise) and it then triggers him to ask himself how much exactly does he know about his employers and his mission.Now a run through the acting performances, Tom Cruise was excellent as always, he seemed to carry the movie through the...how do I say it; already used story line, but I'll get to that later. There's Olga Kurylenko (Julia) who, in every movie I see with her in it, she is the mysterious girl who the main character always falls in love with. Morgan Freeman (Beech) needs no introduction and pulled off a very nice performance, despite is fairly small role/screen time. You can't forget Andrea Riseborough (Victoria) who showed a good performance, I can't say it was excellent though.The story, I really don't want to spoil anything but I'm sure the message board has had many many threads saying the exact same thing as I am thinking. I will just say there is a significant movie rated 8.0 and features Sam Rockwell in it, which follows a very, if not, too similar story line to Oblivion, however I'm here to review Oblivion, not... the other one.Oblivion is a fun movie with different genres colliding, including romances, mystery and action/thriller.

Leisurely movie,"A slow-paced, measured film - that's the first thought that comes to mind when mentioning this movie. Simple, balanced, without too much action or flashy fantasy elements, which surprisingly works in its favor.The impression it leaves is mostly positive, although it doesn't evoke strong emotions, awe-inspiring special effects, or impressive acting. Yet, there's something endearing about it, something calm that makes it easy to watch repeatedly. It's not the type of film you return to for specific moments, but rather because it's entirely non-intrusive, providing a pleasant background for household or creative tasks.The plot, surprisingly, is engaging. Without spoiling for those who haven't seen it, the idea is simple but only fully unfolds towards the end, leaving a satisfying aftertaste.Tom Cruise isn't particularly emotional in this role, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. His restraint fits the film's atmosphere perfectly.The only downside for me is Olga Kurylenko. She is undeniably beautiful and fits well for a model, but as an actress, she falls short. Her performance feels incomplete, as though she didn't fully immerse herself in the role.Overall, the film is well-crafted: clear, clean visuals, pleasant music, and a fresh idea create a calm, harmonious piece. It leaves a sense of tranquility and is perfect for a laid-back evening.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visuals and Soundtrack Save Oblivion,"The Summer of 2013 has been filled with juicy Sci-Fi films that either fail to impress or, will impress! If Oblivion was to be judged particularly on the story, it might of had some some trouble with critics and fans alike. The story can be pretty confusing for some until the very end, or until (lets say) your buddy explains to you what the purpose of the story was. It takes away from the film that the viewer isn't really getting what the story is all about. Needless to say, the story is pretty interesting, just a little all over the place and not enough explanations. (I guess you would say ""plot holes""?) On a plus side, it leaves room for interpretation.What really saved this film was the visuals and the amazing soundtrack by Anthony Gonzalez! Sci-Fi films are meant to shine the brightest in the ""Visuals"" field and Oblivion manages to succeed with flying colors (literally). The soundtrack is easily one of the best of the year, and to keep it nice and simple, the music in the film will allow you to feel like you're in a whole different world (I'll also note that the soundtrack is worth the buy on iTunes.Oblivion stands out in the crowd with it's extreme visuals, great acting, and enchanting soundtrack! 9/10 for me! (Yeah, the visuals are that good!)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
enjoyable,"This is a Tom Cruise movie - most and foremost. It offers amazing visuals (that you only get when you watch the movie on the big screen) .. and pretty good acting, which is expected of the cast - even if you do not like Tom Cruise much - you have to give him that he can do action and even drama reasonably well.The story is not so new though. Quickly - you can anticipate the conclusion - which does not make the movie worse much .. but of course it does take away fromt he surprise. (especially when you consider the movie Moon, not so long before Oblivion - well, not so long being 3 or 4 years i think) There are flaws in the story of course - flaws that are obvious when you think about it - but not so relevant when you just enjoy watching it - mostly due to the movies pace.Worth watching ... but it has little to no re-watch quality.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Movie for People Who Have Never Seen Other Movies,"If you've never seen a movie before,""Oblivion"" is a good place to start. For one thing, it stars Tom Cruise, who usually rises above his material, and it features Morgan Freeman, who always does. For another thing, the next movie you see will probably be better than this one. If, on the other hand, you are a regular movie goer -- be prepared to see things that you've seen before. I recognize the influence of ""2001-A Space Odyssey,"" ""Doctor Zhvago,"" ""Independence Day,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" and ""V"" (the original 1983 TV movie). Some of these films were sources of inspiration for the writer/producer/director, others were sources of plagiarization. I'm sure that many of you will recognize other movies you have seen in ""Oblivion."" I did not see the movie in IMAX, but some viewers may find the enhanced visual effects to be a worthwhile distraction from a very thin plot line.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Great depth, you must watch 2-3 times to get it","Despite the undoubtedly awesome aesthetics, the smooth photography, a great Tom Cruise and an even great Andrea Riseborough, the movie has actually a fantastic plot. There are plenty of hints around the movie in times that you will not get them, but will shape you a feeling you will not be able to understand. The movie's depth is great, you will need to watch it 2-3 times to fully understand a look, a word or even a slight move in the first 3 minutes that actually gives a big hint about what is happening around.Finally, in lots of scenes but also in general, there are plenty of messages-opinions having to do with modern people's way of living.PS.

Originally Written: May, 22 2013Why is everything in the future layered in white? The tables, chairs, walls, floors, clothing, devices...everything seems to be coated in white when living in cinemas impending worlds. Maybe it's meant to symbolize purity or the coming of cleanliness from a darker, filthier time? Even though most future civilizations, seen through numerous films, have a reputation of wearing elegant masks while hiding the corrosion coursing their veins and suffocating their hearts. Or maybe white is just fashionable.""60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated. Nothing human remains. We're here for drone repair. We're the ""mop-up crew"".The year is 2077 and the planet Earth has been invaded and ravaged by an alien species known as skavs. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a repairman that mends broken and destroyed security drones (that resemble dogs, not in looks but in behavior). These drones protect a number of very large, very valuable machines from the remaining skavs plundering whats left of the Earth. These giant, almost extra-terrestrial looking machines are used to gather the remaining water from the oceans around the globe. Once every drop has been gathered, jack and his ""effective teammate"", Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) will have completed their mission and can then join the rest of humanity on one of the moons of Jupiter, or was it Saturn?

"A Sci-Fi Masterpiece of Love, Memory, and Identity","Oblivion (2013), directed by Joseph Kosinski, is a visually stunning post-apocalyptic action-adventure that continues to captivate even a decade after its release. Starring Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Melissa Leo, the film is set in 2077 on an Earth left desolate by a catastrophic alien war. It follows Jack Harper (Cruise), a drone repairman nearing the end of his mission, whose world unravels when he rescues Julia (Kurylenko), a woman who inexplicably haunts his dreams. This encounter propels Jack into a journey of self-discovery, forcing him to confront the truth about his identity, the war, and his purpose.The film is a masterclass in combining breathtaking visuals, emotional depth, and thought-provoking themes. Kosinski's direction seamlessly blends 1970s sci-fi influences with a poignant love story, exploring the profound connection between memory, identity, and the enduring power of love. The alien tech's attempt to control and replicate Jack and Victoria (Riseborough) ultimately falters because it miscalculates the unbreakable bond between Jack and Julia, a testament to love's ability to transcend even the most insurmountable odds.The cast delivers stellar performances, with Tom Cruise embodying Jack's inner conflict and resilience, while Olga Kurylenko brings depth and warmth to Julia. Andrea Riseborough's portrayal of Victoria adds layers of complexity, and Morgan Freeman's commanding presence as Beech elevates the film further. The characters are well-developed, adding emotional weight to the high-stakes narrative.The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the haunting beauty of a desolate Earth and the advanced alien landscapes with precision and creativity. The story's pacing, combined with a gripping score by M83, keeps viewers engaged throughout, making it a must-watch for sci-fi enthusiasts.Watching Oblivion again after a decade only reinforces its timeless appeal. Its exploration of love as a fundamental force for survival in the universe resonates deeply, making the film an unforgettable experience. It's a story that can be revisited time and again, each viewing revealing new layers of meaning and beauty.Rating: 5/5 stars - Oblivion is a sci-fi masterpiece that combines a compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and an emotional core. A must-watch for fans of science fiction and fantasy, this film proves that love and humanity can outlast even the most formidable challenges.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Effective Team,"In 2077, the earth has been ravaged by an alien race known as the ""Scavs"" which has resulted in the remaining few human survivors having to relocate to the Saturn moon of Titan. To reach Titan the survivors have to get to a space station which eventually transports them. Needing fuel to stay operational, the space station has hired two technicians by the names of ""Jack Harper"" (Tom Cruise) and ""Victoria Olsen"" (Andrea Risebourough) to remain above Earth to maintain the fusion generators on earth and keep them safe from attack by the Scavs. Victoria operates as the communication specialist and relays orders from the space station to Jack who then flies to the surface and repairs the drones whenever they are damaged by the Scavs. Now, while Victoria and Jack manage to operate as an ""effective team"" there is one slight problem with their situation. However, rather than disclose what it is and possibly ruin the film for those who haven't seen it I will just leave it at that. One thing I liked about this film was that for an action movie it still managed to contain a very intricate plot with some big surprises along the way. I also liked the performance of Tom Cruise who continues to shine in one good movie after another. This one is certainly one of those and I rate it as above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"This is why I love movies, cheers TC","I still haven't quite forgiven Tom Cruise for playing Jack Reacher. I've been a Cruise fan for years but that one really, really got my back up. So much so that I have decided not to buy any more Lee child books and was seriously considering boycotting anything with TC in it (oo, get me!). My girlfriend and I though, are both sci-fi fans and we got the Apple TV thing a while back. So access to films through iTunes/Netflix etc is pretty easy. This Oblivion movie came up and I had heard the visuals were amazing etc etc and the trailer I had seen and it looked interesting. But TC is in it. And TC let me down with the whole Jack Reacher thing! So we ummed and aahed and weighed it up and eventually I thought what the hell and rented it. Watched it in bed, and she fell asleep about half way through - not a good sign. She does that a lot though. Problem is that if she falls asleep I have to turn the volume down fairly low, then it's easy to miss important dialogue/plot points etc. And because of that I got a bit confused about two-thirds of the way through, started going on line on my phone to clarify the plot etc while the movie was still playing, got more confused, then turned it off! Amateur! Anyway, we re-watched it next morning. It blew my head off. Stunning, beautiful epic work of a movie. I love it. I can't quite put my finger on why, could be something to do with soul.. ha ha I guess that's the point.

Terrible,"This movie was a utter waste of a Saturday night and $50.00. I love movies and can pretty much look past bad acting as long as it has some good effects. This movie had nothing special, some laser beams, flying golf balls with guns and an upside down floating pyramid. The storyline had you wondering the entire movie, what??? I never in my life fell asleep during a movie twice. I forced myself to wake up, thinking I was missing something only to find out I missed nothing. The only thing I missed out on was a good nap. While I was sleeping I would hear an explosion and wake up instantly thinking ""Oh my god, you're missing the action!! WAKE UP!!"" but when I opened my eyes it would all be over. I asked my wife ""What did I miss?"" only to find her snoring away. I'm shocked this movie has received 7 stars. It should receive 2 stars at most as that's how many famous stars are acting in it. Hollywood keeps wondering why people are stealing their movies online. It's cause they keep putting out junk like this. I'm sure the Tom Cruise fans will love it just because he is in it.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Film well worth watching,"I massively enjoyed this film and is definitely worth watching. Firstly the cinematography was superb and I almost wish they had released an IMAX version. The CGI didn't let it down and was understated and subtle in certain instances, of course most of the film is CGI but it was done well and not used to do ridiculous things, but rather just to make a more immersive film. A realistic portrayal of the world after cataclysmic events.The actors were on top form, some subtle hints as to where the plot would go and a good amount of depth in relationships. It made it believable rather than the, oh yeah everyone loves everyone, and everyone gets on despite differences.....wooo malarky.At first I thought the trailer had given away too much of the plot, I won't say much for the worry of spoiling the film, but the plot is good with a few interesting twists, and very few instant resolutions. The ending is slightly predictable American Theater, but enjoyable none the less.And finally the music fitted in well and was enjoyable. Also very thankful no gratuitous sex scenes? Finally a film that you can watch with family and not shudder at two people performing acts upon one another that a gynecologist would feel uncomfortable doing.Great family sci-fi film.

A Decent Sci-Fi Movie,I quite enjoyed this movie. It was nothing overly original and I guessed some of the twists but even so I did enjoy it. Cruise was good in his role. Some of the others a bit wooden in their acting. The end was a bit cheesy also.

briefly...,"I have developed a loss of confidence in Tom Cruise's ability to entertain me.Jack Reacher was a bit of a snooze so I had low expectations for Oblivion. I did enjoy this film and give it the same rating as Prometheus,7/10. I enjoy sci fi, though not an acolyte ,and this film had enough story to keep me in it, and then some. Tom's age worked for him as he needed to look a bit weathered , but was still a bit too pretty. Where are the ugly guys with acting chops? The ugly men need to be used in Hollyweird to give these films a gritty feel. That is one of the things I like about British TV acting...real people who CAN act.It works on many levels...though I understand why the US film machine relies on household names like CRuise,I still hope for a time when more films use unknown actors who may not fit the typical mold.The whole time Im thinking about Cruise's films, his ageing,his interest in Scientology...this prevents me from being fully transported by a film.

What is considered a good a film to the IMDb masses? Pulp Fiction? Top 10? Lord of the Rings top 10? It was OK.. but top 10? really? Trolls and Hobbits go figure. ""Zombieland"" ranked a 7.8, a movie that I could not finish, filled with cheap Hollywood laughs, typical and as mindless as they come gets a 7.8?

Technologically impressive but lacking in punch and emotion,"I suppose credit is due to a big blockbuster sci-fi that it tries to have interesting ideas and not just effects – the best sci-fi's generally being those with the most interesting and engaging concepts rather than the biggest CGI budget. Oblivion has this in some regards because the setup is engaging (if familiar) and some later developments in the plot add complexity to the mix – but again perhaps not that much. There is potential here but it doesn't really come out or make an impact as it should.The film boasts twists and turns but in the end you've probably seen them all before and they will not surprise too many people with where it goes. What surprised me was how little I actually cared – I was carried along by the familiar noise but I was never really emotionally into it and I felt I really should have been given the plotting. Instead what I was left with was a decent story that is very expensively and impressively delivered. The film looks great throughout, whether it is the base station floating in space or the shots back on earth of a desolate wasteland. The blend between the effect and the real is pretty much seamless and it makes the film more engaging as a result as it is easy to suspend disbelief and join. It is a shame then that so little really gets meat on the bone, whether it is plot or characters.The performances sort of match this because everyone looks great but in terms of what they have to do it isn't so much there for them. I'm no great fan of Cruise but he does have that certain something that holds the attention. He is almost too clean cut and ""movie star"" though, because he is never not Tom Cruise here and he cannot bring out much emotion in himself or from the viewer. Riseborough and Kurylenko both do solid work but generally what I remembered of them was how stunning they were – not how moved I was by their characters. Freeman and Coaster- Waldau and also good in terms of presence but less effective in terms of what they deliver, while Leo has little to do.Oblivion is technologically impressive no doubt , it looks good form start to finish no matter where it is. It doesn't have as much of a heart or brain as it thinks it does though and ultimately the story feels very familiar, which is even more of a problem when some of those films you'll think of are more moving and satisfying than this one.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually Striking but missing something,"Many would agree that the visuals in the film are amazing. As for everything else it's just a mediocre movie that could have been much more.The film in brief, involves Tom Cruise and another companion assigned to drain the earth of it's resources mainly focusing on the oceans and taking the water.A few events take place that makes Tom Cruise question the mission and who he really is.The acting was o.k. from most of the characters and a few weak attempts of humor from time to time. I am not sure why Morgan Freeman is listed as one of the main characters in the movie because he is really only in the movie for a good 15 minutes at best and it really wasn't something that was memorable.If you don't mind watching Tom Cruise in movies then you may enjoy this. Just don't expect much from the movie even though the previews show it as this movie that is action packed. Because of the visuals in the film I would give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It becomes clear early on that this isn't a just another generic action movie looking to make a quick buck, but a film that GIVES A DAMN about itself, its story and atmosphere, its music, everything, and that is all too rare a thing these days. The imagery is iconic and leads to a number of the most beautiful scenes I've seen at the movies in ages.In addition to being a visual triumph, the story blossoms in jawdropping ways. I always try to avoid watching too many ads because they often give away too much, but the way this one unfolded caught me off guard again and again. Cruise does some of his best work ever and the rest of the cast(particularly Olga Kurylenko, who was wasted in the sub-par Quantum Of Solace) match him scene for scene. The beautiful, futuristic M83 score completes the picture.If you're a fan of Moon, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, or video game-wise, Mass Effect, Fallout and believe it or not Bioshock, you'd be very well-advised to check this one out.

Worth your while,"I went to see Oblivion on premier night, and I had no expectations what so ever. But I must say that it was a positive surprise to me. The direction and style in Oblivion is close to flawless. A scene involving a swimming pool, close to the beginning, stands out in my memory as particularly well done - almost a work of art. All the visuals in this film are beautiful and full of imagination. The soundtrack by M83 is spectacular, and reminds me of Mass Effect.The script, sadly, is not so spectacular. It's not so bad as to ruin the movie, but it has some plot holes and predictable outcomes. It also resembles another very creative script, which sort of makes it feel less original, even if the resemblance wasn't due to directly stealing.The acting was okay. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, a good actor, but not a particularly interesting character in this film. Morgan Freeman is good, but the role is small and also not very engaging. Olga Kurylenko is the weakest link, and I didn't find her very believable in her role.

"Horatius once said : "" Can a man die better than on the face of an opposite fate for the ashes of his ancestors and the temples of his gifs?"".","In this pure blockbuster, Joseph Kosinski finds the perfect balance between action and science fiction, suspense and twists!

The special effects are at the top and the sound, the 5.1 is as immersive as without excess, reserving beautiful effects for a soundtrack with appreciable dynamics. If you let yourself be gripped by this cinema and its very refined style, Oblivion may stick to your skin for a long time!

Im starting to believe either people are getting dumber or the church of Scientology is up voting the hell out of this movie. This movie sucks. like 40 minutes into the movie i was bored out of my mind. Seriously nothing really happens till the last 30 minutes of the movie. You can literally tell this story 10 minutes long and it would have been way better than this waste of time. Everything is so cliché' and and all the emotions expressed are just so dramatic for no reason. You don't even get the feel of oblivion in the entire movie. Watch this on a Saturday night if you have nothing better to do and lower your expectations and it will be an OK movie but expect a classic sci fi experience and you will be disappointed.,3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Human-centric 'Oblivion' is anything but,"'Oblivion' is a tale of two halves. The first half sort plays out like 'Wall-E' meets 'Prometheus'. It's initially intriguing, but it quickly becomes a bit dull. And then Morpheus Freeman—wait, did I just say Morpheus Freeman? *Morgan*. Morgan Freeman—shows up, and it gets all twisty-turny. Not much of the twisty-turny makes much sense, but if you just go with it the pay-off is a bit of good old fashioned Hollywood melodrama and my favorite use of the PG-13 F-bomb since Wolverine's cameo in X-Men: First Class.With stunning visuals, a score that evokes Vangelis and Tangerine Dream (In a good way) and solid performances—particularly by Cruise and Riseborough, who have to carry much of the dramatic water for the film—'Oblivion' is a journey worth taking.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Sure, just a big-budget Moon, but also a beautifully shot blockbuster.","I skipped Tron: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski's only other film, as it looked like sensory overload to the extreme. Fortunately, Oblivion is just the right amount. The most striking thing about the film is its beautiful cinematography for such a big blockbuster. Its assortment of muted greys and beiges never get tiring. It presents such a shockingly huge and convincing scale that it's difficult to not spend the whole film marvelling at the scope, especially for a film with such few characters. The sound design and score are built to match too. It's a slow and moody film that often takes itself a little too seriously, but that perfectly suits Tom Cruise. While underdeveloped side characters and cliché conflicts left me cold, the heart of the film is Cruise's protagonist. His dreams and drive keep the film compelling even though he puts his 'everyman' cap on regardless of the context, he makes it work. I don't think Oblivion should be singled out for its lack of originality since in contemporary sci-fi, isn't everything borrowed from the classic archetypes? Oblivion can often be confusing when its mysteries don't make sense and when they're revealed, it does feel like just a big budget Moon but otherwise its execution is perfectly fine for what it is. A pleasant surprise.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What an incredible movie,"From the visuals, through the sound design and fantasy elements, to the characters, it's all fantastic.But like others said, it's a bit too long and slow sometimes. There are plot twists I saw a mile away, and I didn't feel like the ending was as good as the movie seems to want us to think.In any case, those are literally my only gripes. It's well worth investing two hours into this sci-fi, because everything else about it is pretty amazing. And it holds up great even a decade later.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting... but that's all.,"I found it interesting though I cannot say I was truly entertained. If you have the time, it is worth seeing on a stream service or DVD. Feel fortunate you did not pay theater prices for the big screen. The cast is sound, performances are good, and I won't give anything away. This is basically a ""one-trick pony"" on a big budget. Pay attention even so and you will get all of the answers.... Unlike too many reviewers who were still left baffle because of intricacies. So be warned and lower your expectations. Especially if (like me) you have already seen / read SF for over 35 years Take a ride for two hours. Just don't pay anything more to do so than you have to.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Watchable, Convoluted Sci-Fi - Oblivion","This piece of sci-fi reminded me of George Clooney's Solaris, which had as many holes in its plot as this film does. We are asked to swallow a massive amount of highly unlikely scenarios and events in order to arrive at the situation this film puts us in. Tom Cruise is interesting to watch, but he has played this same hero role in about half a dozen of his other films, much like John Wayne used to do in his Westerns. Wayne always played Wayne, and Cruise, the modern John Wayne, always plays Cruise. Earth is invaded by evil aliens who destroy 99% of the earth's surface, but there are pockets of resistance (sounds familiar, doesn't it?). Tom is unknowingly a part of the alien control structure, but we do not know that right away. He is living blissfully with the talented Ms Riseborough, who plays his better half living in the sky as overseers. Their life is fairly blissful, but it is all a lie. His real life is gradually revealed through a series of events, and he must make the choice of staying in bliss land or joining the rebels led by Morgan Freeman, who always gives a believable performance. Although there are several holes in the plot, the film is loaded with excellent production values, and Joseph Kosinski is a talented director. Catch the film on a Saturday morning.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Saw it all before,"Apart from the brilliant visuals and some exciting scenes, I felt this was a big let down.I was expecting more bang for my buck, but it takes a while for it to really get interesting. Cruise tries his hardest to hold the film together, but some of the dialogue sounds like it has been taken from a crappy version of Mars Attacks. It reminded me too much of a number of previous sci-fis(2001-A Space Odyssey springs to mind).The score also didn't suit some of the scenes, and was too-The Dark Knight-y in places,though it worked well for the action scenes. On top of this, you could see the generic ending coming from a country mile, which actually got a few laughs in the theatre I went to. Overall, very disappointing.....except for Olga Kurylenko. That woman could make a wolverine purr.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A really good Sci-Fi flick, beautiful imagery","First, I recommend going to the theater to see this movie because it was made to be shown on a massive screen. I thought it was a really good Sci-Fi flick, good story line, good pacing. My friend and I never once found ourselves board. They did a good job of telling the story. It starts off with the future and throughout the movie you find exactly what happened. Tom Cruise is kind of like a more ""action"" oriented Wall-E. As he and his manager are left to fix the drones that roam the earth. And you know, with any destitute place you always will have a monkey wrench thrown into the mix, but its a really good monkey wrench. Its a gorgeously looking picture and the thing about Sci-Fi vs action for me is that is about, could it be believable.. and I say yes. It has good action scenes in it as well. I compare it to Prometheus and it has better pacing and more action than that movie, although they have about the same scale. I recommend seeing it on a large screen because the scale of the imagery and the job at hand is really beautiful. I saw it on an IMAX screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's Good,"I always hunt for a good sci-fi movies and It was nice to see one more made in Hollywood. It is much closer to the real SCIENCE-fiction than silly movies such as Star Trek, X-Men or Captain America and it's definitely a good thing. But the plot is pretty obvious (if you are a long time sci-fi reader) and you will guess everything right from the beginning. Don't expect something like Space Odyssey, Solaris or even Prometheus it is much less sophisticated.Anyway I give it 7 for the gorgeous picture, good design, good acting, music and some nice details. It is still enjoyable even if you know what's going to happen next.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good watchable movie,"I saw this today on its first day of release If your a big movie buff, you will see some patterns and will easily be able to predict the ending.... But its still worth it. There are so many movies today that are like others,its part of living in the time that we do. Just because you have seen something before does not make you super intelligent and allow you to have a self righteous smugness.Tom Cruise does a good job this time around, he really does, the last thing i saw him in was Jack Reacher and i hated that and i hate most of the movies he makes as i usually see the same wooden performance over and over again,so believe me i am not a Tom Cruise fan-boy by any means. But credit where credit is due, he did a good job. He played an emotional part at the ending and it was quite good.Olga Kurylenko didn't do much , she was okay, and Morgan Freeman was the same as he always is.

Obliviuuuuuuugggh,"Where to begin on this one. Oblivion is a visual treat for the first 45 minutes or so, then I got a little bored of the same thing.What It lacks is dialogue, characters and acting. Olga Kurylenko is lucky she is pretty hot as she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. All she manages to do in this movie is move her eyes and that's not even convincing.If Cruise wasn't leading this shambles this movie would have fallen by the way side and went straight to DVD.I'm a fan of Melissa Leo and what we got to see of her was nothing to write home about.Zoe Bell, who we know for her excellent stunts and balls to the wall attitude was wasted in this role, she did nothing, didn't even speak. Huge let down.My high hopes were trodden into the ground.. flop city. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good Sci-Fi Movie,"Oblivion is a refreshing addition to the Sci-Fi realm. The story is fantastic and it's backed by a great cast. This film was way better than I expected going in. It features some of the best visual effects I have seen in a long time, but it doesn't sacrifice character development or a good story in the process. Oblivion feels like a much more complete movie than the director's last effort, Tron: Legacy, which was pretty much just eye candy. The musical score is also a thing of beauty.Tom Cruise, who is a heartthrob to me, can more than hold his own on screen. Morgan Freeman is always good, even in a tiny role like this. The two female leads also do a good job.The story does get a little confusing from time to time and some of the twists were a bit obvious, but all in all a great viewing experience. I will surely be adding this one to my blu-ray collection. I highly recommend this one for Sci-Fi fans.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great visuals, but let down by lack of emotion","First of all, I would like to congratulate Joseph Kosinski for depicting lovely shots of Iceland with added effects. The landscape is epic, and the stark contrast between the slick, clean Tom Cruise and the barren wasteland is beautiful. Unfortunately, the rest of the film lacks the emotion that the scenery deserved. The lifeless and rather lacklustre performance of Andrea Riseborough as Victoria took away from the film somewhat, and Cruise as Jack Harper seemed like a paycheck for Cruise and nothing more. Morgan Freeman as the leader of the resistance was the shining star of the film, as he usually does, however he was sorely underused, adding a sense of enjoyment to the whole movie for the brief time he was in it. Olga Kurylenko as Julia also was a high point, and possibly the only serious emotional character in the film. The picture could also have explored the mythos of the apocalypse a lot more. Overall I would give the film a 7/10, as the film has a striking visual style that is let down by emotionless performances, a very interesting potential idea but a lack of closure, and under utilisation of possibly fascinating characters. Watch it if you enjoy great visuals, and don't mind a less than substantive plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Oblivion: a well-made, familiar nonetheless, sci-fi film","'Oblivion', Tom Cruise's latest collaboration with director and co-writer Joseph Kosinski who we met from Tron:Legacy, doesn't add much to the sci-fi genre. It rather tends to stay on familiar ground dealing with typical sci-fi topics which we have seen in many other similar productions. However, 'Oblivion' is thought-provoking, engaging and manages to feel disturbingly 'real'; qualities that will probably satisfy many viewers. Add to all this its stunning visuals - courtesy of the new Sony 4K resolution camera - and you have a very interesting movie that hardly disappoints. Overall, I would refrain myself from saying that the film is ground-breaking in any respect but I would definitely suggest it to any sci-fi fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

If 2001 & Moon had a Hollywood love child,"After a war with an alien species, Earth has been left in shambles. Two humans stay behind to help repair drones associated with the extraction of Earth's remaining resources. After some unusual circumstances, one of the team members begins to question his mission and purpose.The ads for this movie reveal nothing, yet reveal everything at the same time. It's an odd feeling going into this film knowing nothing about it, but knowing where most of the story will go. Near the end of the film you'll get this strange feeling that you've seen this all before. Well, you have. While Oblivion tends to borrow a lot of elements from better sci/fi films, it's enjoyable enough to keep your attention till the last scene. Oblivion is basically if 2001: A Space Odyssey and Moon had a Hollywoodized love child, which is both a positive and negative.Tom Cruise plays the hero of this story, Jack Harper. A man given the task of repairing drones that are to protect these vessels that are extracting Earth's water supply. We are told the humans had to leave Earth and are on one of Jupiter's moons. Both Cruise and Andrea Riseborough who plays his female counterpart Victoria have two weeks left of their mission before they can return to the TET. The drones are protecting the vessels from the alien species that attacked Earth. Now the story takes a few twists and turns which will have some people glued to the screen and others scratching their heads. By the end of the film all is revealed and cleared up, I for one appreciated the slow revelations of what is truth and what is fiction.Both Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko show up in the film, I don't wish to reveal their characters or purpose because the mystery is integral to the story, even if it's obvious from the get go. Freeman unfortunately is given very little to do and shows up in only 3 scenes. Kurylenko is given more, but I still wanted more of an emotional draw from her performance. Both Cruise and Riseborough do well in their respective roles. Cruise's character is more concerned with exploration and knowledge, while Riseborough is more by the book and stick to the mission. Both characters are at opposite ends of the same mission. Cruise does well here, as usual. He always gives 100 percent in his roles, which I admire. He manages to balances both the emotional weight and the action needed for this film.Joseph Kosinski is the director, who also gave us the visually stunning Tron: Legacy. Oblivion seems to be giving him more to work with from a story stand point, but the visuals are what will draw you in. Cruise is flying around a destroyed Earth with only little remnants of our history. The sequences of him in his ship are great and Kosinski knows how to handle his action sequences. The sleek design of the ship and use of white everywhere might make you think that Apple is in control in the future, but it's obvious the influences in this film are mainly Kubricks 2001 and the Rockwell mind bender Moon.Oblivion is a decent sci/fi film that makes you ask some questions, while being throughly entertained. While it's not as deep as either of the above mentioned films and feels more Hollwood, it's good enough to recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Highly original post-apocalyptic Sci-fi film.,"It's difficult to come up with an original concept for a post-apocalyptic film these days without resorting to dark, bleak, dystopian visions of the future. Oblivion shows us, successfully and entertainingly, that that is not only way to handle the genre. It succeeds in being brilliant rather than being just another sci-fi film because of the depth of the story. It's a not-everything-is-what-it-appears kind of film, and essential we are drawn into a mystery, in which the chief characters don't even know they are involved. The special effects are spectacular. OK, we know Hollywood can do 'spectacular' at the drop of a hat now, but whereas films like Skyfall and Transformers: Age of Extinction throw endless, gratuitous VFX at the film to try to convince you've seen something good, here they are used to advance the story - rather than the other way around. For me, for a film to be good, it's all about story, and Oblivion is a story you can enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Eye/ear candy with a familiar story,"Another satisfying tale about Tom Cruise the Aging Action Hero discovering himself while kicking some antagonist butt. And of course, a Tom Cruise action story wouldn't be complete without a Hot Love Interest to expand appeal beyond the sci-fi crowd.Yes, clichés are abound in this movie and if you were hoping for a fresh new sci-fi mind-exploder, this isn't it. Instead, the writers have combined many well-accepted sci-fi concepts and thrown them together to produce a lukewarm plot. Anyone who has seen Wall-E, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, The Matrix, and similar movies will notice more than a few things in common between the stories.While the acting is of reasonable quality, the visuals and music are what really stand out. Most of the landscapes, architecture and props (basically the entirely movie) are made with CGI and they are nothing short of breathtaking, thanks to excellent cinematography and other things that no one understands. Nothing fell short in the soundtrack department either, with an excellent combination of futuristic electronic and a sweeping orchestra by Anthony Gonzalez of M83 and Joseph Trapanese.Nothing ground-breaking, but certainly a well-constructed, solid movie in most respects.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Major Letdown,"I just got back from the theater and well...it was bad....really, really, bad. I'm not going to give any spoilers because the plot was so weak that there is practically nothing to spoil...yeah, the movie was that bad. The movie lasts for about two hours and there are only three action scenes. The rest of the movie is just bad acting, corny speeches and pointless scenes; for example the sex scene was okay but what made it ridiculous was the music. The music was probably the only good thing about the movie, but sometimes it would do this random drum chorus that sounded retarded, like during the sex scene and the climax. The script written for the actors was awful, i know Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman did there best, but like The Avengers, good actors don't make a good movie, a good movie needs 1) Awesome plot 2) Awesome scripts for actors 3) Good music, and finally 4) Mind-blowing action/scenery. All of those things are important except maybe the last one. This movie has none of those things. There is a bunch of scenery but almost no action at all. I also noticed nothing new, meaning everything was copied from other movies like the matrix, Predator and even some video games like Portal. If this is the best Michael Arndt can come up with then i am sorry to say this but Star Wars is as good as dead. After watching this lame sci-fi flick i have absolutely no expectations for new Star Wars movies. I mean come on, if Phantom Menace was better than this, which it is by the way, then there is no way Disney's Star Wars films are going to top off the prequels. This movie is only good for one thing; to show the world what a terrible writer Michael Arndt is and why Disney should have nothing to do with Star Wars...period",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Both feature spectacular visuals (this one successfully blends F/X and gorgeous locales). Both have good to great performances from its leads. Sure, Freeman isn't given enough to do, and I was left scratching my head in the second half, and especially at that final shot. But it doesn't deserve the 54% on Rotten Tomatoes.

There are twists and turns throughout the story and it makes for an interesting watch the 2nd time around too when you know more than you should.Oblivion makes you think, it makes you question, and it gives you a few moments that make you take a deep breath and either say ""whoa"" or ""what?!"" The chemistry could have been better between Cruise and Kurylenko and I would have liked to have seen more backstory on the scavs. But all-in-all, it's a fun and futuristic ride that should make your ""I'm glad I watched it"" list.Verdict: Watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They're just unordinary and wonderfully stunning. Watching this film in blu-ray quality is just appealing. The unusual post-apocaliptic depiction, next to the high tech shown presents an unusually working paradox. Story-wise, it is advisable to know as less as possible about the plot. While the movie is really modern, its plot is as good as some of the original 70s-80s films - just maybe with a different pace and surely with different visuals. Cast seems perfect in every way. They didn't need too many actors for this film, and they chose everyone just right for their role. There's not really so musch to be told.

"Not bad, but then again not very good.","Oblivion is a hard film to pin down. so lets do this in two parts - good and bad.First off I would say that the acting performances are solid. Cruise is as good as ever and the supporting cast fill their roles well. Second I would say that the cinematography is rather good also. At some points I found myself wide-eyed, admiring the image on screen. Last but not least I would also say that the overall aesthetics of the film are pretty decent. The design of the world is interesting and eye-catching. The special effects are pretty tip top. All of these elements save the film from being a complete failure.The dark side to this film however lies in it's story, it's narrative. The film is far too long - it has too many acts. The audience is slowly spoon-fed each tiny detail even though is only takes the first 20 minutes (AT MOST) to figure out basically whats going on and what will happen (this isn't helped by the trailer for the film as it reveals too much). There is nothing really hidden in this film for too long (even if you haven't seen the trailer) as you are suspicious of just about everything that the main characters take for granted and (hopefully I'm not giving anything away or *spoiling* the film) you are right to suspect these things. I don't believe this film gives the viewer too much credit. As I have said it is slow. This is not only due to the endless details being spoon-fed but also the relentlessness of the action scenes, where you will find yourself sitting around waiting for the next plot point to come up. It distinctly feels as if the audience is faster than the film and the audience is just not being challenged at all.So, should the film be cast into oblivion? Or does it deserve a chance? Well I would say that it's average. Not really worth paying to see but in a few years if it's on television on a quiet Sunday afternoon maybe watch it and see what you think. If you really like it then fair enough, but in the end you can't really argue that it's much more than a film factory Tom Cruise vehicle - with some sci-fi bells and whistles on it.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is just there,"The movie is more of a sight to see than a riddle job for the inquisitive mind, packed with enough twist and turns that puts you the viewer on a guess frenzy, Oblivion leaves you wondering where the threat is really coming from and whom to trust.With a beautiful sight for sore eyes setting, Oblivion's wonderful scenery and bubble craft will make you sit down and enjoy more of what is happening on the screen, than what the story is trying to pass across. Tom Cruise seems to be in top form, in Jack Reacher (2012) he showed his acting prowess and dominated the film from start to finish, here too he displays the same prowess and even making Morgan Freeman more of a side show to what is happening in the uprising between Tom Cruise character Commander Jack Harper and the alien threat (where ever it was coming from).Oblivion is based on an unpublished graphic novel of the same name by the director and producer Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy 2011). Joseph was able to bring to life his idea and concept, thanks to the 120 million production backing of universal studios. Although I still stand that the movie is a sight to see, it lacks in the area of its story, and it is not that the concept was not nice nor grand the screenplay was just boring at times. Do note they were action scenes to liven the mood, but the length in which you have to wait till the movie truly picks up, maybe worth it for some viewers, and may not for others.The storyline is about what happens 60 years after the earth got attacked by aliens known as Scavs. It focuses on one of the few remaining survivors Commander Jack Harper who was on earth as a drone repairmen. While fulfilling his duty he discovers a crashed spacecraft with happens to contain things that bring to question everything he believed about the war. Soon later he got captured by the said aliens that were still on the earth and he uncovers a truth that rocked his world to his entire existence.In the end I liked the way the movie turned out, it ended in a poetic tone and Tom Cruise's performance may be the greatest thing this movie has to offer other than the beautiful set pieces. So if you are a fan of the Mission Impossible man, then you will sure have fun seeing him here, but my final take is Oblivion could have been better.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Beautiful film, slightly less beautiful plot.","Oblivion takes place in a future where Earth is a desolate wasteland, essentially destroyed by mysterious alien forces. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) – not to be mistaken with Jack Reacher – is a former veteran who has been tasked with farming Earth for it's remaining resources with the 'help' of Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) – that 'help' being staring woefully at a screen.From there, the plot get's pretty damn complicated. Rather than spoiling the story by trying to explain it, it's probably just better to warn you that a headache is waiting for those who are planning on attempting to follow what the hell is going on (and not even the good kind of headache – or the Memento headache, if you will.) It's probably a film that is better the second time around.The performances are competent, nothing really to shout home about. Risebourough is probably the weakest of the pack, giving a performance that would sit a lot better in a Bond film. Morgan Freeman performs his 'Mysterious man with a voice that could cool lava' act with all the usual finesse – although honestly it's a bit of a con him being on the poster, since he only has about 10 minutes of screen time overall.The most notable thing about the film is just how beautiful it is. It really is one of the best looking films in recent years – right up there with Prometheus (Which honestly is the only thing you'd want to have in common with Prometheus.)The film has a fantastic score to go with the brilliant visuals, which makes for a truly epic experience. If you don't feel your pulse raising the damn roof during the ending sequence, then you're probably dead – Killed by a heart attack that was brought on by the sheer intensity of the scene. Either that or you just don't get excited easily. Which is fair enough.The issue here, is that it seems that Kosinki focused too hard on making it look good, rather than making it feel good.The film is 2 hours, which is a fair length, but at times it can feel slow. Really slow. It probably didn't need to be as long as it is, because a lot of the content feels like artificial padding. The first half of the film is basically Cruise farting around on Earth, getting scanned by flying robots and falling down holes.Also, the general story just feels overly-contrived. It's hard to crucify it like it really needs to be without spoiling it, but really it just comes down to the film just trying to do to much. It's spread thinner than a jam sandwich made by someone with a crippling fear of spreading jam. The one good thing to come from it is that we get to see Tom Cruise fist fight himself which is always fun.In all honesty, setting aside the 'quite stupid but still complicated as hell' plot, the film is actually quite good. It's no masterpiece, but it's exciting, thought-provoking, and of course - insanely good looking. So if you're the kind of person who cracks one out to The Tree of Life, then this film is a must-see. If you care more about content, it's still a good film to check out, but it's not going to awe you in any way. Watch with caution though, because this film may be the one that brings to light your extremely debilitating fetish for beautiful cinematography.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Morphing of various dystopian science fiction,"7 of 10. Something like Moon (2009) and Cruise's earlier Vanilla Sky (2001) morphed together, becoming more Moon-like as the film goes on. Outside of a cliché Hollywood ending, it creates a relatively original story and surprises to enjoy. If you have to pick 1 film to watch, go for Moon.The films IMDb recommends at the moment for people who like this are way off. Besides the 2 mentioned, the action in this has a lot of similarities to the action sequences in Star Wars prequels and the barren, desert-like surroundings a lot like the Road Warrior films. Cloud Atlas might also be a good pick.A lot of this film's effectiveness depends on surprises, so avoid spoilers if you want to truly enjoy it as much as possible. On the other hand, you may want to be prepared to switch it off near the end as Cruise's character begins narrating.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Such an underrated film,I remember watching this when it came out in 2013 and loving it. Almost a decade later and it's even better. It's truly an underrated sci-fi movie that even movies in recent years doesn't measure up. So I appreciate just how good it is relative to that.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Okay movie, beautiful special effects","In general post-apocalyptic movies are not my favourite genre. I did enjoy this movie though. The story is okay. There are some annoying holes, like why such and advanced entity needed humans the way it did in the first place, but I have seen a lot worse and it was well implemented overall.The best part of this movie is the special effects though. A lot of the scenery is really beautiful although at times somewhat depressing. The design of the hardware is simply cool. The fact that there is plenty of action is of course also adding to the enjoyment factor of the movie.If you scrutinize each element of the movie individually I guess you can say ""been there, seen that, done that"" quite a few times. I do not think that would be fair though. With the amount of movies made since the dawn of movie making you can always find something that looks similar today. If you look at the movie as a whole I think it felt fresh enough and it did not in any way feel like a rip-off.Sometimes the movie went into slow mode / dream mode but I was never really bored. The balance between action and slower bits where okay as far as I am concerned.Bottom line: A quite enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

one movie but to much movies!,"You want Science Fiction? You have it. You want good (or great) actors? Here they are. In addition, you'll have nice pictures, special effects, and totally futurist design.But if you want something new? Then you will pass What is it with American cinema nowadays? You have some Top Gun Tom Cruise playing the hero type like Armageddon/ Bruce Willis, Olga Kurylenko playing the Ripley part, the ""jackals"" acting like some weirdo from Predators or Star Wars and AI being always questionable in the Terminator way. Have you seen the Star Wars or Matrix pursuits (or even Battlestar Galactica?)? So you've seen them all. Did you look at Neo in Matrix? Then you have some ideas of the costume type. The planet? Some Planet of the Aps...No it's not spoilers, it's basic knowledge! Where is vision?? Cinema vision?What is it with this kind of Cinema? I think that America needs enemy, it's part of it identity (and I'm not judging that): that's why they (screenwriters because I haven't read the comics) have to express some common reality because SF always has been about present time. So, what are you trying to say? That you don't know anymore who's your enemy? But it's always about the same basic idea: showing off because 'I have the biggest one' (I'm talking about guns and size obviously!): shoot first and ask question later seems to be the same appropriate response and I'm tired of that monologue.Yes, there is no dialog anymore in this cinema: it's just a one-way ticket with no substance. Where is optimism or better realism? (light) jokes? Why does it want to appear so serious when it is just empty? You pay for entertainment (and earring you neighbors trying and failing to be discreet to eat!), and you fill yourself with some inappropriate moral because some of us, just being realistic, don't like the ""middle thing"": choice is about extremity because you act upon your belief for some pointless moment.Expectation? Stop!!You can have a good time: just leave your brain and knowledge of SF outside the door!

Solid,"I know that this started as a graphic novel by the director Joseph Kosinski, but it has the feel of a movie adapted from a short story. Instead of cramming in too many characters, we get a solid amount of time dedicated to a smaller number of them. Instead of world building bursting at the seams, we have a simple enough concept fleshed out enough for the story's purposes. This movie has room to breathe, offering a completely self-contained science fiction story that has no need for sequels. It's not perfect, but I can appreciate all of that along with the movie's simple ability to tell a straight-forward story.It's been decades since Earth was attacked by an alien force. Humanity won the war, but they lost the planet which has become a radiated wasteland. They've built water harvesters that are taking the water from the ocean and turning it into energy. Guarding these harvesters from the remnants of the alien force, the scavengers, is a pair of humans, Jack Harper and Victoria Olsen. She mans the tower, communicating with the Tet, an orbiting space station and waypoint for the last of the humans on Earth before moving on to the established colony on the Saturn moon Titan. Jack maintains the flying drones that protect the harvesters.Now, I will say that this movie starts wrong. There's an extended voiceover from Tom Cruise's Jack that explains all of that in precise detail, and it feels like something added after a test screening where some people filled out cards saying that they were confused slightly in the beginning. Better to have Cruise explain everything right up front rather than help build a sense of mystery. That explanation robs the opening of a certain sense of discovery that it would otherwise have. Maybe the voiceover was planned from the beginning, I don't know, but it's a mistake nonetheless. That most of it gets repeated, word for word, later in the film to another character, tells me that it was added in later.Anyway, aside from that voiceover, the movie begins really well. Jack has to find two downed and missing drones. He fixes the first, giving us a view of the destruction of the world, his sense of the past that he was never a part of, and the danger of the drones that nearly kill Jack as soon as the first gets resurrected. The second one is hidden in a sink hole that leads to a library. Jack goes down alone into the dark only to find that it's the drone's transponder, not the drone itself, that is hidden below, and he gets attacked by the scavengers. Saved by the drone he just fixed, Jack picks up a book (Lays of Ancient Rome by Thomas Babington Macaulay), and makes it out again, heading back home.Jack's been questioning his role in everything, why they have to abandon the planet even though they won, but Victoria just wants to follow the regulations. The source of his difference is probably that he found a refuge away from the tower. It's a green oasis in the middle of the brown devastation, hidden from radar where Jack has built a small home by a lake. Filling it with trinkets he finds in his travels, like a King Kong doll from the top of the Empire State Building that sticks out of the ground, he has a refuge from the clean lines of the tower and the dangers out in the wild. He's also haunted by visions of New York before the war, before he could have been born, and a woman he doesn't know.Everything changes when the scavengers emit a beacon from the top of the Empire State Building, bringing down a ship in orbit that crashes nearby. Jack goes to investigate, against orders from Sally in the Tet, and discovers several humans in cryo-sleep pods. Soon after he arrives, the drone arrives and starts blasting the survivors in their pods, Jack barely able to save one, filled with the woman from his visions. This is Julia, and she seems as shocked by the people in front of her as the world around her, and the reason should be easy enough to glean from anyone with a bare understanding of how stories are put together. There are particulars that probably can't be guessed, but it's obvious enough that Jack is Julia's husband in some capacity. That this is so easy to guess undermines some of the middle section because the movie, while giving up so much mystery in the beginning with its voiceover, has little mystery left and this point is so easy to figure out that there seems to be a hole. Really, that opening voiceover was a mistake.Julia ends up the source for a lot of the movie's second half reveals, but it's Morgan Freeman's Beech that offers up the most. He is a human on the planet, one that Jack thinks is a scavenger until he's captured by them, given the opportunity to destroy the Tet which goes against everything Jack has known for his entire memory, the past five years. It's when Victoria, concerned at Jack's increasingly erratic behavior and finally broken by the obvious bond between him and Julia, tells Sally that they are no longer an effective team that the Tet makes itself known to Jack, turning on him and convincing him to help.Now, there's one more piece of mystery that gets added late, and I think this is a mistake. Jack gets allowed onto the Tet by bringing Julia with the promise that they will be a more effective team. However, it turns out that Jack didn't bring Julia, he brought Beech and a bomb to blow up the Tet. We know the bomb is there, but the switch of personnel is kept a mystery from us, and I don't really see why. The point should be that Jack is lying to Sally to get in to explode the bomb, which is there, but the addition of the idea that Julia is in the sleep pod that the audience is supposed to carry on actually undermines the amount of tension in the scene. Jack wondering if he can get through with not only a bomb but the wrong person adds to that tension. Hiding that was a mistake.There's a late moment in the confrontation with Sally that I unabashedly love. Jack quotes some of the Lays of Ancient Rome to Sally, namely from Horatius' speech where he says, ""How can a man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temple of his gods."" Sally then replies, ""I created you Jack, I am your god."" That's such an awesome line, well established early by the introduction of the book and the specific lines of text and delivered wonderfully nastily by Melissa Leo as Sally's voice.The design of the movie is clean with a wonderful tower set that utilized massive projectors to create a very natural feel without any compositing in post-production. The combination of super advanced futuristic design with the grungy futuristic design of the underworld humans is well done. I wish some minor changes had been made to help enhance the film, but with each viewing I end up enjoying this more and more. This is a solid science fiction tale, well acted, well designed, and well told. It's not great, and it could have been more than it is now, but it's solidly good.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, but neither unique or exceptional.","While visually arresting and primed with action-sequences, ""Oblivion"" compromises its technical accomplishments with a disheveled script that helps itself liberally from numerous science fiction films. That being said, that doesn't mean that much of it's audience won't find this fairly engaging and entertaining. Tom Cruise returns to the realms of science fiction, collaborating with director Joseph Kosinski ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010), in a big screen adaptation of his unpublished graphic novel.Like a great deal of science fiction films, ""Oblivion"" requires a lengthy prologue in order to contextualize the viewer to the imaginative world they are being introduced to. In this case, that world is actually our own, just not at all like we know it. In 2077, 60 years after an alien invasion triggered a nuclear war that decimated the planet, the human race has all but abandoned Earth for Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, one of the last few drone repairmen stationed on an Earth which has been abandoned for years following decades of war with a group known as the Scavs. Along with his wife Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), they maintain the fleet of drones, protecting the earth from the threat of the Scavs. Yet, when a series of drones go down, and a spaceship crashes with a beautiful survivor Julia (Olga Kurylenko) on board, Jack finds his life changed forever as everything he knows, (or thinks he knows), is blown apart.""Oblivion"" is an incredible piece of visual sci-fi eye candy; sleek, a wonderfully realized world of day-after-tomorrow style technology, including some brutally intense fight sequences. It's one of those films that demands it to be watched on the biggest screen you can possibly find. The world ""Oblivion"" paints is certainly a striking one, but the emptiness that now dominates the planet inevitably also permeates throughout the picture itself. This is the underlining problem with ""Oblivion."" The movie comes off as merely a derivative of other well-done, successful science fiction films. So much creativity went into the visual design that apparently little was left when crafting the plot. The movie liberally borrows from ""WALL-E"" (2008), ""Total Recall"" (1990), ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), and ""Moon"" (2009), that it often veers dangerously close into lawsuit territory.""Oblivion"" is admirable in its look and style, but the film is not unique or exceptional. It holds its own as the mystery initially plays out, and you do find yourself drawn in, but as the pieces begin to slot together, you can't help but feel you've seen it all before. Like the drones — and Cruise himself — ""Oblivion"" is competent, durable, and undeniably mechanical.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Oblivion is a letdown and feels cold to the touch,"Oblivion is a letdown to say the least. Since my colleague Moore reviewed it for the site, I was able to catch it and just watch it like a normal movie lover. Going in I was hoping for a riveting science fiction blast of entertainment because I like Cruise and he doesn't waste our time with his work. I left trying to understand what happened to a solid idea for a film? The biggest problem with the film is it carries ZERO payoff. Sure, we get an answer(somewhat) to Harper's riddle and his struggle and find out what exactly happened to him before the earth was obliterated, but in the final moments a sweet little bow-tie is placed on the film and it sinks the film deeper in muck. The climax is disappointing and the resolution is downright corny and second rate. When in doubt, Hollywood screenwriters resort to a failsafe tactic in their writing and here they did it again in a manner of speaking. Oblivion starts off hot, starts to die slowly and ends with a thud. Cruise is an underrated actor and usually nails his roles(you don't have 12 straight 100 million dollar grossing films and 3 Oscar noms for no reason) but here he is miscast in the role and brings the movie down. Freeman just kind of shows up and spits out inspirational jargon. The women's parts are very underwritten. Worst of all, the film has no soul. No emotional impact. If it had half the heart and soul of Derek Cianfrance's A Place Beyond The Pines, the result may have been more worthy. As it is, Oblivion is a disappointing stinker which may deserve a look on DVD or a late night stop on cable. Next up....Pain and Gain.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Pleasant Sci-Fi Film but falls short of Legendary Greatness,"To the person that wrote ""Entertaining but no way a Masterpiece.."" - I couldn't agree more.Just like Prometheus, The vast landscape scenery at beginning and throughout is marvelously breathtaking, and can easily distract us from its major flaws. While the majority of the story made sense, I found the plot rather flat and disjointed with many parts hardly explained. Much about the command center remains unclear with the cloning scene not fully explained. Even though the cloning scene and others are an influenced by other Sci-Fi works that doesn't mean they don't need to be fully explained (What about those who do want many other Sci-Fi epics?). Most disappointingly though, Oblivion does not bring any unique element to the table, it does not carry its own legend - and thus is not a Masterpiece.As for the acting, quality varied throughout the cast. Cruise carried Jack Harper well to the end, and the same goes for Morgan Freeman (in fact, I understand when someone says that Oblivion was a waste Freeman given his flat plot in such a shallow plot line). Kurleyenko however, was only disappointing; even with a flat character lead she hardly her face was emotionless most of the time.Even with the beautiful scenery and well-filmed shots, Oblivion and other Sci-Fi films should not be excused from adequate plot and character development.

Game of drones... And often confusing,"Usually, I am not much into sci-fi movies, especially when there is fight against technology or vicious creatures not in the know they are doing. On the other hand, I can't remember Tom Cruise performing in a total rubbish... His performance was good again, but the over-sophisticated plot was unclear to me at times (later, I had to read the plot overview to get all things straight). And sophistry on soul, love, memory, power, eternal life, misuse of technology etc. have been exploited in similar movies too many times. True, the sci-fi stuff (incl. battled scenes) was visually catchy and all supporting actors gave good performances, but the movie was too much focused on Jack Harper's character and the approach of topics mentioned above was sometimes too plain and obvious. And I found many similarities with movies like Solaris or Moon.Oblivion was okay, but currently I do not think I will watch this movie again in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion- A Science-Fiction Hodgepodge of Borrowed Ideas that Finds Strength in Visual Atmosphere and Confident Acting,"Science-fiction in film used to be the genre for exploring unfamiliar terrain relating not only to imaginative worlds but also in expanding our moral and contemplative horizons relating to the human experience. However, it seems science-fiction has become a comfortable excuse for only inventing visually captivating sets and technologies for repetitive action sequences instead of utilizing new worlds to widen our gaze into conceptual territory that has relation to our modern existence. This typical laziness can be witnessed in director Joseph Kosinski's sophomore film Oblivion which focuses on creating the architecture of the world rather than worry about the purpose of the structure and substitutes original storytelling for a hodgepodge of stolen plot devices from better executed and more intelligent science-fiction films from the past. Kosinski is known for his resurrection of Disney's groundbreaking cult film Tron with his stunningly visual yet overly stimulated sequel Tron: Legacy and though he repeats his aptitude for captivating visuals they are still inundated by a lack of original foresight by screenwriters Karl Gajdusek, Michael Arndt, and Kosinski himself. Leave it to a renowned commercial director to transform contemplative highbrow science-fiction narrative elements from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Duncan Jones' Moon, and Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker into mere George Lucas inspired mindless space opera. Though Oblivion might be an inferior clone of familiar territory there are some entertaining qualities not only in the visual atmosphere but also in its admirably confident first half before it loses grip on its own unnecessarily convoluted reveals of influences. As an action film Oblivion suffers from its longwinded pauses and as an intriguing science-fiction film it suffers from an overstated sense of self just creating a newer model that we've all seen before. Kosinski does indeed prove that he can entice our imaginations with a lavish immersion into a full dystopian reality but doesn't have the compelling storytelling capabilities to match his visual inventiveness.Read more on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-xI Other reviews: Generationfilm.net",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A stunningly beautiful, mind twisting sci-fi thrill-ride. Just don't watch trailers.","As I said, the biggest problem with this movie is the fact that trailers ruin so many other-wise completely unexpected plot twists. And since I advised you to stay away from those, I feel like it's my duty to tell you what you need to know about the film before going into it. Here we go. Earth got invaded by aliens, we won the war by ruining it with nukes and now we are getting ready to leave it and Tom Cruise's character Jack Harper, who is one of the last few people still on Earth, is tasked with defending the final stages of preparation of our departure. That's it. Very briefly that's all you need to know.This movie does have a slow build-up, introducing you to our two main characters of Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough, followed by a mind-blowingly beautiful reveal of the world they live in and their job in it. Immediately you can tell that something is not right in this world, that there is something greater going on and I adored this aspect of the film. You also get to see some cool action sequences that mainly introduce you to the so called scaves, the renegades of an alien army that attacked us.Now it's time to talk about by far the best thing about this film. Cinematography and visual effects. They. Are. Mesmerizing. The gorgeous desolate wasteland in an awe-inspiring wide shots (often notably shot in camera) and completely seamless CGI make Oblivion one of the most beautifully looking films I have seen in my life. Let me emphasize this... CGI is completely seamless. There are so many instances where I just can't tell if what I'm seeing is real or visual effects. When the CGI is so good that you can't tell that it's CGI, that is praise-worthy. There is always that one shot that makes you go ""oh, that's CGI"". There is not a shot that is even remotely close to that in Oblivion. Same goes to Cladio Miranda, once again proving that he is one of the best cinematographers we have.The structure of the story is so that you can learn and discover new things about the past and the events taking place prior to the world's desolation through flashbacks and this is where we get to my one very slight problem with the film. Though these flashbacks are very meaningful, they sometimes take you by surprise, often during a sequence that you were already really sucked in. But they by no mean break the immersion or hinder the storytelling, is just that they often happen when you didn't expect them. This is the only reason this film doesn't get 10 out of 10.Also, if you ever feel that other characters besides Tom Cruise are kind of underdeveloped just wait until the grand reveal that wonderfully concludes the film, while leaving a good number of thing ambiguous.Oh, and yeah, the score for the film from M83, huuuhhh... wow.Overall I adored this film, it's one of the best looking film I've seen, pristinely directed, well acted, mind bending, meaningful... and it leaves us wondering what will be the next visual treat we get from Joseph Kosinski.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Totally oblivious to the audience,"Did you see great visuals on TV? That's why this film gets the 3 stars I'm giving it. When it comes to story line, you've seen this before 1,000 times but much smarter in other films. I had no idea that this was based on a graphic novel, more like a bad comic book. By the end, it was clear that this film was made for idiots who can check their brain in at the entrance and worship the man name Cruise who was on Cruise Control.For some reason I allowed myself to pay to watch Cruise try to play 6 foot 6 inch Jack Reacher a few months ago. Bad idea. Gave him one last chance and came in with an open mind. The opening scene is a little murky. You're not quite sure what to make of it. Great visuals, the explanation given by Cruise is hokey, something is off but you just go with it. In short, he and his female companion are supposedly the last remaining people on earth with a job to do before they are ready to join the rest of the others in 2 weeks on Saturn. They are a clean up crew, maintaining drones that kill the alien ""scavengers"" on the planet and extracting water/minerals.Gratuitous CGI, which is done pretty effectively, leads us to the first immediate problem. When Cruise pulls out a New York Yankee hat while reminiscing about a football game, you can't help but think ""perhaps the worst and conspicuous choice of product placement I've ever seen."" From that point on, while you want to figure out some of the mystery, you're loath to admit that this script has silly holes in it the size of Saturn.Now I've seen worse but the middle and ending are very disappointing because the twists are not only predictable but so many remind you of other films. And they are also very awkwardly managed. With each twist you keep begging the film to come up with a better answer for these oddities. And as the film plods along, they are unsatisfactory.This is a good free on cable movie, not worth spending money in the theater. As a rental, be prepared for disappointment.

"some good, some bad","""Oblivion"" is one of those movies thats hard to review without writing a spoiler. I'll have to be careful...OK, lots of people have written reviews here complaining about how this movie is a rip off of so many other Sci-Fi movies like 2001: a Space Odyssey, Tron, The Matrix, Blade Runner, Wall-E, Independence Day, etc. So maybe thats the bad news. But the good news is that all of those movies were good movies, so at least here you can count on Oblivion NOT being trashy like the Alien series, etc. I mean thankfully, we have Tom Cruise, and playing a role too in which he must confront and understand his own existence almost like Bruce Willis had to do in ""The Sixth Sense"". So you will be forced to think a little bit, but it shouldn't take Sci-Fi veterans that long to get the catch. We've been down this road too many times now.Anyway, Tom plays Jack Harper, a technician entrusted with maintaining power generating equipment and drones on a post apocalyptic earth. Who he actually works for is for you to figure out. Who Jack Harper really is is also for you to figure out, as well as for Jack, who is not really all there mentally. Now, IF Jack can remember whats been wiped from his memory, and many are counting on him being able to do that, he may be able to save earth from the aliens that wrestled control of it from humanity. There is still time, but only if a secret plot intended to bring him to his senses works. Thats the story, anyway.OK, but is this enough to carry the film? Its a very lonely place where Jack works unfortunately, and we must first suffer through a pretty dull opening 45 minutes before anything really interesting happens. Here he is paired up with a beautiful assistant (Andrea Riseborough) but with virtually NO other support structure which is bizarre. So of course they make love. There seems little else to do and no one is watching anyway. But I found all of this boring and tedious. Meanwhile Jack stalks the planet like a Swat team member. Looking for what? Scavs? What are they doing there?Slowly, a plot does begin to unfold, though, and soon nothing is as you thought it was in the beginning. Meanwhile, we've got some nice but not earth shattering cinematography to enjoy, an atrocious music score to listen to, and not a whole lot in the way of dialogue from anybody thats not military-talk. Yawn........Oh, and there are these drones with those blinking red eye-lights.Eventually though, the minimalistic plot a la 2001: a Space Odyssey turns existential when a spaceship with mysterious cargo crashes and we get to scratch our heads a lot. Meanwhile, I like the flashbacks to NY and the ""oasis"" which was green, but inexplicably so given the seeming absence of any other life on the planet. I kinda don't have a clue as to how the shack and all that memorabilia got there, so it was almost like a dream. Maybe it was. Maybe it wasn't real at all, but a state of mind, like an eden. Jack visits the shack early on like a man returning to his childhood. Without his memories, though, what draws him there? Some strange attraction he will eventually come to understand, I guess, and a garden of eden and rebirth it will prove to be ultimately.So, but thats about all I can reveal though, and you will have to see the movie to find out what really happens. I can tell you though that Jack does fall in love, or re-falls in love, which reacquaints him with his human side. Its a love kind of like in ""Avatar"" - a dual ""love of woman/love of nature"" kind of love. And of course, from there, just like in Avatar, we go right to the battle which climaxes the movie.So yeah, its a rehash - I admit it. Avatar mixed with 2001: A Space Odyssey mixed with Independence Day mixed with Wall-E, etc. I'm glad that we never got to meet any real aliens though, which turned out to be one of the interesting little twists in the story. But overall, all of that thought provoking mystery surrounding Jack and his love and his past doesn't quite make up for the fact that so much of this movie is predictable visually, musically, and technologically. Morgan Freeman gives us his usual nice performance, but otherwise, we don't get much insight into the folks that he leads. Their plight? Their pain? Not really revealed, unfortunately. And lastly, ANY movie who's main character's name is ""Jack"" is going to dredge up memories of Titanic for me and WILL YOU PLEASE STOP REPEATING THAT NAME and calling it out over and over again!JACK!........JACK!........Call him Clarence and maybe you won't feel so compelled to cry out.Thank you....",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not so superb as expected, story telling fails it all.","Scenery is excellent, Computer graphics are stunning, and acting was solid. But movies are not just about actors and scenes. It should have an attractive story to support it. And storytelling should be done well, this is what Oblivion failed to do.Oblivion spends too much time (probably half the movie) as an introduction. By the time 90% of the audience got the point, it kept on going and going.And there are so many plots which do not make a very good sense, I won't point them out, you can see them by yourselves.However, Oblivion's world of Sci-Fiction is very pleasant if you are a fan of sci-fiction, although it was quite a surprise to see a motorbike with two wheels.Overall, a decent movie with stunning CG and actors,but no where close to be a superb movie.**Don't expect too much action scenes either!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A potpourri of sci-fi classics with gorgeous visuals and sounds,"This was a gorgeous movie filled with amazing cinematography and soundtrack. However, watching this movie, one cant help but feel a sense of dejavu. You have seen it all before. Its kind of amalgamation of great science fiction classics. Maybe the director was giving an intentional nod to some of them. There are even some obvious plot holes. At no point in the movie are you really rooting for one side as the two sides become clear only at the end when the outcome is a forgone conclusion. Overall an enjoyable movie filled with some twists at the end though it lacked the novelty and wow factor thereby, failing to really engross or immerse you.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion - Unique sci-fi movie with a unique title. Deserves a watch! (NO Spoilers!),"Tom Cruise is one of my favourite actors. And he collaborating with Joseph Kosinski for OBLIVION makes it even more exciting as I was extremely impressed with Joseph's debut directorial- 'Tron Legacy' which I missed watching on the big screen. So I had to watch OBLIVION in a theatre for sure.I won't write any spoilers because otherwise it won't be a must watch film. Oblivion is a sci-fi fantasy with full on suspense, thrills and the sci-fi part is just the vessel carrying the story with an emotional core that has a beautiful connect to the audience. It gives out a loud message that no matter how hard we try to be like practical machines in the modern era, we are still only humans with feelings.The cast is small but effective. Tom Cruise as Jack Harper is as usual a brilliant protagonist and gives the film a replay value. But its my personal wish to see him for a change in a complete drama, romance or a historical epic again. (like Vanilla Sky, Jerry Maguire and The Last Samurai). Andrea Riseborough gives some steamy scenes with Tom, specially the unique swimming pool scene is to look out for, which is aesthetically shot. I found her performance far better than Olga Kurylenko (the ex Bond girl). Morgan Freeman in his brief role is memorable.The cinematography & VFX shots are spectacular. Reminds me a bit of 'Prometheus' which is good in a way and adds to the realism of the plot. The 'shattered moon' shown in the sky is a brilliantly creative example of the visual effects.The story is quite unique though I wish the duration could have been decreased and the climax could have been more interesting than it is. Some amazing futuristic gadgets are shown in the movie like Jack's ship and his cool bike which are visually appealing on the big screen.I can't forget to praise the amazing sound and background music. Tron Legacy's soundtrack is already a hit and Joseph Kosinski made sure this was no less. He as a director has shown excellence again and Oblivion is entertaining enough to question that this was his second movie only! Really impressive.Oblivion is a good movie, a commendable attempt for bringing an air of freshness in sci-fi genre, even though it falls short to be a masterpiece. Must watch experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Brilliant non-typical Sci-Fi film,"NO SPOILERS AT ALL!Firstly, I want to point out that the movie might have been long but I enjoyed every second of the movie and it was not a drag at all. There is no other way that would have made a perfect movie like this better.The film shows 2077 Earth, an Earth crushed by war. I strongly believe that no other film has more brilliantly shown the Earth after Apocalypse. Cinematography and Visual Effects are stunning, leaving even the most ""scientific"" person awestruck.But, what makes this Sci-Fi so different? The fact that this movie has HEART. Its not just people fighting other people or things throughout. Its about Emotion, Suspense and Action when needed. I loved the fact that this wasn't another stupid action filled movie with bullets and people flying about.Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough have never acted so well and they just make the film a blissful experience. Their chemistry is just perfect.I have seen the likes of Inception and I promise you that this movie is at par with all of them, even better sometimes. You don't wanna miss this one. The movie is so awesome that it even makes the non-believers start believing.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"So much potential, but.......","This movie frustrates me.The special effects are OUTSTANDING. Seriously amazing. It also features several very popular and very good actors.But the plot is just terrible. A decent broad idea, but still a terrible plot. ""Plot"" is a strong word--it's more of a series of twists just to keep you on your toes, nothing really happens, and there's very little character development. There aren't even the classic elements of a plot, you know, with a rising action, climax, etc. Which is sad because of the potential that the creative and amazing special effects and all-star actors give.It's worth seeing once, just for the effects, but set your expectations low and know that it might upset you.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not worth watching for,"OK... Today I saw this movie in a pre-release thanks to a couple of invitations that we received. I would like to begin saying that I wanted to like this movie and don't misunderstand me... It had potential but... 1. The movie is incredibly slow. There are not so many action scenes and all of them could be seen in the trailer. 2. It has a couple of original twists but the major part of the movie is 100% predictable and uninspiring. 3. CHEEEEESSSYYY!!! I'll never understand how after spending such big budget in heavy special effects & good actors, the script could be so full of clichés and cheesy dialog. Tom Cruise does his best to portrait the character, but again the uninspiring dialog ruins it. Morgan Freeman... Was he even in this movie?¿ Well... He does not appear too much. In fact I would give it a 5. Had potential but a series of wrong decisions made it absolutely forgettable. My recommendation: Wait until it's released in Blu-ray / DVD and rent it. If not... Wait for the TV.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
epic,"Personally, I don't really like Sci-fi movies, i loved this one though. Epic storyline, really pulls its audience more and more into the movie. It did get boring at times, I felt as though some of the events were really slow-paced, but really great overall. The visuals were stunning, gave out a really nice theater experience, acting was pretty much flawless, really enjoyed it as a whole. The thing i liked about it the most though is how it gets your attention and holds on to it for the whole 2 and a half hours or so. How the events make you think and wonder about what the hell is going on, twisting the storyline at some points making it totally unpredictable, not a lot of movies can do that. So yeah, in a nutshell, i really enjoyed this movie, didn't include spoilers so those who haven't seen it could read this, get up and watch it. I strongly recommend Oblivion to whoever likes a good theater experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion: Sci-Fi Nerd Heartbreaker.,"I'm sorry sci-fi nerds - and I use the term lovingly - this is another fascinating fictional world marred by its big-budget aim on audiences other than yourselves. Based on the graphic novel of the same name and creator, Oblivion is a plausibly constructed sci-fi world, even if it lacks the intrigue it was aiming for. Jack Harper (Cruise) and his companion, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), have been commissioned by the human race to defend energy generators from Scavengers: an alien race that have lost the war for Earth, but remain in covert pockets across the globe. Supposedly, Earth was rendered inhospitable for humans and the surviving population has taken refuge on a monumental space station. There are issues with the premise and the world Joseph Kosinski has crafted here. The film's dreary progression fuels your skepticism, instead of placating it. The final reveal does settle most logical qualms and leaves a comfortable amount of ambiguity, even if you've completely checked out halfway through.In it's strain to bend your mind, the film goes on to twist itself into oblivion, blending up common sci-fi elements and not-so-subtly referencing the classics. But it does so far too slowly, drawing attention to inconsistencies and implausibilities and attempting to shift your focus to character development. Unfortunately, even weaker still are the human elements in the film; characters who fit neatly into their linear roles and actors who play them with mind-numbing simplicity. As always, Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. There isn't a role in which he's 'playing' quiet or brooding that doesn't make you wish he would retire. Oblivion is no exception. Jack Harper is simply an American guy and that's about all you can bring yourself to care about. Even Morgan Freeman playing Morpheus isn't enough to make you sympathise with the human race. The narrative is actually engaging and it's a crying shame the structure of the film simply leaves nothing to grasp to.Technically, Oblivion is a step up from the visual brilliance of Tron: Legacy. Kosinski's reliance on CGI is saved by its complete cohesion with the actors and thankfully, you won't see any awkward renderings of Jeff Bridges wondering through the frame. The film is visually ambitious, certainly, but it doesn't go all Matrix: Reloaded and try too much. The post-apocalyptic landscape is actually beautifully shot and the film offers wonderful sweeping shots of mangled landmarks against foreboding mountain backdrops, drawing just enough attention to itself to dilute the film's sedative side-effects.Oblivion refuses to strap on its spectacles and delve into the finer details of its own world. Whether due to a heavy studio presence or simply due to Kosinki's own insecurities, this is a film fascinating enough to make you wish it was far more absolute. The first Matrix is an archetypal sci-fi and did everything I wish Oblivion had. It was ballsy enough to lecture you for an hour about its rules and only then reward you with snippets of ingenious action. It never got bogged down in drip-feeding intrigue or caught in the attempt to be anything else. Oblivion, while containing merit, is disappointing.*Piece also appears on http://telaveev.blogspot.com.au/",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A beautiful and sophisticated sic-fi blockbuster, with a hint of blandness...","Referencing to the Tom Cruise canon, Oblivion is a stronger effort than Jack Reacher. Mr. Cruise can still make taking down the bad guys look cool, however this is not his finest hour yet it is far from his worst.Oblivion has an eerie and beautiful feeling in regards to the scenery and visuals. The whole production design was sophisticated and had a crisp feel to it. Overall however, I feel that Oblivion had the potential to be a strong outing for Joseph Kosinski yet the third act did not deliver. The film starts out as a simplistic and imposing, Jack Harper (Cruise) feels a strange connection with planet earth and has doubts about migrating to Titan with Victoria (Riseborough) How the film dealt with Harper's connection with a planet lost from the grasp of hope and life allowed me to engage with the film. Yet, the second half of the film felt like it escalated at a quite rapid pace and the conclusion felt slightly rushed. Oblivion should have stayed with its personal and raw approach rather than levelling it up to a hashed conclusion.The action is not being criticised, but it should have been dealt with a more steady pace. Apart from that, Oblivion is a decent sic-fi which does provide some form of excitement. Focusing on the positives, the soundtrack gave Oblivion a sense of depth and the potential for the film to be epic.Oblivion is far from a disaster, it's just failed to reach for the heights of an epic sic-fi blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than the critics say,"This film is a feast to the eyes for every SciFi fan around the world. Kosinski once again showed us that he is one of the most visionary directors in Hollywood. After two movies. The visuals are stunning and the huge camera pans over the landscapes show Iceland in all its beauty. Yes, there is a place on earth which really looks like this. Most of the landscapes were no CGI, they were real. The set design is interesting as well. Very sterilized, clean but high-value. This also counts for the design of the bubble ship, which every helicopter fan would love to fly with.M83 and Trapanese made a fantastic soundtrack which fits to the film perfectly and even is very enjoyable when listening to it separated. It differs from TRON Legacy in its style. The electronic elements are far more in the background, the orchestra is more in the front. Which is fine, despite the fact that the theme / melody is not as catching as the TRON Legacy main theme. Other than that, M83's score is on par with Daft Punk's work and I hope this time, the score will be a candidate for the award season.The story is good as well. First of all, it is better and quicker and with less slow-downs in it than the TRON script. The SciFi elements are nice and interesting and everything is explained within the movie though some are clearly SciFi and only make sense within the movie's logic. Some questions however need to be interpreted by the audience. The film wants the audience to think about it after the movie is over. Which seems to be a problem for film critics. ""Needs more than 1 brain cell? That's a PLOT HOLE!"" In fact, there are no plot holes if you just pay some attention to what's going on.The action sequences do their job quite well. The camera is not as shaky as in other action films in recent history and the sequences are well paced and well positioned during the 2 hours length.The plot has a lot of references to older SciFi classics (those critics interpret them as rip offs, which is not true). However, the film still has its unique feeling, although you can pick out every reference quite easily. For me, the final climax is no rip off. It is just a huge tribute to one of the most iconic SciFi films of all time.The characters are above average, though some actors could have done a better job. Some emotional scenes do not add up because of the very 'dry' acting.Oblivion is better than Tron Legacy for me and I hope the film will become a success despite the unfairly bad reviews by ""top critics"".Shame on the (american) film critics who only seem to be able to bash Tom Cruise and the 'full-of-tributes' plot. This film is way better than its Rotten Tomatoes score. It is a great, not perfect start to the 2013 blockbuster season and one of the best SciFi films in the past years.Visuals 10/10, Soundtrack 9/10, Story 8/10, Characters / Actors 8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What were the critics smoking? Oblivion is amazing!,"What an incredible movie. It's really almost impossible to review it in any detail without giving away spoilers but I will say this, Oblivion is one of my favorite science-fiction films of all-time. It isn't over the top, it doesn't try to do too much, it just relies on fantastic acting thanks to protagonist Jack Harper, played by Tom Cruise, along with a fantastic supporting cast and a story that is absolutely amazing. The plot developed at a perfect pace for the environment and created a setting that felt genuine throughout. The only flaw was that there were some elements left unexplained, but then again it is a sci-fi movie so it doesn't take too much from the experience. I don't understand why so many critics slammed this movie but they do tend to like weird, artsy fartsy garb and dislike anything resembling a well-made action film. While this movie didn't have much action, it seems like it does from trailers so don't expect a gung-ho modern shooter or anything. If anything, it feels more like a Matrix style film in terms of pace. Regardless, I've said as much as I can say without revealing too much.

Visually Stunning-Opprtunities,"Cruise has made a career of swinging between his MI franchise and some strong science fiction films with the high water mark being Live Die Repeat (Edge Of Tomorrow).This film features excellent effects and great visuals. Cruise is as effective as ever, and Morgan Freeman adds his trademark gravitas.The problem lies with both female leads. Riseborough as Vika delivers an extremely subdued and restrained performance and provides zero chemistry with Cruise. Kurylenko, possibly selected to help the international box office, is flat out awful. Again, no chemistry with Cruise, and her delivery is almost all one note. This is a significant problem because she represents the stolen/lost love of Jack's (Cruise) life. Both in terms of her performance, and Cruise's strangely reluctant acceptance of her (he's been tortured for years with memories of her face) she brings no pain or depth to the story.Ah, the story, there's a couple of big issues there too. The ending (no spoilers) is flat because of the character arc completion (or lack thereof) for Cruise's Jack.Additionally the climactic scene rings hollow as well, because of the gaps in the aliens' technology: almost all powerful in some scenes, and incredibly flawed and fragile in others. There are other plot holes, you'll trip over them yourself if you watch it, that while not completely derailing, cause the plot to skip a beat one too many times.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very stylish sets,"This film tells the story of a team of two in a post apocalyptic futuristic world, who are tasked with guarding the land from intruders. One of them finds something sinister during a mission, and his view of the world is never the same again.I have to admit that Tom Cruise has been in quite a few good films in recent years. ""Oblivion"" boasts very good visual effects, and I'm mesmerised by the beautiful minimalist design of the outpost. The pool is so cool, it's beyond description! The story is good as well, it gets complicated towards the end, making viewers think what is going on. A bit of brain work is a welcomed addition to the film.

Half Moon,"Much of Oblivion is like Moon, which is good. Unfortunately, it also bears a sad resemblance to Independence Day in the tail.But it is encouraging that Hollywood can deliver a sci-fi film that focuses on writing and theme without wanting to warp into dysfunction like the dreadful Prometheus.The story telling reveals what is necessary, making the assumption that the fairly standard plot does not require too much explanation. The world is dead, and Tom Cruise plays a Wall-E type maintenance role, with lingering doubts.It is as if someone has discovered that if the plot is straight forward, less time is spent covering the holes. And while the feeble end is probably what is required for a studio to green light the popcorn, we have been given enough to be satisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion: A movie worth 'going out' for?,"Oblivion had been on my 'must-see' radar for quite a while now. First because director Joseph Kosinski has already proved himself as being a capable director with Tron: Legacy, and second, for not jumping on the 'nowadays mandatory' 3D bandwagon. Tron didn't fully live up to it's true potential with it's questionable narrative decisions, but Oblivion (at least as the early trailers indicated) seemed like a more character- driven and unique movie.Oblivion follows the story of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), one of the last few humans stationing on Earth somewhere in the distant future. Earth is devastated by a nuclear blast, and the remainder of humanity live on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Jack is tasked from higher above to repair and maintain the drones responsible for defending some drill-like machines, which are extracting energy from Earth's water resources. On patrol on his mission he discovers a spaceship full of survivors crashed into the surface which will ultimately lead him to question everything he knows.Despite that the story borrows from familiar scripts, it still follows a strong narrative. As the story unfolds more characters start to fill up the screen and the plot becomes more convoluted and befuddling. But in the end, everything will make sense though.Lead actor Tom Cruise projects strong performance, and contrary to the film's motto, he indeed makes an effective team with his inmate 'lover' Vica (Andrea Riseborough). Morgan Freeman (who admittedly has less role than the posters would suggest) provides contrast and color to Tom's role. Not only the cast excels, it's also the imagery of the wasteland which is drear and wonderfully realized. It mixes the design elements (spaceships, drones, the weaponry of Jack) of Mass Effect, with the barren and outlandish scenarios of Fallout. The visuals accompanied by the epic soundtrack made by M83 make a powerful 'audiovisual' whole.Bottom lineKosinki delivers a strong and excellent fiction. Where the pacing or the narration falls short, the orgasmic audiovisuals kick in. I, for one, tremendously enjoyed it with all it's inconsistencies, and it's absence left me craving for some more sci-fi action.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Sci-Fi seldom feels this good...,"Kosinski's directorial work on 'TRON: Legacy' was rapturously received, and earned him considerable attention for his distinctive visual style. He is a student of the films of directors like Ridley Scott and Stanley Kubrick, especially when it comes to their science fiction work, and while 'TRON' showed him stretching his legs, 'Oblivion' sees him working on his own terms and sprinting forward. Simply put, 'Oblivion' is a visually breathtaking, one of the most beautifully directed science fiction films in years. Kosinski's vision of post-apocalyptic earth is both very familiar and incredibly distinctive, with sweeping deserts and dunes covering the decayed and destroyed remnants of familiar monuments, gorges and rivers where cities used to be, and a planet completely at the mercy of untameable weather. If 'Oblivion' has a protagonist, I'd dare say it is the earth itself, with Jack placed as a tiny, almost insignificant figure against his environment. Just as impressive are the designs for Jack and Victoria's futuristic tower base, slick, clean, modern and highly reflective, and completely at contrast with the nightmare of nature around it. Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda approach these rich environments with sweeping, epic photography that uses every inch of the widescreen image. The film has a grace and fluidity to its rhythm, a level of elegance that was once commonplace in the science fiction of the 60s and 70s, but now lost under the explosions and monsters of today. Adding to that strangeness and grandeur is the highly anticipated score from Anthony Gonzalez and his French electronic band M83. In a similar approach to that of Daft Punk and their magnificent score for 'TRON: Legacy', their score lends the film an otherworldly quality, distinct but intrinsically cinematic at the same time. Once again, one of the most interesting film scores of recent times has come from outside of the filmmaking world.Visuals are all well and good, but 'Oblivion' could never work on images alone. Thankfully, its narrative drive and science fiction concepts are just as arresting and fascinating. Kosinski and Karl Gajdusek's screenplay, based on the comic book also written by the director, is a strange mix of incredibly familiar and wholly original. Most of the concepts in the film have been done before, and often in major films. Very few ideas are truly original, but what makes 'Oblivion' work on its own terms is the manner in which they are executed and weaved together. To say any more would be to ruin many of the surprises, but there's a real sense of legacy with this film, that it understands its place in its genre and the footsteps it is following in. It isn't an act of homage, rather an acknowledgement of what has come before, and how those ideas can continue to be developed and explored.While the prospect of a film starring Tom Cruise seems to turn a lot of people off (I'm still not entirely sure why...), rest assured that Cruise delivers a fantastic and intelligent performance as Jack, a pared-down version of the action hero we've come to expect from him. Cruise has always delivered better performances when working with directors he trusts, and that is clearly the case here. He knows that the film itself is bigger than him, and the successful execution of the film is paramount to him. It's great to see him at such ease on screen again, but with obvious passion and commitment to his work. Just as wonderful is Andrea Riseborough as Victoria. She strikes the perfect balance of a woman both soft and gentle, and carved from ice; the camera absolutely adores her. Olga Kurylenko isn't far behind. While her performance isn't as confident as Riseborough's, she matches the style of Konisnki's vision perfectly, and provides the right amount of enigma to drive the film forward. Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo round off the cast with small but memorable, and very unusual, performances. Each actor is aware that they are part of something much bigger - a giant cinematic panorama - and it is thrilling to see them fit themselves into it with such trust and confidence.The more major studios trust in these new distinct voices, the more exciting a place the cinema will become. 'Oblivion' is a stunning return to a memorable era of science fiction, as well as something original and distinct in its own right. Joseph Kosinski has proved himself even further with this second feature, and I can only wait in anticipation for what he will do next. Films like 'Oblivion' are a welcome reminder of how powerfully visual cinema is, how it can take you places and give you experiences no other medium can. Find it on as big a screen as you can, sit back, and become lost in this extraordinary visual marvel.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable despite some glaring plot holes.,"This was a film I wanted to see on the biggest screen possible, short of the IMAX I opted for the Odeon Leceister Square, the film certainly benefited from being on the big screen. It's the future and man kind has been destroyed by an alien invasion, or so we're told. Th war is over and the humans won, but only at the result of turning the earth into a nuclear wasteland. The invaders, or scabs as they're called, survive in pockets and are still waging a guerrilla war of sorts on earth. In the sky above just in orbit is 'Tech' the control centre which is fuelling what remains of earths resources to the Saturn moon of Titan, this being where the remains of the human population has fled to. The remaining deployment on earth are protected by a fleet of drones, and the drones are maintained by Tech's and their support, who operate from up on high and perform drone repairs as and when needed. These 'efficent' teams are run by couples... one doing the flying/fixing (Tom Cruise) and the other hanging around in the control station / funky floating house - (Not Tom Cruise) but is everything as it seems and why does our hero keep having flashbacks to a former life that took place before he was born? This film looks great, and say what you like about Cruise, but I have always felt he can act and has great screen presence and charisma. The film looks fantastic. Large sweeping landscape of shots of the former United States laid waste into desert look so real and deserts littered with the hulks of ships and nuclear submarines with missile tubes opened are endearing images that will stay with me for some time to come. Where the film dips is when the plot gets going, about 20 minutes in I had a sense of what was coming and the twists as they were thrown at me were not a massive surprise. Morgan Freeman and the excellent Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are underused and barely have more than a few lines of dialogue each. They add weight, but their roles didn't really need to be filled out by stars when this is very much a Cruise vehicle.The ending of the film has been compared to Independence Day and I must confess it was the first thing I thought of when the film went in to its last few minutes. This didn't make it any less enjoyable and the film was a visual feast for the eyes and the acting decent enough all round but this is a story you wouldn't have a hard time poking a few holes in if you try and you wouldn't have to try very hard. Still, this director is making films that deserve to be seen on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"the unique storyline is great, the Drones are spectacular, and Tom Cruise played another memorable role","Tom Cruise is definitely a legend and one of my favorite actors of all-time. The movie previews to ""Oblivion"" made me curious and interested in watching this movie. I like this film, because the storyline is unique. Oblivion is a mix between Mel Gibson's film Mad Max – in terms of the isolation, and it also has some similarities with the movie The Matrix in terms of its storyline – without the Matrix martial arts. The lead character Jack is played perfectly by Tom Cruise – as usual. Julia played by Olga Kurylenko and Victoria played Andrea Riseborough are great characters and the actresses that played these roles were outstanding. There is a very interesting love triangle that develops among those three characters which definitely gives this film depth. Beech played by Morgan Freeman has a key role in this film, and Morgan Freeman was brilliant in playing a leader in this Science-Fiction movie.There is no real down side to this film, because the storyline is written so creatively that it keeps the viewer paying attention to the very end. This exceptional film was written and Directed by Joseph Kosinski. Be advised, this movie is set in the future in 2077 after the destruction of most of mankind so the whole film is in a state of isolation. So if you don't like movies that have isolated towns, cities, or planets than you probably won't like this film. But like I said, the unique storyline is great, the Drones are spectacular, and Tom Cruise played another memorable role – that's what I really liked about this film.The cinematography is wonderful and the CGI is even better. The Drones are my favorite part of the whole movie – they were innovatively spectacular and they definitely brought all the action to this film – hopefully you'll like them too.I give ""Oblivion"" 7 out of 10 Stars",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Skip IT,"This is just a start. It seems nowadays Hollywood has set up a production line for post apocalypse movies with every other movies almost following the same story and a super star. And the philosophy is simple, Blitzkrieg marketing and some high graphical presentation. No ones give a damn about story. I think they just want to en cash the movie in the first week of release. Seems like world is going to end in few months...probably by end of Summer by looking at the release calendar :( AS name suggest I was in total state of Oblivion while watching this movie. It's a story of two person trying to extract earth resource to keep their world functional until they realize they are just serving aliens to steal earth resources. Also there is a underground communities of human being living as some creatures headed by Morgan Freeman. Movie has few moments but otherwise this is a totally flat movie with hardly any twists. Tom Cruise doesn't look interested in the role and looks too old. Morgan Freeman has very miniscule role and disappears even before you can notice.

Strangely compelling and deceptive movie,"Cruise is Jack, one of the few survivors of the interstellar war that decimated Earth's population. The earthlings won, but the planet is severely damaged and what remains of the population is moving to one of Saturn's moons.Jack is a drone repairman, keeping an eye on Earth's water reserve, while Victoria, the other half of a personal and business partnership, guides his missions around the planet. Somewhere in space, ""Control"", manned by Sally, keeps an eye on them.Even if their memories were wiped up prior to the mission, Jack keeps dreaming of life on Earth before the war and, more specifically, his life with a mysterious woman.Two weeks before the end of Jack and Victoria's mission on Earth, something happens. An old spacecraft falls to Earth and Jack discovers the mysterious woman hibernated inside. Turns out, things did not quite go the way Jack thinks.I really liked this strangely compelling and deceptive movie. The eerie landscaped of the post- apocalyptic Earth is unforgettable, not to mention the amazing, futuristic house in the clouds. Once you see that, you might wish you could live in one and fly around in mini-copters.Cruise shows a human side and the love story is quite touching (albeit slightly overdone). There are some minor incongruous points, but after all, this is Sci-Fi.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My Dad Spoke with Tom Cruise During the Release of Top Gun! Just Sayin'!,"Oblivion is about a post-apocalyptic world. The plot is that aliens attacked Earth, so the humans used nuclear weapons to defeat them, resulting in their world becoming mostly inhabitable. So the majority of humans have migrated to Titan, and the character played by Tom Cruise lives on Earth just to do his job on managing robot-thingies. It's a little bit hard to explain, but I'm telling you the set-up is really good.So while the set-up is good, the actual story just becomes too confusing and uninteresting towards the end. Morgan Freeman may be in it, but ... meh.The special effects are pretty damn nice to look at. At least most of the time. The futuristic machinery looks brilliant, but the less pretty stuff is ... well, less pretty.The score is also pretty good. It kind of reminded me of a related movie ... TRON Legacy! Which by the way is one of my favorite special effect movies.There isn't really a whole lot to talk about when it comes to Oblivion. It's really forgettable and there's nothing truly fantastic about it. The set-up and special effects are worth it if you're a huge sci-fi nerd like me, but the rest of the movie is ... pretty boring. It's not bad, in fact it's actually pretty enjoyable at times, it's just ... not anything special. Even if you're looking for just pure entertainment and action, I say the majority of movies this year with the same goal did it better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They cloned Tom Cruise?,"That might be a question you'll ask yourself while watching this. It is incredible how you he looks in this one.

I was surprised at how decent they made it. And I don't mean the technical aspect, because that is just amazing. Though I imagine they did use a lot of money to make those effects work.

"A Visually Stunning, Though Familiar, Sci-Fi Adventure","""Oblivion,"" directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Tom Cruise, is a visually captivating science fiction film that explores a post-apocalyptic Earth in the year 2077. The movie offers a solid blend of action, mystery, and breathtaking visuals, though it falls short of being truly groundbreaking in its story and character development.One of the film's strongest points is its stunning cinematography. The expansive, desolate landscapes of Earth and sleek futuristic technology, including the impressive drone designs and Jack Harper's sky tower, create an immersive world. The film's visual design, enhanced by Kosinski's attention to detail and the atmospheric score by M83, makes ""Oblivion"" a treat for the senses.Tom Cruise delivers a solid performance as Jack Harper, a drone repairman tasked with maintaining machines that protect the remnants of humanity. As usual, Cruise brings a level of physicality and intensity to the role, and his character's journey of self-discovery is engaging, if a bit predictable. Supporting performances from Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough are effective but somewhat underdeveloped, with limited emotional depth between the characters.The film's narrative starts strong, with an intriguing mystery surrounding the true nature of the war that ravaged Earth and the fate of humanity. However, as the plot unfolds, it begins to rely on familiar sci-fi tropes and twists that feel derivative of other genre classics like ""Moon,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Planet of the Apes."" While the film is not necessarily bad for drawing on these influences, it doesn't quite bring enough fresh ideas to elevate it beyond being a standard sci-fi adventure.Where ""Oblivion"" falters is in its pacing and the lack of emotional connection. The film tends to move slowly in parts, particularly in its quieter moments, which can make the nearly two-hour runtime feel stretched. Additionally, while the film sets up an emotional arc for its protagonist, it doesn't quite deliver on the potential for deeper, more impactful character relationships, leaving some viewers feeling disconnected.In conclusion, ""Oblivion"" is a visually stunning sci-fi movie that offers enough mystery and action to keep audiences engaged, but it doesn't break new ground in terms of its story or emotional depth. For fans of Tom Cruise and visually driven science fiction, it's an entertaining watch, but for those looking for a more complex or original narrative, it may feel somewhat lacking.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another Day in Paradise,"I thought this movie was fresh until people reminded me of Moon. Oh well they're both good.Overall the movie was well played out and the narration does well to make sure we don't know too much before the big reveal.Some twists can be guessed, but the movie was well acted, and it's actually a great acting effort by Cruise... not as good as Reacher (which I feel came out at the same time) but decent.The design kind of looks ripped from Mass Effect or the Star Wars Prequels, but overall it was nicely done.Great shots of the desolate landscape in the spirit of Fallout 3.I feel that Freeman was underused and the team he leads were mindlessly erased from plot progression; they're so careful for years and end up as nameless body counts.Except for a few devices that felt like they were there to drive the plot the movie was OK.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good film,"Good film. If I wanted someone to read to me, I'd get a book on tape-surely there are a million better ways of presenting exposition in a film. In fact, most of the information in the narration is presented within the next twenty minutes, and Oblivion would perhaps gain from forcing the audience to form connections implicitly. While talking about story, it may help to point out that the plot is not the main focus of Oblivion. Unfortunately, the story seems almost incidental to the sheer spectacle. Yes there are a few plot twists, but they are mostly predictable, especially to experienced sci-fi fans. But the sheer spectacle is certainly something that Oblivion does right. From start to finish, it is visually stunning. One gets a genuine feeling of awe when swooping over beautiful vistas, or through ruined cities. With so many beautiful shots of nature, the man-made props and sets are given a high standard, but they are equal to the task.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Sci-Fi Film since INCEPTION,"Yes, better than MELANCHOLIA, MONSTERS, SOURCE CODE, DREDD and AVENGERS ASSEMBLE - all good science fiction, but not up at this level. Way, way better than LOOPER, PROMETHEUS, SUPER 8 and Kosinski's own TRON: LEGACY.OBLIVION was a total surprise. Intelligent, exciting, properly large- scale spectacular and ultimately thoughtful, and rather heartbreaking.Cruise is magnificent, Riseborough is magnetic and enigmatic, and Morgan Freeman's brief screen time stays just the right side of Hollywood cliché.The M83 score is beautiful .. and in the final twenty minutes, OBLIVION does exactly what you want it to do - it goes big. Very big. It really gives you everything.There are surprises - stay clear of spoilers - which are handled intelligently and logically. Think it through afterwards, and you'll find the normal slightly head-scratching plot holes, but really very few.I expected 2013's best science-fiction films to be ELYSIUM and GRAVITY, and went in confident that OBLIVION would look gorgeous, but mean nothing. I was wrong. This sets the bar very, very high for Neil Blomkamp and Alfonso Cuaron. 2013 may just be the best year for science fiction in a very long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The places that Jack visits in his trusty mini airplane are jaw-dropping from the mountains, sky, and down below can be pretty shocking how much as the earth as changed.

The special effects are gently done and understated.In short, the best film I have seen for a long, long time.It's essentially a science fiction film, but also has a love story at its core.

Alien Invasion With Twists and Turns,"Oblivion is another alien movie but it has some interesting twists to it. Earth has been attacked by aliens, most of mankind has been wiped out and their only survival lies in escaping Earth. Or is it?I could give a longer synopsis but what you want to know is if the movie is good or bad. I think the movie was very good. By pure coincidence (or not) it was released around the same time as After Earth with Will and Jaden Smith, which seems to have a similar story. I never saw that movie to give it as a comparison but like I said, this movie is cool.The acting is solid enough as is the CGI and the action, but the quality lies in the story and the directing. For being only his second major film, Joseph Kosinski did a terrific job. He made sure not to make the plot to obvious and dull while giving the audience just enough. Some hidden facts may be easy to figure out but I don't think it ruins the movie at all. In fact, I'd say that the director may have thinly veiled certain things just to keep your attention on it.There is a good dose of excitement and thrills. There are some tense moments and narrow escapes, but ultimately this movie relies on the story and it did deliver.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It had also a mystery on the characters which you don't find it in a lot of movies .Then the humans who survived and try to destroy their enemies and the alien invasion was a lie and trying to get Jack on the good side an incredible performance by Morgan Freeman .Also the end was magnificent when Jack destroys Sally and in the earth life goes on with his wife who has a young daughter and tech 52 returns home .

"Oblivion is a visual feast for the eyes with a great lead and some truly admirable ambition, but at the end of the day is left feeling hollow and characterless.","Joseph Kosinski hit it big with Oblivion. Having only directed Tron Legacy(which was only a moderate success) ,he was able to get $120 million to write/direct/produce his pet project. This is a huge privilege that some directors spend decades trying to obtain, but Kosinksi did it in his second outing. And not only that, but he also got some heavy hitting actors like Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman on board to further convince us that this should be a one of a kind movie from the mind of a single person(a rarity in Hollywood). Based on everything we've seen, the movie looks beautiful, but has also played things pretty close to the chest in terms of story. Does Kosinski produce an incredible story that lives up to his creative ambition, or does this sci-fi miss the creativity and land in the realm of obscurity?Read the full review: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/oblivion-review/",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I dunno,"Maybe I've seen too many science fiction movies.What this movie cribs, which is putting it generously... WALL-E (top of the list), 2001, Planet of the Apes, Logan's Run, The Island (I think, though maybe that cribbed Logan's Run too), Solaris, Blade Runner (WITH THE AWFUL NARRATION), and Um... lots of other stuff I'm sure I thought of watching it.Derivative is the name of the game, ladies and gentlemen, but lord knows the production designers, special effects teams (no joke, it is gorgeous to look at... until it's same ol' stuff), and Tom Cruise - all of them, and that includes Andrea Risborough - are trying. But really, this is the sort of film that gives 'homage' a bad name.Indeed I would posit that any of the negative criticisms directed at Tarantino the past several years, about being too much into homage and reference (or his whole career depending on POV) should be directed here instead. Despite all of the strengths cosmetically speaking, the story posturing for something deeper, it doesn't feel ashamed to borrow from the best (it might've been better had it outright stolen it, it tries to be its own thing but it always has the air of influence but without its own heart).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Well-told Tale,"Admittedly this reviewer is a sucker for post-apocalyptic films and while ""Oblivion"" is neither perfect nor watertight in terms of plot, it is a well told tale. The film manages to impressively scale down the entire human struggle to a personal fight for the character of Tom Cruise, who looks as good as ever. The visuals are good though not consistently enough to make a lasting impression. The film appears to draw heavily from the great works of the genre including the recent ""Moon"" and this works successfully for the writer/director Joseph Kosinski whose TRON film was a forgettable affair at best.

The anti-Nero,"Tom Cruise continues to act in sci-fi movies, perhaps something to do with the scientology, since his creator was a sci-fi writer. He delivers the same solid acting as he always does, playing the cool guy with no problems (he could be the same character in all his roles, it'd not make a difference). It bothers me a bit that his girls are 30 years younger than him. I'd like to see him being the husband of an older woman for once. Hm, I guess that would make the partner 90 though.This is an entertaining movie, with flawless special effects. It's full of plot holes the size of Tet, a good few predictable occurrences and it seems to take some ideas from other movies/books like 2001, Moon, Independence Day or Terminator.The first half of the movie interested me more. After that things get a bit too Hollywood and we start seeing a little cliché here and there.Alas, it's an enjoyable film if you don't take it too serious and try to leave your mind blank to avoid seeing all the errors this movie makes. With that in mind, it's re-watchable, since its pace makes it a fun flick and the excellent fxs make it eye-candy.And, well, I saw that there were 666 review written before I started to write this, thus the review title, if anybody is interested and gets the idea.

"At last, a thinking mans science fiction.","I was going to wait for this movie to go to DVD (That is what I did for Looper). But my father who is 78 went to see it and called me and said I should see it straight away. My Dad has 2 movies he marks all Sci-Fi against, Alien and Blade Runner. To my surprise he said that he now has 3, Oblivon. I was in shock, my father is a very harsh critic and he is not a Tom Cruise fan at all. He doesn't like Super Hero movies and he thought Joss Whedon's Serenity was OK and Star Wars, he thinks is silly.So off I went with the wife to see Oblivion and he was right. Now, I don't mind Tom Cruise, but really in a lot of movies he plays the same type of character and in Oblivion, his Jack could have been Nathan Algren (Last Samurai) or John Anderton(Minority Report) etc. But in reality that is who Jack was. The questioning main character who doesn't just accept things as they are, he questions.Joseph Kosinski, the director was impressive, the actors especially Andrea Riseborough, were near perfect and the script? Get the Sci-Fi channel writers to watch this to see how it is done right. No cookie cutter plot here. A real science fiction plot, not sci-fi but science fiction, up there with Forbidden Planet and 2001.Why some people give the movie a low rating is beyond me.

"A Good, Old Fashioned, Sci-Fi Story","If you're looking for Transformers robots fighting, big explosions, and no plot...this is not the movie for you. This is a story that happens to have some special effects instead of the other way around, which is nice to see for a change, since it's been awhile. The '80s were dappled with sci-fi movies with story and with heart and then they disappeared off the map until recently...though, most of the recent sci-fi films are all effects and little story. I'm actually surprised that the director of this film's first film was of that variety. I'm glad I didn't know the director's last film was 'Tron: Legacy,' otherwise, I probably would not have gone to see 'Oblivion,' or at least not be excited about it.I wasn't sure what to expect but the film met my expectations of measuring up. It wasn't a Disney animated film for adults, instead, it had substance. It kind of reminded me of the feel of 'I am Legend' but with a sci-fi spin. It had nice pacing, it was beautiful to look at, it had intrigue and mystery (though, I kind of knew the direction the film would go from the beginning...but it still had plenty of mystery to keep my interested). A lot of the film is based around the mystery, story, and the acting. And since they chose a great cast of actors it was easy to watch them and compelling. This is a film for true geeks and people who just like a good story. Knuckle draggers who crush beer cans with their foreheads and drive over-sized pickup trucks with knobby tires...this will probably not be their cup of tea...or PBR.

Solid 7 for TC- love story is pure corn syrup,"Never has so much money been spent on top-flight special effects for such a corny love story. 8-9 for plot/story. 8-9 for FX. 9-10 for TC.Hollywood has a long, long history of shoe-horning in a female lead and including a totally inconsequential love story, simply to multiply the audience. The love story is not horrible. It is just trite and easily predicted. Absolutely nothing interesting going on.On the other hand, the sci-fi story has several twists. While the ending is predictable, it takes a several turns and creates tension and intrigue. The SFX and the set design are absolutely the best in the business.Big criticism to the director/producer/editor- NOT THE ACTOR- the wife character Kuryakin (?) does nothing but look with big eyes and pouty lips while the world is turned upside down. Literally, like a double-take. She will look pouty and big eyed watching action sequences, then turn away and they have another pouty and more big eyed shot of her above the shoulders. Not going to blame her! I think the director/editor-/producers just liked those shots and wanted to promote her as a 'star'?Tom Cruise crushes it. He is fantastic in close up, medium shot, or just walking around in a landscape shot. He can do no wrong! His emotions are believable, relatable, and illuminating.Good movie!

It didn't seem like there was much a point with the movie. Enough that when my mother asked me if I could watch it with my nephew, I replied, ""She probably wouldn't like it; It's nothing special."".The plot isn't defined clearly until halfway into the movie (to allow for a progressive, slow start), but by the time you realize what's happening, it's already ending and there isn't much action to help intensify the severity of the issue at hand.Your interest is held by you hoping that the movie will get better as it moves along, but with the pace of the movie held constant, you end up just watching it and not really trying to consider which parts of the movie were done well.If you ask me whether this movie is worth the time, it is, but, only if you're a sci-fi fan and/or a Tom Cruise fan. Freeman isn't a major character, so don't bother looking for some spectacular performance from him.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Wow, what an amazing cut-scene, oops, I mean movie, yes MOVIE","Good lord WTF. That's two for two pathetic endeavors of ""all style, zero substance"" piffle by Joseph Kosinski. I didn't think things could get much worse after Tron 2.0, but here we have another insanely expensive, cruelly unentertaining computer game montage to prove me wrong. Tom Cruise should stick to his former strategy of making films without a female love interest because his attempts at ""romance"" with women actors are just laughable/vomit-inducing. In our family, watching a Tom Cruise film is inevitably accompanied by the speculation game we call ""Who had to suck Tom's cock the most to get into this film?"" and clearly the winner here is Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - although he probably got off lighter than poor Jamie Parker in Valkyrie. I hope Melissa Leo didn't have to film for more than one day - all she was given to do was recite lines in a static close up and mid shot - I bet she's glad she won that Oscar now. What an absolute waste of time and money. Rubbish.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The woman was too young.,"What a pity Tom Cruise didn't have the courage to make his wife his own age. He's 51 and his wife in the movie was around 30, if that. When am I going to see a movie with a 51 year old woman and a 30 year old husband - never! You don't see it. Movie - interesting, good effects.Tom Cruise does a really good job in this movie, as expected. The trailer shows way too much so don't watch it, you probably already did didn't you? Well the trailer is essentially the whole movie summed up there's not many surprises! I love Morgan Freeman but his role was extremely small in this movie. I think they just wanted to add another big name to get more bums on seats even though he barely had any screen time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually stunning with an amazing soundtrack,"Oblivion isn't a perfect movie. It's predictable and more complicated than it needs to be. Nevertheless, this movie is visually stunning and the original story feels refreshing among all the sequels and remakes of today. Plus, at 50 years old, Tom Cruise is still able to lead this sci-fi action movie, which is pretty impressive. Many people disliked this movie, but I would watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not too horrible,"OK, I give oblivion a 7. I came into the movie only knowing a couple of things. 1. It was a Sci-Fi movie about a ""future"" earth. 2. Tom Cruise was in it.Visually it was a pretty good movie. The effects are pretty good, and Sci Fi is usually pretty big on that stuff, so nothing wrong with it there. The story, well, there are a lot of people that are going to hate on it because of the obvious Tom Cruise/Scientology connection, but what ever, it wasn't too bad, and was somewhat entertaining.There have been a lot of people that say this movie was too long. I didn't mind. The problem I had was 2 fold. First, I had the whole movie and storyline figured out in the first 15-20 minutes of the movie. The disguised nothing and that sucks...no big surprises. Second, The acting was bad. Tom Cruise is not a great actor but he was OK in this one, But the supporting actors (which there were only really 2) were pretty much bad. Olga Kurylenko is a beautiful girl but this role was completely bad and flat. Andrea Riseborough really added no value as well. Morgan Freeman is just as unimpressive. I know, everybody thinks he is the greatest actor in the world...but he has been known to do some very bad movies.All in all, for a Sci Fi flick, it's decent. With all my complaining I can still give it a 7, and it would beat that god awful ""The Host"" hands down any day of the week.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining sci-fi movie, excellent sound design","What nobody seems to mention is the spectacular theme music that is imo en par with the unique and unrivaled blade runner soundtrack. When it comes to spheric sci-fi scores the frontrunner is still the iconic ""Blade Runner Blues"". M83's ""Sending you away"" is almost there. The synth sound underscores the beautiful cloud shots and the freedom Tom Cruise's Jack feels when he flies to his next mission in his skyglider.The sound effects for the drones are also outstanding. There is this one sound the drones are making when they are scanning their area...it makes you instantly understand how horrifying it would be if one of those drones showed up in front of you all of a sudden. Most movies don't focus too much on detailed sound design, this movie definitely does.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellent movie, deserve to be seen in cinema!","The visually effects in this movie is one of the top reasons it is to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies I have seen in a while. It can be the only reason to see it too! The characters did their job and it wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be with Morgan freeman and Tom cruise, it actually made the movie more exciting and intriguing.The story is unique and is very interesting to watch, some moments can surprise you even if some moment is easy to predict it is not bad because of it.I will make this review short because I think any spoilers would ruin it for you. Overall it is a very very pleasant experience to watch, and you should definitely see it in cinema if you love good graphics.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good Sci-Fi action movie.,"This is probably the only type of movie that Tom Cruise is good in. I quite enjoy action movies that are set in another time with cool gadgets and end of the world themes. This one is no exception. It is a good movie, not great, but it is interesting and entertaining enough.The movie continually keeps you guessing as to what will happen but there are a few dull moments that creep in every now and then. Although I do find myself asking the question of why did they only have two people looking after such an important task? It is one inconsistency that seems odd to me. Of course if this wasn't so then there would be no movie.Overall this is a movie that is definitely worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi action films but don't expect anything too over the top action based or overly intelligent. It is a nice compromise between the two.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not that exciting and so many plot holes,"Could have been so much better, very disappointed.When I get excited watching movies I usually bite my nails, thats how I indicate that I have been watching a good movie, but this movie just made me wanna fast forward.I question a lot in this movie, feels like it should have been better 10 or 20 years ago.The effects and whatnot is OK, but doesn't make the movie more exciting.Oh, cant forget all the cheesy talking scenes ofc, ridiculous.Please future sci fi writers, put an effort into writing the story and dialogs.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Oblivion"" pays homage to 1970s and 1980s sci-fi films while dragging it out of the dark and into the light","Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me. People can go on and on about his crazy behavior and couch-jumping antics all they want. The bottom line is the guy is a good actor and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. It's obvious he loves his job and goes to great lengths to do it, which includes doing his own stunts as much as a director or producer will allow. ""Oblivion"" is another excellent example of Tom Cruise at his finest.The great thing is ""Oblivion"" benefits from having Cruise in it but doesn't rest on that alone. It's a great movie with beautiful scenery, above-average CGI, and an interesting blend of several different plot lines from classic sci-fi films of the past. The story elements aren't breaking any new ground. However, director Joseph Kosinski's concept of taking science fiction into the daylight should be recognized as a step in a different direction.Jack Harper and his partner, Victoria, are the last remaining humans on the war-torn Earth. They're assigned to watch over powerful machines used to collect what's left of the planet's natural resources for use on a moon being colonized by the survivors of an alien invasion. As the job is wrapping up and it grows closer to time for them to leave and move on to their new lives, bizarre dreams and occurrences awaken Jack's suspicions about his mission and who he is.Most sci-fi films take place in a constantly dark world that conveniently helps hide any CGI limitations filmmakers might run into. Kosinski's ""Oblivion"" embraces the light and no doubt made it a bit more difficult on CGI artists whose jobs it is to blend the animated images with the real. They did a good job for the most part and the movie looks breathtaking.It's interesting to see how Kosinski incorporated the stark whites and bubbly numbers of the 1970s and 1980s science fiction classics without making ""Oblivion"" look aged. Any number of those films will come to mind while watching it. It's hard not to draw comparisons to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Alien,"" ""Outland,"" and many others.The story isn't the strong point of the movie, although it shouldn't be looked at as a straight retread of anything before. It's more a conglomeration of several plots from different sci-fi movies of the past. There are key ingredients from ""Highlander 2,"" ""City of Ember,"" and any number of movies addressing the issue of cloning or an alien race's need of our natural resources for survival (""War of the Worlds,"" ""Battle: Los Angeles,"" and ""Independence Day"").Cruise's supporting cast in ""Oblivion"" includes Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, and Andrea Riseborough. Freeman plays the leader of an underground resistance in the same way he plays everything. He's the wise man who doesn't take crap from anybody. Kurylenko and Riseborough play the two women in Cruise's life. They portray their individual characters with convincing emotional ranges.The last thing I'd like to address is the musical score by M83. It sounds very much like the music heard in ""Tron: Legacy"" by Daft Punk. The soundtrack here resembles ""Tron: Legacy"" layered on top of Hans Zimmer's score for ""The Dark Knight Rises."" it fits the film's tone and enhances the viewing experience for the audience.""Oblivion"" is an entertaining journey into a grim future that doesn't look as dark as most genre films make it out to be. There's no real lessons to learn here, except maybe don't trust anyone at face value. It's just a good old-fashioned sci-fi action piece with a bit of a twist and more emotional depth than we're used to from these types of movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A bipolar film that the end contradicts the atmosphere of the film, denying all the glorious and at the same time dark future that he worked so hard to build","Starting with a long expository narration made by the protagonist - and which is later practically repeated in its entirety when he meets Julia (Kurylenko) -, ""Oblivion"" deposits in Tom Cruise the responsibility of carrying the film alone in a solitary and basically physical performance. This is not a new challenge for the actor, whose intensity and delivery to the role more than make up for the sameness of his composition, and it is interesting how little by little we learn a lot about Jack not only from his decisions (such as not sharing with Victoria the fact that his ship failed, something typical of the Hollywood hero), but also of his comfort in the face of the hostile geography and climate of the planet. In addition, it is curious to see how the guy insists on wearing, whenever possible, clothes other than the uniform that bears the logo of his employers - and, at one point, he even wears a shirt whose checkered pattern is directly reminiscent of the clothes worn by Julia in your dream.This contrasts directly with Victoria, whose costumes, always in white or lead, are also complemented by a small brooch in the triangular shape - which reflects her attachment to the rules and her loyalty to her bosses. In the same way, the production design invests in an aseptic white not only in the complex that houses the couple, but also in their clothes, equipment and vehicles, referring to an Apple aesthetic also present in the extremely thin and elegant back of the chair used by Victoria in her workstation. This, of course, contrasts with the dark, dirty clothes and aging equipment of the ""looters"" - whose helmets seem to take inspiration from the Predator by evoking an animalistic and angry expression.""Oblivion"" presents a desolate but technologically advanced Earth. Carefully designed, even in destruction. Kosinski, who was an architect before becoming a filmmaker, knows how to work so that his art direction is not only impressive, but functional. From Jack's ship to the base of operations kitchen, everything feels intuitive and familiar. This sensation is the result of a premeditated homage to the science fiction of the 1960s and 1970s - starting with ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" and passing through ""Star Wars"", ""Solaris"" and ""Alien"" -, and of the calculated use of visual effects, which alternate practical and CGI resources with precision. There is also a visual concern with demarcating territories, with the photography of Claudio Miranda (Oscar winner for Life of Pi and Kosinski's collaborator on Tron: Legacy) highlighting the contrast between the hospital asepsis of Jack and Victoria's universe and the aspect primitive and dark of the invading beings. The palette also transforms when Jack finds his oasis, a makeshift cabin in front of a lake. In the hideout sequences (whose location is duly concealed from Victoria); the warm, natural tones meet the ""real"" Earth. The place serves to show Jack's connection to the planet he doesn't want to leave, the place where he deposits his loot and finds peace to the sound of ""Ramble On"" by Led Zeppelin. Kosinski's ""memory worth fighting for"" is made up of baseball games, rock music, a bit of literature (from Roman poets to Charles Dickens) and love - the memory of the mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) who runs through the film of start to finish.Despite the good effects, the feature fails in its narrative construction. In the first act, the whole situation in which the protagonists find themselves is cautiously presented, but the second part takes time to pick up, making the plot boring for those who watch. The feature excites in the presentation, but is lost throughout the projection and tries to explain a lot, which in the end is unnecessary. There is more to Jack's routine than his missions to collect resources and as the plot twists unfold, the film starts to demand double effort from the viewer. Despite the interesting ideas, the weak character development outside the love triangle hinders the flow of the complex plot (Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau are little more than luxury extras) and the lazy dialogues, which range from insipid to cliché, transform ""Oblivion"" in a film where many concessions are needed to enjoy the final product.While Jack does his usual job, fueling and repairing the machines that kill the invading aliens, we have a solid path trodden by management. The image and the sequence of initial events conquer the public not only for the aesthetic refinement of its compositions, the architectural beauty of the constructions or machines and the opportunely honored connection between man and design, a characteristic that is very present in the most demanding science fictions in relation to this point, like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". But a film is not just made of a mechanical sequence of actions by the protagonists. And it is at this point that all the dazzle coming from the art direction and photography begins to lose ground for the disappointing development and finalization of the script. In a more immediate view, it is even surprising that the breaking point takes so long to be present in Oblivion. However, if the director guided the film coherently until its conclusion, this part more linked to the observation of the terrestrial geographic space and the supremacy of technology could be items used dramatically and would even give the product a symphonic character, growing with each "" movement"", experiencing paths more and more tortuous to then end in an epic way the entire saga against the evil aliens. But it doesn't work like that.When the first explanations begin to emerge, more questions arise. Instead of launching the densest riddles at the beginning and solving them satisfactorily throughout the film (saving, perhaps, a main question mark as a surprise element for the end), Kosinski cultivates the audience's doubt to the limit, and when the dramatic climax of the film arrives and the responses accompany this explosion of dramatic elements, a mixture of confusion, abrupt results and bad or incomplete explanations become major nuisances. What was a promising story set in a dystopian future becomes a sea of characters without psychological depth, with the bonus of a dissonant and useless love story in the final stretch.The great conflict of history is denounced in its very title. Jack and Victoria had their old memories deleted from memory, for the sake of the mission they received. However, Jack still retains remnants of some memories, which torment him mainly in his dreams. For some reason that even he can't explain, Jack doesn't want to leave Earth and insists on wanting to know who he was before everything was destroyed. While the new era of human beings preaches that everything that was before on Earth must be completely forgotten, he feels that he cannot let part of human history be simply erased as if it never existed.It's an interesting conflict, and so is the idea of harnessing it. But unfortunately, the focus of the direction is to bring a very didactic and silly message about the preservation of the environment, with those lessons that everyone is already tired of hearing, and it would be much richer to explore the other path that ""Oblivion"" takes only timidly. Implicit in the story is the message that, even today, the world is being suffocated by the excess of technology and by the paranoia of a future ecological catastrophe, to the point of losing its identity and leaving behind a part of its history (the insistence of Jack in preserving a book he finds during a mission, even living in an age where papers are no longer necessary, is a good insight). In fact, many observe that the price to be paid for the ever-increasing advancement of technology is the inevitable oblivion of some values that used to rule the daily life of human beings. And, like Jack, we could never continue to evolve if we lost connection with our own past.However, this good script idea is suffocated - rather, buried - by an endless sequence of platitudes. The beginning of the projection, which is dedicated to portraying Jack and Victoria's lonely work routine, is so tedious that many in the cinema session were asleep right away. Then the peripheral characters appear, who are always used to cause a certain surprise when everyone thinks that there are no other human beings still alive in history (Morgan Freeman is among these, once again devaluing his career with innocuous characters), and in the final stretch they dared to put a dying character babbling the protagonist his last words before dying, apart from the cybernetic villain in the best Hal 9000 style, from ""2001 - A Space Odyssey (1968)"". The surprise ending is revealed so quickly that no one has time to digest the plot twist, so it only remains to follow the classic final clash, especially anticlimactic.Science fiction works are wonderful historical documents, both as a possibility and as a mirror of a present society, projected or imagined for the future. The nuclear apocalypse, enmity with aliens and humanity's struggle against an oppressive situation of extermination are points that, if well worked on, give a great result to the work, and even better if all this content is accompanied by good investment in production. ""Oblivion"" had the second topic, but did not know how to enforce the first. The result is a bipolar film, which would be much better enjoyed if watched only with the soundtrack and without the sugary ending, contradicting the very atmosphere of the film and denying all the glorious and at the same time dark future that he worked so hard to build.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie,The movie was visually spectacular. Story was very compelling. Musical score added to the feel of the movie. Tom Cruise was excellent. Morgan Freeman was too but didn't have a big part. He was wasted in my opinion. Melissa Leo was annoying with her southern drawl as Sally. I personally find most of her characters in her movies annoying. Olga Kurylenko is beautiful and does an adequate job as Julia. Andrea Riseborough showed a lot of vulnerability as Victoria. The ending felt a little rushed but is satisfying. The orange light was either a rip off or tribute to Hal in 2001 A Space Odyssey. Movie was somewhat long but I think cutting some scenes would detract from it.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Thought Provoking Kind of Sci-Fi,"***Contains NO spoilers***The future looks even more bleak in the latest Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion, and it'll have you questioning the whys of your life and mission.Based on an unpublished graphic novel by Tron Legacy director, Joseph Kosinki, Oblivion is about one man's search to find the answers about himself and his mission. The movie opens to planet Earth, now a desolate wasteland after an alien invasion and nuclear attack, where Jack Harper, Drone technician 49, is part of an effective team with his communications partner and lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). Yet not everything is well with Jack ...he's having trouble sleeping due to recurring memories of a woman and being at the top of the Empire State Building continuously haunt him. Who is she? Why does this building hold such significance to him? Those questions and many more are soon answered when a lone survivor named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) of the spaceship named Odyssey crash lands on Earth and a resistance leader of the remaining human race named Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) take presence in Jack's life. Both characters begin his soul-searching process of truly discovering who (and what) he is, the nature of his mission, and ""company"" (known as the Tet – the alien lifeforce that attack Earth for its natural resources). It's a journey that could ultimately decide Jack's fate and the destiny of the surviving human race.If you're expecting Oblivion to be a ""blast 'em to kingdom come"" type of sci-fi movie, you should skip it. On the other hand, if you like a sci-fi movie where the plot makes you think, question, and decipher clues like an Alfred Hitchcock mystery along with the main character and the action is more of a backdrop than the main focus, Oblivion is the movie for you. Joseph Kosinki, in this reviewer's opinion, did an excellent job paying homage to the sci-fi movies from the 70s (as well as borrowing a few themes here and there from current movies) when translating his graphic novel to the big screen. Throughout the movie, there are notable references to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and the 1968 version of The Planet of the Apes to Terminator, Moon, Tron and Matrix – just to name a few. Visually, this movie is stunning. This reviewer like the contrasting wasteland of mountainous and sandy desert that was once New York City and the luscious forestry where Jack ""escapes"" the ever watchful Victoria to relive some sort of normalcy of a life he once knew. There are some hidden gems in Oblivion to which this reviewer easily recognized besides Led Zeppelin's Ramble On and Procol Harum's Whiter Shade of Pale ...here's one, be on the look out for Pink Floyd's The Wall album.Even though not really a big Tom Cruise fan, it was nice change of pace for this reviewer to see him portraying a character that doesn't start off as the dashing hero but the everyday man who's reluctantly pulled towards that status by Malcolm Beech, leader of the so-called ""scavs"". Morgan Freeman's character, in an unusual supporting role this time, hones in Lawrence Fishbourne's Morpheus character (from the Matix) and the way he cryptically guides Jack to search for the truth without really revealing too much him (and the audience) at once. Just like Jack, we are made to discover it in bits and pieces when he ventures into the radioactive zone. And she liked the seemingly effective yet cold chemistry between Jack and Victoria since they are paired together as co-workers and nothing more. There's no real ""love"" between the two compared to the love Jack and Julia rediscover in the latter half of the movie. Yet the one character that really stood out in this reviewer's mind despite being non-human except for the voice (by Melissa Leo) was ""Sally"". Think of this ""character"" as what Hal did for 2001 ...she was chipper and pleasant yet terrifying with her ""are you and Jack an effective team"" (which had this reviewer wondering what would happen if Victoria said ""no"" to that question) to ""I created you Jack. I am your God"" at the end ...the most powerful movie moment that sent chills down the spine.Music done by the French electronic/shoegaze group M83 wonderfully captures the mood and subtle undertones of Kosinki's Oblivion like what Daft Punk did to his Tron Legacy. This reviewer liked how the opening sequence (titled Jack's Dream) gives the audience seemingly look at happier times while Jack monologues what happened to Earth before the attention grabbing blast of electronica seeing the movie title (think opening sequence to Daft Punk's The Grid with Jeff Bridges in monologue). Other notable tracks off the Oblivion soundtrack include Tech 49 when Jack is roaming the desolate wasteland (beautifully highlights stunning scenery a world that's no more). and Oblivion (featuring vocalist Susanne Sundfer) at the ending credits.Highly recommend seeing Oblivion on the big screen(just to see the stunning the visual effects and scenery) before it's released onto DVD/Blue-Ray.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You should be able to find a better movie to watch,"There is not one original idea in this movie, but that in itself woudnt even be a problem. It is also insulting to the viewers intelligence, but sadly, no one seems to care.. How did the flight recorder get back onto the Odyssey? Shsss... Alright, then can someone tell me why would the antagonist ever give our characters free will, when it is clearly stated they could deny it too? Because then the movie is not happening? Oh, i see.. But still, if there is a logical answer to that, why werent we told about it? Why put the free will thing in there anyway? It was literally a single line of dialogue, and has nothing to do with the rest of the story. It doesnt matter. Just shove everything in there, the idiots will never notice..Is that really what science fiction has been reduced to for some? Mere entertainment? Escapism? Where are the big, concerning questions about morality, society, the meaning of life? Well, not in this movie, thats for sure..Instead we get perfectly blank characters, except for Cruise and Freeman, of course, who are playing, well, Cruise and Freemen. One will save the word and the other will deliver the completely out-of-place exposition. No wait! Actually, they both do both..

"When the bullets aren't flying, it's pretty engaging sci-fi","The best of what ""Oblivion"" has to offer is its unique look. It features a distinctive style and design from the weapons, air/spacecraft to the architecture (man, that house in the sky is something) that makes this Apple store future inviting. This is a visually attractive movie, there can be no doubt.It's somewhere in the second half that the movie starts to question everything thus far, and switches gears into action movie with a series of shootouts. Surprisingly, this is where it started to lose me. Even so, the answers provided in the third act are a nice payoff. Iit ends on a poignant, hopeful note.

A medley of sci-fi themes ruin a promising plot,"It has been sixty years since the alien invaders destroyed our moon causing Earth's devastation through fierce natural forces. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is left with a barren wasteland of a planet where he is tasked with the repair of drones and elimination of scavengers who had supposedly attacked Earth. While his routine, insipid life with work/bed partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) is partly directed by Sally from the mission control aboard space station TET, Jack finds his roots upon the Earth that once was. He frequently escapes into a verdant valley where an old cottage has his collectibles and his peace, while his fragmented memory draws images of a woman upon the Empire State building. It is not until the sudden appearance of that woman who claims to be his wife and their subsequent capture by the scavengers who turn out to be the remaining human population, that he discovers that nothing is as it seems upon the planet. This fragmented memory and the wiping out of Earth's civilization into oblivion has another reality that director Joseph Kosinski ('Tron:Legacy') presents with stunning visuals and pulsating action but neglects the development of an original twist. Rather, he concocts several sci-fi movie themes into a dreary, predictable second half. 'Oblivion' had immense potential to be that epic sci-fi movie and along with its visual appeal, it justifies a matinée show viewing at the very least.High up in the stratosphere, Jack and Victoria live an alienated life that follows protocols dictated by Sally at the Mission control aboard the Steve Jobs designed TET space station. Victoria is motivated to join the other humans aboard TET on a voyage to Saturn's moon, Titan, to start a new life but Jack's indifference to it reflects his attachment to Earth and his hope of finding out the truth. While he was made to believe that after the Earth was attacked, humans won the war but lost the planet, he cannot seem to understand why the humans had to leave their home if they won the war.... Julia (Olga Kurylenko) survives the apocalypse in a space capsule, unconscious with life fluids, only to crash land back to Earth sixty years later. She is rescued from the blazes by Jack who recognizes her as the woman in his dreams. Just as he is informed that he was once married to her, they are captured by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), the leader of the surviving human rebellion. He tries to convince Jack about the reality of the war and his existence but it takes Jack a daring mission into the radiation zone to discover the truth. Up until this point, Oblivion has a captivating sci-fi plot that offers no obvious clues about what really happened. Thereafter, Kosinski orchestrates a medley of themes from 'The Matrix', '2001: A space odyssey', 'Planet of the Apes', 'Prometheus', 'Blade Runner' and of course, 'Independence Day' into an uninspiring second half.Tom Cruise has backed many promising films that lacked a solid plot throughout and they have suffered their critical and monetary fates. Oblivion would have been his best sci-fi role since 'Minority Report' had there been a more coherent, novel plot to follow through. Performing most of his own stunts as always, Cruise has worked hard being Jack Harper and he does add whatever credibility the character can offer. Once again, he has noticeably stopped aging but that is merely a frivolous observation. Andrea Riseborough looks like a serious school teacher throughout; certainly not someone you want to see naked in the pool. Miss Olga Kurylenko adds more emotion than she did as a Bond girl but does little to add credibility to the character. Morgan Freeman looks quite badass in the Morpheus type goggles, dark cape and cigar in hand. His character needed more screen presence with perhaps an insightful past and action towards the future. His deeds are confined to the cave with little impact to the plot's conclusion.Claudio Miranda's (Life of Pi) cinematography depicts spectacular landscapes, skies and action sequences while the visual effects team delivers awe-inspiring elements that make this film a must-watch on the big screen. With a more than able cast and crew, Kosinski had potential to take Oblivion to greater heights but the lack of an original follow through and some heavily inspired sci-fi themes make the second half a predictable fantasy adventure. An audacious plot could've made better heroes of Earth's survivors and Tom Cruise's sci-fi outing would not have passed into Oblivion.7.002 on a scale of 1-10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""It's not what the movie is about, it's how it is about""","After seeing many negative reviews for Oblivion I have decided to do this movie some justice by posting a less judgemental take on this contemporary work of fiction. Joseph Kosinski's second film outing is a modern homage to the great sci-fi films that have come before. He has taken themes predominant in science fiction and filtered them through his own unique lens. Does this make it a sin? Isn't everything a derivative of something that has come before, or has the keyboard toting armchair review elitism of our current age prevented us from enjoying movies with an open mind?This film is one that pays much attention to visual detail and has struck an efficient balance of atmosphere coupled with an arresting soundtack that has been tastesfully layered throughout the movie...even till the end credits.The casting of Andrea Riseborough as Vistoria is an inspired choice. She epitomizes the lead character's struggle with their mission. Her performance is poised, measured and immersive. Olga Kurylenko as Julia provides a suitable contrast to the lead protagonist's ideological wrestle with his assigned task. Finally, Tom Cruise gets much flack due to his larger than life public persona and his many dances with controversial issues, but that should not take away his credibility as an actor.In terms of production value, fans of cinematography, effects and art direction will no doubt get a kick out of watching this carefully considered piece of film design.

Fair futuristic space sci-fi shows strains of tedium,"""Oblivion"" is a futuristic space sci-fi film - the type that is best enjoyed on the big screen. I especially enjoy such sci-fi, and first saw this film in a theater when it came out. I had enjoyed it then and just finished watching it again on DVD. I revised my rating down a couple notches on second viewing, but not because it seemed less spectacular on the smaller screen. If anything, my impression and enjoyment have probably been most affected by the plethora of films of the genre. It continues to expand, and with that its sense of unreality and the almost complete use of CGI.Imagine, with such a small cast, this film cost $120 million to make. Even with Tom Cruise getting paid more than $10 million for each film, and Morgan Freeman commanding high pay, that's a huge amount of money that went into some models for sets, art work and CGI.As with a few other sci-fi films in the 21st century, this one has a psychological plot that slowly unfolds. This is a good plot in that regard, but not a great screenplay or edge-of-the-seat film. The challenge for this genre, with the huge use of CGI in the future, is to come up with very different plots that will be interesting. The younger generation will continue to watch this type of films for a time, but over time, they will have their fill of films that become run of the mill.The sci-fi space genre is similar to another genre of films that had all but disappeared by the end of the 20th century. Western films used to be common from the 1930s into the early 1970s. There weren't many that rated in the top films for awards - a similar situation for sci-fi, but audiences, young and old, enjoyed Westerns. And over time, films of that genre became ho-hum. With the exception of an occasional extra budget film with a great story - or retelling of a Western legend, and with a big name cast and production, Westerns no longer appeal to the vast population. So, two decades into the 21st century, any fan base for Western films is miniscule.Consider these changing numbers that reflect the appeal and audience interest in Western films. In 1950, 123 Western films were made, and in 1940 there were 86. In the 25 years from 1930 to 1954, about 2,700 Western movies were made. That's an average of 108 per year. In 1970, 71 Westerns were made, mostly in North America and Europe. In 1971, 47 Westerns were made; and in the last three years of the decade, the numbers had dropped to 12, 15 and 16, respectively.Sci-fi films of the main space category face the same fate, it seems. With little variation, they are beginning to look like the same stories rehashed. Although they have had a longer run - from the earliest Buck Rogers space films of the 1930s to the present day, there are few films with new, imaginative or interesting plots. The psychological sci-fi films have held sway in the 21st century so far, but only so many of those can be made before they become tedious. The best of the space sci-fi films that still have drawing power are the Star Trek and Star Wars films that appear every few years. But that hardly represents an ongoing genre of appeal. Those films are unique by their diversity in characters, the human elements, with interesting stories and creatures. The special effects and CGI don't dominate.If anyone doubts that outer space sci-fi films are losing steam, just look at the box office for this big production. It lost money in the U.S. market, with only $89 million in ticket sales. It took worldwide sales to reach $286 million cumulative box office for it to cover its costs and make a small profit (studios earn about 50% of the box office sales).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good way for sci-fi films to start the year!,"¨60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated and nothing human remains.¨Joseph Kosinski broke out as a director in 2010 with TRON: Legacy and before continuing his work on the sequel he took a break to direct his personal project, Oblivion, a sci-fi film which he had previously worked on as a graphic novel along with Arvid Nelson. He successfully adapted the screenplay and has created one of the most visually stunning films of the year. Oblivion looks great and has some terrific sci-fi action scenes with a strong charismatic lead role played by Tom Cruise. The supporting cast is also pretty strong, but the film focuses almost entirely on Cruise. That means that Cruise fans will probably love this film because he pretty much plays himself, while those people that can't stand him will want to stay away from Oblivion. The best thing going for this sci-fi film are the great visual effects, while the weakest part is perhaps that it takes too many elements from dozen other sci-fi films and kind of meshes them altogether. On the positive side I was overall pleased with Oblivion considering at least that the studio took a risk at creating an original premise (and when I say original I mean that it wasn't a sequel, prequel, or reboot of a previous film) and turned it into a fun and cool looking film. I actually enjoyed this movie much more than Kosinski's previous film and hopefully this marks a great year for sci-fi film considering the upcoming After Earth and Elysium. As much as I liked Oblivion, I still have to admit that I felt Prometheus was a much superior film (thanks in most part to better performances).The film opens with a narration from Jack (Tom Cruise) explaining how the Earth was devastated 60 years ago by a war between humans and an alien race known as Scavs who wanted Earth's resources. We won the war, but the planet was devastated after the aliens destroyed part of the moon's mass which caused several natural disasters. The population that managed to survive moved to one of Saturn's moons known as Titan. It's the year 2077 and the only humans on Earth are Jack and his partner Vica (Andrea Riseborough) who live in Tower 49. Jack is a technician in charge of repairing drones which are responsible for guarding the planet from attacks of surviving Scavs. Vica stays in the tower serving as Jack's eyes and maintains communication with Sally (Melissa Leo), the mission commander living on the Tet (a large space ship in orbit around the Earth). They are in charge of safeguarding these giant machines that draw up water from the ocean to process it as energy in Titan. The few surviving scavs try to disrupt this process, but Jack and Vica are only two weeks away from parting from Earth to Titan. However, Jack is feeling nostalgic and is constantly having memory flashes of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and he can't quite figure out who she is since he has had his memory wiped after the war in order to serve his planet. Everything changes when a shuttle crashes on Earth carrying the woman Jack has seen in his dreams. Her name is Julia, and all of a sudden he begins to question everything that he has been doing.I wasn't too pleased with the way Kosinski decided to open the film having Cruise narrate the present situation, but the visuals won me over, and once the action begun I had a great time with the film. Like almost any other sci-fi film I felt there were some plot holes, but didn't make much of them since the film kept me entertained throughout. Oblivion is a little over two hours long, but it has decent pacing and you never feel like the story drags. Morgan Freeman has a supporting role, but really doesn't have much screen time. This is almost all about Cruise's character, which is good although I thought Andrea Riseborough gave probably the best performance of the film. I like Kurylenko, but she doesn't do anything memorable or ground breaking here. Oblivion isn't a perfect sci-fi film, but it is an entertaining one and I had a great time at the movies. If you enjoy science fiction movies you will like Oblivion unless you are picky or expected a totally unique film. There are several moments where you will be reminded of some greater films which this movie was probably inspired by in one way or another (2001, Blade Runner, Moon, Logan's Run, Independence Day, etc). A lot of credit has to be given to Kosinski however for making a somewhat original sci-fi film and making it entertaining. I would recommend this film!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Over-rated on IMDb,"Science fiction is one of my favourite film genres and I usually enjoy a Tom Cruise movie, so I was looking forward to ""Oblivion"", only to be sadly disappointed. A slow and sluggish first half finally comes alive only to present a series of plot twists that become ever more confusing and unsatisfactory.Some of the scenery is suitably bleak for an apocalyptic story but the model work is all too evident. Cruise is fine, although his dialogue is pretty leaden. However, in a small cast, the two female support roles - the accomplished British actress Andrea Riseborough and the Ukrainian former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko - are underused and often reduced to whimpering ""Jack! Jack!!""The responsibility for this let-down is all too clear. Joseph Kosinski co-wrote, produced and directed the work which is based on his unpublished graphic novel of the same name. Like his previous directorial effort ""Tron: Legacy"", ""Oblivion"" looks good but lacks flesh and blood characters. There was probably a reason why the graphic novel is unpublished.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An Extended, Overlong Homage to '70s Sci-Fi Films.","""Oblivion"" (2013), directed by Joseph Kosinski, who previously made ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010), is an extended homage to science fiction films in the 1970s. The script, by Kosinksi and Oscar-winner William Monahan with uncredited touch-ups by Michael Arndt, appears to be an amalgam of a disparate batch of films, from ""Logan's Run"" (1976) and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) to ""Solaris"" (1972) and ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968). This similarity with sci-fi films of the past paradoxically is both its major strength and weakness.In reinvention of iconic scenes, such as black and white flashbacks to New York echoing Gilliam's ""Twelve Monkeys"", its use of design with immaculate white, angular flying Bubble Ships and living quarters, we are given some stunningly beautiful, perfectly envisioned concepts. Claudio Miranda, who won the Academy Award for ""Life of Pi"" (2012), shoots the landscapes on location in Iceland, breathtakingly utilising the widescreen to maximum effect.However, films are more than a collection of attractive shots edited together; they have plot, characters, direction. For a futuristic film, the ideas element is all the more prescient and this is where ""Oblivion"" falters. Too little is new or resembling originality. Anyone well-versed in cinema will see where the twists are coming and none of the characters, despite a good cast including Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman, connect and engage. Cruise's character in particular doesn't work well enough; the writing is too generic and not insightful enough, a disaster when the film pivots around him.Kosinski's direction displays his variable talent, his penchant for framing sequences to best effect and building up a vivid sense of geography. Yet the people in his shots flounder, the character ""moments"" not hiding his disinterest compounded by the story's weaknesses. Pacing too is an issue with Kosinski and his editor Richard Francis-Bruce struggling to find a proper rhythm to the film. Some scenes are much too long, others are seemingly abandoned, meaning that even at a mere two hours long, the movie feels a drawn out affair.If ""Oblivion"" is imperfect, when it does work, Kosinksi is shown to be a director who has skill, can direct complex technical scenes and has a kinetic way with action. It is his abandonment of actors, intended or not, that undercuts his efforts. The film finally, despite looking very good, is less than the sum of its parts.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Clever And Well-Acted,","Oblivion is a great movie with a well developed plot and an impressive cast. It's an amazing spectacle which is one of the highlights, it clearly did not rely too much on green screens, building sets and taking the cast out in to real landscapes, which is much more effective than an abundance of CGI. However, the plot was very convoluted at times, I understand it's a Sci-Fi, but it got very carried away with itself, the twist towards the end is very much like an episode of the Twilight Zone, although it delivers more confusion than shock and awe for the audience. The cast is terrific, Tom Cruise shines in the lead role, managing to swiftly convey the emotions of this complicated character, he also shares great chemistry with Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough, throwing Morgan Freeman in to the mix only adds to the top notch performances. While the ending raises more questions than it does answer, Oblivion is an enjoyable movie with a stellar cast and a beautiful spectacle, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or Sci- Fi.Jack Harper is sent out to find the remaining resources left on a now empty Earth, but he soon learns some things about his past.Best Performance: Tom Cruise",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

2013: A Cruise Recall,"No sooner pass the one-hour mark, does Joseph Kosinski's ""Oblivion"" turns from an intriguing sci-fi premise into a ""guess the other sci-fi movie winks"" game. It was a bit of a letdown, having so much potential and then letting the screenplay take the easy way out, by catering to the audience. A superior screenwriter would have explored some of the interesting idea to its extent. Here we are treated to a slick, slam- bang futuristic actionier that treads on familiar territory but looks and sounds fantastic.If you got something, go for broke. This is only Kosinski's second feature film after the equally visually spectacular ""TRON: Legacy"", and he goes for broke with the visual effects and design of the movie. There is an awesome sense of scale and sights of breathtaking spectacle throughout the movie, and I'm not just talking about the action sequences - most of the film's establishing shots will make some hairs stand in awe. And unlike today's CGI-laden films from MTV directors, with choppy editing and all; Kosinski wants his audience to appreciate and savor the effects, so we get them in long, wide shots with a patient duration.If there ever was a director as visually creative and epic in his use of effects, Kosinski may be the go-to guy for such a movie, seeing that James Cameron or George Lucas may be busy with other projects. Hell, it's clear Kosinski cares about how his movie looks, and basically you get more than the price of the IMAX admission. Yes, the IMAX version is the way to go for this one. I simply cannot imagine seeing this movie again on a smaller screen. The visually stunning world Kosinski has created is worth more than the price of the IMAX edition alone.Alas, if only the script were as daring as its visual scale. It's based on Kosinski's own graphic novel, and I've counted major influences from ""Total Recall"", Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" and Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", among a few others. Yes, the ending is simplified Hollywood pap, but the visual journey to there has been nothing short of amazing. Hell, at least Kosinski has the gall to put in references to Kubrick and Tarkovsky, so it's all good. And Tom Cruise as the engineer Jack Harper, reminds me of those good-looking, manly heroes from the golden years of science fiction - handsome, intelligent, and ready to act when necessary, with Olga Kurylenko supplying enough weight for her obligatory love interest role. Even Morgan Freeman shows up to prove he ain't just wise, he can kick ass too.It appears the trailers have revealed far too much of the visuals. I simply do not understand the marketing for films today. Do they want to market the movie, or show you most of it just so you can pay 11 bucks to see the ending? I wisely avoided watching the trailer (although I heard them) and it allowed me to imagine what kind of visuals that may come up on the screen. Needless to say, I was not disappointed with what I saw.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Basically it's 90 minutes of ""clues"" that lead nowhere, a 10-minute monologue by Morgan Freeman that attempts to resuscitate the film with exposition, and then a closing sequence that is beautiful but has no place in the timeline of the movie.

Well nothing special on the storyline as it was very familiar with other scifi movies that i watched before like sphere and independence day. Hence, the first twist was as expected, didnt caught me off surprise but the second twist changed my whole perspectives on this movie.

Surprisingly decent scifi film,"I didn't go into Oblivion with high hopes. Granted I had already seen Edge of Tomorrow, which was decent Tom Cruise film, but then again I had also seen War of the Worlds, which was awful. But, Oblivion managed to surprise me. Not only was Tom Cruise well-suited for the role as a lone technician, looking for meaning in an abandoned world, but the whole film was beautifully designed, the story was interesting if a bit clichéd, and as a whole I was entertained from start to finish.The best part of the movie is how it looks. The whole abandoned Earth and the giant machines that scourge its surface to fund humanity's reach for the stars look majestic and the white, sleek designs of the few stations left are beautiful to look at. It has that 00s iPod design vibe to it, but in this film it fits, because the whole landscape supports it with it bleakness.Furthermore, Andrea Riseborough and Tom Cruise have good chemistry together as the two technicians tasked to look after the machines, and while I do think Morgan Freeman was criminally underutilized, it's always a joy to see him any film.The story is a bit clichéd, as I already said, and the end is a bit preachy, going over the same ground every single one of these movies does, but it's told well with good action, well-timed twists and good pacing in general. Enough time is given for the simple appreciation of how the film looks, the dialogues flow smoothly and the only real thing missing is that spark of originality that would have made this a great film instead of ""merely"" good.Oblivion is well worth a watch if you're looking for a decent scifi film with excellent, innovative set designs and a plot that will keep you interested.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining if not memorable,"After the visual stimulus that was TRON:Legacy director Joseph Kosinski has again crafted a feast for the eyes and a movie hard to appreciate on an emotional level. Oblivion looks the goods thanks to its naturally stunning Iceland vistas with added CGI effects but it's a film that's not as grand as it thinks it is and a film that sadly isn't as pretty as it wants to be.Oblivion aims for the epic and doesn't reach it. The story of Tom Cruise's repairman Jack allows for lots of character development and growth but no matter how much Jack develops there is never a real sense of connection to his character or those of the female leads in Anna Riseborough as Victoria and Kurylenko as Julia. Another aspect that works against Oblivion is very weirdly the kitsch look of the whole film, diminishing the hard work of the movie and its backstory history.For a film that cost in the vicinity of $120 million Oblivion looks awkwardly cheap in its effects and props. Examples of this can be seen in Morgan Freeman's wardrobe (seriously why is Freeman chuffing on a cigar?), the films weapons and vehicles and the final act of the film has some of the worst CGI this side of Sharknado. If Kosinski wants his visions to meet their full potential more attention needs to be paid to how the film looks as a finished product.With all this negative talk it must be said that thanks to the intriguing enough story and mystery the film presents Oblivion is always watchable and there are enough well-constructed scenes to keep the viewer glued to their seat. In regards to Tom Cruise no matter what the naysayers can come up with, the man can act and here holds the film with his presence. Kosinski is an interesting director and one can feel soon enough a movie for him will click not just visually but emotionally and when that day comes it will be a joy to behold.P.S – someone give GOT's The King Slayer (Coster-Waldau) a decent role already! 3 drones out of 5 For more reviews and opinions on movies check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

when games work,"I liked many things in 'Oblivion', actually more than I expected. I am no fan of computer games, certainly not of these that are dominated by machine guns and laser guns, by cars races and space-ships races - and there are plenty of those in the film directed by Joseph Kosinski. I disliked many of the films that bring to screen heroes and action inspired by comics or graphical novels, and 'Oblivion' is based on one written by the director. And I am not too sympathetic to the action heroes roles that Tom Cruise picks almost exclusively lately, the main reason being that by doing this he buries in the past an excellent actor (hopefully just puts him to freeze). Despite all these wrong starting points, I liked a lot (but not all) in this movie.The story conceived by director, script writer and games creator Joseph Kosinski happens in an uncertain future. The world as we know it ended in 2017. Earth came under attack, Moon was destroyed and the nuclear weapons of Armageddon were used in self defense. Mankind won the war but lost the planet Earth now inhabitable, and will soon be moving to a new home, one of the satellites of Jupiter. It's only that almost nothing of what we see in the first 15 to 30 minutes of the film is what viewers are actually made to believe. 'Oblivion' starts like a very standard comics-inspired film, and as we got used to its world, something happens that is quite unusual in routine movies of its genre. Characters start to develop, they learn about themselves, they ask questions about their own identity. Eventually the movie will turn into the action thriller that it was advertised to be, but this will happen in a smart manner, and the heroes end by being something very different from our initial guesses.A few words about acting. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are two names that do not need any introduction. Cruise gets more opportunities for an interesting role and deals with them honorably. Freeman has a much drier part and cannot make too much to enrich it. The real surprise is Olga Kurylenko, not only fit to the action role, not only looking good, but also acting appropriately in a key role.There are two interesting aspects in which 'Oblivion' breaks the rules of the genre and helps being more than just another adaptation of a graphical novel. One aspect is that the viewers discover together with the heroes that the world where the action is located is something very different from what they thought it is. This complete change in their systems of reference and values doubles with a story line that has clear ecological and political references to the present, although the action takes place in a not very immediate future. The dangers of the new technologies like AI and cloning when they fall into the wrong hands are clearly articulated. The second aspect is that the graphics fit well the idea of the two intersecting and interchanging worlds. In the beginning the film has a very computer graphics game look which describes at perfection the apparently ordered world. Later the border between the artificial and idyllic worlds and the complex realities of the future begin to blur, we see the 'monsters' and realize that they may not be what they seem to be. There is also a political saying about a world where drones play such a central place from fighting the wars of the humans to protecting and saving their lives. 'Oblivion' has many quantities that make if different from the crowd and is definitely worth a try.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Average replacement of science by fantasy,"Typical Hollywood big budget Science Fiction. Well, fiction at least, not any science here. It's a fictional depiction of a future which for most should appear no more than fantasy. Of course beautiful people pilot space craft. Why wouldn't they? And a couple engaged to be married would of course be sent on a space mission together.I didn't really get the gist of the story, but that's because there was too much whispering by the characters. Usually the whispering would take place after noisy fighting scenes.There's lots of silly sound effects made by Jack's flying machine, but I was reassured to hear that computer systems of the future still use the same reassuringly futuristic beepy-clicky noises that all computer systems from films and TV of the past twenty years use just so I know that deep complex computations are taking place.I found myself critical of the scenarios the Jack was placed in, to only later find they were not what they seemed. Clever. A twist! But find it difficult to believe Jack's seemingly super-human physical resilience.There were lots of unimaginative triangles and circles and cubes to indicate qualities such as non-human intelligence and comprehension - I did feel the loud buzzing and beeping noises the drones made were quite appropriate - they would be particularly intimidating.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not one of the most memorable,"A lot of Sci-fi films have and are coming out at the moment, the one thing about Sci-fi is that they have to be big, bold and filled with CGI, Action and adventure :)I do think this film has a lot of qualities, I do also think that it will not be one of the most memorable films in this genre this year, but it has a lot of good effects, small pearls that keeps the story interesting, surprising and watchable. But there are also things that are not working in this, things that seems too much, changeable during the film and maybe a bit strange.Beech played by Morgan Freeman is one of the more enjoyable characters and even though he is not as mysteries as he appear, he does a great job. Jack Harper played by Tom Cruise is a very typical calm on the surface a bit of a hot head on the inside, action Tom Cruise character, he does all right, but we are missing some humor for this character (way to serious).It is an entertaining, very scenic movie, a lot of action and good elements of sci-fi, but it still feels like something is missing, and the story is a bit too strange at times or too unbelievable.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gets Interesting as its Progresses,"Pretty interesting science-fiction story that looked basic early on but becomes more interesting as the movie progresses. The technology shown is also pretty much believable which makes it more believable. Tom Cruise is as solid as usual, I just wished we would have seen more of Morgan Freeman.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Joseph Kosinski's 2nd big budget snooze-fest,"The beginning looked promising and raised questions, but then the plot and action boredom kicked in and I lost my interest. Run-of-the-mill bombastic orchestra-like music highlighted all the generic ""tight spots"" and ""last minute saves"". I wanted so badly to do whatever else, like get out or check for new emails but I endured.Ditching the action and replacing the music with something more fitting, and refining the plot could have saved this movie. Maybe even insert some desperation, humor or one-liners? I don't know since I'm not a director, but one thing is sure: I won't be watching any more of Kosinski's movies unless someone convinces me otherwise with flawless reasoning.+1 for visuals and +½ for working but uninspired plot, for a grand total of 1½/5.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just what is going on?!,"Oblivion is another one of those films which, judging by the disconcerting introduction, you just KNOW will contain a twist. You'll spend the rest of the duration figuring it out... trying to pick up various clues here and there... but will you do it? Chances are... no. Yes, there are a few signposts along the way to point you in the right direction, but most of it only makes sense in hindsight. This is good, as the events of the latter half will come as a shock to most viewers... and isn't that why we watch movies in the first place... to be enthralled and thrilled?Getting there, though can be a bit of an uphill struggle at times... as the plot meanders when it should be racing ahead. Tom Cruise is his usual self... he was possibly born for everyman hero roles such as this. And Andrea Riseborough makes an impression as his sexy assistant. But the quieter moments feel a little corny, and the action scenes, while impressive, tend to get repetitive. After all, there's only so many ways you can blast flying droids...So, while it may lack the intelligence and heart to be compared with the very best of the influx of sci-fi mysteries we've been experiencing of late, it's still worth a watch. And credit Cruise with being 50 but looking like a man a full decade younger. Bet my dad's dead jealous... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Derivative but Humanistic and Entertaining Sci-Fi,"Technically Oblivion does a lot right, and for that it is worth watching. I absolutely adored it's take on apocalyptic earth, vast open spaces, desolate and uninhabited, but not oppressively dour and beige. The whole design of the film and its characters, in particular its use of light and color, really were a joy to behold.That being said, the biggest weakness is the movies opening. The movie opens with voice over exposition which feels like an addition due to a producer intervention rather than creative direction. I would have preferred if the movie let the visuals speak for themselves, showing not telling. The visuals tell a lot in oblivion too, Earth has been scarred after an intergalactic threat arrived and forced humanity to go nuclear. Humanity won, but now they plan on jumping ship to greener pastures on Saturn's moon in a technologically impressive arc like spaceship.The earth is now barren, but still colorful and vivid. There are pockets of life and vegetation, even if now vast swaths of the globe are deemed unlivable radiation zones. Tom Cruise gives a solid performance playing the drone handyman Jack, who still has a deep fondness and curiosity for the Earth and its beauty as it contrasts with his mundane and sanitized life above the clouds. The opening sequences post voiceover mostly involves him going about his routine and helps the viewer understand why he has become so fond of the melancholically beautiful landscapes. It also introduce us to his assigned partner Victoria, played excellently by Andrea Riseborough who gave my favorite performance in the film. She is all business, and cannot wait to get off to the moon to start their new life. There is an excellent tension between the two characters who while fond of each other seem to have incompatible visions for the future.The overarching plot is a mishmash of awesome sci-fi concepts that are all interesting in their own right, but they are also derivative and mostly by the book. The heart of the film lies in its emotional core, behind all the shiny sci-fi tech is a human and empathetic story of people who feel misplaced by circumstances they cannot quite fathom. Characters feel deep and romantic connections to their past lives, to the point where they are literally haunted by memories they cannot really recall because their memories were wiped, presumably because most of the survivors would have committed suicide if constantly reminded of everyone that was lost in the conflict. This dynamic, and its interplay between Jack and Victoria's partnership, really felt nuanced and compelling and was my favorite part of the film.Of course the action in the movie is pretty great too. Most of the combat is between scavengers and these bland and inoffensive looking drones that are essentially flying spheres with guns. They look sanitized and boring in a way that feels truer to life than your average sci-fi robot that cares mostly about looking cool and being badass. There sounds are also incredibly fitting to their image, sounding more generic and mass produced rather than creatively adapted, pragmatic is a fitting word. Meanwhile the scavengers take the exact opposite approach and look like something out of Star Wars, a decision I was not personally a fan of, but it was charming especially in the few shots of them spying on Jack. Either way the drones act with ruthless efficiency and it is something to behold as they hunt down the scavengers.Ultimately, the movie goes in a lot of directions, and the plot covers more ground than it probably should and is far from perfect because of it. Much of the dialogue is overdone and I wish it took a more minimalist approach to some of its themes, even if there are some great cheesy lines in there. But everything else is done well. The movie never drags and constantly utilizes to great effect either the open landscape or interior desolate buildings with gorgeous cinematography. The movie starts slow and has some plot holes, but if you are a sci-fi fan, it really seems like you can't go wrong with this one, especially if you appreciate the more subtle emotional plots that plays in the background of the main operatic battle between earth and the invaders.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Yes, it meanders: just let it take you along for the ride!","I'm not going to say much about this one for fear of giving away crucial plot pointsbut I thought it was an enjoyable, stylish, well acted and well written sci-fi thriller (watch it for the plot - if you don't like robots and space ships, don't worry; you'll get over it!) I make no apologies for the fact that I like Tom Cruise as an actor, and he fits into this part perfectly.The plot line is in no hurry, and casually meanders along. Sometimes I'd get frustrated by this, but for some reason I was happy to just let this one wash over me.Verdict: Bravely slow-paced, with the thriller element taking precedence over the action/sci-fi elements.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Decent sci-fi, a bit predictable, doesn't reach its full potential","This was a pretty entertaining movie although it didn't quite feel complete. The main reason I watched it was because Top Gun: Maverick was so great and this has the same director.It's certainly not on the same level as Maverick although some of the action is pretty cool and you can see potential in the directing style overall - a patience to let the story unfold which not all directors have.The concept isn't enthralling, but it piques your curiosity. The story develops a bit but doesn't go in the most interesting directions.It's ironic. I think it would work better as a TV show. It both feels like not enough is going on but also that there's so much more to explore. A TV show could have taken more time. End each episode with a cliffhanger or reveal. Let them sink in a bit. Let the world develop and evolve as you learn more.The movie tries to do too much too quickly. As a result, the twists and developments have less impact - we haven't invested enough yet! On the other hand, the implications of the ideas aren't explored enough. It just kind of rushes on at times. So it's both too slow and ponderous and too rushed at the same time.Anyway, it's hard not to spoil it, but the concept is enough to draw you in. But these kinds of movies, mysterious sci-fi action epic etc, they really depend on the final concept. What was the crux of it? What's the big twist or the ending, the purpose? It all hinges on that. And Oblivion is alright in that way but not amazing.I don't really feel a need to rewatch it. But it does give me ideas for similar stories. And a TV show adaptation with much more detail and fleshing out of the world seems plausible.The acting is fine, especially Cruise who always throws himself into these action roles. Morgan Freeman is good but not used that much - it feels like anyone could fill the role. The main woman is a bit annoying while the newer woman is decent. But perhaps that's the point as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually stunning.,"Firstly I will not be drawn in to the debate about Tom Cruise, Some people hate him, some people love him.I remember watching films such as Top Gun growing up and hey just because some people do not like him because of his choices... he does a good job with his acting in this.The Visuals are STUNNING. The production crew put a lot of time in to the visuals, and you can tell. I wont spoil it for anyone, yes its a bit long at 2H:03M (I think), but if you have sat through several hours of Das Boot, about life in a Submarine, then you will have this covered.Music is eargasmic, especially the main score (Ending), some is a bit meh, but the ending music fits really well.Its Science fiction, watch it for what it is, a FILM, its not Science fact, otherwise it would be a documentary on Discovery Science, Its ENTERTAINMENT, and it does it well.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Overall a fun time,but some significant flaws","There is a lot of fun to be had with this flick.First off,although it's no surprise,Tom Cruise shows yet another time he can act. That being said, none of the actors do a bad job. They are all decent in their roles,but none of them does a phenomenal job. Now the practical effects and the visuals are stunning. The CGI is great and the whole landscape shots are amazing.Now let's talk some some of the issues with this film. Some people complained for it having a similar ending/story to another film,which I will not name since this is a spoiler-less review,but you probably know which one I'm talking about. The movie itself is predictable at times,although it does have a number of good twists throughout,which you see coming if you know about the other film.Me having not seen it,I wasn't quite taken out of the movie as some other people apparently had.This film is not by any means bad,but it's just decent,when,given the concept and the casting,it could have been great.Morgan Freeman was really underused here and I really wanted him to have played a bigger role in this,same goes for other characters.My biggest issue with the film is the pacing.First it starts off slow,then picks up for some action,then slows down again for big portion of the movie.Although you are kind of interested in what's going on,the pacing really does not help and might even bore you,as it did to me. There is an epic battle and some amazing moments but the character development is lacking and close to non-existent.So, summing up, Oblivion is a fun time with some friends but not nearly the scientific original epic it presented itself to be. With its amazing visuals and fun action scenes,it's not a movie I regretted seeing but neither would I recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A more than watchworthy entry in the post-apocalypse genre,"I love it when authors adapt and direct their own works, because the films often bear signs of having been made with a little more care, a somewhat deeper affiliation with the story, and a more idiosyncratic visual expression. Authors-turned-directors tend to go about the project in a more auteurish manner than the average director, and although Oblivion is a story and film far too seated in a well-established sci-fi tradition to be groundbreaking or even very original, writer/director Joseph Kosinski has created a film with a certain self-reliance and a clear game-plan that it sticks to and is able to make effective.Tom Cruise stars, with everything which that implicates of drive, enthusiasm and familiarity, as Jack 49, a drone repairman on a desolate future Earth, seemingly abandoned of all human life after an alien invasion and subsequent nuclear war which the human race won. The humans have been evacuated to the Saturnian moon Titan, and Jack 49 and his partner (and lover) Victoria are among the workers left to keep things neat and tidy on an otherwise messy Earth. So far so good, but there's something or someone lurking in the shadows as Jack goes about his lonely, daily business on Earth...Thematically, Oblivion is a crossover between classic post-apocalyptic films (of which there are too many to start mentioning) and a more recent and unusually interesting sci-fi flick called Moon. It is through its likeness to the latter that Oblivion is at its most interesting, book-ended by a fine subplot involving Cruise and Olga Kurylenko, whose brilliant performance elevates the film and gives it the humanity and spirit it often otherwise lacks. For the most part, this is a film which promises more than it delivers, but at least the promise is alluring and attractive like a modern art exhibition (albeit one where you feel that you'd rather get to know the artist than buy one of his works), and the action is crisp and direct, which is often the case with Tom Cruise's films.In the end, there are too many familiarities for Oblivion to make a really lasting impression, including a disappointing score by French electronica maestros M83, but Kosinski's ability to create captivating landscapes and moods makes this a more than watchworthy entry.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Tom Cruise was actually great in this one.,"By reading the reviews i only saw some positive opinions about the movie overall, i don't know, if it is only me, but i watched it and didn't feel any emotions or whatever. In my opinion the plot was really dull, for a science fiction movie like this there should be way more action.Morgan Freeman also had a very insignificant role, he literally didn't do anything, despite him being the head of the survivor base, for an actor of his caliber, i was disappointed to see him in a role like that.Despite the movie not being entertaining for me, i really like Tom Cruise's acting in this movie, that and some of the beautiful movie were the 2 aspects, that made me even continue watching it, because at the beginning i was quite bored already and the ending wasn't a shocker at all, as well.Maybe sci-fi fans love this movie, just not really my cup of tea, anyways 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
enjoyable but disappointing,"I know giving a film a 5/10 is the worst possible move as it automatically earns everyone's hate seeing as the general consensus on IMDb is to give a film a 1 or a 10 with very little scores in between. But I'm going to say that I did find this film enjoyable and thoroughly watchable, but disappointing as it could've been much more.I love the world that was created, and the tranquil scenes of Earth juxtaposed the gritty action nicely. The acting was solid all round especially from Tom Cruise who gets much more hate than he deserves, he is still one of the best actors around.So why only give this film an average score? Well, it made some rather disappointing rookie mistakes. Firstly, there were so many holes in the story. I know it's sci-fi and one must suspend their disbelief, but some of the mistakes were just sloppy. I won't elaborate for fear of spoilers but when the story finally does kick off, don't try to think about any of it too hard. This is my major issue with the film.Also, whilst Cruise's character was well developed, the others (such as Morgan Freeman) were left pretty undeveloped and hence one-dimensional. Freeman pretty much acts as the plot explainer and many of the other characters I simply did not care about as they were given virtually no screen time.If you like sci-fi action then get some popcorn and watch it for some solid entertainment with friends but don't try too hard to think it through.

Cliché Fantastic,"Like James Cameron may have said about Avatar, Oblivion is every single sic-fi movie you've already seen and it's pretty good - in fact much better than the Smurfy farce Avatar ended up being. There's plenty of Kosinki's TRON Legacy in here. Count in Matrix, the Death Star from Star Wars, HAL from 2001 and the robots from The Black Hole. Basically anything you can think of. But I still somehow liked the heck out of this movie. I don't even like Tom Cruise and I liked the heck out of this movie. It's so genuinely nerdy, it's genuine. Those Drones are actually the star of the show I think. The sound design for their menacing R2D2 speech is pretty scary stuff.I don't know what to tell you about Oblivion other than I saw it twice and I may see it again. It contributes nothing to the genre, but for some reason, I just enjoy the movie.

Really good,"For more than two hours, immerse yourself in a completely different universe, believe in the authenticity of its constituent images and the laws that exist in it. A completely different world comes to life right before your eyes. It seems that you will stretch out your hand - and now you are already somewhere there, inside. You participate, you worry, you worry. In the debut of director Joseph Kosinski ""Tron: Legacy"" this feeling did not arise, but ""Oblivion"" set a high bar. From the first frames you get into the story, you begin to believe the characters unconditionally. Despite the fact that a wonderful man and actor Tom Cruise performed in front of the same screen two minutes before the premiere, you almost immediately disconnect from this impression and immerse yourself in another world - authentic and real.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Science Fiction In Its Purest Form,"Generally speaking, my favorite films are the ones that are pretty much genre-diverse. Yet, if I do break down into genres, my favorite is science fiction. That is the reason for the five-star ranking of ""Oblivion"", as it is simply the purest form of sci-fi put to film.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees the team of Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) monitoring the water-removal from Earth after the planet has been decimated by attack (""we used the nukes"", says Jack in an opening montage). On one ""away mission"", however, Jack is blind-side by Beech (Morgan Freeman), the leader of a gang of rogues that changes everything that Jack has ever believed in (or thought he believed in).Plot-wise, this is science fiction at its finest. It is part other-worldly, part cautionary tale, part human drama, and all adventure throughout. For those who have watched a lot of sci-fi, all the basic ""landmarks"" of such stories are touched upon. It doesn't get old or feel re-hashed, though, as director Joseph Kosinski makes sure to keep the proceedings on track and moving forward.The visuals of ""Oblivion"" are also spectacular. You'll feel as if you truly are in the future via the use of interesting, integrated new technologies. This isn't one of those ""all visuals"" movies, by no means, but it would be more accurate to say that the visuals perfectly complement the story lines and characters.Overall, sci-fi fans will love ""Oblivion"" for its ability to make the mind wonder. It might not be the flick for everyone, but if it looks even at all intriguing to you it's a pretty good bet you'll at least find it somewhat enjoyable (if not much more so).",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nice way to spend and afternoon but not earth shattering,"This movie reportedly cost around 120 million. I assume that most of that was spent on the salaries Cruise and Freeman because as good as the effects were, in this day and age of PS3 and Xbox, let alone the next gen of PC games, it is almost impossible to distinguish between what is real and what is virtual. Too bad it wasn't spend making the set a bit more convincing or the story more original. Sure the Earth was devastated but did it have to be so total that only a few landmarks were left? The use of deserts always reeks of budget cuts. The design of the ""chopper"" and especially the drones wasn't as inspired as some people make it believe either. The drones could have come out of Portal and the chopper was apparently the last product Apple built before the Moon was blown up. Speaking of the shattered moon, that really looked like a painted matte. There even appeared some fire or magma which is hard to believe seeing the Moon is dead. The story had some nice twists which were pioneered in the Matrix and the end came straight out of Star Wars and Independence Day. All in all, if it wasn't for Cruise and Freeman, this movie probably would have been straight to BluRay instead of the blockbuster it undoubtedly will become.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Oblivion""- Decent entertainment but overlong, generic, simplistic and often derivative of other (better) films. Alright popcorn adventure, but far from anything special.","Tom Cruise stars as what more-or-less amounts to a glorified repair man in ""Oblivion"", a Sci-Fi adventure from director Joseph Kosinski, who was responsible for Disney's long-awaited ""Tron: Legacy."" Yes, instead of being a dashing pilot, or an adventurer, action-hero Cruise is little more than the guy who comes in to fix your pipes while accidentally exposing the top of his rear-end due to slightly saggy pants. (Although to the character's credit, he repairs advanced technology- mainly drones.)I don't know why, but the idea that Cruise is a repair-guy just sort of tickled my humorous side. Especially considering he's the most ripped, buff and ""action hero""-y repair man I've ever seen... but I digress.The film focuses on Cruise's character, Jack Harper, one of the few remaining human's colonizing Earth after a horrible battle with vile aliens known as ""Scavangers"" or ""Scavs"", which forced other survivors to flee the planet. Living with his partner (and lover) Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough), Harper oversees the maintenance of heavily armed drones, which patrol the surface in order to protect hydro-plants used for the generation of fusion energy from the remaining Scavs living on the surface. However, after discovering another surviving human named Sally (Melissa Leo), and learning more about the true nature of the Scavs, Harper is forced into a fight for survival that will leave him questioning which side he should be fighting for.The acting is actually very solid. Cruise as always proves to be a fun and charismatic lead, and despite picking on his profession above, he makes for a very solid performance, and is compelling and likable. Riseborough is also quite good in her role (and quite stunning I may add), although she doesn't have too much to do within the narrative, which was unfortunately a bit of a letdown, especially given some of the twists and turns that I will not spoil. Leo is decent in her role, and she has a lot more to do than Riseborough, although I honestly felt that both Cruise and Riseborough overshadowed her. Something about her just wasn't quite as compelling. And other supporting roles (the names of who I won't mention due to spoilers) are generally quite well-played.The direction is also very good. Kosinski is a very capable visual storyteller, and his work here is very slick, concise and stylish. I really appreciated that unlike virtually every other director working today, he doesn't over-use ""shaky-cam"" or rely on crafting a dark, gritty work. He's perfectly happy with still shots and sweeping photography, which felt like a breath of fresh air compared to most other modern Hollywood films. I'm sorry, but I wish shaky-cam and grit would just sort of go away for a while. It works sometimes, but Hollywood is just too obsessed with it.The rest of the production is also quite nice. While the costume and set design is a bit generic (for example, the Scav's suits look almost identical to predators from the movie... um... ""Predator""), it's all of a very high quality. And the visual effects were quite nice, and didn't take me out of the story as they do in other films.However, the problem here is not the production, cast or direction. The issue is the script by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn, based on an unpublished comic by director Joseph Kosinski. It's just not very good. It's about 15 minutes too long, quite generic, overly simplistic and often derivative of many other (much better) Sci-Fi adventure films. It's not all that compelling a story either, nor is it particularly original. And it was loaded with a lot of sequences that felt like unneeded filler. Many people have commented that the film seems to contain countless tropes and ideas from Sci-Fi film history, which I agree with, and believe it cheapens the story to an extent. Unfortunately, while the rest of the film is actually very good, the script is just mediocre to the point it drags the entire thing down a few points.Which is a shame.I think this had potential. With another re-write or two, it could've even potentially become a modern Sci-Fi masterpiece. But with the script that they used, I unfortunately can't give this film anything more than a pretty- good 7 out of 10.I think this film is still definitely worth giving a shot, and a lot of people will find it fun and entertaining... but don't expect much thought or heart to be there. Because it isn't there.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nothing monumental. Really enjoyed it nonetheless :),"In a world where the post-apocalyptic/alien invasion setting has been done a thousand times over, it's certainly difficult to find something that sets itself aside from the others. Oblivion is one such film. Though some have complained about the clichés and plot holes, I personally believe that it easily makes up for these things with its originality in concept and overall likability. I have tried to find another movie to compare it to. I just can't. No other film of this kind has left me so intrigued and then satisfied at the films conclusion. And when I say intriguing, I mean really intriguing. Even the bad marketing that Oblivion had prior to its release didn't ruin this. Now I may be praising this film but I do acknowledge the issues that others have brought up. It's far from a perfect film. Oblivion just appealed to me in a special way... Its a delightful treat of originality with some clichés sprinkled here and there. If you can learn to look past it's issues and enjoy oblivion for its original concepts, intriguing plot, likable characters, on screen romance, and highly satisfying ending, this film delivers.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A fairly forgettable end of the world scenario,"A 2013 film by Neil Blomkamp featuring a future, post apocalyptic Earth and a defeated humanity.Planet Earth was attacked by Aliens and a war ensued. In order to win the war, humans had to lose the planet. They waged was with the aliens, launching nuclear warheads thus leaving Earth ravaged with radiation. The Plan B for humanity is the moon of Titan, humans have been shepherded off to survive there. Those who aren't already there are on a massive space ship just outside of Earth's atmosphere waiting to be taken. There is hardly any trace of human beings left on the planet. Two people that are still there are Jack and Victoria (Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough). They are maintaining drones and robotic equipment meant to take the last of the resources on Earth in order to allow humanity on Titan to prosper. They do their jobs and don't ask questions - they are an effective team. By night Jack is haunted by visions in his dreams but by day he risks life and limb maintaining equipment and dealing with scavengers, the left over aliens who have no hope of leaving Earth again. One day a human spaceship, the Odyssey, crash lands on earth, beckoned by a signal that the scavengers have set up in an old communications tower. This event changes everything and Jack soon starts thinking that not everything is as it seems and how he's been told.This was an enjoyable film albeit not that complex and surprising, I was able to guess the outcome and ending before it unfolded on screen. The cast are authentic but not that deep or complex, the most complex part of the make up was Jack's random dreams which sell the way the film is going. I haven't seen Andrea Riseborough in anything else and she was authentic and refreshing, the same applies for Olga Kurylenko (Julia). Morgan Freeman (Beech) plays the same character he usually does, intelligent but smart-mouthed. It's nice to see Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Sykes) not covered in dirt and blood (a-la Game of Thrones) but he comes across as bland and forgettable which was a pity.The film is all very straightforward and there is no disruption to the narrative or anybody who wants to question the situation. Even when uncovering the truth it's all very straight forward, nobody argues and they just accept what is being said. The big twist in the film is obvious and shouldn't surprise anyone. The saving grace for this film is backdrop and scenery, it shows Earth beauty despite some radiation ravaged landscapes. It reminded me a little of the kind of environment you'd expect to find in the game ""Fallout 3"", the only things missing where the mutants and rad-scorpions. Despite being a big budget Hollywood film this felt almost second class and it isn't a film I'll remember in a few weeks time. The CGI was finely executed and the set was top notch and imaginative but with very little in the way of plot and story the film was never going to leave an everlasting mark on film history. This is one of the more light hearted post apocalypse films I have seen in recent years. A lot of style over substance I'm going to give this 6 out of 10 - not the worst film but definitely not living up to the potential it had.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thoroughly underrated movie,"This movie is actually quite awesome and gets better with each viewing. Hands down one of Tom Cruise's best performances, also underrated.

To not be who you think, to not be on the right side and not know it, to be stuck with someone else's memories... and it's quite though provoking to think about the meaning behind these memories and what it means to be someone.Shout out also to the special effects which are among the best post- apocalyptic renditions I've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A very well made Sci-Fi movie. Reminds of many Sci-Fi movies yet is distinct in its own ways.,"I don't believe I was late in watching this movie. But am glad i did. The concept of the movie is awesome! It just keeps you guessing throughout the film.If you like sci-fi, you will surely enjoy this one. The whole presentation of the movie is classic! The action, the actors, wonderful visuals of earth, the music and the well-done special effects, simply superb!Tom Cruise is at his best. I love Morgan Freeman and he is also done a great job in the movie.I would surely recommend to watch it if you haven't!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Positive Surprise,"I didn't have high hopes, when I went to see this.Immediately though I was captivated by the beautiful visual style in both the landscape, architecture and especially the cool technology (HUDs and touch-screens etc.). It was simply stunning!As for the plot, it wasn't too original as such, but I loved the ""husband and housewife"" -interplay between ""Jack"" and ""Victoria"". It was somehow cozy to see a single couple alone in a vast rough environment - together, but separated. There was a distinct air of longing about the whole setup.One of the most memorable (and silliest) moments was when ""Jack"" rode his motorcycle for a long stretch of desert. Seemed kinda pointless for him to have to use a motorcycle but it was a nice scene otherwise.Which brings me to the music. I loved it. I give the movie 8/10 for the visual style, music and the bitter-sweet chemistry between the main characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fascinating, visual delight","A man on a workaday mission in a post-apocalyptic Earth discovers secrets about his home planet - and himself. He comes to realize he's just a simple pawn, that he's been set up. He is, at times, on the run from those who had employed him. If you guessed that maybe this was a Tom Cruise movie, you'd be right. Poor old Tom is always getting set up and having to figure out what's what. But, like his earlier Minority Report, Cruise's latest sci-fi is a lot of fun, beautifully shot and tightly plotted.It's the future, sometime, I forget when. Giant bugs invaded Earth. We kicked their butts with nukes, thus rendering almost the entire planet unlivable. Those who survived the war were shuttled off to eventually settle on Jupiter's moon Titan. Meanwhile, drones are set up in low Earth orbit to monitor and destroy any surviving bad guys, known as Scavs. You know, short for scavengers. Nothing grows. It's a big ol' wasteland, this planet.Jack Harper (Cruise) is a soldier who has the task of being the clean-up crew; he and his colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are in charge of monitoring the drones and the extraction machines that are removing water from Earth's surface to bring it to a huge space station called the Tet, humanity's escape vessel. All Jack has to do each day is check on the drones, fly around in a funny looking ship, and blast away the occasional Scav while ensuring that the rigs gulping down the water are still operational.The Earth at this point is divided into at least two zones: inhabitable (kind of) and radioactive. The rigs are working in the former area, trying to squeeze all they can out of the planet before Jack and Victoria have to head up to the Tet - in two weeks' time.But something funny is going on, down there on Earth. A simple recon mission to check out a rig leads Jack to believe he's not alone down there, and the truth - well, the first truth is shocking enough to him (he's been there a long time, though he has almost no memory of a time before the War), and the second is a stunner to the nth degree.Certainly, to give more information would spoil the film for you. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Tom Cruise movie in which there was a surprise of some sort. And his acting was better than usual, too - he's human, not a cardboard monkey playing dress up. When confronted with the truth, he's as befuddled as we are, which is unusual for a Tom Cruise character; they typically Know It All and Save the Day. Not so sure that's the case here.His Jack also shows quite a bit of depth. We get glimpses of his past, through his own fractured memories. He can't shake them. He dreams about things that seem familiar and yet unknowable. He is introspective and cocky. He is daring, yet unsure. He is human.Morgan Freeman shows up in a role that cannot be explicated here except to say that he's Morgan Freeman. Melissa Leo is Sally, the commander of the Tet who checks in with Jack and Victoria every day to see how those rigs are a-comin' along (Southern accent). Both are excellent as always.I came away from Oblivion with a strong sense of satisfaction. The ending feels right; it's not contrived, it's not forced, it's not really Hollywood. That's not to say this isn't a feel-good movie, because in many ways it is. Just not the way you'd expect from the beginning of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Visual Delight!,"Joseph Kosinski's 'Oblivion' is a visual delight, that offers some of the most stunning images you'd see on celluloid. Also, the action-sequences are remarkable!'Oblivion' Synopsis: A veteran assigned to extract Earth's remaining resources begins to question what he knows about his mission and himself.'Oblivion' falters in the Writing department. Kosinski, Karl Gajdusek & Michael Arndt's Screenplay is thin & snail-paced. It does have its share of intriguing moments, but somewhere, the desired impact, as a whole of a Screenplay, is missing. Kosinski's Direction, however, is amazing. Each and Every Frame has been worked on & the immense handwork reflects on-screen throughout. Visually, I haven't seen a film as stunning as 'Oblivion' is a really long time. Its so beautifully made, that I was awed by its visuals. Even the action-sequences, as mentioned before, are remarkable. Cinematography is grand. Editing is pretty sharp. Art & Costume Design are extra-ordinary.Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise is first-rate. He plays the troubled Commander with rare ease. Andrea Riseborough is highly efficient. Olga Kurylenko is perfect. Morgan Freeman leaves a mark. Melissa Leo is fair.On the whole, 'Oblivion' should be watched for its masterful visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid SciFi,"A good story, though maybe a little light for some.A drone repair men is sent back to Earth after a war with an alien species has sent us to the stars while we wait for the remaining aliens to be mopped up by said drones.No one I watched this with had trouble picking the minor twists and turns the plot takes, but it was quite fun talking about it after the movie. Also it leaves quite a lot unanswered, but sometimes that is half the fun, once again spurring conversation.There were a few minor plot holes and ideas that make you question the motive behind those making them, but nothing that ruins the good mood of the film.Overall enjoyable and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cruise Delivers Again,"The year's 2077. Earth has become a desolate & remote planet after an attack - and subsequent destruction - on the moon by alien beings called Scavengers. The human race now inhabit Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, but Jack Harper (Cruise), who's a clone & security technician, has been assigned to stay on earth along with girlfriend Victoria (Riseborough), who's a communications officer, and keep the Scavs from trying to destroy important buildings known as hydros. However, after rescuing a single survivor from a crash site then reluctantly coming into contact with the Scavs, he discovers that everything's not as it seems on earth.Put bluntly Oblivion is an absolute epic feast for the eyes. Everything's shot on such a massive scale with the special & visual effects being nothing short of stunning right the way through. After watching, you can definitely see why the film cost an estimated $120m to produce.Story-wise, it's nothing really original or special, but that doesn't make it bad, and it's well played out at a good steady pace. There aren't really any boring parts either, and it definitely keeps your attention. Pay close attention though, because if you don't you can become lost pretty easily (as I found out with my wife about a third of the way through after I heard a muttered ""I'm lost"").Like him or loathe him, Tom Cruise delivers once again. He may seem a bit out there at times off-screen, but on-screen he brings it home and plays the part of Harper so well. Riseborough is a touch annoying with her ""butter wouldn't melt"" English accent and persona, but thankfully it's not enough to ruin the movie. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman. Absolute brilliance no matter what he's in or how long he's in it for.Overall, if you love sci-fi movies which are set on a massive scale such as this, or even just sci-fi movies in general, then you will be drooling over this one. Even if sci-fi isn't your main thing, Oblivion is most definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Isn't as bad as everyone says it is,"I really enjoy this movie. It's movie is very complex and I recommend seeing it again. It has a lot of great ideas and has interesting characters I'm invested in. The story is set in the far future. It has been evacuated and abandoned due to an alien invasion by creators named ""scavs"". A drone-repair man named Jack and partner Vika are the last sent there to clean up. Both of them have memories, though only Jack's are seen and in his dream there is a woman who is always there. He has no idea who she is and it's driving him mad. Then bang! A ship crashes on Earth and guess who's on it? The woman of his dreams, literally! For content: one F word at the end, Vika and Jack go skinny-dipping, the noises the drones make are pretty frightening, some gun violence. PG-13 stuff, pretty mild. To all those who say it was too confusing, it wasn't too hard to follow (at least for me). It's one of those movies that requires a lot of deep attention and similar to a movie like Inception, it asks questions but leaves audiences to fill in the blanks. That's one of the things I love about this movie, almost makes me feel like I'm in part creating the story. Don't expect clear answers, it's meant to be a movie that makes you think and theorize and it has a basic enough story that you can connect the pieces a little more clearly than something like Inception.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oh Movies,"Respect to the craft. they built a real spaceship (basically). Acting was great. Visuals divine. twist and turns i can appreciate. Let us agree there can only be one inception. Complicating a movie does automatically give it a certain level of sophistication. It is a predictable movie in many aspects, and the other half is simply confusing. It is not a movie that you are likely to think about twice, or remember throughout time. It has a story though, it has a cast. Nevertheless, as i usually say i am a big fan of ""find out yourself."" who knows for you it just might be your movie of the year.

"This movie had all the potential in the world, but it ended up as a slow, confusing mess.","Hello! This is Garrett with my first movie review! To start off, I'm doing a recent Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion. This movie is set in the future. The moon has exploded and Jack Reacher and his partner, who I forgot the name of, have to repair these drones for some organization. But weird things happen, yeah, it's kind of hard to explain. Okay, now onto the review. The story itself is pretty good. It brings us an interesting plot that is pretty thought provoking. But, it's really confusing! All these weird things happen and the movie doesn't do a great job explaining the situation, leaving some obvious plot holes. It's one of those movies where you have to see a lot of sci-fi movies to truly get. The acting is pretty good. It's nothing phenomenal, but it's still pretty good. The characters themselves are bland an uninspired. The only truly likable characters are Jack Reacher and Morgan Freeman (because, you know, he's Morgan Freeman). All the other characters are completely one dimensional. The character developments and relationships aren't much better. They're pretty weak and not well explained. I want to know what happened in the past, not just small snippets. I want to know what got the characters in this state. It doesn't do good explaining. The action scenes are pretty cool. They're flashy gun battles that really keep you on the edge of your seat, but they're interrupted by really, slow, boring, uninteresting character developments. At least the movie did justice at the end, which wrapped up the movie in a great way. The dialogue is, for the most part, pretty good. There are some lines that come off cheesy and pointless. It's a small complaint, but it is noticeable. Overall, the movie was decent. It had a good plot and sweet action only to be interrupted by weak character developments and confusing plot twists. The movie is still enjoyable, but it's not what it could've been. If you want to see it, rent it. It's not good enough for a buy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cruise-Helmed Generic Sci-Fi That's More Concerned with Impressive Visuals Than Fresh Thoughts,"Tom Cruise plays the last man on Earth, a high-tech janitor of sorts who's left to mind the planet's robotic chaperones while the rest of the species lives it up on one of Saturn's moons. It's slow, predictable and riddled with holes, but the production's cache of slick, attractive future tech and constant visual revelations make for excellent diversions. Cruise's sleekly designed equipment is a real science fiction goldmine, visionary in the same sense as Minority Report's giant touch-screen UIs, and the first hour is an outstanding lesson in world-building. The plot eventually falls into too many Cruise / mainstream Hollywood pitfalls, though, and borrows too liberally from other films. Duncan Jones's excellent Moon, in particular, is robbed of all but its subtlety, performances and locale. Still, such faults are hardly surprising by this point and if you were anticipating something more... well, maybe an adjustment in expectations is in order. Perfectly acceptable as a conceptual exercise, but make sure you swallow that grain of salt before viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A fun cyberpunk romp,"I thought it was fun and interesting. It could have explored some themes a lot better but I suspect there's more depth there than people first thought. It seems like Tom Cruise is pretty into cyberpunk. Vanilla Sky, Oblivion, Minority Report. Feels like buddy likes it. And so do I. This movie deserves a 7, I think. It was enjoyable, if a bit transparent but acting was good, production values were great, some great shots, and as I said, deeper than some might have thought initially.So I debated as to if this is cyberpunk or not and in the end I think it is. With all these movies when I give my thoughts here there will be spoilers I'm sure.There's a stark contrast of colours in use: Tech is always white from the guns to his ship. It's always in stark contrast to organic substance.He begins with always seeking out a more organic life as the system can't fulfill what he's looking for. Including changing into other clothes and having an existence entirely separate from his purpose and the system in place.His very nature is what ultimately sets him free, a very cyberpunk theme and while he's searching for this elusive thing, the music is almost always very cyberpunk and it changes to something else when he's on task for the system.When he does finally deviate from exactly what he's supposed to do in a way that is essentially a form of desertion he's told this: ""... I can't protect you""Also it's telling that the ""scad"" are not portrayed as human until the protagonist goes against the system and is forced to learn the truth, all the while within he's bathed in a spotlight no less. But is being held in a dirty, grungy place. Which his uniform now is, for the entire rest of the movie.""You're not who you think you are""A prevailing theme in it is nature vs technology, it is constantly rebelling against tech. For instance the system can't track him when he's literally inside of it, multiple lightning strikes disable tech during the course of the movie, and he continues to remember things despite whatever tech was used for him to be reprogrammed.As in most cyberpunk, the punishment is death for not being apart of the system, often the death of others close to the protagonist. Often this comes with an unwelcome truth, as it did here as well.Technology is neutral within the setting, with both sides using it as they see fit. While not typical of cyberpunk, it isn't straying from it either as the protagonist could be viewed as technology themselves. With nature vs tech vying over him constantly throughout the film with his memories vs programming.When they're running away in their hideout as they're being attacked, there is flickering lights in their sanctuary meaning that the system is there and things are in contention. This seems to happen in pretty much allllll western cyberpunk films. Probably from noir?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The narration felt tacked on and uninspired.

Visually impressive sci-fi drama,"It's 2077. The Earth has been rendered virtually uninhabitable after an alien invasion that took place sixty-some years earlier. Even though the humans technically ""won"" the war (using nuclear weapons which pretty much wiped everything out), most of the planet's survivors have long since moved to a colony on one of Saturn's moons, leaving behind only a handful of people, like Tom Cruise's Commander Jack Harper, as part of the "" mop-up crew,"" whose job is to repair drones and to make sure the alien remnant known as the ""scavengers"" don't interfere with the continued production of fusion power from the oceans that is needed by the humans living up on Titan.Complications arise when Jack rescues a female flight commander (Olga Kurylenko) whose vehicle is shot down by Scavs. Trouble is he thinks he may remember her from a time before he had his memory ""swiped"" as a needed security precaution given the sensitive nature of his job and mission.""Oblivion"" is a visually elegant film from director Joseph Kosinski, adapted from his graphic novel, which was never published. The screenplay by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn has some of the opaqueness of ""Inception,"" as, like a master card dealer, it shuffles the planes of reality to the point where the characters and the audience can't quite make out what is actual and what is a mixture of dreams, memories and alternate realities. Similarly, the filmmakers seamlessly blend CGI action, metaphysics and a surprise, turnabout ending to create a subtle, thought-provoking vision of technology in a post-apocalyptic future.""Oblivion"" takes its time telling its story, more concerned with mood and impression than with whiz bang action and plot details - though it doesn't stint on either of those two things either.Andrea Riseborough, Melissa Leo and Morgan Freeman round out the cast, though Freeman's character feels more plot contrivance than genuine person.""Oblivion"" isn't a completely satisfying movie in the final analysis, but its effective balance of tone and glorious visuals makes it worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A solid and visually pretty sci-fi film,"You know, I'm going to cut right to the chase and admit that I find it somewhat hard to find myself compelled to talk about a movie that I don't have a strong opinion on- when I write a review, I like it to be on a movie that I either really really like or really really dislike. I just find it easier and more enjoyable to talk about a movie that I feel strongly about. So in all honesty, I'm finding it a little difficult to muster up enthusiasm to discuss the latest Tom Cruise film Oblivion. I saw it last night, and honestly, it was pretty good, but not great- hence why I feel a little reluctant to talk about it. The fact that the movie has so many twists and turns also makes me feel a little hesitant to review the film, so I'll keep this one kind of brief, and refrain from giving away any plot details.All you really need to know going into this film is that its science fiction and Tom Cruise is the star- the plot is so full of twists (some impressive and some kind of ""meh"") that it's probably in your best interest to go into the film free of any spoilers, be them major or minor in nature (remember kids: ""spoilers absolutely suck""). And besides, the plot is spelt out for you so literally thanks to a five minute opening narration from Cruise's character that you don't really need any context going into this.I have to say though that this led to a kind of underwhelming beginning, as his narration goes on for a long time and causes little to be left to the imagination, at least for the first portion of the film. The voiceover is a cinematic technique that I've never really made up my mind on; sometimes it can work really well (see Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece Sunset Boulevard), yet sometimes it feels awkward and unnecessary (see the infamous theatrical cut of Blade Runner, with a disgruntled and bored-sounding Harrison Ford). The voiceover in Oblivion isn't a prevalent force throughout the entire film, but it does overstay its welcome in the film's prologue. I found myself wishing that the film had found a slightly more subtle and natural way to introduce us to the film's world and its characters.Thankfully though this voiceover (which I keep rambling on about for some reason) is accompanied by some absolutely stunning imagery, which, unlike the voiceover (there I go again) is a constant presence in the film. Seriously, this film is absolutely gorgeous, and without any gimmicky, blurry, distracting 3D effects, it is, simply put, a joy to look at. Everything is so smooth, white, and so very very shiny, and though the film takes place on a desolate and destroyed Earth, it's still just so staggeringly beautiful. This is perhaps one of the most visually awe-inspiring films I've seen for a while. The look of this film, along with the soundtrack by M83, are the two main elements of the film that are receiving near unanimous praise, and deservedly so, in my opinion.Other elements of the film have proven more divisive. While I'm all for unpredictability in narratives, and therefore I'm a pretty decent fan of the odd plot twist here and there, Oblivion has a lot of them- maybe too much, to the point where every-time a new big reveal was made I almost felt like rolling my eyes and saying ""really, another one?"" And I also have to mention that while the twists are for the most part fairly well-executed, and often unexpected, a number of them have been damn near ripped off from other science fiction films. Of course I can't say which twists they are, and where they've been borrowed from, as I'd rather not spoil any movie in this review, but at least a few of the twists have been seen in other pieces of science fiction, which honestly hurts the film as it makes the twists in Oblivion feel less exciting and surprising, because they're twists that some of us may have already witnessed in other, earlier works of science fiction.Tom Cruise probably deserves a mention though- he gives a good performance and really does help carry the film. The supporting cast is good, but none of the other characters are given as much screen time as everybody's favourite scientologist. It's not a one-man show for Cruise by any means, but he is undoubtedly the film's star.I've never been the hugest fan of Cruise, but I fully respect and understand why he is so immensely popular, and has been for so long. I tend to enjoy his performances, but I do think he often has a tendency to over-act and this makes his performances sometimes a little hard to take seriously (the yelling scene from Born on the Fourth of July anyone? Or how about his wheelchair fight with Willem Defoe from the same film?) Maybe this is why one of his most deliberately goofy performances of his career also happens to be one of my personal favourites of his- I'm talking about his small yet so very memorable role in Tropic Thunder.And there's his infamous antics outside of his films that are so highly publicised and talked about that it makes Tom Cruise the actor hard to separate from Tom Cruise's characters- the man is so well-known and so frequently discussed that it makes it impossible to watch a Tom Cruise performance without being aware that you are indeed watching Tom Cruise.But hey, he's still around, and he's still dedicating himself to most of the roles he takes, so he does deserve respect. And his reliability in Hollywood is undeniable- it's amazing that he has been such a reliable actor for so long considering how unstable celebrity gossip sites and tabloid papers will tell you he is.Anyway, that's about all I want to say about Oblivion. I'm sorry I didn't really go into depth with this review, but it really is best to go into this film without knowing too much about it at all. It is a good film, but it's probably not going to stick with you like the best science fiction films often do. It's a good time at the movies though for sure, and if you just want to go and watch something visually spectacular, then this is the movie for you. The soundtrack, acting, and direction are all solid, and I really can't say I ever felt all that bored during it's 126 minute running time.Still, it never achieves greatness. An over-reliance on twists, some that may prove familiar to some members of the audience, a forced and overly-long opening narration and some less than stellar character development harm this film in the narrative department, but it's definitely not a waste of time. I recommend Oblivion, but I'd advise audiences to enter the film with moderate expectations- a new science-fiction classic this is not.3 and a half out of 5 stars, 7/10, B, etc...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pure Science Fiction,"Tom Cruise is a futuristic astronaut of sorts salvaging the rest of earth's resources after some big war with Aliens. Humans win the war, but the earth is unlivable, so everyone packs up and goes to some other planet or moon or something, I forget, but its atmosphere is compatible for us. Or is that what's going on? It keeps you guessing enough to be interested and answers your question sufficiently at the end. You do wonder what the heck is really going on here for a good part of the movie, but it's not so confusing that you lose interest. The concept kind of reminds me of After Earth, but Oblivion is better and takes an interesting turn whereas After Earth is pretty boringly straight forward. Say what you want to about Tom Cruise, he does get pretty good rolls and he does a pretty good job in the end.

Oblivion or Oblivious?,"Oblivion or Oblivious? Well, the former is verging on the latter, it has to be said...I'm a big lover of science fiction, in its many forms. As a child I avidly read Asimov, Clarke and many more. I bought the first issue of 2000AD, the comic which introduced us to Judge Dredd. I'm sure it had a plastic spinning disc with three arms in the centre stuck to the front as a free gift... I once had a sew on arm patch from an Apollo mission and a poster for Revenge of the Jedi.That's right... I said 'Revenge'.As a movie addict, I devour the films. Whether it's 2001: A Space Odyssey,Star Wars, the X-Men films (I used to read their comics too), Event Horizon, Black Hole, I, Robot and more, I'd rush to watch and thoroughly enjoy being taken away to times and realities far from my own.I'm quite partial to most Tom Cruise films too. Action and adventure, thrills and spills, they all entice me. I wasn't over keen on the last Mission Impossible film, however. Great ideas and stunts, but should the gadgets go wrong? I don't think so. I love Simon Pegg, and he was great as the franchise's 'Q' character, but those gloves, the mask creator doodad and so on. Part of the essence of MI was the spectacular inventions as well as the non-stop action.Cruise was good in Collateral and I thought inspired in Rock of Ages. Rain Man is a classic (though Dustin Hoffman steals the film).2015, the Year of the Blockbuster brings us another outing from the Mission Impossible stable, but it has to go up against new iterations of Independence Day, Star Wars, Terminator, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Avengers, Finding Dory (Nemo), Fantastic Four, Jurassic Park, James Bond, Avatar, Hunger Games, Alvin & the Chipmunks (?!) and Inferno (Dan Brown). There's also slated a Warcraft film, Assassin's Creed, another Kung Fu Panda, the Penguins of Madagascar and possibly even a Prometheus 2! And breathe.Oh, and prepare my tent for camping out at the Parkway (my local cinema in Cleethorpes - great place!) So. I had high hopes, as Kodaline might say, of Oblivion. It's a bit of a surprise that I hadn't found myself watching it long before now, but life waits for no film, hence I didn't. So there. Last night I had chance of a quiet moment or two and decided, finally, to go for a bit of a Cruise.It started out slow. Probably, I thought, building the tension. Waiting for the huge climax. Interspersing the film with pathos and then flipping into explosions and stunts and breathlessness.After a while of not a lot happening, I interrupted my viewing for 20 minutes of the 30 Day Shred (day 4). I was certainly more breathless from this than anything Oblivion had thrown at me thus far. I then returned to the movie hoping things would pick up.They did, but they also didn't. I won't give anything away about the plot (I had my fingers burned when I accidentally let slip a very important fact regarding the wonderful Judi Dench's brilliant M portrayal in Skyfall - oops), but then, there wasn't much of one to give away.The various set pieces, for me, weren't big enough. They didn't draw out the tension and I couldn't find myself particularly feeling for the characters. I didn't fear the Predator lookey-like Scavs. Olga Kurylenko is decidedly lovely, though, but her performance was a touch wooden. I was disappointed with Morgan Freeman - something I could never imagine myself saying. Shawshank is one of my all time favourites. I thought he was a fab God in the Almighty films. I even liked him in Dreamcatcher. Unfortunately, his brief appearance in this left me cold. It was too predictable. It had been done too many times before.And we knew, didn't we, he'd go for that gun turret? There were many things that could have been built on, the events in the Radiation Zone for one. I thought many of the ideas were good, but none of this film was particularly new. And Independence Day 2 is coming out in a couple of years, please don't steal ideas from the first and then do them so blandly! I could go on, but this film did it for me (went on). It's a shame. The cast was good. The ideas were there, but they weren't developed.It was fine for a bit of entertainment, but just a bit. At the end, I asked myself if I'd enjoyed it, but couldn't really answer. I didn't NOT enjoy it, but that's not the same thing.The shower afterwards and a mind spinning through various aspects of Visual basic code I was trying to figure out helped me ease into sleep.Oblivion could almost have done that itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An excellent sci-fi movie.,"I had my doubts, to be honest, about this movie. I thought it would be shallow and visually oriented movie without much effort put in the plot. Boy I was wrong - luckily.This movie is a lot of fun to watch. The plot is very interesting, without ever becoming boring. I really like the whole scenario. Acting is very good, Tom Cruise really nailed this one in my opinion. Sound effects are great. Visually, the movie brings some beautiful scenes (mostly through showing things completely opposite of each other like barren lands and hi tech objects).I think this is one of the best sci-fi movies in recent years.Are you still an effective team?",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Easy: One of the most awful, totally incomprehensible movies I have  ever seen in my life! Incredibly stupid!","I will repeat what I said above in my Summary and add a bit more. This movie is beyond terrible. Tom Cruise should get a new job--perhaps a commentator on Scientology radio?--and forget acting.I am not a dope--an HLS grad--but this thing was so out of it that any dissatisfied viewers (I hope there were many, despite the amazingly high rating the unscientific IMDb poll gave to this unfathomable work) should join in a class action to have their money refunded and obtain extra damages for emotional distress.Not only was Cruise poor, but Morgan Freeman was even worse. The female leads were so bad it is hard for me to imagine how they were chosen in the first place. ETC.

An epic 'pick and mix' of Sci-Fi classics.,"I so wish I hadn't seen The Matrix, Star Wars, Mad Max, Armageddon, or in fact many other great futuristic, apocalyptic or space themed movies, as this film wouldn't have got a 6, it would have been a ten!The pro's of this film are: The score, (Which is wonderful), the cinematography and the visual effects. It is beautifully made and the CGI doesn't affect or interfere with the flow of the movie.The cons are: The script is somewhat plagiarized from other films of this kind. In fact its the Sci-Fi equivalent of ' Hot Shots' or 'Scary Movie'. What I mean is, you see the influences of many film's in this one. Also, its a ninety minute film, not two and a half hours.Don't get me wrong, its a good film, some may even say its fantastic. Others, who have seen all the above mentioned movies, will say its rubbish. I think I am being fair and judging it on its merits, its OK as a movie and I enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Overly Complicated Plot That Melted My Head,OblivionThis was a fabulous panoramic movie that just needed a big screen. It was beyond my brain to make sense of this labyrinthine plot.I enjoyed it but much didn't add up and the conclusion was less than satisfactory.

The scenery, house and personal plane Cruise used were all interesting and fun as well.But -- Here is the kicker -- It's SLLOOooow. After almost an hour and a half into this film, you still don't know what it's about or where it's going. The last 20 or 30 minutes completely saves the film. All the stuff that was cool to look at wore off in the first hour, then I spent the next half hour bored. It actually winds up being pretty good later and it sums up the story and loose ends fairly nicely and becomes a whole lot more interesting.The problem is, it takes SOOOooo long to get there, that by the time you do, you have to wonder if you even care anymore.

My Favorite Tom Cruise Film In Years,"Oblivion is an interesting and refreshing entry in the Sci-Fi genre. Lately the Sci-Fi films that have come out are mainly style over substance. The Transformers films are ones that quickly come to mind. I am a big fan of science fiction! Oblivion and the new Star Trek movie are the two movies that I wanted to see most this summer. I was not disappointed with this film! Oblivion is a film that makes you think. When I watched this film in the theater I did not fully understand what was going on. When I thought about it more on the way home I began to piece everything together. I like science fiction films that can do that. This kinda film reminded me of films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of the atmosphere and tone. It also reminded me of films like Wall-e and I Am Legend.The special effects of this movie are fantastic. This film is able to create a beautiful looking world, and immersing the audience in it. The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about. Morgan Freeman's character is also likable. The other characters though are pretty bland.Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning. There is not much action in this movie either. The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it. The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is. However, I find Oblivion a very refreshing and enjoyable Sci-Fi film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

O.K,"I think oblivion is an solid movie but it has some flaws in my opinion.First of let me say that I really like Tom cruise and I'm a big fan of his movies. Especially movies like edge of tomorrow, which I really enjoyed. This movie isn't as good as that but it is quite enjoyable either way.The acting is solid. Especially Andrea ( the one who plays Victoria.) She brings tension and makes you feel a little bit on edge as you are watching.. Tom was also great but if you ask me not his strongest performance.I would say on the other hand that the pacing of the movie wasn't the best. It felt slow sometimes. And the plot was nothing special.. quite easy to figure out ( idk maybe I have watches to many movies )But overall I enjoyed it and If you are a science fiction fan and are looking for a solid decent movie with great cinematography I would definitely recommend watching.Final verdict 6.5.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Glossy packaging, but it's all dumb inside","The setup is simple enough, bad dudes blew up the moon and so we nuked them all. The loss of the moon's stabilising effect on the earth combined with all the nuclear fallout meant humanity sought refuge elsewhere. But we're still using the earth to suck up all the deuterium from the seas for fusion energy and to protect these installations we got a bunch of heavily armed autonomous drones that kill any ""scavs"" they find.It all looks sorta pretty but the problems in this film quickly build up and compound on each other to the point where very quickly not a goddamn thing makes any sense.Apparently 64 years from now humanity has access to fusion energy so I suppose getting the last few survivors to Titan isn't too big of a problem but mining Saturn's hydrogen atmosphere for deuterium is out of the question? And we totally can't deal with the radiation but our main character who works on the surface and gets dust blown into his face doesn't need ANY form of protection other than the clothes he wears? Also earthquakes were too much of a bother but a -180°c mean temperature is not?Oh and the high risk job of drone maintenance that requires our hero mechanic to be armed with not just a side-arm but an honest to goodness assault rifle, that can totally be done by just one guy, right? Better not give him a couple mates that can at least keep a look out so his bike doesn't get stolen, that'd be boring.Did I mention by the way that our protagonist has a bobble head doll that's got sentimental value to him? No? Well now I have and I'm happy I shared that with you because little details like that are very important to bring to your attention because otherwise how else would you understand Tom Cruise is a human who likes motorcycles and football and has height issues?This film is just plain badly written. The way it glosses over everything substantive and wastes an inordinate amount of time on heavy handed characterisation is very reminiscent of bottom rung comic books.Avoid",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Captivating movie with great visuals,"Oblivion is a Sci-Fi, action adventure movie directed by Joseph Kosinski and stars Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Melissa Leo.Oblivion is undoubtedly a great visual experience and also defines the imaginative brilliance of the director in capturing post-apocalyptic earth and also the earth in the year 2077 with barren lands, dried seas, broken bridges which shows the aftermath of a war and powerful drones, futuristic smart and floating homes with some great aircraft which shows the growth of technology.In terms of screenplay the movie is gripping and the larger part of the movie is unpredictable but becomes little predictable as soon as the movie approaches to it's climax. The screenplay also becomes directionless in the middle but will not disappoint you.Tom Cruise has once again proved his already proven potential, Olga and Andrea was good but i was disappointed as Morgan Freeman the power house of talent is wasted as he could've been used much better.Overall the movie is captivating with powerful visuals and good acting. A Must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not quite there yet,"Oblivion is a beautifully shot movie. That all can be seen in the trailer already. The overall story is quite good also, and acting is satisfactory. This is mainly a Tom Cruise solo movie and the character feels like it's TOM CRUISE all the way. I did not feel at any point that this person was actually Jack Harper. That is the same problem with Tom Cruise and Will Smith lately.Acting obviously is a big part of a movie (especially one with as scarce amount of personnel as this one) but all other aspects are equally as important. Like said there are many good pieces here but they are not connecting perfectly and well-thought out story has gaps in it's little nuances. Also, many plot turns are sourced from classic scifi movies with some variation.It's not really easy describing the story of the movie without spoiling anything so I wont do it. People will be better of reading the general description and just go and view the movie themselves. In regards of similar content to this film I think ""The Moon"" by Duncan Jones was overall success. Still, this was not a bad movie by any means, but it was unfortunately not a memorable or great one either. Having said what I said about Cruise, he does his best and I am not sure if a less unknown star would have done any better in the role.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Think hard what movies from last year or the last few years live in your mind today (The Avengers, for me from last summer Star Trek reboot, Iron Man 1 and even Thor) But not remembered at least for me the last Batman, MI GP, Captain America This movie falls in to that group it was good just not remember-able.Part of the movie that worked really well is the love story. The movie used a very different plot line but played it out a bit slow. By time the story developed you were not riding along you were ahead of the story. Most people knew what was going to be said before it was said on screen. The tech used in the movie was great from the bubble ship to the control tower and the drones.

"The result of Hollywood spending millions on a film, and nothing on script","I saw Oblivion when it first came out. I thought it was going to be a great movie; good effects, scripting and story. But to my horror I was stuck in a two hour long snoozefest! The storyline was just over clichèd to the point where you could actually guess the line they were going to say! The effects were very good though and that was the best part of the film. The film was just boring. It was far too long and had no character development or even good acting. If they shortened the run time to 1hr 30mins maybe the film would have been bearable. I give Oblivion a 5/10 - 1 star for acting 4 stars for the visual effects which were in all honesty, brilliant. Ladies and gentlemen; Oblivion is the product of Hollywood and that's all. This film is what happens when you spend millions on a movie. After this they remembered they had to include a terrible script",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It should have been called 'Bleakness',"This movie commits two big mistakes:
1. no good climax
2. no good villainAnd then it feels like they didn't want to spend money on backgrounds, and on character development.The movie's story and visuals are minimal. It's a post-apocalyptic world, but instead of showing elaborate city ruins, it shows dirt. The few ruins that we get to see, are covered in dirt. No post apocalyptic world building, nope. Watch this cardboard ""rebel hangar"" propped up on a patch of dirt instead!
Very little is happening in the beginning, and that is ok, I can live with that as an introduction, allows me to focus on Tom Cruise's character. But that works only if you're going to give me a lot more of substantial stuff later on!
Nope. Seems that the makers of this movie got no budget left. Tom Cruise ate it!I can't help but compare Oblivion to 'Mad Max Fury Road'. 'Fury Road' is a post apocalyptic world too, but it has cars and a car worship religion and dudes employing a car related jargon, there's explosions, huge storms, rocky passages, cities in the distance, whence come strange characters with at least a not-boring appearance.
Oblivion is just monotonous dirt.
The world in Mad Max Fury Road affects the story thoroughly. I can feel the characters trapped inside their world.
In Oblivion, the world is made irrelevant, employed only to execute the car chase, I mean, flying vehicle chase.. Twice is Tom Cruise's character chased by boring spherical machines with guns, and of course, robots are dumb, he-he. They don't get him, and I already knew that, because then the story would end, because the movie is about Tom Cruise.
So Oblivion is ""Tom Cruise and dirt"".There's many other faults to this movie, but talking about it would be more substantial than the movie itself. So let's jump to the conclusion.
The no good climax is that it has Morgan Freeman in it. And that's a nono.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good sci-fi flick! (No spoilers),"I was planning to watch this movie for a long while, actually ever since it came out in 2013. This movie tells the story of Jack Harper who does repairs and cleaning up in a post-apocaliptic world. As he progresses through the movie layers of his story come out and that makes for an interesting movie.This movie was surprisingly received very poorly by the critics when it was released saying that it's the classic case of style over substance. I actually find to have many layers and a lot of character depth. The visuals are stunning and is sad to see that this movie didn't got nominated for an Oscar in 2014 for visuals. They are combined very well sometimes with beautiful landscapes that makes for a fantastic visual experience. But that's not the only thing this movie does right. The characters as the story develops have a lot more layers and depth than you might think at the beginning. The performances are pretty good especially from Tom Cruise who carries this movie forward, but also the rest of the cast do a good job in the screen time they have. The story is really good and at times full of mysterys and intrigue. There is one thing that bothered me and it was the fact that the story tried at times to be to much for the movie or for the pace it had. That meant some less screen time for certain characters that might seem promising or interesting at first. Another thing that I didn't like was that the story overall had some circumstance and motives lacking from some of the situations presented. I was constantly ""it's good, but I would want more"". That would have maybe involved me more into the story and in the movie. Apart from that the story has emotion and humanity at it's core and that is what I liked about it. It was about the characters while using a sci-fi scenario and it was something that you could relate to and have a message sent towards you with which you could remain with by the end of the movie. By the way the ending was beautiful but somewhat short. I mean I would have wanted a bit more explanations and more connections to be tied up by the end. But that didn't ruin the excitement I had overall with the movie. One last thing I'll mention is that the tech seemed very futuristic and realistic for a sci-fi but that is somewhat of an understatement for all the new sci-fi movies nowadays.Overall a very good movie with great visuals, good enough story good performances and fine characters that intrigue as much as entertain the audience. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another Day in Paradise,"Greetings again from the darkness. Here we have Exhibit Number One in proving the theory that no quantity or quality of movie special effects can overcome the lack a good story. Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) directs his own graphic novel, and the result is a beautiful and impressive looking film that lacks any substance and fails to develop any characters for us to care about.This almost plays as a sci-fi tribute with tips of the cap to at least the following: The Matrix, Moon, Total Recall, Inception, Planet of the Apes, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 2001: A Space Odyssey ... and even Top Gun! Unfortunately, it falls short of all of those except for the stunning visual effects of the patrol drones (George Lucas would be proud) and the beautiful photography of Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi).The most obvious comparison is with Wall-E. This time, Tom Cruise plays the ""mop-up crew"" along with his assigned spouse played by Andrea Riseborough (very good as Wallis Simpson in W.E., and recently seen in Disconnect). We learn from the initial voice-over (by Cruise, not Morgan Freeman) that Earth was left in ruins after a long battle with aliens. Now the last bit of Earth's resources are being harvested before it is deserted forever.The cast is pretty deep with an extremely upbeat Melissa Leo showing up in the ""Hal"" role on a low-res video screen, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as leaders of the underground surviving humans, Olga Kurylenko (a Bond girl in Quantum of Solace, and currently in To The Wonder), and even stunt-woman extraordinare Zoe Bell making an appearance.All the wonderful toys are present, the look and feel are really something to see, the Jetsons-style home is kinda cool, and we get the ever-present Cruise sprint ... this time in a space suit! Despite all the goodies, this one just seems to fall flat in the ability to draw us in. If you are a sci-fi visual type, you'll get a kick out of it. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an effective team.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great on So Many Levels Yet Still Missing Something,"Acting- Great.World Building- Great.Special Effects/CGI- Great.Cinematography- Great.So what's missing? I never really connected with the story or the characters. I suppose, with many films like Oblivion that are taken from a graphic novel, one really should be familiar with the novel to really be able to appreciate the film.I kept feeling like things were going to start making sense at any time but they never really did... Not even at the end when it became 'somewhat' clear what the real situation was. I felt like it lacked connection and investment with the viewer. Oblivion is a beautiful film and technologically very impressive but pretty wrapping paper does not a fine gift make. Still, I think it needs a second viewing and some more in-depth knowledge of the source material. But that is on me and it doesn't make the film weaker per se, it only means it is THAT type of film... it depends a little more on outside info to really connect with the viewer.It also, at times feels more like a video game than a movie AND there are some pretty preposterous logic flaws (like the inability for command control to force a return of a scout ship via autopilot that has been taken for unauthorized explorations... and a relatively simple means to defeat scout drones by popping open an access cover and stealing their energy source a la the Lost in Space Robot's power pack... I mean, seems like these issues should not have passed initial quality/security audits).Anyway, the premise is interesting and intriguing IF it takes until the very end to discover what it is. The fight scenes are fine but nothing we really haven't seen before.. a bit cliched for the most part.Oblivion is slick and impressive in a lot of ways but it demands more from the audience than it actually provides them to make a strong connection work. I had a 'what did I just watch' feeling immediately after viewing. But I also found myself thinking about it a great deal afterwards as well... so there's maybe more to the film than I'm giving credit.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I want to believe.. I want to give it higher!,"Recall when you watched Jurassic Park - the enchanted beauty and jaw dropping serenity. Oblivion outdoes Prometheus - it is like a candle lit dinner in Paris for the visual senses bedazzling with majestic 4K surreal landscapes. The soundtrack from M83 is haunting. The acting average.. with Olga stealing the show. Without this it would be a 3/10.The plot, like that of Wall-e, centers on somebody repairing robots in a desolated broken world unaware of what's out there. Unfortunately, Oblivion borrows too much from Moon and 2001 a Space Odyssey. Here is where the proverbial wheels come off the wagon.Not only are Cruise's pretentious soliloquies vague with so little story to support them, but the plot has gaping holes and the most unremarkable obvious plot twist I've seen in decades. A far superior example of Sci-Fi is Book of Eli.Oblivion feels like $10 mil art-house movie despite $120 mil budget. I really wish at least a day was spent thinking about making the story more convincing and logical. I really wish Hollywood made more thought provoking sci-fi which deals with the human condition, morals, etc.. instead of yet another saving damsel in distress story.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Around half way through the movie I had guessed what the ending would be like and I was almost dead on, but it still surprised me and didn't change my opinion one bit.

Visually great but quite shallow.,"It's entertaining, with some great visuals.However, for me it follows a similar concept to the greater movie 'Moon'.Oblivion has better visuals but it lacks the emotion of Moon. It could've been a great movie with more central character development. I wish they had spent more time on the couple and their relationship in the solitude. I felt very little for them, and that spoils the whole premise. It's still a good movie and definitely worth watching if you are into SciFi or Tom C. A few plot holes or inconsistencies.Do yourself a favour and watch Moon. That movie provokes more emotion for the viewer, is more claustrophobic (more fitting for the solitude) and is much more thought provoking, at least for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This movie anyways, has a pretty good plot, and better yet; excellent animation. If I were to say anything myself, I gave this movie a 7/10, although I would've gone for 6.5 if I could have.

Fantastic Sci-Fi Film!,"Oblivion is pure modern science-fiction entertainment and it was a blast to watch. It has an interesting post-apocalyptic story that takes place on a damaged Earth and it raises some interesting questions. Not only does this film require you to think at times, it's a visually-stunning film that has excellent cinematography and plenty of action. Plus, it has Tom Cruise. What can go wrong with Tom Cruise?Joseph Kosinski's sci-fi actioner is about a man named Jack Harper who is one of the last people on Earth along with his lover named Vika because many years prior, the Earth was attacked by extraterrestrial beings causing the remaining inhabitants to relocate to Saturn's moon, Titan. Harper's job is to protect the fusion energy generators which provide the power. But after discovering this mysterious woman who crash-landed on Earth, Jack begins to question his entire existence.This film is well-acted and that is one of the highlights of this film. Tom Cruise is a max-effort actor and once again he shows why. He brings commitment into his role as Jack Harper and he made his character very interesting. Morgan Freeman is excellent, but he is not in the film as much as the trailers or posters would suggest. But his role is very pivotal. Melissa Leo is creepily cheerful in her role, but you'll know why once you see the film. Finally, our ladies are not only attractive, but they do well as the much younger love interests of Tom Cruise.Overall, Oblivion is a fantastic, action-packed sci-fi film that is a wonderful time. Based off the some the reviews I read, I wasn't keen on seeing this film. But once again, time proves again that movies are subjective. Despite the reviews, I enjoyed every part of this movie. Tom Cruise once again defies time and age in this visually-stunning, post-apocalyptic movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Science Fiction by Today's Standards,"We don't know all that much about Science Fiction anymore, because we have become way too cynical and have given up on the stuff that made previous generations great. We're stuck in our texting machines and haven't put anyone on the moon in decades. We're happy to be distracted by Wizards, Vampires and post-apocalyptic archers.This movie harks back to the original notions of Science Fiction, back when we really appreciated it. Everything we start out knowing in this movie turns out to be wrong. Humans just won't go away or give up. And they won't stop believing.This movie brings back all of those old, long lost themes. The enemy is faceless, huge and mechanically cynical. It has only one mission, and humans are merely pawns in the scheme.And, in the end, the things that make us human become the defining theme of the movie. ""If we have souls"" Harper begins, and then explains what makes them.Great stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A thing of beauty,"First and foremost, Oblivion is a visual experience. The locations, set design and prop design are all absolutely stunning. The languid pacing allows the viewer plenty of time to take it all in which is great if you like that kind of thing but probably quite annoying if you don't. Luckily I'm in the former camp. It evokes memories of 2001: Space Odyssey at times, even if the movies are quite different in tone.The soundtrack also really works for me. I am a sometime fan of M83 and he does some of his best work here. Sound design in general is also very impressive.But visual and aural stimulus alone doesn't make for a great film. So, does it hold up in terms of plot and acting? Plot-wise, it is somewhat derivative. But the script is interesting enough to keep my attention and has enough twists to keep things interesting.As for the acting; Tom Cruise does what he does best, which is being Tom Cruise. I'm not a huge fan but he does this kind of thing very well. No qualms about his performance here, he is very good in this. Certainly among his very best performances as far as I'm concerned.Of the supporting cast, only Andrea Riseborough is given enough material to shine. She does very well as the somewhat tragic figure of the movie. Olga Kurylenko is a bit more wooden and her performance is merely serviceable. Morgan Freeman is always a joy to watch even if he doesn't have a lot of screen time. The minor characters have very little screen time but are convincing enough. I wouldn't call this a character driven movie but I can't fault the acting.Overall, there is not enough heft to this to call it an absolute classic but it's certainly a very enjoyable movie. I have watched it three times now; once at the movies, once on DVD and once on TV. I will definitely be getting the Blu-Ray at some point so I can watch it again with the good picture quality and great sound it deserves. A visual and aural feast indeed. 9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A New Ground for future Hollywood Sci-fi, Well Done...","This movie is extraordinary. Firstly, the plot seems absolute future oriented and unimaginative visual scientific environment. Secondly, this movie grips all possibilities of excitement and pace, when seen seriously on big screen or Blue Ray DVDs. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who has seen Starwars, Independence Day, Star Trek and Star Gate etc. The concept is simple, its all about aliens and invasion on earth, in the form of human body, directly replicated from only two people, Tom Cruise and his partner Andrea Riseborough. Though they don't kill humans but repair the drones (killing machines) manufactured on 'tet' which kill people where ever they go. The machines (rigs) manufacture something from sea water, that I couldn't understand but got an idea that these machines produce some kind of energy which helps 'tet' to stay alive in space, just above earth. Tom cruise also helps in maintaining the rigs and help 'tet' to get power from the same. The real adventure begins when Tom Cruise's real wife arrives and changes everything, the daily routines and works done by both people comes to an end and a new story comes into picture which gives further excitement and entertainment in the movie, see for yourself. This movie is a worth watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boring.  Boring.  Did I say boring?,"I wasn't expecting some mind blowing plot, but I was expecting a decent action film. I got neither.The first 80 hours of the film is someone doing chores. Yes the scenery/cgi is great, but I wasn't there to watch a scifi version Martha Stewart living.Bottom line there is maybe 12 minutes of action in the whole movie. If you watched the trailers, you HAVE seen about one third of all the action sequences. Seriously! Also, the action that is there is clique with the dramatic pauses in the middle of shoot outs.Maybe wait for it to show up on Netflix.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A good sci fi movie,"This movie was good. In this film's aura and critical reception, I definitely noticed similarities to Minority Report (it was underrated). Without spoiling anything, it is clear that there are massive similarities to certain other sci fi movies... But maybe that is inevitable in this genre. It was very visual and sleek. The story was good, but I felt like it shouldn't have had such a family oriented wrap up of an ending. Plenty of movies that are legendary, ended with a bitter ending that better suited how humans actually are.One thing I noticed after watching this, was that blockbuster sci fi movies (this included) are becoming lame to me, because they are tending to assume that humans can't overpower the invaders, but must outsmart them with a million to one odds, and then throw a Hail Mary for the win. And/or change some high ranking enemy's heart to have them help the good guys. But it doesn't seem that far fetched that humans outsmart their opponents after a massive battle with huge losses, by adapting to their enemy and legitimately going over the top to destroy them. Is that really that weird? That is how humans beat everything else isn't it?Because this movie followed the popular paths, and also unjustifiably overlapped too much with other movies, it doesn't deserve a 10 or a 9. But if you like sci fi, you should watch this once.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"At best, a poor emulation of sci-fi grandeur","It's not great, let me start off by saying that. I don't mean to be (to used the go-to and clichéd term on IMDb) a 'hater'. I'm not. Despite Cruises many personal faults, I still think he's a terrific actor, and he usually makes great choices when it comes to scripts. This is not one of those.I understand there are countless reviews that already that discuss this films penchant for previous sci-fi works. And usually a film that pays homage to other ideas from before itself do so with reverence, and with a flair that brings something new.This film does not. This is the culmination of Hollywood producers sat in room brainstorming previous successful innovative ideas, and trying to compress them into one story that will garner the biggest box office return.The visuals were impressive, especially given the budget. I know that may seem like a silly statement, but most films nowadays on such a scale will have a budget twice as large as this film and yet still won't achieve such beauty with CGI. (The Hobbit, for example). So for this I give Oblivion high praise.However, the plot is pandering and thoroughly un-original. And again, the argument here seems to be: ""All sci-fi movies borrow from earlier works and themes."" Yes, this is true to an extent. But what most seminal works of sci-fi have in common is that they elaborate on these themes, and they in turn offer something new.This film did nothing. It took what it could from previous concepts, smashed them together into a mess of a plot, and hoped that younger audiences who wouldn't be aware of its blatant plagiarism would marvel at its supposed uniqueness.Nothing about this films plot has merit. Inspiration has its uses, and it will nurture ideas. This was simply a hack attempt to capitalise on previous works.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Mix Of Cliché And Original That Works Out In The End,"I had heard good things about this recently, saying that it was underrated, so I decided to check it out. I don't remember any raving reviews when it came out, so the sudden praise peaked my interest. I'm glad I checked it out.The film is an interesting mix of original ideas and clichés. One minute you will be intrigued by the plot, the next you'll be saying ""oh well I kinda thought that would happen"", but I think it's a film that remains more on the original side. Sure, you'll see some of you're typical Hollywood movie clichés that will make you think this film is going in a bad direction, but if you stick with it until the end, you will be pleased.This is quite a beautiful film at times. It has some mesmerizing shots that will leave you breathless. They help sell the futuristic feeling. But on the flip side, there can be some slightly boring and typical set pieces. The film kind of goes back and forth between inspired and unoriginal with it's visuals, but I think the good visuals left a bigger mark on me.Tom Cruise gives a good performance, showing that he still is capable of being great. Olga Kurylenko gives an okay performance. I read about other choices for her role and I feel like maybe one of those other actresses would have worked better, but she gets the job done.Overall, this is a film you should check out if you're a fan of sci-fi. It has lots of twists and turns and will keep you entertained for sure. It seems like it slipped under the radar a bit, which is a shame, but it's worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The mirror to the scientology,"So I saw a couple of reviews on this movie and the plot line is well very very captivating. I won't go into details for the people who havn't still watched it but it talks about greater powers which see how to perfect mankind an amazing concept. I think it's also a wake up call from Tom Cruise himself, he has not only evolved as an actor but also as a human being matured and like fine wine gave us some amazing moments.The basic plot line is amazing, the CGI amazing, the acting amazing. Although the co-cast was not as strong so in my opinion it's an 8 star but if you like this movie don't forget to watch edge of tomorrow. Not only is it a more refined and well written script it is also amazing to watch him grow even more as an actor. Emily blunt the wonderful but underrated actress plays the role superbly also.

"Looks Good, but Kinda Stinks","This movie had great visual elements- the open landscapes, the sleek design of the technology, and all the the flying scenes. Some action in it, but not great action. This movie was intended to be one of those complex mindblowers with a twist, but it ends up being a pile of trash after some reflection after the movie ends. Ultimately, nothing really makes sense from a macro perspective. All the questions I could ask are not able to be answered within the film. Anyone who rates this movie more than a 7/10 should be ignored.This movie was like a mix between 2001: A Space Odyssey, and MOON, with a touch of some other sci-fi movies in there. Both of these movies I mentioned as descriptors are over-rated movies, just like how Oblivion is over-rated. This movie was worth watching for me for the visuals and the overall affect this movie has, but it ends up being a movie to watch to kill some time in the end.

One of the best scifi movie in 2010s,"I can say this is one of the best sci-fi films of the 2010s. In the 1st act or the prologue, this film feels like it's in a hurry to convey the summary of its backstory. however, you will find out why at the beginning it feels accelerated, that's because before the core of the story, you will be presented with a pretty mindblowing storyline. I really feel mesmerized with cgi treats and amazingly cool special effects.with stunning special effects, this film is also supported by cinematography techniques and magnificent scoring from start to finish. several times I found good framing in shooting some scenes, mostly scenes from tom cruise. talking, about acting, you definitely won't deny how the totality and perfection of Tom Cruise's acting is. all the cast also I think put on a brilliant performance even though Tom Cruise took all the attention to him. Lastly, I think this film could potentially be used as a sequel or made a prequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bad acting and plot holes vs great CGI and Music,"There wasn't any good acting in this movie. Cruise, Freeman and that girl from a Bond movie - all going through the motions. Which is a problem as this movie is trying to be one about hope, where we care whether the people survived.I found I could care less.The story has an interesting premise. Unfortunately it doesn't grow a decent plot. The script is basic cut and paste. If you are more than twelve years old it will seem like one cliché after another.On the positive side of things the CGI (all of the visuals) are very well done. The Star Wars clichéd chase scene is a clichéd and shortcoming of the story, rather than of the people in charge of the visuals.The music is stirring and uplifting and one of the best for a long time.But, as a movie, it's just average. A straight-to-DVD kind of outing with an over-sized budget.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beautiful and vastly underrated - the Tom Cruise factor?,"I'd been wanting to see this ever since the first trailer, but ended up passing on it while it was in theaters. I'd been poisoned by many of the critical reviews and some internet commenters, who called it ""slow"", ""confusing"", ""plodding"", ""derivative"" and just another vanity project for Tom Cruise.I was happy to discover (after finally watching the Blu-Ray release) that it is actually none of those things. What it is is a beautifully shot, thoughtful, complex sci-fi drama the likes of which we're not often treated to in this era of superhero action movies that just want to blow as much stuff up as possible on screen.Oh, but there is action - it's just that those scenes are strangely enough the least interesting. That's probably because the movie's not really about that - in fact, it's *these* scenes that feel drawn out a bit too long. We know the heroes are going to come through, otherwise the movie would end. I just wanted them to get on with it. The main drama is filled with way more twists and turns than any of the action scenes.It's these twists that make the plot interesting - it opens like a puzzle that doesn't quite fit together, but that's intentional. Rather than feeling like the filmmakers slapped a twist on to make for a surprise ending, ""Oblivion"" is built in such a way that you're actually meant to question the status quo right from the first scene. If you've got a curious mind and you're paying attention, you'll wonder about various little things.For example, about 10 minutes in my wife asked ""where did they get the money to build all this beautiful stuff?"" I won't give away any spoilers because finding out the answers is one of the pleasures of this movie - but trust me when I tell you that all your questions, even seemingly insignificant ones like ""how could they afford this?"" *are* answered. It's pretty satisfying how everything starts to fit together as you watch.The movie really is beautiful to look at and it's mostly well paced to allow the wide open, minimalist settings room to breathe. Joseph Kosinski seems to have a real aesthetic of his own (though one that's obviously influenced by Stanley Kubrick). Both ""Tron: Legacy"" and ""Oblivion"" share many aesthetic qualities - one is primarily ""dark"" and the other ""light"", but they're easily recognizable as having been helmed by the same person. I didn't actually know the same guy directed both while watching, but I remember saying ""this feels a lot like Tron"" to my wife while it was on. That's not a criticism - Kosinski's still building his catalog, but the best directors usually have a distinct style through all of their movies, regardless of genre.I really wonder if the problem a lot of people had with this movie is that they can no longer get past Tom Cruise. I'm not a fan of him personally, but I'm able to detach my feelings about him from his characters. I actually think he usually does a good job of making me forget I'm watching Tom Cruise (in other words, I don't think he's a bad actor!) and that was true here too. The acting among the four principals was surprisingly good, and I think I even have a little crush on Olga Kurylenko.The movie does seem to be a comment on the dangers of our increasing reliance on drones. I don't know, maybe that's a topic that's been covered in films before, but I haven't seen it - or at least not like this. I feel like some people didn't get that, or they did but had already made up their mind about the rest of the movie. Let's not forget, though, that a young Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (which itself was a comment on our coming reliance on AI) was heavily criticized on its release for many of the same reasons ""Oblivion"" has been. That's not to put them in the same class, but just to suggest that it's possible for films to overcome initial critic and audience biases over time. Hopefully that happens with ""Oblivion.""",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sunglasses Again,"I gave up on this one after a series of events. Tom Cruise's character makes a remarkably bone headed decision that lands him in a dark cave. If he remained intelligent, the plot would not go on. He's in great danger from the apparent bad guys that ate the moon and triggered an atomic war that ruined the Earth.And who does he meet in this DARK cave on a devastated Earth? Why Morgan Freeman wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar. I'd say at this point it was 30/70 favoring Morgan that he'd be the one instead of Laurence Fishburne but it had to be one because it'd been too long a white's only show.Of course he had to look all cool and all.I'm tired of the idiocy.

Hope for Sci-Fi,"Oblivion was one of those films, that went below my radar, and it wasn't until I saw it on a streaming service, that I thought this might be good, and it is.You can read the synopsis here on IMDb, but the story is not new and it's been seen before.However, this movie consists of beautiful images - a visual impact, that is so clean - so crisp. You get the sense that everything is controlled in this wasteland on earth, through the perfect imagery. It is the camera here that tells the story - not dialog.The soundtrack is downright gorgeous and supports that subtle feeling this movie has.I love that sci-fi is slowly returning, where the real notion of scientific-fiction is taken seriously. Oblivion is one of those movies, in line with Prometheus and Moon.I rank this movie 8/10, while not breaking new grounds, it is visually stunning, all the actors deliver, the soundtrack is one of the best I've listened to in a long time!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Well balanced and capturing sci-fi,"Oblivion is a film that succeeds in something that is increasingly uncommon in films, especially high-caliber, visually elaborate films. It ties up the bundle leaving no loose ends. When the movie ends it gives the viewer a sense of satisfaction; a sense that everything in the film had a purpose and the different elements were in balance. The film is visually impressive to watch and the setting of the story is capturing. There is action but not too much to undermine the atmosphere and mystery of the story. The dialogue is not excessive either and that which is there is well thought through. The characters are convincing, both in script and in the performance of the actors.The story line is one that could easily give rise to a 2-hour explanatory monologue and far from all questions that may arise in the viewer are answered. However, in this case that is not a problem. The film itself doesn't address more questions than it answers. It does not attempt to explain everything; it focuses on only a few characters and their story, no more. This is why Oblivion succeeds rather well. It does not try to take a bigger bite than what a 2-hour film can chew. The result is a well-working balance that is enjoyable to watch and satisfying afterwards. For anyone who finds the film's genre interesting, Oblivion is worth to watch as it easily ranks among the better sci-fi productions of past years.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A man versus machine story with great visuals,"This is a film about assumptions, how wrong they can be and how they can destroy you, if you're not careful. This applies to machine intelligences as much as it does to those manipulated by them. Ultimately, we all make mistakes and we are all punished for them.Kosinskis film uses tropes from other sci-fi movies (what sci-fi movie doesn't?) and wraps them in the prettiest looking visuals since Bladerunner. The sci-fi future it depicts is almost retro in it's homage to various prog rock album cover art from the 1970's. This is a strength.Its main weakness is an unwillingness to push its world building further into the plot and stick to rather safer blockbuster territory with predictable twists and unreasonable optimism.

When the Telling is better than the Sotry,"Sometimes, it is impossible to separate the story from the storyteller. When that happens, suspension of disbelief is easy, and the art becomes a part of life. This is rare. Often the great story is told and the teller succeeds by bringing it to the fore and staying out of the way.A movie is a great story teller, but often the medium eclipses the message. This is clearly one that does. The polish of the production almost blinded me from the view of the movie. Great FX, immense star power, and an excellent score left whatever was the point of the movie on the cutting floor. An escape? Yes. However, as the plot developed, the lack of character pathos and reliance on amazing vistas let my mind wander. Any time the story gives you time to think, it is usually a bad thing.Tom Cruise was excellent, as usual. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman, complemented the star well. But the story never dared to go anywhere you might not have guessed, and the ending was predictable in a way that did not make me feel perceptive.Have you ever met a person who was so meticulous, so well groomed, proper and predictable that you wondered if he/she was real?

Fabulous !!!!,"I saw Oblivion earlier this evening, not knowing much about it other than it was a science fiction film set in the near future starring Tom Cruise. I love sci-fi and generally enjoy Tom Cruise movies. When the movie started, I was immediately impressed by the visuals, the bleak landscape (which is quite disturbing) and the special effects. It takes a few minutes to get used to Tom Cruise in the role and the dialogue at first seemed pretty clichéd. So I watching this movie thinking, OK it looks great, but where can this movie go ? They are just there doing their job on the rig, he's explained what they are doing there, big deal !But lets just say the movie experience improves exponentially as the film goes on, as the story becomes more complex and things begin to expand and make sense. I don't want to put any spoilers in here, but there was a point when I thought oh no, its gone too far now, this part doesn't make sense (after another patrol craft lands over the sand dune). For those who've seen it, you'll know which scene I mean. But then even that makes sense completely by the end too.Going into this movie totally unaware about any plot detail was the best thing, it made it so much more enjoyable. I was worried this film was going to be great to look at, but vacuous. That it certainly was not ! It was profound and stunning ! Tom Cruise is at the top of his game here and he definitely looks the part thoroughly. The love story is very believable and is quite deep and touching. I had a tear in my eye on more than one occasion. This film touches cleverly on the point that life is about memories, those you love and those you lost, not just about what you do and who you are. This resonated with me. The other main female role, his colleague is also great in her role. The direction, the tension, the sound effects, especially of the drones, are all fabulous. I really can't fault this film, apart from a few minor issues that I'm not going to bring up now ! 9/10, the best film I have seen in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great SciFi movie,"This is a simple scientific/futuristic/romantic movie. The plot is pretty simple and it has a rather interesting turn of events at the end of the movie. I enjoyed all of it.... especially the futuristic house.All I can say is, ignore the bad critics and see the movie for yourself. If you are a true sci-fi person, you should not be disappointed in this film.I also think there is plenty of room in the film for a sequel and even more character development in the future.I also think Tom Cruise did a fantastic job with his character, I am not sure who could have done a better job. Maybe Brad Pitt?Anyways, its a must see film for sci fi people....",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
""" The most difficult opponent you'll ever encounter, is yourself ""","This futurist movie was directed by Joseph Kosinski and is a concept long in arriving. The story concerns Earth in the year 2077 A.D. The remnant population of the planet is on a devastated sphere without a viable moon. Living on a Titan moon Jack's base is occasionally attacked by invading 'Scabs' intent on destroying Earth's remaining satellite system. There to repair these satellites is a highly skilled technician named Jack (Tom Cruise) who's task is to keep these drones in working order. Troubled by sporadic memories involving a recurring dream, Jack tries to piece them together while preparing to leave his assigned post. Aiding his daily efforts is his partner Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who periodically states to their celestial boss (Andrea Risebororough) that she and Jack make an effective team. In addition and hidden among the debris of Earth's landscapes is Jack's secret cabin where he longs to return often. However, the troubling dreams become more complex when he saves a survivor from a damaged spaceship shot down in a battles with the Scabs. The remnants of the human race are constantly seeking him out to convince him to join them. Indeed Jack has to deal with them and images of his former wife who wants very much to reunite and remind him of who and what he really is. The movie is crammed with exciting Aeriel action scenes and one is hard pressed to keep up with the explosive scenes of the story. Morgan Freeman is superb as Beech and so too is this lively film which is a fun addition to his movies. Recommended to anyone who likes Tom Cruise. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exciting and Thrilling. Brings back many classic Sci-Fi Movies!,"I was expecting another Tom Cruise movie, my average rating for his movies is about 6-7, good, but not transcendence. It turned out quite different this time. I've always been a fan of Sci-Fi movies. And this was no exception. It brought me back movies like I,Robot, Titan A.E. and The Planet of the Apes (original).The best of this movie is that it will only keep getting better and better, you will love it all the way through the end. It's originality is beyond anything I've watched for the past 5 years. You won't regret watching this movie, it's a great experience. It's not just another action movie, It has great sci-fi elements, and it has a lot of potential for a sequel.After a second time I learned many things that weren't clear the first time I saw it, and I found out elements of even more Sci-Fi classics, like War of the Worlds, Independence Day, and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys Sci-Fi Thrillers.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Most underrated Tom Cruise movie ever,"I don't understand why the ratings of this film is so bad. 50% rotten tomatoes, that is really insane. As far as I'm concerned this movie can be rated 10/10 from three aspects. The first is the artistic design. You can find many moments of this film to the snapshotted as your desktop theme. Also the property design, such as the plane, the motor bike, the sky house they live in, which is so heaven and like a dream. They actually made the real house scene to shoot some in house scenes. Second the clear idea of the story. It has a strong spine which is the original love between the hero and the heroine. The bond between them is what wakes the hero and saves the world. And everyone in this film is willing to sacrifice their lives just to save their loved ones. I don't why people think the story is weak. Every story in this world is basic. Love, war, hate, money, live and die, these are the basics of our lives. The thing is to make it complicated and appealing and the movie has unequivocally done it. The third is the theme music, which is OMGly so beautiful and so strong. I downloaded the theme BGM just to listen over and over again from high school, now I'm doing my PhD but I still love it. Good music never tires your ears. In conclusion, this film is so themed like they put a lot of design work in to make everything consistent. So 10/10 is what it is. And I think if you can re-rate online, it will definitely get higher marks, like 90% tomato.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tom Cruise at his best,"Tom Cruise is an excellent actor. He can make any movie work. But this movie is a supreme example of thought provoking ideology. I like the dystopian or fantasy genre of film because it might, actually, turn out to be the truth. You will need to be capable of following the premise but I have watched this three times and am now confident that the message has come through. Please watch this.

Better than you would think,"Earth has been decimated by an alien race and a few have been left behind to clean up what's left of the planet until he's kidnapped by a resistance movement and told a few truths, sounds cliché'd (there have been comparisons to THE MATRIX and even WAL-E)but there's a good twist or two in here that's worth the price of admission. The story unfolds gradually to a big stunner at the end and only slows at the middle. The music is very similar to THE DARK KNIGHT as i found with TRON:LAGACY but i enjoyed it anyway. The director is one to watch from now on as he knows how to make a big movie and make his actors look GOOD!!. I saw this today in IMAX (1.44:1)open matte and it looked stunning.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Elements of Slaughterhouse Five. Enjoyable yarn.  Fresh Take.,"I went to the movie tonight with my son. I enjoyed the film. Tom Cruise was on target cast as ""Jack Harper"" who has flashbacks reminiscent of Billy Pilgrim. Combat and a nice little spin on the space house Billy Pilgrim lived in with Valerie Perrine. I won't tell some of the differences because I don't want to spoil the story. But here is a snippet from Slaughterhouse Five and let me know if you see the resemblance.""A man tells his story of how he became unstuck in time and abducted by aliens.""

Thought provoking sci-fi drama/mystery,"Just saw it in London, England as its on general release here now. Overall its a very decent movie. If you expect a slow moving sci-fi drama set in the not too distant future (2077) then this is that movie. Its by design a slow moving but interesting premise & feels a lot like a 1970's sci-fi classic. Not quite though as the reveals leave you wanting a little more exposition but for the running time it covers pretty much everything anyway.As long as you do not expect anything more than a bleak & thought provoking sci-fi drama you will not be disappointed the visuals of a barren & almost destroyed earth are flawless. Acting is solid across the board & Tom Cruise gives a measured performance avoiding any opportunity to smile or make humour of the dire situation they are in.Andrea & Olga have about the same screen time as Tom overall as the joint female leads but the chemistry between Tom & Andrea & Tom & Olga is just fine.For once you have a modern film which does not fully reveal its ending until the last 2-3 mins up until then you have no idea how its going to end which is a strong example of just how skilled a director Joseph Kosinski is as for me personally I did not notice the 2 hour running time at all as I was so enthralled in what was happening on screen & how it was all going to resolve itself (or not as this does not give you many answers & leaves several questions).8/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than the critics said,"I think Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) thinks big and does a very good job of it. The set is stunning— under a big fractured moon with one big segment broken off and simply hanging, suspended in orbit, with a trail of little pieces floating around. Also The technology in this movie had me amazed after 10 minutes. The sky home set is amazing so modern & futuristic. I can imagine that it wont be long before we have this technology. The digital effects and the scenery in this movie are breath taking especially on the IMAX screen. The actors do a very good job of making this movie spectacular. I seriously do not understand how critics gave this movie a bad review I throughly enjoyed this movie and want to see it over and over. This is one that I will be buying on blu-ray for my collection, also the soundtrack Is stunning I listen to it day and night. I visit the movies a lot and I have been recommending this movie to everyone that I talk to.

Fantastic example of Sci-fi,"Stunning visuals and a play on a concept we've seen before in other ""the earth is uninhabitable"" post-apocalyptic movies. The loneliness of setting and characters adds to the great atmosphere this movie gives. The movie is also quite slow-paced but that is complimented by the isolated feel of the main characters and their roles, rather than being some gun-ho style of movie which sci-fi movies tend to be. Great soundtrack too with some tracks perfectly tied into the expected feel and sonnd of the drones. This is a great example of modern-day science-fiction without being an all-out war with alien invaders. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent example of Sci-Fi at its best,"I don't usually feel the need to write about movies, but this one I think deserves my support.First of all, let me say that I am not a Tom Cruise fan; the mere fact that he is in a film is sometimes enough to put me off. But I had heard so little of this film – seriously, it seemed to have snuck into the theatres – that I decided I would give it a go. So I went to a Saturday afternoon session, on my own. And I wasn't disappointed.This was Sci-Fi at its best:, sometimes as awesome as the Matrix with regard to the VFX, but often very understated like Gattaca. The themes were really interesting and the characters were also well developed. The pace was also perfect, with a good combination of suspense, drama sometimes it was even scary.Without going on and on (I don't want to give too much away), I definitely think this is worth seeing at the cinema. Visually it is amazing. The bigger the screen, the better, in my opinion. Also has a great score.People who say they didn't ""get"" it obviously don't understand Sci-Fi.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pass the Popcorn review,"If you've seen Oblivion's trailer, you know what to expect, since much of the story is spoiled in it. But the saddest part is, the movie is very predictable even if you haven't seen the trailer - just another Hollywood money-making sci-fi/action product. Except, Oblivion is based on a comic book. At least that's what they want you to believe - the comic book was never published, the director Joseph Kosinski started an illustrated novel and then abandoned the project to work on the movie. He said it was not intended for distribution, only for legal purposes, and Tom Cruise found it interesting.In the year 2077 Earth is uninhabitable, after the nuclear war between humans and aliens known as ""Scavs"". They had destroyed the Moon, which caused natural disasters, and started invading Earth; humans eventually won the war but lost the planet. Some of those who survived are now living in the Tet, a large spaceship orbiting Earth, waiting to go to Titan, Saturn's moon where the rest of humanity is waiting. Jack (Tom Cruise) lives with Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) in a house above the clouds and spends his day repairing drones - Scav killing machines - while she oversees him and communicates with the main commander on Tet. One day, Jack finds Julia (Olga Kurylenko) in a crashed spacecraft, who will make him question everything he thought he knew about himself and the war.If a movie is in the ""science-fiction"" genre, I expect it to be at least somewhat accurate about the ""scientific"" facts it presents. In Oblivion, Jack and Victoria live in a house above the clouds, and can normally walk around it and even swim in a pool in front of the entrance. They don't seem to mind that they are located in the stratosphere where the air is one thousand times thinner than on Earth and where it's pretty cold. I guess I should forgive the scriptwriter's mistake of considering the Moon's destruction responsible for earthquakes, but it still bothers me. And how can Jack and Victoria believe that, even after Earth was destroyed, humans managed to build their house, the Tet, those giant water-sucking machines and the drones? How could people possibly live on one of Saturn's moons if they had not made it habitable before? And they had only 60 years to do so. I suppose I'm nitpicking, but all these inconsistencies ruined the movie for me.Also, the movie is way too long. Not much happens in the first half an hour, it is basically just made of shots of the destroyed Earth and remains of the American civilization (because nobody else matters in Hollywood). Although, I must admit, the cinematography in this part is good. Unfortunately, it doesn't make Oblivion any less boring. Furthermore, the special effects are also good - but with a $120 million budget and being a Sci-Fi movie, they can't be bad. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is bad. The scene when Jack and Victoria swim in the pool at night is romantic and sexy, but the music doesn't fit that mood at all. And then there's Ramble On by Led Zeppelin, probably put in the movie to show us that Jack/Tom Cruise is one cool guy. I should also mention Morgan Freeman, the exposition man, who was probably cast just because he has a nice voice and was supposed to explain the story. The other actors did a good job as well, I suppose, but their performances won't be particularly remembered: Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko does an unimpressive job, Andrea Riseborough is the best of the three. Interestignly, Kosinski only directed another movie - TRON: Legacy - which reminds of Oblivion: great visual effects but poor storytelling. I surely hope he won't continue making this kind of movies, since he seems to be on bad terms with science fiction.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A solid start to the summer blockbuster season,"In 2077 Jack Harper (Cruise) is a drone repair man on what is left of Earth. He lives in a house suspended in the clouds with his female mission controller, their every need catered for as they enjoy 'another day in paradise', making an effective team under the control of TET head office.The moon remains shattered in the night sky following a World War to rescue the planet from an alien invasion sixty years before. A war that was won but necessitated all remaining humans to leave for Titan's moon to start a new life. The power for the moon is provided by colossal machines pulling resource from the sea, protected by drones against 'Scav's', which is where Jack comes in. The drones are wonderful characters, like ""Pixar's"" EVE but with a very bad attitude, great sound effects and guns, lots of guns.Jack and Victoria's (Riseborough) life is pretty good. Their apartment in the sky is every Apple fanboy's wet dream and with the added benefit of naked night-time dips in their suspended pool, the daily grind is easily forgotten about.Jack however, has occasional flashbacks, remembering a woman he knew at the Empire state building, only snatches but nonetheless disturbing as both Victoria and himself had voluntary mind wipe to enable optimum mission effectiveness. The team and especially Jack's sorties to the surface are monitored minute by minute by 'Sally' (Leo), rather oddly with a strong southern drawl, back at TET.Forays to the surface are usually uneventful, Jack repairs drones, gets them back online, fights off occasional 'Scav' incursions, stays away from the radiation zone and looks forward to his next night-time swim. Most of the audience would think, this is not so bad, sign me up.However, Jack has doubts and finding the occasional discarded book, he starts to think, feel and yearn for a simpler life, perhaps more than is best for him. This gets noticed but not by who you would expect.The story, like a hyperactive magpie borrows and steals from many more famous Sc-Fi films to pull together a more thoughtful film than you might have been expecting. There is very effective action but the movie is not about blowing stuff up or killing hordes of aliens, there is intelligence here and for once, it is mostly in the script.Cruise sells this better than anyone one around, increasingly a divisive figure due to his personal life, he arguably remains our only remaining true old fashioned film mega-star. He acts well here and holds the film together, with excellent support from Riseborough as his mission buddy. The film is yet another example of the point we have now reached, where state of the art effects allow the world the characters live in to be displayed seamlessly, yet with no obvious effects at all.Visually and sonically, the film is outstanding. Director of 'Tron Legacy' Joseph Kosinski and his team, no stranger to green screens, have been so effective that it appears that they just shot the film as live action by just filming what was there. This no doubt contradicts the months of effects work of various kinds, to put such a film on the screen, truly impressive and ground breaking in it's own way.The film also allows Cruise to indulge his passion for riding, motorbikes, abseiling and flying cool pretend spaceships, all whilst wearing flash shades. It would not have taken long for him to to sign on the dotted line. Cruise also gets to team up with Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurlylenko in roles that would be a spoiler alerts. Despite Kurlynko's obvious appeal, Freeman's voice is as usual the main attraction here.Flaws, occasionally the film is heavy on American iconography and the link to Baseball and American football can seem rather indulgent in today's world movie market. The story is not always easy to follow but some thought afterwards, should most plot pieces together in the right order.The film is free of any notable graphic violence and despite some tasteful nudity and one very well deserved profanity, free of anything else that would annoy a family audience. A treat in modern blockbuster movies.SummaryConsiderably more intelligent than most Sci-Fi blockbusters, light on action but portraying a created but wholly believable world, beautifully realised.An enjoyable Sci-Fi thriller, at times derivative but in an age when everything has been done, this still manages to find a new angle and makes a solid start to the summer blockbuster season.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Epic Sci-Fi with some great twists!,"Sci-Fi movies nowadays have the tendency to be clichéd stories or remakes of old ideas, using similar characters and threats, it's not very often that a completely original idea comes along. Oblivion is one of these movies, offering both different and unique plot points, some great acting from all three leads, fantastic design and visuals and spot on directing. The story of Oblivion (taken from an un-published Graphic Novel) introduces us to a post-invasion planet Earth. After an alien invasion wiped out most of humanity, we are told that we used our nukes to end the war. 60 years have passed, and Earth is now a partially radioactive wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), is a member of a 'mop-up' team tasked with repairing drones and eliminating any remaining alien threat. But when Jack is captured by a group of humans, their leader (Morgan Freeman) tells him that things are not what they seem and that everything he knows is a lie. Director Joseph Kosinski is actually the author of the novel the film is based on, and so from start to finish this is his baby! Kosinski creates a frightening future world with Oblivion. The smoothness of many scenes and the way the film constantly holds both tension and intrigue to the viewer is so good that you forget, this is only his second film.The performances in the movie are also superb, with Tom Cruise being on top of his game as our hero, Olga Kurylenko was mysterious and sexy in her role as the survivor that Jack saves from a shuttle wreckage. I was a little disappointed that Morgan Freeman didn't have more screen time, but at least he was great in the scenes he was in. The effects were fantastic, everything from the apartment above the clouds to the ship Jack pilots all looked not only futuristic and cool but also completely plausible which I loved!In conclusion, Oblivion is a great sci-fi movie. It has a love story, great plot twists, stunning visuals, all the elements to make it a classic. However, this is by no means a film without flaws.. there is a particular revelation scene towards the end in which I spotted a pretty major continuity error, that I couldn't work out how they didn't notice it or maybe it was deliberate..i don't know! All in all, I loved this film. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen. To enhance the experience though I would suggest avoiding spoilers so it doesn't ruin the twists in the movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mediocrity is fate worse than failure.,"Mediocrity is a fate worse than failure when it comes to entertainment. An audience remembers a truly awful movie as much as they do a great one, if for completely different reasons. But nobody remembers a mediocre movie, it's just.....there. Nothing stands out about it or separates it from the hundreds of others in mediocre hell.Well, make room for one more mediocre, forgettable movie.Oblivion is the newest sci-fi/action flick starring Tom Cruise & directed by Joseph Kosinski (TRON:Legacy). In the year 2070 Earth has basically been destroyed due to a war with aliens (Scavs), the moon was blown up which caused numerous natural disasters and prompted Earth to go to war with the Scavs. The humans won, but the Earth lost, the entire population of Earth was moved to Saturns' moon, Titan. Earth is patrolled by drones that eliminate any remaining Scavs and those drones are monitored by two people; Jack Harper (Cruise) & his assigned partner Victoria. Jack soon finds out there's more living on Earth than just the Scavs & everything he thought was true is questioned. Oblivion is an original story & a great premise but it just doesn't do anything special. It starts of great & is a ton of fun for the first 30 minutes but quickly comes to a screeching bore. It's fantastic to look at though, Kosinski makes some beautiful movies I'll give him that. Like TRON:Legacy, it's a joy to look at, has some good action but is ultimately boring, overly long & too ambitious for it's own good. It's about 30 minutes too long & suffers through some pacing issues in the second half. This movie took longer to end than Return of the King. I had recently turned the corner with Tom Cruise; loved Jack Reacher & discovered the incredible Collateral. I was really excited for this one due to this; I have to give Cruise a pass for this one. He doesn't get to do ""his thing"", kinda cocky/totally confident hero that you will always root for. He starts off this way but somewhere in there he loses his charm & the movie suffers for it. I don't blame Cruise for this, you're only as good as the materials you're working with. Morgan Freeman has an extended cameo & he plays Morgan Freeman as usual.Oblivion is yet another case of the trailers deceiving the audience; instead of a sci-fi flick with a ton of action, great visuals, original story & a fun hero I got an overly long, too ambitious, boring, great looking, original story with a boring hero. Oblivion was one of my anticipated movies for 2013, it will be ultimately forgotten & looked at as a missed opportunity & replacement for Ambien for me.www.backdoorreviews.com",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fresh, Visually Unprecedented, Emotional, Uplifting, Classic.","There is very mixed reviews on Oblivion, I can understand why, the plot is not flawless, other than that this movie is not far off perfect.Visually, its unmatched, there is no other movie in existence that combines the actors and absolutely incredible backdrops with this level of crisp, clear, sublime CGI. No shaky-camera, quick-cut nonsense, everything plays out nice and wide, a visual spectacle.The soundtrack is second to none for the genre, even critically compared to the likes of Blade Runner.The acting is AMAZING, I am not a Tom Cruise fan, i've always found him underwhelming, this is his best performance by far, the supporting roles (although few of them) are all absolutely solid too, absolutely integral for a film with such few leads.Plotwise (NO SPOILERS) I thought it was very, very good, the pacing is absolutely fantastic, it starts of slow just to ease you into the surroundings, and the momentum just expands gradually and appropriately in an exciting, edge of your seat fashion.There are many twists, a couple of which I figured out just before they were revealed, and several that absolutely blew me away. One thing I liked about this too is although it's relatively easy to digest on the surface as the film rolls out, it will leave you (in a matrix/inception sense) thinking deeper and deeper into what you've just witnessed, even promoting yourself to add ideas of your own. Some would say this is a bad thing as it should be clear in the film, others (including me) think there can be nothing better than a Sci-Fi film that plants a new concept and ideas in your head that cause your mind to fizz up after :D.If your thinking of watching this film, do yourself a favour and don't research too much into it, i've put everything you need to know in this review, its a superb film that anyone of any age can enjoy, and you will experience emotional, mental, visual and audible excitement from start to finish.

Best big budget Sci-fi in many years!,"I came on here to relate my experience with the voice of the thousands. Well though many of the reviews here are fair, there are many that seem to exist to show their hate for anything sci-fi. They just don't seem to get it, and therefore love to say how much they hate it.Many people are saying this is nothing new because there are elements that remind the viewer of films like the matrix, moon, independence day etc., but that's just like giving any rom-com a 0/10 because it contains kissing and laughing, a break up and a get together.On to the film... I wasn't expecting much, the trailer gave no indication for a developing story-line at all, and though most Tom Cruise films are entertaining, they're never exactly high-brow. How I was proved wrong. It is well written, imaginative, thrilling, epic, emotional, and never forced. it's more than enough to pick up sci-fi reputation after Prometheus dropped it. It's easy to pick one or two could-be-holes, but just as easy to use your brain and fill them in yourself. Just watch it; if you respect sci-fi, then you won't be disappointed.Also great music by M83, a few tracks noticeably similar to tracks from TDKR, but can't exactly blame them, and they're not the only ones capitalising on Batman's success in the music department.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
'Oblivion',"I love my science fiction, and 'Oblivion' felt like a homage to my favourite genre, taking it's recognisable themes from the world of sci- fi.It was also a stunning looking film. From the design (the bubblecraft and drones for example) and the visuals (cinematography was by Claudio Miranda, who won Oscars for his work on 'Life Of Pi' and 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button') and the barren landscapes of a war torn Earth. If ever there was a gorgeous looking film, then this is it!I also enjoyed director Joseph Kosinski's first film, 'Tron: Legacy', and 'Oblivion' seems to continue his style of gorgeously shot films, and I certainly look forward to more from this director.The story itself, which is based on an unpublished graphic novel by Kosinski (an illustrated novel will hopefully be released), and without giving too much of things away, has Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), and his by-the-book assistant Vika (Andrea Riseborough) assigned to Earth, its surface devastated after decades of war with the alien Scavs, to repair the damaged drones that scan the planet surface. When Jack discovers a crashed spacecraft, it's contents bring into question everything he believed about the war, and may even put the fate of mankind in his hands. The trailers don't give too much away, for a change, and although towards the end it becomes a bit of a sci-fi mixtape with familiar tropes from some of my favourite sci-fi films, it's still a very enjoyable ride!The soundtrack by Anthony Gonzalez of M83 and Joseph Trapanese is one of the highlights of the film and very haunting. I've been listening to the score leading up to watching the movie, it's very good as a standalone piece and it does work especially well within the film. It did remind me at times of Daft Punk's score from 'Tron:Legacy' and 'Blade Runner' by Vangelis, which is no bad thing at all!If you go in expecting a full on action sci-fi with aliens etc, like the trailers may have presented then you may come out of the cinema disappointed. But, if you're after a bit of quality in the same vein as 'Moon' and love science fiction, like I do, then you will enjoy 'Oblivion'. I can't wait for the blu!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellent and affecting science fiction, unusually sophisticated for high budget blockbuster","Excellent fusion of romance and sf, slightly over-length but utterly engrossing and beautifully filmed by 'Life of Pi' cinematographer Claudio Miranda, very affecting performances. A few clichés enter film in second half but overall it's a sophisticated mix of sf and action as most of the serious US critics recognised. It is difficult to discuss this film without spoilers but it combines a number of sf themes and ideas in a way that is extremely satisfying. Elements of 'Solaris', 'La Jetee', 'Moon' and much more.

Not Really Satisfy With It.,"The main reason I went to see this movie was because of Joseph Kosinski and what he has done with Tron: Legacy (that movie was awesome by the way!!). This movie has potential to become really good but I think because of its story that lack substance it bring the whole thing down.This movie is more like a sci fi/ drama rather than sci fi/action that we mostly get nowadays but never the less there are still some action to enjoy. Yes, only some (very few to be precise).The story of a man left on the ruined earth with only one mission: to extract Earth's remaining resources and repair driod. Sound fun? Yes it is. But sitting in the theatre for one full hour watching Tom Cruise repair droid ain't much of a fun (it will come to the point when you will thinking to yourself – ""will there be anything happen in this movie?)The second part of the movie is when most stuff happen, when things get more interesting and clues start reveling and action start happening. Everything squeezes into this one hour that you hardly get to know and feel for the movie. I don't think I even get the name of Morgan Freeman.Anyway apart from the story everything is not bad. It got brilliant direction, acting (by Tom Cruise), CGI, music and the tone of the movie. But with weird choppy dialogue and the story that has been told a million times in other movie - this left me totally unsatisfied with this movie.If this wasn't for Tom Cruise and good CGI I think this movie going to fail.My recommendation: Worth a rental!!Rating: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great throwback to the sci-fi flicks of the 70s.,"'OBLIVION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new big budget, special effects laden, sci-fi/action film extravaganza starring Tom Cruise. This one was directed by Joseph Kosinski and it's his sophomore film effort (after the 2010 blockbuster sequel 'TRON: LEGACY'). Kosinski co-wrote the screenplay, with Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt (of 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE', 'TOY STORY 3', 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE' and 'STAR WARS: EPISODE VII' fame), and adapted it from his own unpublished graphic novel, of the same name. It's about a future where the world has been attacked by aliens and due to the destruction of the moon, as a result of the war, Earth's surviving human population moves to a space station called Tet and establishes a colony on Titan. Cruise plays a technician stationed on Earth in order to repair drones and protect machinery which is used to gather up the planet's remaining resources. The film is a great throwback to the sci-fi flicks of the 70s and it's visually striking enough, as well as emotionally intriguing, to make it worth while for any sci-fi nerd.Cruise plays Jack Harper, a technician/pilot finishing out the last couple weeks of his assignment on Earth; repairing droids to secure the use of other machinery there (used in gathering resources for the remaining human population). Once finished he can return home to live on Titan. His lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), is a communications officer stationed on the planet with him. The two report to their commanding officer on Tet, Sally (Melissa Leo), and also must worry about the remaining alien hostiles on the planet , called Scavengers (which the drones are used to wipe out). Jack and Victoria live in a tower miles above the ground and have no memory of the past (as their memory was erased in order to protect it from interrogation by the Scavengers). Despite the memory wipe Jack continues to have dreams of a woman from his past (Olga Kurylenko) and when a ship crashes on the planet with her on board (in a sleeping capsule) his whole life (and what he thought he knew) is forever changed.The movie of course has amazing visuals and is breathtaking to look at (any idiot can tell that from the previews though), what I enjoyed just as much as the special effects though was the story. It's involving and full of surprising twists and turns (although it does get a little too complicated towards the end, at least for me). It really does have that classic 70s/80s sci-fi feel to it and I'm sure most fans of the genre will eat it up. Kosinski proves once again that he's a master of these type of movies but the true highlight of the film is Tom Cruise and his performance. No matter what you think of him as a person he is one of the most talented movie stars working in Hollywood today. He always gives 110 percent and this film is no different; you can really feel his emotions and passion every step of the way. The character and his drama isn't quite worthy of such a performance though, and that's the one negative thing about it. The film does still work on all levels though; it's not a masterpiece but Cruise does masterful work in it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Visual Delight,"As a big fan of the sci-fi genre, it often saddens me to see the same old Aliens attacking the earth and wearing slightly different costumes every time. Somehow someone always turns out to be the hero and saves planet earth. All the innovation on the part of filmmakers is spent on the guns, artillery and destruction images. For me, this doesn't work at all. What I desire to see in a Sci-fi movie- more importantly a movie dealing with Outer Space are images- Strong images that emphasizes on the idea of the life beyond earth or far from earth. This is where 2001: A space Odyssey succeeded in an almost unparalleled way. Those visuals that showed the outer space or should I say the Director's (or the novelist's) imagination of the outer space. Those images and the strong focus and pause on each and every image are what made it so much special. Similarly Danny Boyle's Sunshine or Duncan Jones's Moon worked for me big time- both have them having strong focus on the visuals and done subtly.Watching Oblivion was a great experience for me. It's quite different from what's shown in the Trailers. It's such a breath of fresh air from the loud action zero story science fiction which have less science in the fiction. The most striking feature of the film is its visuals. From Tom cruise's Aircraft to the monitoring system to his station where he lives are all simply stunning, There's a scene where the lead actress goes bare body in a swimming pool- Trust me if you will- the beauty of that scene is not the actress's body but the swimming pool. The Images of a disaster struck Earth and the mini twists in the story compliment the visuals beautifully. It's a long 2 hour plus film and believe me, I was ready to watch it again once it got over.The story is very good if not great and even though I could guess the twists and turns, I liked it that they were there. The first 30 minutes and the last 15 minutes are visually stunning. Tom Cruise is perfect for this role. It's amazing how calmly he portrayed a character which could have been done horribly wrong by some other actors. Tom displays the right emotions and manages to depict his attachment to his planet through his monologues and gestures.Oblivion is a great film for me. Not because it has an exceptional story to tell but because the path the filmmaker chose to tell it. There could have been a lot of noise and unnecessary activity in this film but it remains subtle and does the job in a brilliant way. Love it for the story , love it for the background score, love it for discovering the now getting lost emotion of ""Man's love for his planet"" and love it for the visuals. I hope there are more such Sci-fi movies in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Channels the best of sci-fi,"In a world where sycophants and yuppies demand to see something new every tenth of a second it's good to see that great stories can still be told. Oblivion channels the best of sci-fi to ask the most basic questions - Who am I, Why am I here and What is it to be Human? The basic run down is simple, Jack is a drone repairman. The drones are AI controlled robot sentinels guarding the extraction of the last of the earth resources. Jack's work is vital, the last of humanity is relying on those resources for it's very survival. The 'Scavs' on the other hand will do anything to sabotage this important work.Good sci-fi should examine the human condition, the cool technology and flashy effects merely a vehicle to explore not space but ourselves. This vehicle is used expertly here. Jack has a good life. He thinks everything is as it should be, but as he learns more he begins to doubt what he knows to be the truth. He is forced to ask the questions that need to be asked. This leads to a discovery that will change everything.It is not perfect though. There are two big issues - 1. Emotional engagement and 2. Story flow. The character development is not as strong as it could be over the course of the movie, as such The audience is not given enough reason to care deeply about the characters. The characters just feel a little static, not really developing much throughout. This may be because of the story's development - it went from prelim treatment to (as yet unpublished) graphic novel to movie in just a few short years. The story seems to suffer a bit from the same issue. For example there is one point where a vital piece of information is revealed to Jack and he seems just a little too willing to accept it, where as other things he seems to reject outright until literally bashed over the head with them. This turns out to be a pivotal moment but it seemed a little rushed where other sections of lesser import got more time and treatment. Again this is probably down to the short development time frame.This is a fantastic movie overall and I would recommend it to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just loved it,"Believe me when I say that I do not like movies because of the actors that are in them. The movies have to be good regardless of the director or film star. I say this because the last movie that completely blew me away was Vanilla Sky and now another Tom Cruise movie has done the same. I couldn't find fault with it. At all. Its visually stunning and yet very understated, not once did I feel that the creators were showing off as is so common these days. The OST is unbelievable. M83 have managed a score that easily equals Hans Zimmer, Michael Kamen and Thomas Newman. I can't speak highly enough of the music and its part in my appreciation of the film. It is simply beautiful and used to great effect throughout. Cruise is on top form and looking very comfortable. Morgan Freeman is terrific as usual and really suits the part so well. The story is not complicated but then it doesn't have to be - its a human interest story at its heart. I loved this movie. Its right up there beside Bladerunner, Star Wars and The Fifth Element on my shelf of ""classic""(!) sci-fi films.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great sci-fi adventure,"I rather enjoyed this movie. I found the story to be intriguing and the film beautifully made. It particularly excels in showing us future technology and a devastated world. Cruise's performance was superb. The movie has a couple of neat twists, but I don't want to give them away.It continues to amaze me that filmmakers can produce movies with such incredible special effects. The special effects in this movie are indeed spectacular.If I have any complaint, it's that the film caters too much to those who go to the movies to see chase scenes and shootouts. For about 5 minutes, the movie actually morphed into a video game.Also, it annoyed me that Morgan Freeman was in this movie. He can be great at times, but he is grossly overexposed. I almost considered not going because of his presence.The current IMDb score is inexplicably too low. I checked out a few earlier reviews to see why. Reading some of these reviews, it seems that the lower scores hinge on three factors: (1) the presence of Cruise; (2) the similarity to other movies; and (3) lack of realism.It seems there are some people who atavistically dislike Cruise and wish he would abandon Hollywood and stop making movies. I get that. But regardless of what you think of Cruise, he remains a talented actor; he shows here he can easily and convincingly play the lead role in an action-adventure movie. (Come to think of it, I cannot think of a recent movie in which Cruise has not excelled.)It's more or less impossible now to produce any movie that does not remind moviegoers of earlier films. All movies are derivative, to a certain extent. And to give this movie a ""1"" for that reason is unfair. This movie is absolutely not a ripoff of ""Moon"". There was one similar plot device. That was it. And even if movies are similar, so what? References and allusions are standard in any medium or genre. They give a movie depth.Some reviewers have dissected the movie to look for aspects that are less than completely realistic. However, I noticed none of their points while watching the movie. It all worked for me, and if something is truly unrealistic I notice it immediately. There was nothing that was so jarringly unrealistic that it ruined the film for me.I'd go see this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A pleasant surprise of a movie,"I had no idea when I went for the movie except that it starred Tom Cruise and that it was science fiction and went ahead because English movies don't stay long where I live. So it was a completely pleasant surprise that the movie was much better than I had been expecting. While one could guess the possible ways in which plot might turn, you have to commend the film makers to keep us guessing. Both my wife and daughter loved the movie and my wife declared it as the best movie since Inception. While that may be an exaggeration, a movie definitely worth watching. It was visually stunning with very believable future technology and transportation. Olga and Andrea were inspired casting as was Morgan Freeman.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually stunning!,"This is an excellent movie which entertained me thoroughly. Visually, this is stunning. A post apocalyptic world this beautiful will make you yearn for apocalypse! In fact, some impact of the desolation shown is lost as everything looks so good. Too good, maybe. The story is also good, though the surprise is revealed midway, and then the movie turns into a sci-fi actioner. But overall, an engaging story throughout.Tom Cruise is his dependable self and carries the movie. Andrea Riseborough is very good. Morgan Freeman is underused. Olga Kurylenko was the weak link. I couldn't picture her as a 'haunting' presence at all.I didn't watch TRON Legacy, so did not know what to expect from director Joseph Kosinski. Apart from the visual flair, I think he handled the pacing very well. Movie starts with foreboding stillness and gathers speed as tension builds. Did I mention the visuals?

OBLIVION... send it to oblivion.,"I must say I have been privileged to watch (partly) one of the worst movies ever. Unbelievable!! I simply walked out after about half an hour. This was utterly boring and stupid. I do not like post apocalyptic movies in general. However, I thought ... Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman ( I never saw him)... This must be good. Was I wrong!!! I would never recommend this to anyone unless they are big fans of senseless crap. Very disappointing. Tom Cruise is a great actor and I do expect a lot more that this. I must say he has his moments. He has done many good movies as well as bad. This is one of them.OBLIVION... send it to oblivion.Very appropriate title.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best sci-fi movies,"Easily the best sci-fi film since Serenity (2005).Borrowing heavily from Moon (2009), Oblivion (2013) does not disappoint. The plot is predictable but at least the science behind it is plausible unlike many other sci-fi movies. Action scenes are very well-executed and the sound effects are top notch. Anyone that doesn't like this movie likely shouldn't be watching sci-fi as the back-story and science is elementary for anyone with a scientific background.Tom Cruise is one of my favourite actors and is very convincing in his role as part of a ""clean-up"" team on earth. I wish he would do more sci-fi as he's great in these kind of roles. Andrea Riseborough is also very good as the other member of the team. Olga Kurylenko was an unnecessary addition and the film goes downhill somewhat when her character is introduced.The CGI and picture quality is stunning; some of the best seen so far. Sadly the film was mastered at 2K to save time & money which is a real shame.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"How can man die better: than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods","An intelligent piece of sci-fi directed by Joseph Kosinski after adapting it from his own graphic novel and a more than competent second movie for him as a director (his first being the excellent Tron Legacy).There is action aplenty in the trailers but the movie itself is more measured and thoughtful. The film provides wave after wave of revelation that had me scratching my head at one point wondering how deep all of it would go. Fairly deep as it turned out. The minimal cast all acquit themselves well. Tom Cruise as Jack Harper carries the film with ease with good support from Andrea Riseborough as the sad and confused Victoria, and also the gorgeous Olga Kurylenko.Special effects were not overplayed, they didn't need to be, but there were some great scenes of the ruined Earth, ie the harbour of ships that is now a desert and the bombed Pentagon, etc etc.Last year's Prometheus should have been like this, and not the mindless rubbish it was, I wish more films had as much care and thought put into the storyline as Oblivion.Try and see this film before it expires at the cinema, you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Original and fantastic film making at it's best.,they say there are no original ideas in movies today. All I have to do is point to Oblivion and say there is. Tom cruise is either getting better at the acting or i'm starting to like him a lot more. Oblivion takes place in the future the moon was destroyed by an alien race that wanted to ravage Earth for our resources. We won the war but lost the Earth. Now Earth is orbited by Man's new home a large space station. And the Earth is inhabited by two people Jack Harper and his partner Victoria. their job is to make sure the Drones put in place to protect the large energy processing plants are running and the plants that are harnessing fission energy for the station are running properly. they have two weeks to go before they can leave this radioactive hulk called the earth. But Jack is having strange dreams that feel like memories. And things are starting to feel strange. When Drones start disappearing and Mutant scavengers called scavs are attacking the drones and stealing them and one of the plants is destroyed. Jack is starting to realize things are not what they seem. when a ship crashed and a army of drones kills the survivors except one. Suddenly Jack has more questions then answers when the lone survivor is the woman haunting his memories. And when the Scavs kidnap him and expose him to a startling truth. Jack suddenly realizes he's running out of time. they all are. They all have one chance to escape Oblivion. Can Jack believe his eyes and ears long enough to find out the truth and who can he trust?Well done film a shining example of what Scince fiction should be.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, entertaining.","Spoiler free Review.The best aspect of this movie is without doubt the Photography. The desolation of this sad future is well brought to the screen: the music helps also to involve emotionally the viewers.The plot is nothing original, but the story is well told.The special effects are also really well done, and the drones in their simplicity are just scaring and cold. The design recalls a lot the one seen in District 9 (the weapons at least).What i really didn't like was Tom Cruise. I am not talking about his performance (that in my opinion was really good), but about his presence as main action hero. Maybe this is a subjective thing, but i would have preferred to see some one else instead of him.Cool movie, anyway. One of the best Sci-Fi in the last 5 years i would say.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quality Sci-fi with Some Mass Market Appeal,"Beautiful visuals. Great score and sound effects. Good story. Good stunts and special effects. Very entertaining. Strong ending. Smooth and consistent. Tom Cruise brings star power and credibility to the project and is his usual self. Andrea Riseborough really shines and does a wonderful job as Victoria. Every scene she is in is just terrific. Olga Kurylenko's character didn't do it for me though.If you're looking for purist-level sci-fi you may be a little let down in spots as Oblivion certainly drifts off into ""mass market appeal"" mode in a few major scenes that I don't think really needed to be there to tell the story properly but overall this is one that most sci-fi fans will enjoy and it will also satisfy a lot of viewers who don't normally go for this genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A surprising gem,"This was one of those films that flew under the radar, I remember seeing adverts in 2013 for it's theatrical release but I never bothered going. At the time I felt we were too saturated with other sci-fi themed films and it was becoming somewhat tiresome. Fast forward 8 years and I finally watched in 2021, to my surprise I absolutely loved this film. The ambience, visuals and performance from the leading cast drew you into the story of this strange new dystopian world, with plenty of plot twists it keeps you on your toes all the way to the end. The soundtrack is also excellent and compliments the mood of the film perfectly. If you are looking for a truly enjoyable experience with well worth the 2 hour runtime.

Totally Baffling,"If you have any clue what is going on in this movie you are the new Einstein. Its like the writers have taken the loose pages of 2001 a space odyssey, Star Wars and perhaps Whalley?,threw them up in the air together, picked them up randomly and used them as the screen play. The plot is very poorly explained making the film very hard to follow. The story was more of a shoot 'em up computer game than a sci fi movie. If your concentration wavers for a second, you haven't a clue who is who or where they are or when it is happening. Effects are good with a lot of speed scenes and explosions.

A movie worth watching,"C'mon now admit it, you thought it would be another sci-fi movie with good CGI's and acting doesn't matter... Well you are not entirely wrong. The acting here is very decent.

I don't use that word often, however i really think this movie deserves a thumbs up. This is because all the questions are not left unanswered in this movie, in which is a big plus point for me.The twists in the story does not confuse the audience, moreover annoys them. The acting however is rather annoying, especially Olga Kurylenko. Andrea Riseborough brought out a great performance (thank god) and surprisingly i wasn't enjoying tom cruise's acting.

The story was beautifully written, stunningly filmed. Certainly hit me enough to go and see it twice in IMAX.One thing that really did it for was the music. Perhaps the best film score I've heard for several years. The cinematography is quite something, not many sci-fi films manage to look quite so real. Some say it loses momentum during the second half but I actually felt the second half was just as strong. It really builds up to a fantastic climax that works incredibly well with the music.Yes it might be a bit predictable but that's not always a bad thing in my opinion.

Into Oblivion,"This is a fantastic example of old school sci-fi. The look is mind blowing and the soundtrack a delight. This was a film that really stuck with me for a few days after watching it which, for me is a sign of a classic.Cruise does what he does best and carries the key role well. He is ably assisted by the other cast members but the win goes to Freeman. His understated performance hit the right note for a film of this size and scope. The story twists at a nice pace and the action is not over-extended. All in all, this is a fine film and a future benchmark for the genre.This being Kosinsky's second film he must be praised for a work so detailed and entertaining. Better than Tron Legacy and a new marker in his journey in Hollywood. I for one will be keeping an eye on his future projects.Oblivion won't win loads of awards but it will stick in your mind and give you a sense of what good sci-fi looks like.

Great movie: tom cruise has done it again,"I this movie is a good mix between sci-fi-action-romance. I wish it had a little more action in it, but it is not really that type of movie.

It was very keyboard meets action thriller which failed a little for me. This takes place in the future the date the earth was destroyed which was 2017 and it takes place 60 years after that. Tom cruise is an action movie nut. He always does a great job with his characters. This movie is made in layers details in this movie always come back to some importance.

Awesome movie w/ great characters and plot,"There are a few movies (Sphere, Vanilla Sky, Solaris) that don't necessarily get the best ratings but are top on my all time favorites. This is now one of them. Not going to say much other than I loved the special effects, character progression, overall plot, and awesome job from the actors/actresses. When you continue to think about a movie for several days after watching it, you know it really had an impact and succeeded in captivating your thoughts and attention.I loved that it didn't focus solely on special affects or action. There was a legitimate story line that never failed to carry me all the way through without boring me. A few times I caught myself whispering things like, ""whoa, that's crazy"", or ""didn't expect that""... Not something I usually do throughout a movie.

A massive amazing opportunity....absolutely wrecked by developers that had no creativity besides machinery making and apocaliptic landscaping,"So many things that could have been tackled by this movie and none of them even crossed at surface level.
Are we more than just our memories, bodies and DNA? Can we trust the jobs and the place in society we are assigned to? Are we just like every other worker, given no identity, dignity or difference whatsoever in the eyes of our hierarchic superiors? Must we obey our God or face him and set each of ourselves as our own Gods?
I don't know and this movie sure didn't prove to even be aware it could have been as grand as one that indeed noticed how to write characters' speech and plot and become a movie with it's own identity, character... art. Becoming a must watch that could make each and everyone of it's viewers make real questions and become inspired. That's what this movie could have been. That's certainly, ufortunately, what this movie isn't.Also, despite the infinite plot holes, at the part where it is said ""I am your God, I created you"", and I looked at his inspired, determined face imagining him to say ""I am my own God""... and the reply we get is ""F you Sally""...

An excellent homage to the sci-fi greats,"I like many other reviewers here truly recommend viewing this film with a clean slate. That is really how all movies should be viewed anyway, if this were a perfect world. If anyone happens to be reading this who has not yet seen the movie, just stop reading reviews and go watch it.One thing I notice is that people are complaining that this is a 'rip off' of previous sci-fi films and that should be a bad thing. I disagree. Leaving the theatre I had the distinct impression that the director wanted to weave together a slew of creative sci-fi themes and into one standalone film, and I think he did a fantastic job. It is an excellent homage to the great sci-fi movies that have come before it and I think the mistake is in thinking that this movie is trying to be one of them. It isn't. I tire of the critics who yelp at every movie that doesn't present an original idea as though originality is the only key to successful film making. I also tire of the Tom Cruise critics, who seem to grasp at any opportunity to discredit the man, despite the fact that he *is* a great actor who has made some very good movie choices over the past decade.In my opinion, a good movie is one that makes you think and affects you in some positive way long after viewing it. While Oblivion is a first rate entertainment movie - with it's stunning visuals and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that shines throughout - it is also a dissection of humanity. There are clear religious elements to this movie as well, which I found surprising (Adam and Eve: ""another day in paradise""). While the ideas presented here seem very familiar to avid sci-fi fans (Hello Moon and Matrix!), Oblivion utilizes these themes to convey a message about the enduring human spirit. A message that is worth repeating in cinema. Oblivion is also a character piece rather than a strictly 'humans vs aliens' piece and while Tom Cruise does not pull out any major stops here, his acting is solid, and you warm to his character by the end of the film. Morgan Freeman is just Morgan Freeman. And there's nothing wrong with that, because the dude is awesome. I think a special mention should go to Andrea Riseborough here. Her acting was also solid throughout and I feel her achievements are being overlooked.More than anything, I feel that the soundtrack to Oblivion is what sold it to me. The film is bathed in a beautiful musical score and the theme especially is just fantastic. It would be a crying shame for Oblivion to not be nominated for best original score as this is where it truly triumphs. The music is atmospheric and has an ethereal quality to it.Altogether, a beautiful piece of cinema that is a feast for the eyes, ears and soul. The only thing I can say that I wish was explained more in this movie would be the villain, as their motives in the final segment of this movie makes little sense. However, enjoy it for what it is and don't cry for what it is not. I give this a 8/10 which is quite high, but I feel it deserves a high rating as this is a high quality film. Don't miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Tom Cruise in sci-fi movie? Couldn't been better, actually was brilliant.","Very intellectual and interesting good sci-fi movie for a long time.I had some thoughts of ""what the heck is this?"" because Tom Cruise in such a movie but happily I was wrong.Great character development, great plot, directing acting and all.Movie had everything one can want in this genre, CGI was fitted perfectly to other things going around and there wasn't too much explosions or so to make it success, this one didn't need those. Also I liked the future scene, very unique.. brilliant. And those droids were so cool looking.. Usually they are some ready-made crap.Only thing that I missed was in the end, the story development because it was kind of twisted too long, there could have been something but maybe it was just good as it was. Cant get any bad thoughts about this one.10/10 truly.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Get Ready for Cruise Control!,"I have always been a sucker for Tom Cruise's movies, and this is no exception.Tom single-handedly carries this movie. Its difficult nowadays to find actors from his generation that still maintain box office draw. Tom is not just a survivor, but he's getting better. This is the man Hollywood can count on.The cinematography is epic, because of that new camera they used. The CGI is superb. Tom, Olga and Andrea also easy on the eyes. Visually, this movie is very nice to look at. I love the beautiful locations (desert, waterfall, oasis, etc).The story is almost original. There are some parts that remind me of other sci-fi flicks like The Matrix and Independence Day (you'll know which parts I refer to after watching this). Still, I was entertained and was kept on the edge of my seat.There are some parts from the soundtrack that sound like Inception, or maybe that just me.I don't care whether Tom jumps on Oprah's sofa again, but he is the undisputed king of the box office.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And the entire movie gets boring and boring...As usual, the trailer looks like a much better movie than the movie itself.

An intense SCI Movie to watch with music volume set on high,"This movie hooked me up on the early beginning by its theme song. And this movie, in my humble opinion, its all about its music.CGI was perfect, acting perfect as fit. Story, nothing really new but enough to keep you interested. Few characters so you can keep a clear mind. And all that glued with a perfect soundtrack, making the movie timing perfect, with a very genuine pace.This movie it's about feeling and experience. So a good movie system is required.It's not a groundbreaking movie, or something that would change you or history of the cinema. Even so, its pure entertainment - to watch alone, with a friend or a companion.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
There is More than One of Everything,"Tom Cruise just seems to be getting younger, as long as he does not grow a beard. Whether he is Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible or here as Tech Jack Harper, he never seems to age, and his energy is great. I don't care if he's tapping the energy of some Mothership, he's still OK by me.Speaking of Mothership, there is one in this film that is a real Mother, if we remove the word ""Ship"" from the end and add in something more derogatory.As we get into this film, Jack recites a ""Revisionist Future History"" of sorts. There had been an invasion. The moon has been blown to bits, and all the ""hoomans"" moved away after the ""war"" and are living on Saturn's moon Titan. There are huge water Sucking machines gobbling up all the earths oceans drop by precious drop, supposedly to send it all to Titan. And it's Jack's job as ""Tech"" to keep these things running, along with a bunch of Robotic Drones that kill off apparent left-over ""invaders"" that are still hanging around Earth for some unknowable reason.Jack's assigned wife is ""Victoria"" (Andrea Riseborough) and she's his Comm officer. They report to ""Sally"" (Melissa Leo) who is allegedly on Titan supervising them. It's a ""Mop Up Operation"" as Jack puts it, they have two weeks to go, then they can all go home to ""Titan"" and live happily ever after.But Jack keeps seeing the image of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and it bothers him. He doesn't even know who she is. But lately Jack has been picking up Books and other pieces of remaining culture and he hides them away at some house by a lake, which appears to be an oasis in a land basically barren. It's off the Grid, so Victoria has never seen it - Victoria stays high up in some Sky Nest monitoring the Comms while Jack roams the earth fixing broken Drones. He keeps asking Victoria if she won't go down to the surface with him, but she always refuses.The Robotic Drones are there to kill off the ""Invaders"", Jack can't comprehend why they are still there and why they are so tenacious. There is nothing left, isn't there? We get flashes of their POV now and then along with images of what look like Scurrying Animals. When Jack falls into a pit which is the Public Library in NY City, they don't shoot him. Why?In fact there are two histories running at once, the revisionist history which we are led to believe, and what really happened, which comes to Jack in dreams and visions. Which one is real? And who is this Woman?But all things start getting answered, when an Orbiting Spaceship falls to the earth after 60 years, and who is in it but the Woman which Jack dreams about. As a matter of fact, Jack's world is twisted totally out of proportion from this moment on.What I love about this film is the imagery, it's a totally believable surrealistic landscape of a world devastated. Combinations of CGI and Practical Filming leave no indications where one ends and the other begins. What we have here is an antiseptic High-Tech World above the sky and the remnants of the devastation below. Of particular visual interest is an image of the very top of the Empire State Building sticking out of a sea of sand, for some reason, a signal is sent from this ruin to some place in the sky.But ""Nothing is as it Seems"" and ""There Is More than One of Everything"". These two Axioms form the basis of what is a wholly unpredictable and enjoyable movie. Keep your eyes peeled for Morgan Freeman and the Stuntwoman-Goddess Zoe Bell, because ""Humans show up when they are least expected"".Directed by Newcomer Joseph Kosinski who wrote the original Graphic Novel this was based on, we can be safely assured there are no ""Temporal Causality Loops"" or other gimmicks used by filmmakers. This is wholly original ground, even though it is basically Tom Cruise running around with a Gun- but I have always enjoyed Tom Cruise running around with a gun.The Film's Score co-written by Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese (The Bourne Legacy) is Bookended with a wonderful song performed by M. 8. 3. - So it's new faces all around.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Story was absolutely amazing, If you are fan of alien invasion movies and world ends this is the movie for you. Appearance of Morgan Freeman made this movie so much better.But to be honest this movie was predictable at the end. Too many silence scenes; no music. Final conclusion, great movie, warmly recommended to watch. Rate 8/10 because it was kinda predictable for me.

For sci-fi lovers that are not after action only,"I have been a huge fan of sci-fi from childhood, not only in terms of watching movies, but also reading most of classic sci-fi novels... And lately I have been having tough time to find a sci-fi movie to enjoy, because it all seem to go in the direction of action & violence and very simple stories that let you switch off the brain and eat your popcorn, like Ironman and Avengers...Now, Oblivion was a treat and a very enjoyable piece. Perhaps not the ultimate sci-fi movie (for that I would want to have my mind twisted a bit more, and to see more of exploration of the unknown possibilities), yet it does have enough exploration for me to meet my sci-fi standards: question of identity, question of what it means to be human, question of the meaning of life/death, question of true love...So, yes, if you like sci-fi movies that touch your mind as well as your heart (and not only your eyes and your ears), you will probably enjoy this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not a bad story, but definitely overlong and too many video-game style fights","An uneven mix of Moon, Star Wars, The Matrix and any post-apocalyptic movie. Cruise stars as usual as the hero of the story (in this case, even multiple hero), a guy named Jack who is watching over planet earth after an alien invasion destroyed the moon.He lives in a wonderful, futuristic villa with a beautiful, stylish, well-dressed woman and commutes by helicopter around the planet to fix sophisticated broken weapons (called ""drones""). Not a bad job or accommodation, if you ask me. Desolate earth looks quite peaceful and not having traffic jams or annoying neighbors looks great. Unfortunately for Jack, dark secrets are lurking around. Jack discovers that things are not quite as he thinks and that perhaps it would have been better if they were.The discovery involves the crash of an ""old"" spacecraft containing mysterious Julia, who is mysteriously related to Jack. After the crash the movie lose steam and it turns into a boring ride involving too many video-game style fights.The end is quite a let-down. Throughout the movie, which is a good 20 minutes too long, I just kept wondering what Jack and co. were eating, since there was no visible sign of agriculture, fishing or any other activity that provides food. And also, where those stylish clothes were coming from",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This movie makes me think there is still hope for Hollywood. Imax made it even better experience and I'm happy it wasn't in 3d,just too much movies are done in 3d its getting boring fast.It is noticeable that the same crew worked on Tron,because visuals and sounds are amazing.I wont write anything about the plot cause i don't like spoilers in the conclusion anyone who likes to watch sci fi movies will not be disappointed and anyone who doesn't like them might just start to.

Exquisite production and great performers wasted on feeble script,"This film looks beautiful. The ravaged Earth, full of the detritus of civilisation; the lovingly designed aircraft and drones; and the house that looks like something from the Jetsons brought to architect-inspired life. They are all stunning, and the film lingers over them, rightly proud of their magnificent, on-screen realisation. Cruise, Freeman, Riseborough and Kurylenko all turn in solid performances, but the show is stolen by Leo as Sally (""Are you an effective team?"") even though she only appears as a video image, and mostly in grainy black and white. GoT's Costner-Waldau is wasted in a cardboard cut-out role.Ultimately, however, the film disappoints time and again through its shoddy script and tiredly predictable, pasted-on action sequences. The film is at its best when nothing much is happening, little or nothing is being said and you have time to just gaze at the gorgeous eye-candy.As with the original cinema release of ""Bladerunner"", the expository voice-over narration at the start is a mistake and serves only as the first example of the many disappointments to come in the ham-fisted storytelling.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is what sci-fi should be all about!!,"OK, THIS is what sci-fi is, not The Colony or 2012.In Oblivion everything is not what it seems to be and the movie starts with a beautiful concept that it is able to get it through and through.From the very start you know something is off in the task Jack is assigned to do but I will not tell any spoilers since, knowing them will ruin the majority of the good script and incredible solid experience.The acting is top notch, the sound is by far one of the best i've seen this year, music is incredible inspired and directing is, well, how to put it, one of the best i've seen this year.I was almost beginning to lost all hope on the sci-fi front for a good movie when Oblivion makes its appearance now we have a major contender for the movie of the year alone with Elysium.This is what sci-fi SHOULD be all about, not about special effects (although there are and they are top notch) but characters we care about, a script that is solid, lines well said, moments that have meaning and are not clichéd and above all, a plot well developed. Oblivion will not try to impress you with action sequences, effects are natural, incredible well crafted and more importantly, they are there for the purpose of telling the story, not to show off, also, the movie's action parts are there too, for the plot, they don't feel to be put to give you a wow moment, but to put you into the character's shoes, the world of Oblivion is incredible alive!Oblivion will bore the easy movie goer that wants action but will turn upside down the sci-fi lover, this movie has it all, it is slow at the beginning but not because it's boring, it's because it takes it's characters very seriously, the plot is extremely interesting and full of enigmas, rises a lot of questions and opens up the can or worms to a lot of interesting ideas with the plot after the movie ends, Oblivion takes advantage of it's actors, have deep atmosphere that will expand in your mind after you watched it, and above all, it is inspired.Oblivion does not think it's viewers are dumb, it does not need to explain everything and so, does not need to deliver stupid obvious lines through it's actors, you have to figure things out for yourself and this is a wonderful comeback for the genre.The ending is actually so good, without giving you all the answers but actually creating new ones that feels like sci-fi can be a respected genre once again.Oblivion is miles ahead of any other movie of this genre from this year, you MUST go see it you will not regret it, and don't let anyone spoil the movie for you, make your own conclusions and enjoy it.It's the first movie I truly enjoyed this year and deserves a solid 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Old-skool Sci-Fi goodness,"Real good. Some have complained that this film is derivative... but with the wealth of science fiction stories, series and movies that exist in the world at this point, it would be hard not to be a little derivative. The Matrix was derivative. Didn't stop it being a modern classic.In fact, this movie is a real homage to the best themes and traits of classic science fiction. The plot plays out like a very large-scale early 20th century sci-fi novel with added hi-octane action, the visuals are frankly stunning (blame Iceland's scenery for much of that) and Tom Cruise and co. give really solid, seamless performances.The ambient music is really well integrated with the rest of the movie, and the score is just a touch quirky in places, enough to be original by Hollywood standards.It's got plot, visuals, soundtrack, performances... and even a subtle subversive political message (subtle enough to annoy some people without them realizing why, methinks). It ticks all the boxes, and is officially the only movie I've ever given ten stars to... this decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Year's First Real Contender for Oscar Consideration,"I knew nothing about the story of ""Oblivion"" when I went in the theater, but when I came out I was completely awed by this movie. This is the first film this year that I feel is a real contender for Oscar nominee consideration.The story is intelligent without being too ""Inception""-like in its telling and development. The setting is the future after aliens have destroyed the Earth. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a technician who fixes drones or ""Wall- E""-like flying robot police gofers of that time. He works with with his partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) and they report to a talking head on their computer named Sally (Melissa Leo). He keeps having flashbacks of going around the observation deck of the Empire State Building with a woman. One day, he rescues a female crew member of a pod that crash-landed named Julia (Olga Kurylenko), who could be connected with his past. A band of human rebels (led by Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) gives Jack an insight on his real nature. I could not divulge anymore details so as not to spoil your enjoyment of this must-see film.The technical aspects of this film were flawless. The cinematography by Claudio Miranda was breathtaking, and the director really takes time with these beautiful imagery. The art direction for this futuristic setting, from the stylish tech towers to the ruins of Manhattan, were all very well done. That transparent flying machine they use is radical in design and movement. The visual effects, so integral for science fiction films like this, were very subtle, not obtrusive at all. The atmospheric musical score was awesome, from the big orchestral sweeping ones for grandeur to those small quiet rhythmic ones for suspense.Tom Cruise does very well in this movie as the central character Jack. He does not overact this time. On the contrary, he was quite unusually reserved in his approach, underplaying, which was perfect for his character. I am not exactly thinking of an acting nomination or anything though but he is so right for the role. Freeman and the exotic Bond girl also do well in their smaller supporting roles.OK, there are some derivative scenes which may remind you of ""Star Wars"" or ""Planet of the Apes."" But more important than those observations, writer-director Joseph Kosinski really had a good story and he tells it very well indeed. He knows how to maximize the talents of his crew to create this unassuming but excellent sci-fi masterpiece. Highly recommended! .",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A little bit of everything, I realized I loved it","Watching this at the world premiere in my little hometown, not knowing anything about it except it receiving av 5 of 6 stars from my favorite film critics newspaper, I knew I was in for a treat as a sci-fi lover.Not perfect in th beginning, but slowly getting interesting. Still, as the film grew on me I realized I enjoyed the ride immensely. It's not perfect in a 100 percent way, but it's got what I love in a good sci-fi movie. I was transfered back to my classic sci-fi experiences at cinema, feeling some of the same as when I saw Blade Runner (1982), Gattaca (1997), The Fifth Element (1997), Matrix (1999) and A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).The thing about Oblivion is that it has something of everything. A lot of homages to other sci-fi movies are among them, but it's got action, sentimentality, beauty, intrigue, unexpectedness, humor, love, memories and mystery. Put in a dash of loneliness, environmental issues as well as all the hidden gems of you to discover in the rubble, then you've got a classic. I could go on, but with Morgan Freeman, Nicolaj Coaster Waldau and Tom Cruise on the team, this was a gem.This is what a sci-fi movie is all about. Stealing your imagination, making it hard to understand sometime, but then it all comes down to poetry, love and soulfulness. I realize most of the sci-fi movies I loved has had many of the same elements. Oblivion is a mix of A.I., Wall-E, Star Wars, I am Legend, Star Trek and another kind of benchmark in the genre if you ask me!And there's more than enough room for a sequel as well, in more than one way. In the end I even saw Ron L. Hubbards signs of an God-all-seeing eye which can be interpreted into almost what you want either good or bad, but most certainly something Tom Cruise could by into. Hilarious! Especially if you think him as the one bombing the whole system to pieces.Go see it, and enjoy! It's understandable that you'll forget the popcorn eating during watching it. You're still happy when you go!OK, it's cheesy, glossy and dirty as well, but saving the planet is a dirty business!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
If you haven't seen Oblivion... Don't be Oblivious,"What can I say about oblivion. Is it the best movie I have ever seen? NO, does the story have holes? YES. Do any of these two questions affect how much I liked this movie? ABSOLUTELY NOT.After reading several reviews I have found that many people criticize this movie for having wholes in it's story. The only movies that I have been able to find without any ""wholes"" in it's story, are movies that are actually based on real events. Now don't misinterpret me, there are a few movies based on real events that have wholes. Why do I bring this up? well this movie in no way shape or form stated that it was based on true a factual events, hence having wholes it's almost a given.Now to why I think this was such a good movie. Even though it was not perfect and it has it's flaws, I was able to connect with several characters in the movie, specially Tom Cruise's character. How many times have we found out that things are not like they seem? how many times have we had to make choices without having perfect knowledge on the matter? How many times where does choices easy? How many times did those choices come with a a sacrifice and a price? Because I was able to see all those different details in Oblivion is the main reason why I enjoyed it so much.The movie is not perfect, neither are we, but that still makes us great.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Good (I LIKED Tron: Legacy) - Maybe a Spoiler,"Tom Cruise is very likable, even in a stinker film, of which he has few, and this was in no way a stinker. It had a slower pace than roller coaster rides like an 'Armageddon' (in that way, like Tron: Legacy), but it held my interest and kept me engaged. Yes, there was some predictability's, but some surprises, too! And how can you not like his female counterparts.. yes, Tom always gets the girls (in that way, I'd like to see him fall down once in awhile in the movies instead of his personal life), but you can't have everything... that is, unless you are Tom Cruise... ha! I'm jealous.I agree the CGI is GREAT! And the Story, once it got past the setup, was very good - not GREAT, but I'd give it a 7.5 (I give it an 8 overall - Production Design was first-rate, like Tron).The music, well, not so great.Tom's acting gets better most of the time, and he's great as a 'come-from-behind' hero.

The reason movies are made..,"Perhaps you have already seen the previews or heard others talk about Oblivion. Maybe formed an view but haven't quite got around to seeing it for yourself yet.For me, movies like Oblivion are the reason movies are made.I have heard some people say that this movie was a bit slow, but it was ideal for me. I like action movies (perhaps more than most) but the best movies are those where the action has some meaning and the you care whether the characters live or die or something significant is depending on them. In this film - certainly I felt like the action (fantastic action - particularly the flight pursuit scene) had purpose. Characters - are very well develop and I don't think time was wasted on them even.It is a beautifully shot movie with an astounding soundtrack, some would say even haunting. I am not always a fan of constant dark or foreboding worlds (like the director's previous Tron Legacy or Cruise's Minority Report), but Cruise's character somehow in his own lost way never seems to allow us to descend into deep melancholy. Some say he carries the film, but certainly he brings an air of optimism to the scene and a touch with the reality on this side of the screen. Logic suggests other actors could also play his role. But it is hard to see someone else being able to do it better.It is a movie of a post apocalyptic world which I must say often draws me in, where existence for Cruise's character and his partner is lonely until an unexpected arrival from space.I will not go too much into the plot. It is a film with twists and revelations, but it is a film you feel you are living in. Yes, I have heard some people talk about it not having enough shots fired or maybe a copy of ideas from films like Wall-E, but I found it dramatic, very original possessing fantastic action of consequence. Perhaps like me (and many others), you will sit after the movie is over and listen to the wonderful soundtrack, being haunted by the memory and thinking about it even after a good nights sleep.For me very few movies have had such an effect on me. But it reminds me of the reason movies are made. Should be made. And why we will always watch them.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A Surprisingly Enjoyable, All Around Well Made Sci-Fi Film.","I never seem to have a consistent view on sci fi films. From hard sci-fi based in real physics of a highly possible future to the polished sheen and constant explosions of the blockbuster sci fi, I feel like I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy it. It also helps if the film has enough serious tones to solidity that mood and allow me to completely suspend my disbelief in order to really enjoy the film. And unfortunately the beginning of Oblivion put none of these elements in place. Maybe it was the film I had previously seen, The Place beyond The Pines. Maybe it was the somewhat cheesy, generic Tom Cruise character. Maybe the sci-fi world wasn't fleshed out enough. However, before long these notions had dissipated and I become fully enthralled in what would be a thoroughly enjoyable, well-made sci-fi film.Oblivion follows Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). on a wasteland version of earth. Earth has become a wasteland, mostly destroyed by an alien race with the majority of surviving humans living in a massive pyramid shaped version of the International Space Station called the TET. Jacks mission, job and life purpose is to oversee that the remains of earth are utilised by watching over and maintaining the vital energy and resource gathering mills on earth and repairing the armed robot drones that protect these mills. The ""Skavs"" creatures that seem akin to the Sand People of Star Wars are implied to be the remains of the aliens and are placed firmly in the role of antagonist as the film gets starting But as the plot thickens, Jack runs into a great deal of problems, from the mysteries behind humans found alive in hyper sleep chambers, to, gunfights with Skavs, and chases scenes and battles against rogue drones before discovering that maybe everything he has been told is not quite as it seems.The entire visual design and look of this film is where it shines the most. The drones, certainly do seem futuristic with the first person computer screen view cementing them as an Artificial Intelligence with high powered weapons to boot. The contrast between the earth turned wasteland setting and the futuristic highly maintained drones and the bright, whiteness of Jack and headquarters makes each setting stand out and become more interesting than they would be alone. These settings also help to give the feel that this really is a different time to where we are now. Lasers replace bullets for the most part adding to the sci- fi future elements, but with bullets occasionally returning for use with the less well-equipped waste landers that appear.Plot wise, it begins with the typical story of a man with a job to do, but curiosity and mystery interfering with the job and the character questioning the line of duty. Thankfully this plot thickens throughout the movie, with some great twists, each twist further taking the movie into deeper sci-fi territory but never becoming too complex. Cruise plays the hero character well, and although a somewhat generic American hero, a reasoning for this character is given in some revelations throughout the film. The other characters played their parts as they needed to be played but nothing really stood out. Sally (Melissa Leo), although only appearing on video has some gradual changes in personality as the movie continues with some great change coming near the end and ... does this perfectly. Not much more can be said about the plot without spoiling the surprise of the twists but the plot provides enough depth to be interesting but keeps enough action to keep everything exciting too. A word should also be given to the varied electronic and orchestral soundtrack, provided by French electronic artists M83. The score provides ambiance when needed and also some huge sounding orchestral parts when actions revelations or even just huge landscape shots appear.Overall, Oblivion is a great sci-fi film, with a well written story full of twists and revelations, some acting that is perfect for the role and an amazing overall look. The score is brought done slightly by some small plot holes, the acting of supporting characters and the fact that maybe everything is a little too coincidental.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Oblivion — A sad post-apocalyptic world, a wasteland for a technician","Oblivion is sci-fi hotness. It's not perfect, but it delivers great value.The photography and the special effects are phenomenal. A must see in IMAX. The action is great. The dialogs are good. The acting is just right. Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, and Melissa Leo all performed without flaw. The ideas behind the scenario are great, and the story is very interesting with nice rebounds. I would have like to explored this world to a greater depth. Very interesting.An annoying little thing is that the backstory is not clear, and when an explanation comes from Freeman, it's just a bit too much ""telling the audience"".Now, for the flaws. The end is pathetic. The ""after"" should have been cut out, and you'd have a great fade out. It's a scene that's just an unnecessary Hollywood gimmick. Also, the woman should be on the Tet not at the cabin.I removed a full star for the ""after"", but beside that, the movie is a rock star. An incredible ride into a strange future.I highly recommend it, especially to science-fiction fans. Do not miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wow...just wow..,"Wow...OK movie had some cliché scenes, yadayada. I am a big fan of SF. There are only small dozen of movies in past years which are truly SF but this one is pure i mean pure SF. Visually epic (Tom Cruise didn't overreacted when he said that in an interview). It is truly epic, but story is...wow..with few twists, it is pure SF.Music is amazing. I see people claiming that some tracks are Hans Zimmer like. Well kinda, but you know Hans didn't reinvent the wheel, these chords are used all over the years. In short music is amazing as well..If you love SF, if you liked District 9 (not the same but equally good in SF department) go and watch this.I won't simply i wont forget ending scene and when lights goes on i was literally stand up with my fist hard pressed yelling inside of me YESSS!!!I am going to give it a 10 just to raise scores. It doesn't deserve 10 , eight is more realistic but i am going to give it a 10 just to raise it so hopefully more people decide to watch it. I feel sorry for people who gives this film bad rating. I don't know it seems to me that SF spirit died in them and now they look for issues and errors which every movie have. These same people won't be ever satisfied and they as such are out of luck anyway.Just see that movie and you won't regret it !!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great CGI, good actors, terrible story.","This post-apocalyptic science fiction movie tackles the story of a man who has been posted in the uninhabited Earth to repair the machines that exploit Earth's resources, after the planet is destroyed in a galactic war between humans and aliens. The script seems interesting at first glance, but we soon lost interest in the film because the story does not have much else to explore. Tom Cruise plays the main character and does it in a very correct way, but his character is overwhelmingly boring and the story is very monotonous. Morgan Freeman is another actor who excels in this film, leading a good cast that has received a bad material to work because of the poor script, with good ideas but poorly developed. The big bet of this movie is CGI, with great plans of our planet destroyed, especially New York. Visually, the movie is great, with optimal cinematography and superior quality sound effects.

"Overally a good movie, but definitely not original","I have to say , overall i loved the film, it had a very tron/ star trek (2009) feel with some good music, but it was very predictable and heavily stole from other movies such as MOON, (the guy who is alone on the moon) and well, tron in terms of its visuals.But the biggest thing that got to me was the scientific errors, most specifically the helicopter thing that the main character flies in, they make a big thing of it showing the swiveling engines and zooming in on the tail rotor, but here is the thing, if its got two independent motors on either side, why does it have a tail rotor?It can be to turn or counteract torque because the main motors just swivel... so yeah FAIL!other things that i cannot say as they are spoilers but this movie was just made for the money, written for the money etc..

Great shot of the moon.This novel this movie is based on must have been written using an alternate time line. The movie's war supposedly started in 2017. We're nowhere near this space time line.

Will Someday Be Considered A Sci-Fi Classic,"I rarely buy Blu-Ray/DVDs anymore but I wanted to own this for my collection. I loved this film. I think it deserves to be considered among the classics of science fiction. This is a character and story driven film more than an action adventure, although it has enough action to make it fun to watch. It's visually stunning, owing to the fact that it was shot mostly ""in camera,"" meaning that the sets and location are almost entirely real with only as much CG as needed. The actors are acting in real spaces and not in front of green screens. The musical score is unique and original and integrates very nicely with the visuals.I love that the story reveals its surprises as it goes along and isn't predictable. I love that the scenery, sets, objects and such in the film are beautiful to look at. It reminds me in many ways of Forbidden Planet, another sci-fi classic that's still fun to watch over 50 years after it was made.

The return of the Clean,"Ever since Space Odyssey and Alien, the clean, white futuristic look has been abused by cinematographers and producers, stuffed in sequences where it simply represents nothing. Oblivion is a great exception: black and white, clean and dirty are brilliantly mashed together, driving the emotional impact of the movie by generating an incredible sense of minimalism.The plot itself does have well-placed twists and is one of the most thought-provoking stories in the history of cinema. The abstract and mysterious writing however may confuse or cause the viewer's attention to be distracted by small details. It appears to be the top of the iceberg of an intricate lore, however understanding what is going on is clearly not the creators' intent: they want you to feel and think, and if you let them succeed Oblivion will become a cinematic life lesson.Finally the art and VFX teams deserve a hats-off too.

Further ahead are two or three twists that will blow your mind out.The screenplay & direction is something to be lauded. CGI & VFX are very good. But, the score & SFX are better. Not boring with ridiculous melodramas, the plot revolves around post-apocalyptic-war. Lots of action sequences involved with gun battles, drone attacks & like.

Supporting cast is fine, but I am unhappy with Olga Kurylenko for her wooden expressions.Music is enchanting which gives that ""Inception"" feeling.

If anyone has ever seen the great (Though not well known) ""Moon,"" they will see ""Oblivion"" as a pure rip off. As I did.Cruise is obviously hoping no ones seen it. Trying to take credit for its amazing twist. Which was even done better then, than its been done in this way more expensive rehash. Even if you haven't seen ""Moon"" I think you'll be underwhelmed by the lack of originality in ""Oblivion."" The aliens (Which turn out to not even be aliens. Sigh!) Look like something out of ""Star Wars"" trying to look like something out of ""Predator,"" and the giant attacking robots in the film look like the love interest of ""Wall-E.""""Oblivions"" main problem is that it thinks its way better than it actually is.

"Pure sci-fi, from start to finish","Oblivion, starring Tom Cruise, Olga Kuriyenko and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, director of the efficient Tron in 2010.Recently a lover of sci-fi movies, I got to admit that this one has a lot to offer. Visually, the movie is amazing. I personally loved the pursuit with the drone and the ship that Jack is driving in the middle. The idea stays original and it brings us to think about something, to just take a look on what the earth is gonna look like in the future, which is good, (okay, maybe the year 2017 is too soon for the planet to get look like in the film).Personally, for someone who likes to appreciate good actor performances in the movie, I think that this film was not the worst that Tom Cruise played in in his career, in terms of acting. Still Tom Cruise played in pretty not bad sci-fi movies like Minority report (god I HAVE to see it again!), Morgan Freeman is, as always, an actor of good talent. Honestly since I just saw the whole Batman trilogy I just like to see movies with this actor. But Kuriyenko's acting is just bad I think. But damn she's hot. And maybe the love story was a bit too much?Anyway I also saw some good references to other sci-fi movies like 2001: a space odyssey, which is one of my number one movies of all time. Oblivion can be a bit boring at the start but the climax for me was almost breathtaking and quite very interesting.

The details could have been tightened up, but overall, if you are not seeking perfection, this is a very good film. The scenery is breathtaking and awe inspiring.I understand why some did not like the film as much as I did. It is a matter of personal taste. I love thought provoking science fiction. I also love action packed science fiction. This one is not action packed, but when the action does occur it's great.

Definitely worth watching!!!,"I came into this movie with an ""open mind"", and needless to say I was NOT disappointed!!

But I must say this movie is extremely entertaining, keeps you wondering what will happen next. Of course he has numerous ""running"" scenes (it's an on going joke with my husband and myself), but very much worth watching, It kinda makes you wonder if UFO's aren't like us, but they wear disguises to protect their own identifiable anatomy!

Great tech - very entertaining with a poetic ending,"A highly entertaining movie that I would recommend to any sci-fi fan.The technical design is top-notch, and the visuals are stunning. The story is solid and lean, with very little extraneous content. The acting, editing, and overall narrative are all exceptionally well-executed.It's hard to imagine this movie becoming much better by making different choices. The only potential improvement could be in the music, which at times feels a bit too synthetic and drum-machine-heavy.The ending is both solid and poetic, likely defying your expectations. It resonates deeply with me, prompting reflection on our world.

Enjoyed from start to finish,"Have to say i stumbled across this film be accident and wondered why I had never seen it as a person who loves this genre of film and Tom Cruise as an actor.Oblivion is one of those rare sci-fi films that checks all the boxes for me as a fan of the genre. From the moment it started, I was completely immersed in its stunning visuals and the thought-provoking story that unfolds in a beautifully desolate, post-apocalyptic Earth.First off, the special effects are simply top-notch. The film's world-building is incredible, with every scene looking like a carefully crafted piece of art. Whether it's the towering remnants of destroyed cities or the sleek, futuristic drones, the attention to detail is amazing. The visual effects not only set the tone but also enhance the film's exploration of identity and the human experience in a way that feels both epic and intimate.Tom Cruise is perfect as Jack Harper, a drone repairman with a mysterious past. His performance brings the right mix of action-hero toughness and emotional depth. I really enjoyed how he conveyed Jack's internal struggle, making the character relatable and his journey compelling. Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman are also fantastic, adding layers to the story with their strong performances.What I loved most about the film is how it blends a gripping narrative with visual spectacle. The story dives into themes like memory, identity, and what it means to be human, all while delivering breathtaking visuals that kept me glued to the screen. It's a film that not only entertains but also leaves you thinking long after the credits roll.If you're a fan of science fiction, it is definitely worth watching. It's a visually stunning, well-acted film that hits all the right notes for a sci-fi lover like me. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivious to sense,'Oblivion' stands as a stark example of fiction with big brains for a big idea but little sense for a development and delivery of that idea.As such the first half works as a memorably put together sci fi-mystery film with bare photography and impressively bold production design.After that it descends into oblivion: hero exploits twaddle lashed to an utterly irredeemable and unintelligible piffle of a narrative. Incredible and unworthy.Imo a complete shame because I found the first hour likable and engaging and I was willingly following the narratives progression.I rate 4/10 thanks to the interesting opening act however I can only really recommend to film fans who only watch the first half of a film and then make up their own endings. That's my honest assessment of 'Oblivion'.,4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Artistically splendid sci fi with enough soul,"""Oblivion"" is so visually crisp and clean that you could actually brush your teeth with it. Director Joseph Kosinski, who pieced together the aesthetically immaculate ""Tron: Legacy"" takes a similar approach in adapting his graphic novel for the big screen, and with some solid screen writing help, ""Oblivion"" feels especially worth of the ""science-fiction"" label.""Oblivion"" moves beyond post-apocalyptic fiction clichés by borrowing some from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the sci-fi indie ""Moon."" It fixes squarely on its main character, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), which is simultaneously a strength and a point of weakness, but most importantly prevents it from getting too emotionally hollow.The key is that ""Oblivion"" successfully deceives its audience and keeps things mysterious and exciting for two hours, even if its very nature demands a lot of skeptical questions.Harper is a drone repairman in 2077, 60 years after Earth was ravaged due to an alien attack on the moon. Drones keep an eye out for stranded aliens attempting to spoil humanity's last-ditch effort to harvest ocean water so life can continue on one of Saturn's moons. Jack lives with his partner in life and work, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), but he dreams of another woman (Olga Kurylenko) and the past in New York City, which he cannot understand because that was before he was born. When he discovers the woman in his dreams in a crash-landed pod on Earth's surface, it unleashes a whole set of questions.Buying into the film and this story turns out to be pretty easy thanks to Kosinski's pristine direction, and the poetic voice-over narration throughout ups this film to above-average sci-fi movie intelligence. A strong artistic vision and an intriguing story are pivotal in any movie that's part of a genre so steeped in suspension of disbelief; ""Oblivion"" has those hooks firmly in place.Any sci-fi film involving a comprehensive context/backstory will draw plot hole or logic skeptics like a wake of hungry buzzards, and ""Oblivion"" compounds those issues with its plot twists and an ending that seems far more simple than the rest of the film. The satisfaction of the result doesn't have to be connected to the excitement of watching it unfold and there's a definite difference in this instance.The actual issue is that all the time spent on exposition, explanation and Jack's character doesn't leave too much room for the rest of the cast. Morgan Freeman's role as a leader of a group of survivors doesn't have as much weight as the script would like to believe it does and his right hand, played by Nickolaj Coaster-Waldau amounts to nothing more than a moment of ""whoa, it's Jaime Lannister!"" The script doesn't satisfy our curiosity to understand them and learn more about them. We care way more about what happens to Jack.A few shallower areas, however, are no indicator of a hollow core. ""Oblivion"" is far more than just visual flair and a pulsing contemporary score. It has a discernible heartbeat and does some original and exciting things within the sci-fi genre, which is never easy.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just don't get any spoilers!!!! One of the best sci-fi films of the decade.,"The less you know going into this movie the better the experience will be for you. Some people here are calling it predictable and obvious, but I, maybe to my detriment, still had no idea where the plot was going until the end. Is it derivative of other science fiction movies? Maybe, but at least it's daring enough to be an original story instead of a remake or wanna-be franchise starter.Joseph Kosinski is a highly underrated director of science fiction and I hope he continues in this genre. After my ultimate guilty pleasure (TRON Legacy) he directed this gem about Tom Cruise's isolated life on a wreaked Earth. The photography and imagery is completely stunning, more so than many other 'acclaimed' science fiction and independent films, and it is filled with creative and unique designs that you just don't really see in a one-off movie like this. (Bubble-ship, the drones, his air-house, etc). The pacing is a little slow but that's because they need to show off all these designs and scenery that are basically pieces of art, and I wouldn't care if they took hours doing it. The color palette is fantastic. I found more positive aspects in it than in other modern sci fi films such as the okay Arrival. Maybe Tom Cruise just turns too many people off. Too bad for them.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Even after seeing the entire movie, I am not 100% what was going on. They could have really done a better job of explaining things as the movie progressed. My wife hated the movie and had a hard time staying awake as she was so bored, I kept watching hoping that things would improve, but they really did not.

People who love and know the magnificent Tron Legacy soundtrack will notice a certain resemblance here, but this is certainly not a bad thing, rather the opposite.

You have very little sense of anyone else as a person; I felt particularly bad for Andrea Riseborough, stuck in the role of the bland and obedient wife.Some moments ring false, notably in Cruise's first encounter with Freeman, in which everything is done in a very stupid way.

Morgan Freeman seemed to be on autopilot (I guess he sensed from the start this movie was hardly going to demand much of his considerable acting talents).Disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A rather brilliant Sci Fi Action movie with heart.,"Brilliant, brilliant and, well, brilliant.The entire film is brilliant.The entire landscape and soundscape is wonderful.The pacing, editing, direction and CGI are all flawless.Tom Cruise really can carry a movie and imbue it with a solidity and grounded manliness and this is a brilliant vehicle for him.Olga Kurylenko does a lovely turn in her role, showing a sensitivity that helps bring the human element of the film to life.Same too does Andrea Riseborough, who is equally lovely, but in a different, more sublime way.But, even with the great Morgan Freeman present, it is Tom Cruise who really brings this movie to life.I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good story told well. Especially if they like it mixed with action. And even more so if they love SciFi with a human element, as I do.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great production values, so-so storyline","I found it entertaining and fun to watch. Always enjoy Tom Cruise. And after 11/5/24, I needed a diversion from the gloom I feel as our own version of a TET prepares to take over and exploit humanity and Mother Earth.May the average souls, as those depicted in the story, gather together now to push back on the exploitation and destruction of decency and civil rights so that we can all thrive. May those who have the resources to live in the clouds and think us as mere objects, be tossed out so that we can be free of their endless greed for money and power.

Takes ages to get going. 3/10,"Review: What a load of rubbish. I was wondering why I didn't hear anything about this movie, and now I know why. The storyline was quite terrible and it I lost interest after a while. I did get a bit confused near the end, but I wasn't that bothered. Morgan Freeman's part could have been played by anybody because he's only in a couple of scenes. There isn't that much action so you just end up watching Tom Cruise for 2 hours, trying to work out what the hell is going on. I also found his wife pretty annoying but the CGI was pretty believable. I was expecting something amazing to happen throughout the movie, but as usual, nothing really did. The whole tempo of the movie and the fact that there isn't much of a cast, is what made the film extremely disappointing and it just seemed to drag. What a waste of $120million.Round-Up: Tom Cruise has really gone down in my estimation lately, with movies like the disappointing Jack Reacher, he needs to pick another avenue. As usual, his movies always make there money back so the studios will always be giving his projects a big budget, but the last good movie that I saw him in was Tropic Thunder were he was acting completely out of his comfort zone. Morgan Freeman looked a bit out of place in this film, for some unknown reason, but I did like the robots. I hope they don't come out with a sequel to this film because I personally don't care what happens to the characters. I did end up falling asleep a couple of times because it takes about an hour before anything really happens so be warned.Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $286millionI recommend this movie to people who like there futuristic end of the world type of films with Tom Cruise being the hero. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very entertaining and holds up to the very end,"I have not read reviews before watching the movie. This might not be the wisest move, but it worked for me. The story turned out to be so standard that it was not hard to guess each step and the end. However, that does not distract from the fun. You might even want to watch it again to see the subtle clues and not so subtle clues.I was surprised by the mix of actors. SeeingTom CruiseandMorgan Freemanplaying virtually the same characters that they played in many movies saved time in trying to figure them out in the story.For the technical, I only saw the Blu-ray version. Blu-ray is no longer unique, but they also did not have to create extra CGI to show it off.The story:It is after the war (Earth vs. Aliens) naturally we won, or you would not be seeing the movie. However, the Earth is a goner, and everyone moved to a movie of Titan. The effective team of Jack and Victoria are cleaning up the last of the oceans needed for their new home.Only Jack seems to see some inconsistencies in his life and mission. Slowly the truth is revealed. Jack may be pressured to take sides and act.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Looks good, but the story's not great","OBLIVION is a great-looking addition to the wave of serious science fiction movies that have been filling cinema screens of late. It has wonderful vistas of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and although the screen is often full of CGI effects, they're handled very well and the overall result is a beautiful-looking movie.A shame, then, that all of the money and the visuals are wasted a little on a storyline that turns out to be rather clichéd and predictable. OBLIVION takes a number of well known sci-fi tropes and mixes them all together in a somewhat unsatisfying mess; you know from the very outset the sort of thing that's going to happen here, and sure enough it does. It doesn't make for much in the way of entertainment, even if it is good spectacle.Tom Cruise stars in the usual everyman hero type role he's well known for, and he's not bad here; but none of the actors are required to do a great deal, which is a shame when there's genuine talent in the supporting cast. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets all of two lines, and Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko both look arresting but play rather one-dimensional characters. By the time you reach the second hour of this slow-moving production, all of what transpires will have been well telegraphed in advance, leaving this a somewhat hollow viewing experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underrated Sci-fi,"Before I watched this film, I didn't know what is it about or read any synopsis. I bought it just from the poster. The opening is very convincing. The CG, the set, outfits, vehicles really help building up the atmosphere of the future. The story line is refreshingly new. You don't know what will be going on next and it keeps you curious about it. The action scene happens occasionally along the movie in the right amount of time. The drama scene, however, is a little too much for this kind of Sci-fi. Tom Cruise nailed it as usual, the role suits him well. The whole plot is a typical American action style, nothing to expect here. Anyway, The best thing in this movie is the graphics, both computer or non- computer graphics are mesmerizingly stunning. Everything is beautifully designed. It's one of the best as far as I have seen in Scifi category.

I'll file this next to Interstellar: in the 'Unlikely to be watched again' category.,"2017: hostile aliens known as Scavengers wage war on the human race, blowing up the moon, causing catastrophic natural disasters on Earth. Sixty years later, and most of the surviving human population have left to start a new life on Titan (a moon of Saturn); only Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain, their job to track and repair the drones designed to protect the massive power plants that supply energy to the Earth crafts, the pair receiving their orders from Sally, who is located on an orbiting space-station called the Tet. But when Jack rescues a woman named Julia from the wreckage of a downed NASA spacecraft, he kickstarts a chain of events that will lead him to a shocking revelationThere's no denying that Oblivion is a visually impressive movie, with the post-cataclysmic scenery on Earth being particularly breath-taking, but the script and the direction leave a lot to be desired. The story is intentionally perplexing for most of the run-time, drip-feeding just enough information to keep the viewer intrigued to the finish, where loose ends finally pull together—but when all is said and done, there are simply too many contrivances, plot-holes, and unanswered questions to make it all work (Case in point: Why do the Scavs hide the fact that they are human? Why, to further the plot of course! Case in point, number two: isn't it convenient that that only survivor of the Odyssey happens to be Jack's wife?).If all of this nonsense had been flawlessly handled by director Joseph Kosinski then I might have been a little more forgiving about the iffy (and rather derivative) plot, but somehow he makes a big-budget film about Earth's fight for survival against a hostile extraterrestrial intelligence seem incredibly boring: for much of the time, it's just Cruise wandering the barren planet, fixing his machines or taking a break listening to records at his lakeside cabin, which soon gets tiresome—but even when the action scenes do kick in, the film is strangely devoid of excitement or tension. 124 minutes seemed a lot longer.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for the lovely Riseborough, who helped the time pass a little easier whenever she was on screen.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellent sci-fi movie, brilliant score","This film is a ripper, it is visually spectacular and the plot has a host of classic sci-fi elements. It holds its own against sci-fi classics and I will happily watch it again.The plot holds together really well, it's a really good story with nice twists and is a well made film with believable characters and plenty of heart.I've seen some criticism of this film, but it seems this focuses on people wanting the movie to be something other than it has intended to be. If you want non-stop action and explosions this might not be your film. The main action sequence is necessary for advancing the plot but is the only aspect of the film I thought was overdone. This is the best sci-fi film I have seen in years and the DVD will happily live on my shelf next to Blade Runner, Gattaca and Alien.Casting is excellent. While I'm not particularly a fan of Tom Cruise, credit where it is due, he is really good in this role.Well done to all involved.Edit: ive just rewatched this and wanted to add praise for the musical score.

Nothing made up for just how dull and unoriginal this movie is and I love Morgan Freeman's acting. I was not shocked or surprised by anything except how glossy and unrealistic it all looked. The concept might have worked well in its original form as a graphic novel or even a short film but there really wasn't enough there to make it worthy of 2 hours.

Good Sci Fi Flick,"This is a great sci fi flick. The plot unravels slowly, a marker of a good film. I think I figured a lot out after 30-40 min and probably a lot do, but I think people want that in a film, even if they say they don't. Excellent put together on this though. Good effects, compelling story, good soundtrack (M83), and overall ownership of the product by Kosinski.I wish I had seen this at theaters. My only criticism is that the plot is a bit thin as far as details go....or rather, not as believable but that is Sci Fi anyhow, right? Honestly, I think a lot of the ideas, colors, and theme mimic star wars movies a bit though it is not a star wars clone at all. If you look at the 'bad guys' the black and white color and flight abilities are like star wars. I guess it is hard for sci fi flicks to define themselves quite separately. I think it also borrows from movies like Memento.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I just don't want bad production value, and this film is excellent like many of Cruise's films. The supporting cast is also good. The like the basic story, and settings as well.

To me, at its core it's a love story with the Earth in peril from aliens as a backdrop.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Muddled and tired,"One has to wonder what appeal the Oblivion script offered to its big stars. The film isn't particularly smart, the special effects are pedestrian, and the characters are all one dimensional and bland. If there's a message, it's that Hollywood can and will use Tom Cruise as a bludgeon against the rigors of logic every time. He's never met a flawed-Messiah script he didn't like, be it the naive jerk in Risky Business redeeming a hooker, the naive jerk redeeming his autistic brother... (you get the point)...on up to the new era of rote action heroes standing against wave after wave of CGI foes all insisting, humbly, that he is The One. That he MATTERS in a world dominated by rote action fodder.Oblivion ticks all of the boxes for young-adult dystopia: dying planet, concealed destiny, advanced tech that doesn't seem to work very well, plucky resistance fighters, embarrassing predictability. The one thing it does have going for it is sterility. The machines and their motivation don't make a whole lot of sense, and that flaw essentially propels the movie away from one set of sci-fi cliches, lending the central mystery a little more weight than it deserves. But it's the clean, detached emotional clarity of the characters that we're supposed to imprint on, leaving the movie free to meander and sputtered toward a truly banal climax.But yeah, there's Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman, and Andrea Riseborough all pretending like any of this is worth their time. There isn't much here that deserves yours.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A very good sci fi story that's full of realistic plots...a possible future for earth and mankind.,"There's a lot of true science in this film, since its not some cheap flick. It's a Tom Cruise. And it's the only reason I had to go see it and it didn't disappoint. There are some factors which I really like. One being how the moon was destroyed by aliens which caused massive destruction on earth. What a powerful event that if any aliens our there would know to do, it's a smart thing they would do, ... Destroy the moon and earth will collapse momentarily. Great point. I've seen tons on UFO movies but none which aliens used their minds to create such true science conclusion. I love it. The idea stands out in the movie the most to me.Secondly, jack and Victoria DNA was used for cloning multiple techs to monitor earth is very well a possible idea aliens can do to use humans to work for them, which is what most scientists believed about the ancient gods, or Zachariah sitchin books depicts. How humans where created or made to work for them, as how we today build machines and robots. Wonderful idea in this conclusion.No movie is perfect. No director nor book writers got it all figured out. After all, its still only just a movie for us to enjoy, and not some real documentary of any known UFO factuals. But given the technology we have today and the geology studies and astronomy research, this movie makes good sense. I give it a 10 for its pure fun and interesting science conclusions and plots. I also like to give a 10 for Tom Cruise on his success in this film because when it comes to sci fi, only he and will smith has movies worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
typical Cruseathon,"Completely predictable, less than plain women, boring throughout. The only redemption is that it cost me nothing but time, IE moments of my life I will never get back. Certainly on a par with Disney's failed foray into the genre, The Black Hole though with less acting talent. Even Morgan Freeman seems to have phoned this one in, though at his age, I can't blame him for taking it easy with his remaining years. If it takes you more than 5 minutes to know the plot, you'll probably love this tripe. I am surprised this movie only lost 40 million dollars though I suspect that is mainly to do with it not being made for DVD to start with.

Stupendous movie!!,"Pros:Plot: Interesting (8/10) Acting: Great (10/10) Screenplay: Phenomenal (10/10) Cinematography: Beautiful (10/10) Sound-work: Polished to perfection (10/10) Overall, one heck of a movie! (9/10)Cons: There were only a few elements that slightly bothered me throughout the movie. For starters, the soundtrack was great, but could have been better. Don't get me wrong, I liked it a lot, but it sounded too much like Tron at various points during the movie. Another element was the reoccurring science fiction aspect that all humans are are reproductive bodies, and that all love is is a feeling. The soul was forgotten. This isn't a big deal though. It's just a personal opinion.Also, be aware that the movie does contain some foul language, such as words ranging from the 'd word' and 's word' to words like g** d*** and the 'f bomb'. Near the beginning there're two scenes possessing brief yet minor nudity (Nothin' but butt. It's PG-13, so that's all they can really show.) I also felt like there was an anti-god aspect near the end of the movie. I may be overreacting about that one. You'll just have to judge for your self. I don't want to give away any spoilers or else I'll be ""blacklisted"". I'm new here, and that wouldn't be fun.Conclusion: All in all, Oblivion is a visually masterful, and immensely entertaining movie!

Tom Cruise is back where he belongs...on top!!!,"Tom Cruise's latest film ""Oblivion"" shows him at his very best in this sci-fi thriller set in the not too distant future. Tom Cruise typically has done very well as the hero in sci-fi films, and this film is no exception.In fact, it may be a cut above Minority Report, Vanilla Sky and War of the Worlds. The storyline is strong with a few unique twists to it that keeps it fresh and interesting. The special effects are good and so is the supporting cast. Morgan Freeman plays Beecher, the leader of the ""Scavs"", and Andrea Risenborough along with Olga Kurylenko are the women in his life.

Worthy of a Sigh,"Jack, Tom Cruise, is a survivor of some future war which left earth mostly uninhabitable, due to radiation, leaving what was left of the human race to go live on one of Saturn's moon's.

As Jack's retirement approaches, where he will be relieved of his duties and get to join the rest of humanity on Titan, he can't help but begin to question his dreams.From there on, Oblivion tries to pull of a series of twists, none of which we haven't seen before. Instead of being the original, new sci-fi epic Oblivion promises to be, it just steals ideas from Total Recall, Moon and The Matrix without being anywhere close to as good as those films were.Oblivion starts off with promise in the pacing and visuals but when Morgan Freeman shows up as a Morpheus character, it just goes from one clique to the next with a finale worthy of a sigh.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sci Fi conundrum,Oblivion is set in the not too distant future and the story unfolds with small flash backs and present time story telling. After a war with an alien race the earth is left in ruins. The start of the film concentrates on 2 central characters but as the story goes along more are added. It had a certain 'Book of Eli' feeling but quickly gathers pace with its plot. I enjoyed the visuals and the story wasn't too weak although it did lack spark mid way through in my opinion the love/emotional storyline does distract from the premiss. Saying this it still flowed along nicely and as it begins to get complex you don't lose yourself in the middle trying to figure out who is what and when!! The end could have been better but so could the end of a lot of good films. You won't be left disappointed as a sci fi fan it touched on all of the things I like best. I would've loved a more detailed history of the alien race but then I guess time can be your worst enemy when trying to cram it all into 2hrs and 10mins. I would suggest IMAX or a larger screen for an optimal viewing experience. Tom Cruise does what he does best and mixes up the action with a touch of romance of plenty of heart. Oscars I doubt it but a worthy performance never the less. Lets hope this is the start of a run of some enjoyable sci fi films set to hit the big screen this summer.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent and brilliant,"Last night I had the fortune of being in the world premiere of Oblivion in Argentina and see it with Tom Cruise in person in the Theatre,The film is entertaining and the many drafts of the script is very well led by Joseph Kosinski, Cruise is the perfect job, as well as that of Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman.The visual effects are outstanding, using a method of illumination and image overlay replacing the green screen.The plot, besides presenting a few small holes, which are imperceptible catch the beginning of the film until the final climax. Perhaps the presence of the same Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko in the room has boosted the expectations a bit to see this film, or how to analyze it, but the general public went very satisfied of the last jobs I've seen Cruise, this is certainly one of the best without a doubt, the story takes science fiction to another level, what would you do if the fate of your race depended on your memories? Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is one of the last mechanical drone for Earth. It is part of a massive operation aimed at extracting vital resources after decades at war with the terrifying threat of Scavs. But Jack's mission comes to an end. Walk and patrol the sky thousands of feet until your ""high"" existence collapses when a beautiful stranger rescues a ship demolished. His arrival sets off a chain of events that will force Jack to question everything he knows and you end up putting the fate of the human race in their hands. My final opinion is that it is a successful work of Kosinski, based on his own book, and good entertainment, it's the end of the day what a viewer will find the movies",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tom Cruise delivers...and how,"Have already seen this twice in theater. The major strong point of Oblivion is its cinematography and set designing. Beautiful and as capturing as they get, the visuals keep the audience in awe. Also, this is Tom Cruise's best performance in recent years. The story may not be as rich as they made in olden days, it still manages to keep you engaged in its proceedings and offers enough twists (some actually very good ones) to hold you to it. I particularly found the background score the next best thing after its cinematography. Charged with tense tunes and thrilling energy, it perfectly complements the proceedings. At a runtime of 124 minutes, the length allows the movie to setup its characters and plot at an easy pace and saves Oblivion from a being a rushed up attempt.It's a good watch and a must for all Tom Cruise fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Dull, meandering sci-fi dud","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNearly a hundred years in to the future, Earth has been shattered by an invading army from the skies, and has become a desolate wasteland. In this barren landscape, Jack (Tom Cruise) is one of the few remaining 'drone' operators, who is dispatched from his remote station by his co- worker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) to complete missions. But he is having recurring dreams about Earth and the life he once lived there, which he shares with a mysterious woman named Julia (Olga Kurylenko.) When he comes in to contact with this woman in real life, he is thrown in to a desperate identity crisis where he meets the leader of the invaders, Beech (Morgan Freeman) and the shocking truth of the matter.Opening to decidedly average reviews, Oblivion was another one I forewent at the cinema, in spite of it probably being a film that would have been better suited there. Indeed, sweeping, majestic visuals and cinematography are probably it's main recommendations, for what is other-wise a slow, uninvolving and meandering trip in to nowhere, that fails to draw you in or go anywhere that your average post-apocalyptic action thriller already hasn't. With a plot that features only a few main characters, it really needed a story with some meat and bones on it to keep you interested, and sadly it just doesn't, boring and aimless as it is. It's such a shame so much effort went in to lavish production design and rollicking action sequences, and not as much as in to anything to subsidize it.Cruise, it would seem, remains the go to guy for this kind of big budget, spectacular folly, and as long as it's got a star with his kind of name power on it, it's guaranteed to draw in at least some revenue at the box office. I don't know if it was a hit or a flop, but the reviews would seem to take the wind out of it's sails enough to hint at something probably roughly in between. It's the box office where you have to hit the makers of this kind of movie, because artistically it can take all the flak you can throw at it, but if enough fickle, superficial movie goers go and see it, an even lamer sequel will undoubtedly follow, and go some way to showing them they can get away with it.In title and in deed, Oblivion is better suited as a theme park ride than a film. Maybe it would have been better if it was based on it. **",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
thoughtful and enjoyable sci-fi,"Tom Cruise has starred in yet another excellent sci-fi movie (cf. ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Minority Report"") that is dramatically entertaining and very thoughtful and relevant to our world today, as the best sci-fi is. Its examination of the ramifications of using drones clearly reflects on the Obama administration's use of the same, including the difficulty of defining the enemy, etc. On a larger level, the film examines the necessity of cultural and personal memory (see the title) for individual and social identity, stressing the importance of tradition and books, as opposed to the electronic distractions of the moment. Finally, all of this is related to the environmental disaster of our own world that is allowing its irreplaceable resources to be exploited. Add a complex love story, and the result is a very good movie, indeed!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mind-blowing Sci-fi Adventure after very long time!,It is absolute thrill to watch such brainstorming movie after such a long time. Walking through the movie really bring some chills in that darkest scene. Regardless of its initial slow pace it actually puts you in oblivion and imitates you to discover the plot but it grows a new direction every time and reveals at the end! Tom cruise performing brilliantly with Sir Morgan freeman and of course the actresses. Some very impressive special effects of after-earth and the shattered moon. An awesome story line followed by some coolest future-tech and makes you put the pieces together till the very end. A masterpiece of Sci-fi and Adventure !,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome movie,"This movie is an all around cult classic.It takes some of its best ideas from previous sci-fi iterations such as moon, 2001 a space Odyssey , total recall , Prometheus, heck I think it's got some mass effect(video game) going on as well.Although the story elements are composed of old ideas, the way they are put together around the main character make for an excellent departure from the typical sci-fi scene.**Beware of the mid-movie plot twist!!**The visuals & audio are fantastic, and the music is very adequate. The lead actor is superb as always. The overall cast, although very limited (almost no humans)get the job done.Sadly, due to the fact that some ideas are recycled ,or previously seen, the movie will leave an overall feeling that it is lacking originality.

Excellent Sci-fi film!,"Well, this film which I scored yesterday blew out my mind! Excellent film starring Tom cruise (plays spectacular, as always) with few of the most beautiful movies views I've ever seen. This is a very intelligent movie and has one of the greatest sound track I have experienced for a while... (music by M83 which is my favorite band). I hope that the other Sci-fi movies at the upcoming summer will keep up the good job raised at Oblivion. Seems that Tom Cruise keeps his roles carefully and I'm sure his next Sci-Fi's ""All u need is kill"" film will keep him as the leader of the Sci-fi movies (Will smith is my 2nd sci-fi movies actor).

My favourite intelligent life,"One of my favourites. The earth is dust. Machines take care of the last remaining survivors. Which doesn't mean that they DO care. It turns out they don't. Tom Cruise is just the perfect actor for the job. Admittedly, my interest here goes a lot deeper. Company CEOs. People think that companies care about their CEOs. Because those companies take care of them. The CEOs, the only intelligent life in most companies. Like in this movie, boards don't actually care. As it usually turns out. The first thing CEOs sign before they move one finger is severance agreements. You never know. Actually delete that. You do know: They won't care.

We make an effective team!  Tom Cruise Scores on This One!,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE THEATRICAL VERSION.""Jack Harper: 60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated. Nothing human remains. We're here for drone repair. We're the ""mop-up crew"".If you want to see a fun film with romance, excitement, plausible futuristic inventions, weaponry and computer-control, complete with Big Sister and the apparent salvation of the human race, watch this film.The film's beginnings concern an apocalypse of sorts, where in 2017 Man won, at a terrible cost, a war with an alien invasion. The remnants of that war, fought by the alien Scavs, want Jack (Tom Cruise) but not to kill him but to capture him.The cloud condo (I like to call it) has everything, complete with swimming facilities, showers, food and a hot red-headed, Brit-accented woman (Victoria) who also happens to be Jack's lover and communications officer.Every morning Jack goes out on patrol, fixes downed drones, and they complain to ""management"" up in ""Tat"", a large module miles wide, that is shuttling the last of humanity to its new colony on Saturn's moon, Titan.And every morning the communication from Tat asks , ""Are you an effective team?"" and all hell will break loose if it's other than ""Yes!""Who could ask for more?There's more to the story than that. We are introduced to an apparency. And like Matrix, there is more than meets the eye and all is revealed, in bits and pieces, as the alien resistance, led by Morgan Freeman's character, Beech, is also not all it seems.Plots and Points:I won't reveal much, just to say the story will be familiar to many sci-fi fans. The action is non-stop (but it's not a military film), and the story slowly unfolds (but it's not Matrix). The plausible machinery (the dragonfly-like helicopter-ship with space travel capability) and Jack's cool, futuristic motorcycle are fun to watch and experience.The film's expostulation of what our world will be like is shocking – New York is completely wiped out. We have the library, subway system and the Brooklyn Bridge at hand. What sci-fi movie does NOT have the Statute of Liberty's arm up in the air, a common feature in these types of films since the Planet of the Apes!Best scenes: Getting your cycle stolen from aliens. I mean, that's really a shame! The humor as Jack catches that ball at the stadium, site of the 2017 World Series. And the hideaway that Jack keeps, a mountain lake and cabin, with remnants of humanity's technology (great Jazz vinyl) unknown to his partner Victoria.When a signal brings down Odyssey, a ship that's been in orbit ""pre-War"", and one survivor, a woman who had been in his flashback dreams, completely destroys all the harmony and substance of Jack's world and sends him on a frantic hunt to find the truth or meet elimination at the guns of drones!Bottom Line: If you like your sci-fi with great scenes, seamless CGI and a constant plot with no pausing, then see this film. The film does take some concentration and if you're observant, you can follow along just fine. In fact I may get the DVD to fill in any points I missed.IMAX, was worth it!Cast & Crew:Directed by Joseph KosinskiWriting credits Joseph Kosinski (screenplay) and Karl Gajdusek (screenplay) and Michael Arndt (screenplay)CastTom Cruise ...

No Countries; no population growth means life without God,"A suitable explanation to the sci effects of driving through a world that is drugged. The population on earth is billions; without medical attention are poor countries who often are bellow the poverty line because of 'no good reason' colonization.
A different approach to the climatic struggle that the western hemisphere is to undergo is the struggle for humanity because of global warming: it was us who created energy or fire but it won't be us to reclaim it. Then the struggle here is not human because it goes passed us in seeds by human love or sexually which in the end of humanity would be counter apocalyptic. 
A Sci fi movie or a movie in the future holds humans in sexual situations that are absurd with counter productive results: the humans after we are dead might look at our sexual innuendos as to the last of us. The humanity in the movie is strong like a episode in life that can be found if consumers outlive the consumed vegetables and fruits. 
Eating fruits brings life but vegetables leads to growth: scientific truth that both 'Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise' accept before the war against us is over. Then people viewers who see life against their medical situations might be blocked or considered 'not allowed'. 
Poor people or from the third world nations: belong to the English language under the democratic rules of their country but grammatically this viewing like a game of chess would be called absurd because the present leads to the future and so apocalypse is the moment that life does not return to us.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Every aspect of this movie was brilliant!,"I've been a fan of Tom for some time now! I'm aghast that he hasn't received more recognition from the movie 'industry' and his colleagues! Tom certainly has gained my appreciation, his powerful performance in Magnolia deserved an Oscar for best supporting actor and his role in Eyes Wide Shut deserved an Oscar for Best Actor (I can name others as well). His portfolio stands out and I can name most of his undertakings by heart! His performance in Oblivion was superb and despite some minor weaknesses in the story line it was a thoroughly entertaining and suspenseful dramatic handful that I've returned to on several occasions. Kudos Tom, I look forward to anything you appear in! In my humble opinion you are at the peak of your profession! The Oblivion Iceland scenery is incredible (despite there being CGI sprinkled in) so come for the scenery but stay for the movie!

Instead, what we got was a situation where the producers were given WAY too much money and proceeded to fill the screen with every last SFX that money can buy.I agree with the commentator who recommended you watch Moon instead. That movie had a real plot. Oblivion lacked a driving unifying narrative. It was more like a series of problems occurred and the hero of the story addresses them one at a time. But what was the point?We see Cruise's character desires to live in some sort of bucolic hideaway from the rest of the world.

An immersive and frightening possibly prophetic look at our future,"Cruise has to be one of the ultimate actors of our time and from one pilot to another.....an all round good guy! Morgan Freeman provides another powerful performance in his inimitable fashion as a rebel fighting for survival and for the planet itself. The ubiquitous Andrea Riseborough plays Toms partner with a twist........Olga Kurylenko also featuring in a marvellous and unexpected way! The flight sequences are breathtaking and accurate, nothing equals being up high above the clouds dancing on laughter silvered wings! Tom is a SUPERB real life aviator and he puts this into the flying segments as no other could! As a lousy amateur 'composer' and general keyboards, guitars and music NUT my compliments to M83 for THE most haunting score since the original Bladerunner, by Vangelis!

Enjoyable Sci-Fi movie with great atmosphere,"People who say there are countless plotholes, are completely right. But I was more bothered by the woman's role in this movie. She was just there to love the hero and that love helped him to remember. It's like in this old action movies where the super buffed up very manly heroes have a (of course very beautiful, soft and loving) woman on their side so we can see their weak side and we know for what they are fighting. Until the very end I didn't understand what that woman was good for. She was a pilot, she was no damsel in distress, so why make her appear so weak? I'm really surprised that nobody seems to be bothered by this. We have so many movies out there where woman are potrayed much stronger and braver than man (which is ridiculous and unrealistic) and then we have such movies where they reduce a woman to her role as a caring and loving wife - who somehow got pregnant at the end of the movie and I don't know when that happened! I would prefer something in the middle: an interesting, strong woman who is no superwoman at the same time. Well, that said, the sci fi part was spectacular, I loved the scenery, the cinematography, the pace, the mood, the mystery. I was not bored for one second and that means something when a movie has a run time of two hours.

I have to say to the people who take this movie apart piece by piece to watch the movie again and appreciate it for what it is. The plot is great and I never even saw the plot twist coming.

Going average into the Oblivion,"I watched the Film half a decade after its release, mostly for the reason of it's Score Composers and of it's Sci-Fi origins (rare breed these days).
My expectations where non existant for the simple reason for me not caring about this flick when it originally released to theaters.First up the positive: you are mostly in for a visual treat, you have beautiful landscapes, sets and designs, this is especially fascinating because of its nature. Most SciFi films about a planet where War nearly eradicated most of its inhabitants tend to look destroyed and rather ugly (not in a cinematographic sense). The Orchestral Score is outstanding, especially it's Leitmotiv, french Electronic band (here Kosinski the director goes again, choosing a french elctro band as he did with Daft Punk on Tron) M83. 
Also some cool ideas, i won't spoil, youll get near the end of the story concerning the whole premise (which also is its weakest link at the same time).Next up the Negative: You have not enough information about what is going on which results in you as a viewer just blindly follow the protagonists, which perse is not a bad thing if done right (Great examples 2001, Moon,.....). The saying ""less is more"" seem'ed to be the Mantra of Kosinski, because you get barely any information in the begining of what was going on before the Earth went exterminated and right after that you follow Cruise and his companion along the ride where you'll get tidbits of some random scenes which get explained in the end but in reality dont make any sense, because the character of Cruise doesnt remember them, so it just is for us the viewer which doesnt make sense because why show us something the main protagonist doesnt remember if we as a viewer dont know anything about what is shown to us if it only gets revealed in the end ?. If you set up scenes in the editing you have to take care that in the context they make some kind of sense for the character or the viewer, even both if the story demands for it, you cant just pull in some random scenes and in the end say ""well that was the whole reason"". As i said in the positive aspects of this film, the sparse story elements, which go down a pretty fascinating idea in the end, it also is its weakest link. The most interesting idea of this SciFi story gets revealed in the End and than it stops, Cruise saved the day and ""kumbaya me Lord"". If youd describe the film in short sentences it'll be ""Cruise is rediscovering stuff on earth and gets objectives to hunt for some stuff, there is some stuff he isnt to touch or bring back and then he finds out the truth ...the end"". 
Another big problem is the Action, while it has some cool action setups they also are pretty boring mostly, infact the whole film felt like a Video Game, but the bad kind of Game in which the variety of enemys is reduced to 1, it goes even further the Film reminded me a lot of a Game called ""Destiny"" (not my taste btw), the story has some similar elements and even pretty simmilar visual styles. 
The whole experiene felt flat with some ups but mostly downs, it felt like a franchise starter but the worst kind. What happened to the good old days where even if a film gets a sequel you still focus on making a great film and not holding of stuff for the Sequels (We'll guess we are in the Age of TV where even Movies are becoming big budgeted TV Mini Shows).",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But a space ship crashes... a very old NASA space ship! Jack manages to rescue a woman. A woman (Julia) he seems to know from long ago. But his memory has been wiped clean. So maybe he knows her from his dreams.""I know you, but we've never met. I'm with you and I don't know your name. I know I'm dreaming, but it feels like more than that. It feels like a memory.

The scenery was absolutely beautiful (they shot at the top of Hawaii's tallest volcano for a 360 view). The effects were great.Whoever came up with the concept had a great imagination.

A very underrated film.,"If my wife and I hadn't gone away for the weekend I probably would have never watched this film which would have been a shame. We decided to order a movie in our hotel room one night and we picked this since everything else looked unappealing. We were both blown away by how good it was. Tom Cruise was fantastic. It was nice to see him do something other than another Mission Impossible. The whole movie we were trying to figure out what happened and the reveal was unexpected and very sad. Very few movie tug at my heart strings but this one did. The visuals and great soundtrack really round out the good story and make this an amazing movie. I really wish I had seen it in theaters. Immediately after my wife wanted to know when we could get it on blu-ray. A first for her since she is not an avid movie watcher. I just found out today that the director of Tron Legacy directed this film, which explains why I got a Tron vibe while watching this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great film in the ""end of the world"" genre !","I was pleasantly surprised by this film, which fits admirably into the 'end of the world' genre. Technical effects are top notch, and the props are reminiscent of the Star Trek series in their quality and cool factor. But what blew me away mostly was the landscape photography which is really what gives this movie it's character. Watching the credits at the end one finds out it was mostly filmed in Iceland, hence the astoundingly stark moonscape type backdrops. Now I want to travel to that country ! Good acting and superb directing from Kosynski, though the script is a bit hard to follow at times. I won't go into that not to give anything away, suffice it to say you have to pay attention... Enjoy !",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nice movie, sensible sci-fi","""The Earth is a memory worth to fighting for"", is the premise that leads the science fiction movie ""Oblivion"". Oblivion, which gives its name to the film, refers to the process of planet earth loss as a result of a war against alien agents. Yet despite the utter desolation, the memory lives on, even in the genes of the agents land protagonists of the story. The memory, put in images, in love content, a return to the homeland, to books, to hard rock of the 70s, to evoke revives the essence of life that we keep in the background somewhere: brain , soul or heart or whatever you want to call it, the story moves in those sensitive areas where refuge for harassment usually the outside, either in the depth, or in the reading of the book of poems, is hearing this aria that we transports and leads us to that place we only know and no one else can enter. That place unique sensibility activated and only occurs in the perfect place. , at any stage of things, the future or the past, history exemplified in these lines, is about memory intrinsic notion of the earth as paradise lost even longer longs the death of civilization. Humans no longer inhabit the planet. The earth is reduced to a minimum. The moon was destroyed and dominates the landscape like a trail of fragments Selenites. There heritage, architecture and monuments are remnants almost evaporated. The only solid that remains is the memory of the terrestrial installed in genes cloned to satiety, but reluctantly, never lost its essence, expressed in the most basic feelings: love, nostalgia, memory, emotion . The last emotion perceived memorable and printed to the core of memory. For this I recommend this film proposal of an impeccable, endowed with a concept of pure entertainment, no major ambitions, which pays tribute to a classic of science fiction: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick. The last ship to the latest human to orbit the earth and returns after 60 years is called ""Odyssey"" and at the end, not to spoil the function to those who have not seen, omnipresence reminds alien Hal 9000, the computer that is rebels against the rational domain of human DNA. The story is based on a comic or ""graphic novel"", not yet published, which once again confirms the power of the graphic arts that enrich the scripts and storyboards twenty-first century cinema. And proves once again that the formula: hero, heroine, eternal love and fight to the death for an ideal, are and will remain a motivation to continue going to the movies and dream of epic fiction, get us out of the harsh reality.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
brilliant !!!!!,"this is my first ever review. I went to see this movie without expecting that much because of having read a few reviews earlier about it.. But from start to finish we were on the edge of our seats we never even blinked once..Excellent plot with lots of twists and ups and downs,brilliant cinematography,believe me i totally enjoyed it even though i am not that much of a Sci-fi fan..a sci-fi love story.. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are terrific as always..the rest of cast did their best too especially Andrea Riseborough.. 8/10..pure entertainment..a treat to watch :)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extraordinary film! Awesome plot twists!,"This is definitely a movie I'll be adding to my collection as soon as it comes out on DVD!First of all, the action was AWESOME! Plenty of explosions and high speed chases. The spaceships, drones, and other flying vehicles were nothing short of spectacular. The suspense was great, not too much, not too little.The plot twists... well usually a movie only has one or two plot twists. This one had at least four. And they were all very, VERY well done and totally unexpected. I'm a sucker for a good plot twist so when I get that many, I'm thrilled.The acting was good, the plot was good, everything was just awesome! There was even a little comedy.This was an amazing, incredibly entertaining film and I definitely suggest seeing this one in the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The electro magnetic heart,"Tom Cruise could just as well have played a character named Tom Cruise instead of a guy named Jack Harper. I swear this Hollywood monolith must have an electro magnet instead of a heart at his core. It's silly all too sterile fun. The characters are as artificial as the surroundings in which they move around. Morgan Freeman appears as the only truly free man in this production, but then appearances can be very deceiving. At least he projects some of that human quality of his earlier roles in this present screen reincarnation/avatar/cipher (take your pick). On the positive side, it makes for a great demo disc for all your new and fancy 4K home video equipment. A generous 5/10 because I dig polished surfaces.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Comparisons to real life and morality,"Oblivion was a movie that stunned the audience as well as me for its multiple plot twists and intriguing mystery.The beginning of the movie started with questions about who the main character was, and what happened to Earth. Slowly throughout the movie, we get subtle hints through variable glimpses, flashbacks, and memorable items as the main character walks through his main mission. His main mission is all that was given after he and his partner/wife undergone a memory wipe operation that left them clueless about the past.As the mystery unraveled and questions started to become clearer, more deeper questions arose, such as what the secret agenda is behind the mission and the morality behind his actions?I identified myself with the movie because I question morality behind actions with regards to the United State's foreign policy. Like the main character questioned his mission, I question the mission of the United States. Is our involvement in other countries moral and in what interests? Likewise, the use of drones in the movie gave a glimpse of destructive nature of drones in other countries such as Pakistan or Afghanistan. It is almost as if the director of the movie timed the release at such a critical time when Congress is currently deciding what our policy with drones are and whether to intervene into Syria or not. And for that, I found the most intrigue.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A timeless favourite worth repeat viewings.,"Great hard scfi adapted from Kosinki's graphic comic novellette

Very good story...,"1st watched 5/4/2013 – (Dir-Joseph Kosinski): Very good story about a drone repairman from the future named Jack Harper, played by Tom Cruise, who believes he is protecting the current Earth from a group called the Scavs – whom they won a war against --- and are gathering resources so that the remaining humans can transport to Titan due to the current Earth being destroyed by nukes. His memory has been erased supposedly, I guess, so the horrors of the war and how the Earth used to be won't cause too much depression, but he has dreams that later reveal some in-accuracies in what he believes to be true. The movie is visually very appealing, and has very few flaws that you really have to work to find, but it's definitely not the type of story to get the Academy's attention(except at a technical level). Despite that – this is the best movie I've seen released in 2013. Jack's dreams eventually connect to an incident where a spacecraft crash lands on the devastated Earth and he saves one girl(who just happened to be in his dreams as well). To say much more would reveal spoilers, and I would rather you watch this movie and see the complicated twists that happen to turn Jack upside-down and make his purpose of existence much different than what he originally thought. Do not miss this one – you will not be disappointed in this graphic novel based future fantasy & sci-fi film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually Perfect!,"Go See It! Visually stunning! Tight Script for Cruse and also for Morgan Freeman.Nothing Bad about this flick ... nicely done.

Characters were richly developed and not overdone.I give it ten stars, easy!!Tom Cruse character - Jack presents the perfect company man. Twisty little plot reveals something ... gotta go see it to believe it.Like the female lead and female co-lead, hell I even liked the computer lead ... this is just a well written story line!The bad parts of this movie were edited out ... you can follow the story and just imagine the location difficulty.

Exciting Science Fiction,"I do love a good Science Fiction movie...especially one that has a baseline of truth that could actually be applied to humans and earth. This one has just that...and Tom Cruise. He is superior in an action film. Not only can the guy act, but he really gets into the action part of it with a vengeance. Not all that many movie actors are so believable and enjoyable to watch as Cruise. And he does shine in this one. Morgan Freeman's always wonderful. His part wasn't all that long in this one, but what there was could only be termed choice. I wouldn't miss a Morgan Freeman film any more than I would a Tom Cruise movie. Together they're terrific.

"In the cold light of Netflix, Oblivion has enough, admittedly cliche, material to fill a few seasons of TV.","It's got a smorgasbord of good ideas and some genuinely superb design work and photography but that, plus a pulse pounding score from M83, is not enough to save what is a dire and clunky script full of plot holes, inconsistencies, leaps of faith, bizzare pacing and cheesy awkward moments. It's far, far too long and it's mystery's payoff is not worth it. The first half is superior to the last half and a lot of the way it's handled undoes the good of the first half. A noble and well made waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-fi Top Gun for Cruise in 'Oblivion',"Over the course of the last few years, the science fiction genre of film has either provided major hits or complete misses. Depending on who's acting and who's directing, movie-goes appear to be fairly picky about which sci-fi films they're willing to spend their money on. In 2012, Prometheus took us back to the Aliens universe with critical and commercial success, while at the same time, Battleship and John Carter sank – ultimately drowning in a sea of misery. Speaking of sci-fi success, Tom Cruise has been a part of a handful of lucrative sci-fi endeavors, including Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and War of the Worlds. Now, Tom Cruise is back once again with another pre-summer box office smash, Oblivion.Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Lecacy), Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the few remaining survivors of the planet earth – half of which has been destroyed and deemed uninhabitable after a nuclear war with an alien species, known as Scavs (Scavengers). Harper, along with his partner and love interest, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are in charge of an operation to salvage and extract the last of earth's natural resources, prior to leaving earth and rejoining their fellow humans on a massive space station, called Titan. However, everything is not as it seems when Jack saves a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage of a crash-landing – the same woman whom he has been having recurring memories and dreams. And, after making contact with the Scavs, Jack must uncover the secrets behind the organization for which he has been working and the reasoning behind his absent memory (which was mandatorily removed) . Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo also star in supporting roles.First and foremost, do not leave the theater when you see this film – and you absolutely should see this film. Oblivion is one of the films that will require your attention at all times, because it's extremely easy to miss a giant piece of the puzzle during a bathroom break or popcorn run. The film's plot is relatively easy to decipher by the conclusion of the film, however, there's more going on in this film that you can possibly interpret in one sitting. The introduction of the film crams a whole lot of information into your head to set up the present conundrum being tackled by Cruise's character, Jack Harper. Clearly, he's involved in a snatch-n-grab job, hastily attempting to remove earth's resources, while attempting to avoid any difficulties or interaction with the supposed villains, the Scavs. However, it's impossible to get specific about the majority of the film's plot points without spoiling the film.Oblivion's cast is one of the most impressive features in this film and remains tremendously authentic from beginning to end in this enigmatic drama. Tom Cruise hasn't been this enjoyable in quite a long time and really finds his groove with his character. Reminiscent of the character from War of the Worlds, Jack Harper is mostly in the dark about the majority of the occurrences in this film and is often in over his head – yet somehow always manages to come out of each dire situation unscathed. On the other hand, his partner (Victoria) constantly finds new ways to be jealous in a world where she has absolutely no competition. At times, she can become an annoyance, but that's mostly due in large part to lack of her unwillingness to think outside the box (which is reserved solely for Tom Cruise's character). Finally, let's face the fact here – everything is better with Morgan Freeman.By far and away, the most enjoyable moments of the film revolve around the CGI action sequences – which include some very intriguing and well-designed drones. These drones are the main agitators in a rather Empire Strikes Back-like flight batter which is also a nice flashback to Tom Cruise sitting in a cockpit in Top Gun. It's unclear whether or not the filmmakers meant to create a throwback sci-fi Top Gun-style chase scene, but regardless, this specific flight chase will have you wishing for a Top Gun sequel (which was sadly canceled after the death of its original director, Tony Scott).Overall, there's absolutely nothing in Oblivion that hasn't been done in some other sci-fi before it. Sure, it would be easy to say this is just another post-apocalyptic film with alien invaders, ultimately forcing humanity to unite for a greater good to defeat them. Yet, this film is much more complex than your average space-invaders film. It provides a busier (occasionally confusing) than usual plot (in Prometheus fashion), so if you look away, you'll most likely miss something important. But, if you play close enough attention to the plot points, you'll be able to tie everything together in a nice, pretty bow when the credits role – hopefully coming to the conclusion that Oblivion is a perfectly fun and enjoyable sci-fi film.Overall Film Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lots of Familiar Twists,"Where is a blue light when you need one? If you take elements of I, Robot, The Matrix, Independence Day, Total Recall and of course Top Gun and put them all in a bowl and mixed them up, you would come up with Oblivion. This film was totally crazy and literally out of this world. And to top it all off, with all the previews and the length of this film be prepared to get butt blisters for two and a half hours. I do have to say that I thought the special effects were brilliantly done, especially with the ship that Jack is flying. I also liked the fact that explanations of what was going on were trickled in throughout the film, right up to the very end. Basically the film centered on a band of rebels that are left on earth after a planetary war who are fighting against the establishment. Jack (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairman with less than two weeks to go on his so called tour of duty. Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) is his eyes in the sky and takes direction from the control center that is wedged in space. As depicted in the trailer, Jack is captured by the rebel tribe and this is where the journey of discovery begins. Beech (Morgan Freeman) is the rebel leader and is determined to get Jack to see the truth. This is also the point in the film where there starts to be a lot of twists and turns. I did hear myself saying (a couple of times), ""what the heck is going on here"". This is when the fun started for me, because I started thinking about all the other films that this one stole from. I think that director Joseph Kosinski did a pretty good job considering the only other film that he has produced was Tron: Legacy. He is definitely headed in the right direction if this is the genre that he wants to stick with. Although the film was a little long for my taste, it was definitely not boring. The film moved at a steady pace and the little enlightenments along the way kept my interest. I think that this film does merit the price of a ticket for the CGI and cinematography alone. Oblivion did not leave me oblivious so I am going to go ahead and give this film a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Proves More is Less,"I watch and find myself wondering, ""Doesn't even Tom Cruise ever get tired of mouthing the same tired words and sentiments over and over and over again?"" I know he gets paid roughly a billion per word, but wouldn't part of being extremely wealthy mean not having to do the same stupid thing over and over and over? At least Cameron plays with submarines!But we need to realize that as a Scientologist Cruise probably believes some part of all this crap to be FACTUAL, so maybe it's like ""scripture"" to him.Just why are all future fonts slightly squarish? Since they appear in everything ""futury"", they must be superior, so why don't we just give in and use them for everything now? I guess the answer must like in the predictable lack of imagination in the designers of these films.This movie was too long by at least half, but I don't think even the needed slash-and-burn editing this movie required would have made it interesting.And for the last time, NO that speckly-face old black actor guy doesn't automatically add ""gravitas""--not even to Sprint commercials!

More than the sum of its parts,"I'm really irritated by all the reviews that speak only to what Oblivion has in common with other scifi movies. It is true that there are a lot, but that's what is so great about this movie. It takes all the well-worn tropes of scifi like: alien invasions, post-apocalyptic dystopia's, artificial intelligences gone awry, and a David/Goliath fight for survival and tells a fresh and engaging story. This is a movie that actually has something to say, something that I found very touching. In fact, the more I thought about it after the movie was over, the more I loved what it was saying. The overarching message is obvious enough, but the implications of what it is saying reverberate back through the storyline and give more weight to what could appear, on the surface, a simple action-adventure tale. My friends and I discussed it afterwords and made a lot of interesting observations and connections.I have to say that I am very impressed with director Joseph Kosinski who came up with the story and helped write the screenplay. His direction for Tron:Legacy was good but flawed (mostly due to a mediocre script that he didn't write), but here he guides the characters through an epic adventure with the restrained passion of a director who is confident in what he is trying to communicate to the audience. Amid the special effects and big set-pieces there is something nuanced and beautiful in what he is trying to say about life and the here-after.I would definitely recommend this movie. It has all the elements: great visuals, beautiful music, and an entertaining plot. Just keep your mind (and heart) open to the larger themes that are connected to the simpler actions of the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Combination of Outstanding Performance, Visual Fffects and Originality gives you the best of the Sci-fiction genre","After seen this movie, I decided to divide it to three aspects before i review it.OK! let start with the story. so, the movie start and i was with it on line, till the half of it or more a bit, and at that moment everything start to change, i'm not gonna tell you what has changed exactly, so not to break the suspense, but i wasn't expecting that the story line will go further than what i was expecting after seen the trailers before the movie kick-off in theaters, trust me at that moment, it will make you to stick to the screen and give the movie more attention than before, even if you have to go to pee, you'll stuck it and ask: oww! hold on a second, what's going on exactly?Now let's jump to the dramatization and performance of the cast, Tom Cruise (Jack) as always gives the best of what he got and he got a lot, so no doubt he did what he had to do to make the movie worth to watch, i mean he lead everyone else to give outstanding performance in this movie. Andrea Riseborough (Victoria), well! she kills it, i mean she gave i think her best performance till date, I've never seen her before in any other movie, this is the first time i know about her and i was blown by her performance. Morgan Freeman (Beech) like any other movie i think he give the same level of performance every time i saw him, in this movie he did what he had to do to help the hero to achieve his goal. Olga Kurylenko (Julia) she gave what she could give, i mean she didn't kills it but she helped the hero to achieve his goal.Then comes the third aspect, it's really stunning visual effects, i mean if there's an original story like this one, you have to handle it and give it a nice looking face, for this movie that's what happened, and because it's Joseph Kosinski who directed Tron: Legacy, the guy knew where he have to look to give such a take breathing visual effects.Ultimately, I was really blown away, and for such a great Sci-fiction movie i encourage people to dig deep in this genre, because there's a lot to be found, and i highly recommend this movie to the ones who got big imagination... others who never liked sci-fiction don't knock this movie door!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Must-See,"Oblivion is a refreshingly brilliant story that reminds me of the classic sci-fi movies of the past. The plot is not too complicated or convoluted, and at times even a little predictable, but still very engaging and involved. All loose ends are tied and there is never a moment where you don't want to watch the story unfold. The action is great, but the film presents a well-balanced mix of character, mystery, romance, and, of course, enough CGI explosions to keep the action fans satisfied.This is my favourite film of the year so far. Oblivion is definitely one to add to the classic sci-fi collection.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oblivion Entertains,"If you measure Oblivion on pure entertainment value it earns 9 out of 10. The film is beautiful to look at, engaging, and immersive.Throughout, the viewer is sympathetic toward the protagonist and other characters. One feels compassion for the characters' situation and interest for how things will turn out for them.In my opinion, one of the earmarks of a good science fiction story is that it establishes a set of rules or laws and then follows those rules to their logical conclusions. As you become familiar with the rules, it is possible to almost anticipate what will come next, building tension as you wait. So long as the story obeys its own rules, I am willing to suspend my disbelief and the science fiction, however radial, drives the story. Oblivion does this well, explaining the state of the world, if you will, and then remaining completely within those confines throughout.The cinematography, computer generated graphics, and story logic (as described above) combine to make this science fiction film plausible, beautiful, and entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best Sci-fic Movies i have ever seen!,".. just exceptionally great movie. If you pay attention to details and try to actually watch a movie. Try not to find the things, focus what would happen next... because this is science fiction movie not thriller nor mystery. This movie is great when you look at how well story is spread out with music (if you watched with IMAX, you would know it is just the best work on sound) as well as the emotions/ mood created each moment. I have never felt satisfied after watched a movie like this before! Don't watch this movie with bias like ""oh it is tom cruise"" ""oh this doesn't have great something.. blah blah"" Watch this without comparing with any other sci-fic movie. This movie is different than other sci-fic packed with actions nor crazy sci-fic effects. One sentence describing the ""Oblivion"".. ""The best sci-fic movie with great execution, sound... and everything about it."" Recommend this movie 4.5/5 for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Big budget for a simple plot, but effective","There are a lot of good things going for this film: the special effects are flawless, the actors play well, the production values are high. Even the script is not the usual mess that US films have made us be used to. If there is a problem with Oblivion, it is that it is a too good a movie for its own story.OK, there is a twist, somewhere, but you need to not watch the trailer and be rather unconcerned to not see it miles ahead. There are action scenes, but not that many, so you can't go calling it an action film that doesn't need a story. Nor is the story badly written. It just feels so like one of the episodes of Outer Limits that it makes one uneasy while watching. Like something is missing, but you can't place your finger on it. And while it works on delivering the predictable finale, it starts losing its consistency and gaining logic holes that are the hallmark of careful work that was rushed at the end.In a way, it's a very expensive play. If you ignore the extras and the few scenes in which Jamie Lannister still has a hand, there are five actors in total. Some might multiply this with 50 or even 1000, but the actual actors are just five :)So my conclusion is that it was an entertaining film, with full control over the vertical and the horizontal, but less over depth of story. It reached a sort of uncanny valley for which production values are so disproportionately high compared to the complexity of the story that is made me uneasy.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hardest Movie To Follow Ever. But It's Still Really Good.,"Tom Cruise has been called crazy and proved that he is crazy many, many times. It has been said that he is only good in one role: playing a guy with a gun that has a big situation. Sometimes it has been said that he is just flat out a bad actor. He proved to me in 'Oblivion' that either he's a good actor, or he's good at playing the role of a guy with a gun who has a big situation. This movie is very hard to follow, but good. It was enjoyable to me and kept me confused for a very long time. It's not an extremely complicated movie, like 'Inception', but you can't really figure out things in it. This movie almost completely pulled that off. With amazing scenery and very cool action, this movie very much deserves the rating I gave it.It starts out with Tom Cruise narrating what's happened, what he's doing, and why he is where he is. I didn't like that it was Tom Cruise narrating, because I think that when in the beginning of a movie, to tell what has previously happened, they rely on characters narrating it. I think that it's cheap and if they want to tell us what's happened then they should just show us. Anyway, there's no figuring out what he does, because he just told you, so when he does it, it's kind of boring. That's one thing I wanted to talk about. The beginning, where they should have introduced the characters, they did a little bit, but mostly had boring things happen that no one cared about. I know that this is one of those movies where you figure out that the main characters were lied to and it needs to start out with them having no clue that they were lied to, but if you're going to do that, at least make it interesting and entertaining. This part is why I said the movie almost completely pulls the ""hard to follow"" type of movie off.Later, there's action that's actually pretty entertaining. A few weird things happen that didn't make sense for the characters, which started pulling me into the story. I started liking the movie at that part. Some kind of confusing things happen, and you don't think they need to happen, but later you figure out why they happened. The story then is interesting and better than before. There's a little more character buildup, and there are some things that you can tell aren't quite right. I thought that it was a good idea to do that at this point, because it really made want to know what it was that was wrong, and what's going on.Then, all kinds of weird things start happening and the movie gets better, but I had no idea what was going on and that it was extremely hard to follow. When I can't really figuring out what's going on in a movie, I think that the writing for it is good because of that, but sometimes I think that if you don't know what's going on, it could be bad, because it could have failed trying to give that information to you.Anyway, it was exciting, but my mind was filled, so I kind of had no idea what to think. In this section of the movie the Morgan Freeman part that was in the trailer came, and I didn't really like that part. It kind of happened too fast and didn't really give off much information. It may have tried to give us more information, but it failed to, but I don't know. There was also something else wrong with it that I can't quite put my finger on.Well, after that it starts getting even more complicated and I got completely lost in that part. Before it got even more complicated, it gave us a little information (that part was boring, though), and it explained a little bit of what had happened and what came up next, but I will still completely lost next. I had no idea what to think of the movie at all then. It wasn't boring, because I was confused, but I thought this movie needed to redeem itself, because I didn't really enjoy being lost, then. The things that happened in this section were clever, but very strange, and of course, complicated. Later, it is redeemed for, though.Now it really starts getting good. A lot of the questions are answered and we're set strait on a lot of things. I really started enjoying the movie there. This wasn't exactly the end, but it was leading up to it. Their explanations were very smart in the writing, and are acted very well. There weren't many big things that happened in that part, but I don't really think you can have big events happening what you're trying to explain why all of these crazy things have been happening in a movie, but I think it would be cool to see a movie pull that off, though. So, now we have most of the answers, but not all. The end is coming up, and we're ready to figure everything out!The end of 'Oblivion' is here now, and it is amazing. It starts by huge action buildup, then to a very sudden but completely awesome and intense action sequence that blew my mind. This scene was the main reason this movie got an 8/10. It kept me on the edge of my seat with hardcore action, then emotional scenes, then back to more hardcore action. This movie completely pulled off that scene. Later comes the resolution, and the answers to the rest of the questions, some of them with flashbacks, which I thought were shown nicely. My 8/10 rating means that the movie was really good, and I will want to own it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun, clever, not too deep","This was a fun movie, with a bit of cleverness in the plotNow, if you did not previously know that Tom Cruise loves airplanes and motorcycles, this movie would surely tell you that. A very large part of the movie is devoted to filming Tom on aircraft and motorcycles.Andrea Riseborough achieves the odd effect of looking as if she is CG when she is real. I was absolutely persuaded that she was CG at one point, but now I don't think so.Tom also prefers younger women. You see that in this movie. The love interests are much younger than he.I think there is a danger when the performer has this much control over a movie for the thing to be too narrowly focused on what he personally enjoys.Nevertheless, it was a fun, peppy movie -- a lot of action, good photography, good special effects, all that stuff we expect from a contemporary Hollywood movie. It's not Shakespeare or anything, but that's not what it's for, not to be intellectual or overly thoughtful, just a diversion.I saw it in 2D. I'm not sure 3D was available, but that would be a good idea, given the number of scenes of aircraft going through complex spaces at high speed.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
