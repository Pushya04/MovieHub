There are few films that can make me laugh like this one can,"`Snatch', written and directed by Guy Ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time  it is easily in my personal Top Thirty.  In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:Turkish (Jason Statham) and his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are amateur boxing promoters who, after their premier fighter is wounded, have to find a replacement to fight, or one of the meanest guys in London, Brick Top (Alan Ford), who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.  Enter Mickey (Brad Pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out, who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook.  Meanwhile, there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond, trouble ensues, and his fence, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Doug `The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid).  Of course, this can't happen easily, as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film, Boris `The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija)  or as he's better known, `Boris the Bullet Dodger'.Did you get all that?  The performances by all of the above actors, and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good, particularly Brad Pitt's.  Every single actor in `Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story, while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  There are many one-liners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film, and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good.  `Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone, but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on, the film transcends brilliant and becomes FAN-insert your choice of expletive here-TASTIC.  The slick cinematography, lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis, techno and a traditional-sounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.While this was not the first time I had seen the film `Snatch', it was the first time I'd watched the film knowing that I would have to analyze it slightly in order to funnel my thoughts from the film just being `Phenomenal!' to `Phenomenal because..'  While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan, and have been for the last two decades, I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `Swept Away' path, rather, to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.

"Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels","The release of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.Turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel ""Snatch"" is stylistically very similar to ""Lock, Stock"":  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think ""Very Bad Things"").  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad PittPitt resurrects his trailer trash look from ""Kalifornia"" and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend's Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O'Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and part-time pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.While ""Snatch"" initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchie's earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Just as much fun as Lock, Stock.  Snatch is a great and entertaining movie.","Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, ""SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!"" What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.Snatch is a confusing, twisting, crazy movie.  Let me repeat that.  This movie is crazy!  Imagine the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid, and this is what you get my friend.  Believe it or not, this mass confusion and complete insanity is very, very entertaining.The movie has it's problems.  First off, for those of you who have seen Snatch's predecessor, (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you know that Guy Richie (the writer and director of both films) has a very music-video style as far as the camera angles, movements, and cinematography goes.  The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater.  I was also turned off by this madness. However, most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour, so it doesn't last.If any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did, do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can.  Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock, but when it's funny, you'll laugh till your lungs burst.  It was nice to see Vinnie Jones, who was Big Chris in the last movie, return as the same basic character (only now named Bullet Tooth Tony) and doing the same ""slamming victim's head in a car door"" act again.  The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack.  I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn't have a bigger role.  I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he's not.So, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie's style.  I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp.  That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock.  If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A movie that has it all,"A film about boxing, diamonds, gangsters pretending to be Jews, a fat getaway driver, a rather vicious dog and man eating pigs. Guy Richie has followed the success of Lock, Stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as Tarantino did with Pulp Fiction. The characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jones reveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as Irish Mickey. See this movie!!!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Comedy Masterpiece,"""Snatch"" is fantastic; and not least because it demonstrates emphatically that the British movie industry is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was one of the funniest movies released in recent years, and ""Snatch"" takes everything that ""Lock, Stock..."" did so well and does it even better.Back are the cleverly intertwined plotlines, the hilarious one-liners, and the simultaneously intimidating and comedic London villains. So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).Everyone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.Like Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.When it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better ""Snatch"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Do You Know What Nemesis Means?,"I was never really too keen on ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"".  All my friends constantly quoted it, raved and ranted, and then when ""Snatch"" came out, everyone made an even bigger deal of that.  I watched Lock Stock, and though I did like it, it didn't really tickle my fancy.  But Snatch, that's a completely different story all together.When I saw Snatch at the cinemas, I was shocked to see a couple leave only fifteen minutes into the film.  As they left, you could hear their intellectually deficient comments; ""this movie is so boring"".  I couldn't believe it!  I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE, The Pope even!There are hundreds of thousands of reasons for anyone to see this movie; each word of the script being a reason.Snatch is possibly one of THE best written movies I've seen. It's smart, witty, funny and has just the right touches of dark humour.  With characters like Turkish, Mickey, Tommy, Brick Top, Bullet Tooth Tony and Cousin Avi; their witty repartee will have your personal quotes list full for months after watching it.  The camera work and editing complement each other to keep the film's pace on its toes, much like the boxers at the center of the character's stories.Jason Statham has some of THE best lines in the movie, constantly slamming anything even slightly intelligent his partner Tommy has to say.  Brad Pitt turns out an excellent performance as the Irish-Gypsy-Pykie Mickey; his accent is hilarious.Even though the story line is only a simple one (following a massive Diamond through England's criminal underworld), it is the connections each character has to the diamond and each other that really makes this film stand out from all the usual jewel-heist films.Another 10 / 10 from me on this one, it's just a pity the follow up to Snatch was a ""collaborative effort"" from Mr. Richie and his um.......wife.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guy Richie and Vinnie Jones have done it again!,"Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit as astonishing as its predecessor. The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year.

Perfect,"This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. 10/10.I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.I must pick out specific actors who were just over the top - meaning 10+!Jason Statham as ""Turkish"" is simply superb - a star of very high caliber. (You should see him in anything he made, and read my comment about John Carpenter's movie: ""Ghosts of Mars."")Alan Ford as ""Brick Top"" is terrifying - his forced speaking style made me think that he was chewing on the flesh of his previous victim.Vinnie Jones as ""Bullet Tooth Tony"" is total tough head to foot tough - a walking brick wall - a marine for all seasons - none tougher.Brad Pitt as ""Mickey O'Neil"" is utterly 110% convincing. I never liked Mr. Pitt's work before this - but this one totally sold me - he is as solid an actor as ever came out of Hollywood... and better!Finally, Guy Ritchie should be recognized as a Michelangelo of film.-LD",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Subtitles A Must To Really Enjoy This,"I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes. So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so?Well, because I usually enjoy ""stylish"" film-making and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy, played by American Brad Pitt, is almost intelligible.This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film, at least for the first viewing, or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before: the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway, I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on, especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB.Since the action changes every two minutes to another scene with other people (Lord of The Rings subsequently did the same), it's had to get lulled to sleep or have your mind wander. Something wacky is going on every few minutes. The attitudes of the criminals are rough: these are low-life people in the underworld: extremely tough people with the toughest being ""Bricktop"" (Alan Ford) who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of f-words in here, too.The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange, so cartoon-like, that - combined with the unique visuals - it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release , at least here in the States, such as Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here.This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all tough-talking, almost-crude men (plus a funny dog). It's so weird, I'll just end with the cliché that ""this is not for all tastes"" but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different, you might want to give it a shot. Just remember to turn on the subtitles.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guy Ritchie's style on full display,"Turkish (Jason Statham) and his buddy Tommy are two low life boxing promoters. They get entangled with a diamond heist when they try to get incomprehensible Mickey (Brad Pitt) to fight for them. Meanwhile the wild casts of underworld criminals get involved with this boxing match.Writer/director Guy Ritchie introduces the audience to a vast array of wild and crazy criminals. It's his second movie after 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. He has a crazy unique style. The story is hard to follow, but it's not actually the most important part of the movie. It's Guy Ritchie's unreserved style and excessive energy that is on display here. It's a constant stream of outrageous characters, over the top mannerisms, and great actors having loads of fun. Brad Pitt is completely wacko. There is just so much going on in this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"An energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors.","'Snatch (2000)' is an energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors in which whatever could go wrong does go wrong. It's a series of eventually intertwining parallel stories each centred around a stolen stone which feature a cast of colourful, mostly inept characters with slightly weird names and a mainly cockney lilt (aside from the Russian, the American and the sort-of-but-not-really Irish thing that Brad Pitt tries to do). It deals in stereotypes and the comedy is pretty broad, but the film isn't so much funny as it is exhaustively coincidental in a strangely compelling way, with the usually dumb-as-bricks characters making a major mistake only to run into someone (sometimes literally) who then fixes that mistake or changes their path entirely. It's not so much a straightforward narrative as one that keeps you guessing as to where it's going to go while simultaneously not mattering at all, as it's the individual situations themselves that entertain. The fact it all ties together in the end is, strangely, kind of a bonus. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You must have already decided to love it before watching...,"That's the only way I can explain these rave reviews and 8.2 average. Because if you come into the movie actually looking for a great story with great acting and diverse, interesting characters, well, you won't get it.

I mean, if you take every cliché ever put into a gangster film and rehash it with tommy gun rapidity, that's the first 15 minutes of Snatch. And it just keeps going, and going.

I'm sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.As for the movie - I usually get confused in fast-paced movies with so many characters, but when I watched Snatch I was able to keep all the characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique and quirky about him.  I liked that, and I liked the accents, and I liked the silly plot-twist humor, and I liked the dogs.  The evil men were EVIL (""so evil you would call it the froo-its of the dev-eel"" to quote Mike Meyers).  The bumbling men were endearing.

In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?,"Snatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience. Guy Ritchie has done a Sam Raimi, he has remade the first film that put him on the cinematic map. Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there's a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it's the same movie and without doubt it's lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks!Snatch in story terms is concerned with a big diamond that stitches together a number of threads involving the London underworld. Some rough and tough Romany types join in the fun, headed by a purposely illegible Brad Pitt, while Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro and Rade Serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat to the crooks and gangster stew. The British cement holding the building up comes in the twin forms of Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, with Vinnie Jones once again turning up to frighten the masses. Everything from bare knuckle fighting to bumbled robberies - to dog fighting and shifty arcade empires - are here, with Ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off of the screen.As with ""Lock-Stock"", the beauty is in the way violence and humour are deftly blended. Scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny, a pearl of dialogue is never far away from a perilous situation. The comic tone is more close to the knuckle here, Ritchie having fun toying with ethnic and machismo stereotypes, while he brings his bag of visual tricks before it got boring. The narrative is deliciously complex, but much credit to Ritchie for the way he pulls all the threads neatly together in a whirl of scene splicing and cocky literary assuredness.So it's ""Lock-Stock 2"" then! No bad thing if you happen to be a fan of that sort of wide boy malarkey. If you don't like it? Then jog on sunshine. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
My stomach hurts! It literally hurts!,"Last year I was working on the IMDb Top 250 list, and I noticed that Snatch was on the list, so I decided to take a look at it. I was in Denmark at that time. I live in Faroe Islands.I stayed at my uncle's apartment, and he told me that you have to watch some of Guy Ritchie's movies before watching Snatch to get to know his movies better, so I watched Revolver. I was not very keen on it and then I was not looking forward to see Snatch.While my uncle was not at home, I decided to watch it. I wanted to turn it off after the first second, because I thought it was so weird. I'm 14 years old now, and I knew almost nothing about cinema back then, and I had never seen such a movie like Snatch, and it's style! I thought it would be stupid of me to turn it off after 1 second so I kinda forced myself to watch it. To be honest, I actually loved the weird style after 10 minutes!The cinematography was great. I had never seen something like that before and the editing was just as great too. There were lots of great characters and the script was excellent. It was funny and clever and it will you make you laugh every single second! This movie is like Pulp Fiction. You can almost quote every line! The acting was totally awesome!

"Brutally funny, a stylish masterpiece","The tightly knit formula for the average ""heist movie"", is constantly in danger of becoming predictable to the point of redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry, so to see a film quietly whisk in and reinvigorate the genre was a refreshing feat indeed. And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch.Director Ritchie has somewhat fallen out of favour with both critics and audiences of late with both his ill-advised cinematic tribute to his wife Madonna, Swept Away, and his nonsensical gambling drama Revolver, so it is easy to forget how masterful a filmmaker he can truly be when given the chance. Ritchie's convoluted tale, which ties together three parallel stories involving a diamond theft and the world of unlicensed bare knuckle boxing in the British underground may prove to be too full of twists and turns to be followed entirely on the first viewing. This, along with the stylistic similarities to its predecessor may prove to be the film's only major criticism; however, it is highly unlikely the majority of audiences will feel alienated by the fact that the adrenaline fuelled plot may prove hard to follow, and instead relish the chance to revisit the film multiple times to pick up on things they may have missed in previous viewings. In a film with as much to appreciate as this, it comes as no surprise that multiple viewings never seem to detract from the experience, but that the film seems only to increase in quality upon each viewing.Stylistically, the film is in a class of its own, employing hyper-kinetic cinematography and editing, which proves to be some of the most vivid and inventive work demonstrated in recent cinematic history. The film's score and musical selection is consistently pitch perfect, and endlessly catchy, never failing to amplify the seedy yet comical mood. Ritchie's sense of pacing is impeccable, and how a film which opens with a group of Jewish rabbis entering a bank, (which in itself sounds like the beginning to a particularly brilliant joke) only to steal its valuable contents, launching the film into an adrenaline fuelled title sequence could ever be considered not funny or at the very least oozing with style is beyond conventional logic. Ritchie also proves to have a real eye for location, and in each scene the viewer feels fully immersed in the grunge and filth of the underground, making the film that much more effective.The ensemble cast rise to the challenge of bringing Ritchie's brilliant screenplay to life, and turn out universally superb performances, each creating a unique and memorable character, complete with catchy names. Jason Statham is consistently strong as boxing promoter Turkish; his deadpan delivery and excellent narration carry the film wonderfully. Steven Graham similarly raises many a laugh as his consistently dumbfounded sidekick, Tommy. Benicio Del Toro makes wonderful use of his far too brief screen time as gambling addicted diamond thief Franky Four Fingers - his Las Vegas gambling flashbacks are nothing less than flat out hilarious. Ritchie favourite Vinnie Jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary Bullet Tooth Tony (a role it would seem is only a step away from his real life persona) and Russian actor Rade Serbedzija creates a simply classic character as arms dealer 'Boris the Blade'. Character actor Alan Ford makes for an exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark 'Brick Top', and Robbie Gee and Lennie James are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves. But surprisingly enough, the film's unlikely standout proves without a question to be its biggest star: Brad Pitt, waltzing in to steal the show as incomprehensible 'Pikey' boxer Mickey - an egoless and thoroughly hilarious performance.Though this may be familiar ground for those who have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is no less enjoyable as a result - brutally violent, caustic and hilarious, with Ritchie's trademark sense of incomparable style. Snatch excels in every possible aspect, and the truly talented cast bring their vibrant characters to life with unquestionable flair, each one flat out hilarious when given their moment to shine. Though all of the film's intricacies may not be entirely clear on the first viewing, this only makes each following viewing all the more intriguing and entertaining. For those who have yet to appreciate the cinematic genius that is Snatch... don't wait for protection from ""Zee Germans"", simply see it!-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
But I like style over substance. Who took the jam out of your donut?,"(r#93)Whine, whine, whine, is that all you people know how to do? I mean, sorry to burst your bubble, but Snatch is not the kind of film you give an in-depth analysis. Snatch is a roller-coaster ride that you just sit back and enjoy. It is a brilliantly funny movie, with an unimportant story which still takes a couple of viewings to fully absorb. Add to that a fantastic cast, including Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, the dog, and Alan Ford as the sweet-natured Brick Top. Add to *that* that Guy Ritchie's fantastic way of using his camera and music to give the fantastic flair that is the trademark of his ""lorry-gangsta"" films. What more could you want?Everyone's raving about Brad Pitt's performance as the incomprehensible Mickey, and yes, he's great. But Rabe Serbedzija doesn't get nearly enough attention as Boris the Blade! This guy is pure comic genius. Watch the scene where he's selling a gun to Turkish's partner Tommy. A fantastic actor all around. But what am I talking about? Literally every single actor is hilarious in this film. Benicio Del Toro is a complete psycho, Jason Statham keeps burning his buddy Tommy, Alan Ford is brutal (in more than one way) as the crime boss who feeds people to the pigs. The rather unknown Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade all hit the right notes as three slightly-less-than-competent street thugs.Do I even need to say that the script is utterly brilliant? Who can forget these lines?? ""I shoot you! You go down!""; ""It was two minutes five minutes ago!""; ""What? You don't think I've got the vitamins?""; ""Do you know what 'nemesis' means?""; ""It was *behind* you, Tyrone. When you reverse, things tend to come up from behind you!""; ""Tommy, 'the tit', is praying. And if he isn't, he f-ing should be.""; ""Don't snatch!""; ""I love this song!""; ""Anything to declare?"" ""Yeah. Don't go to England.""; the list goes on and on.Overall a hilarious, forgettable, but instantly quotable flick to just turn on and enjoy the hell out of whenever you're bored. And what's wrong with that? Do you really want every film to change your life? Snatch is entertainment at its finest, and if you have to whine about 1-dimensional characters, bad storyline, or style over substance, start a blog. At least then we won't have to read it.PS.

Good golly Miss Molly! One of a kind!,"SNATCH (2000) Director Guy Ritchie flix this must have movie into the South - English culture with brutal gangsters and one punching taters.Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones, all this good actors operates in this violent crime comedy that really entertians you! Depressive and smartass mood twisted into a state of mind of strong language and rough'n'tough characters. Explosive with its brutal way of telling its story. Benicio del Toro and Brad Pitt steals much of the show with their two indispensable parts of the movie (though del Toro's not too big). It may have some things like remind you off Fight Club and stuff, but it is without doubt very much the same of Ritchie's other English gangster movie Lock, Stock and Two smoking Barrels (also with Vinnie Jones). The story is fast and very nice put together where you switch cameras sometimes and may in the background you can see things happening in the other camera view, very good Guy!Statham is great and together with his partner Tommy they work for a brtual and disgusting gangster boss. They hire Mickey, a hard punching man living off selling caravans and loves his mum.

Lot of characters not much interest,"Snatch has been critically acclaimed throughout and has been praised as such a great film with an interesting take on a British crime, involving many characters. However as watching the film, there were many characters but too many where we did not care for them. The plot at times is confusing with these characters all coming together but in the end we do not really care. For a film with a running time of a little over 1 hour 40 minutes, it feels longer than one should. As an ensemble cast, not many stand out except Jason Statham (in a very early role in his career) and Brad Pitt (though not in a good way, speaking with a difficult hard to hearing accent- and wondering why he took this role).Too many characters, and were not interesting, was hard to remember their names as well. What makes it worse is the constant jumping from characters and scenes. Snatch is quite the overrated film and wondering why it is currently in the IMDb top 250 with a rating of 8.3. Also praise with comedy and having humor but nothing into the film is quite at that, where the scenes feel bland and wondering as to what people found funny. Apart from some of the boxing scenes involving Brad Pitt, the scenes with Jason Statham and the last 20 minutes or so, Snatch is not a good recommend.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The way movies -should- be made.,"Read this review carefully, please.First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot.By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once.There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points (Think The Ring vs. Ringu, did we need the ""How long could you survive down there all alone?"" line?). Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully.The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying ""Zee Germans"" and things like ""It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?"" quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.Summary: watch the movie, and don't expect to be TOLD everything, expect to have to pay attention.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Snatch has it all,"This was an amazing movie. The dialogue was extremely witty and tied in with the acting perfectly. There is an element of hilarity which will also appeal to a lot of people. Not a single actor in this movie was bad, each person played their role perfectly. The different cultures were portrayed perfectly and the acting reflects on that.Another really cool aspect of the movie were the wonderfully colorful names that each character gets. They alone contribute to the culture.It's amazing how the entire movie revolves around one pivotal moment in the beginning but then branches out into the matrix of stories that are all entwined and then brought back together in the end.This is the epitome of a good movie, great acting, great actors, great story, great culture, great dialogue.

A Win for Everyone,"Snatch is a gangster tale, set in England. While it's nothing like these films, the best comparisons I can make are ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Way of the Gun"". All the actors do a spectacular job, especially Brad Pitt who plays Mickey the Piker. His ability to play a marble-mouthed boxer is impressive, comparable to any of his other solid roles. The camera work is brilliant, with guns directing the direction of angles. Boris the Blade is one of the greatest mob characters ever invented. But best of all is the intricacy of the script. Rather than a straight ""rise to the top"" gangster movie like Scarface, this one requires multiple viewings to really understand. Multiple gangsters with various affiliations going after different objectives. Yet they're all interconnected, and trying to keep straight in your mind who works for whom might just take a little work. This film is highly recommended, and even more so if you're already a fan of the other films mentioned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Anything to declare?... Yeah don't go to Hollywood!,"The British film industry is lucky.  Guy Ritchie doesn't like flying!The main criticism I'd heard regarding this film was that it was just more of the same from its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Well I'd rather have a Lock Stock'2 than the 50 Runaway Brides that Hollywood deems worthy to force upon us each year!Of course it is impossible to avoid comparisons with Ritchie's remarkable debut.  The trademarks are all here - the larger than life criminal underworlders (including more racial stereotypes than all the Bond films put together), the far-fetched farcical plot, and the comicbook violence. However, Snatch is an altogether darker, harder tonic to swallow.While Snatch may be a lot darker in tone, with hard edged depictions of life in the depths of the criminal underworld (most notably the dog-fighting), it still delivers plenty of punch in its comedy.  The cast all seem to thoroughly enjoy their roles (most of which are pretty much straightforward cameos) with Brad Pitt perhaps steeling the show with his spot on coherently-challenged Gypsy boxer.Snatch is a brutally stylish, wickedly enjoyable British gangster film. More of the same then!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Disappointing, lack lustre and callous....","I really looked forward to watching Snatch. Not only was it from the director of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', one of my favourite UK movies of all time, but it had Brad Pitt in, who since Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club is my numero uno cool actor.But I ended up greeting many of the attempts at humour with a stoney face, found some of the images (notably the one with the body bags) just gross and distasteful and the entire plot lacking in the FUN that had been Lock, Stock.The plot didn't seem to weave as much - the diamond changed hands predictably, the comedy dog wasn't and some of the gags were so...sitcom-like. Ooooh...a fat man having trouble getting out the car.The characters were bad too. Ah, he has a cockney accent that's all  we need to know about him. Ah, everyone f***ing hates Pikies. That's funny repetition.The violence didn't fit with the cheeky style the film attempted...It makes me angry to think how much better Lock, Stock is. And it's a warning to ppl making a 'next' movie - change the plot, setting, chracters, tone, etc. so that comparisons between two movies are left abstract.Snatch is the half-backed sequel to Lock, Stock. But Ritchie sold out earlier than Lucas. If you look carefully you can see Ewoks everywhere.....or is it just lack of originality?",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Gritty comedic crime thriller that kept me invested throughout.,"""Snatch"" is nothing short of a very entertaining movie that kept my attention fron start to finish due to its memorable characters, witty dialogue filled with humorous slang, insane situations, and unique editing (not to mention excellent performances such as Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy boxer, Jason Statham as an English criminal boxing promoter or Alan Ford as a ruthless gangster and pig-breeder).I also love how despite this film having quite a lot of sub-plots, it still manages to be a coherent film and also comes to a clear conclusion that wraps everything up nicely.Without getting into spoilers, what else can I say other than: WATCH THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Weeding through the Cockney slang is half the experience,"In this fast-paced thriller-comedy Ritchie again takes us into the 'underworld' of England and this time he does it with more assured direction than in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This is a world full of tough, gritty and eccentric characters who cheat each other on everything from rigged unlicensed boxing games to multi-million pound diamond heists. This heist is central to the wide montage of characters in Snatch who all want a piece of the action.Snatch has one of the greatest opening credits in film history. It follows then, that the rest of the film should be equally entertaining and stylish, and it just about makes it. It is a viciously styled thrill of crime, humour and attitude almost solely propelled by the dialogue and interactions of its characters. There are no sugarcoating action effects or stunning visuals to detract - the core is the focus, and the core is its many dynamic characters, like Bricktop, Turkish and Tony and the hilarious situations they get themselves into. The stupidity and amateurism of these 'gangsters' provide for the comedic effect, as is Richie's style.The only slight flaw, as I can see it, is the lack of cinematic harmony. In other words, there is no traceable thread throughout the film - more likes a series of entertaining scenes. You know how some people are just born to write, and others have to practice to get to the same level or articulation and vocabulary - but ultimately, the idea of 'what sounds good' cannot be taught and the natural writer will be the better one. It is probably the same in direction, and Guy Ritchie is not a natural talent as there is no harmony. It's pretty good yes, but not harmonic.When I say more 'assured' direction on Richie's part, I mean that in Snatch, every scene and character serves a purpose - unlike in Lock, Stock where longer segments were often used. But above all, you can tell that the director had fun with the script because it translates so well in the film. It is more hilarious than anything, and the accents provide for half the comedy. A wildly entertaining and highly stylish crime film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Not bad at all,"""Snatch"" is a lot like ""Lock Stock"" in many ways. The formulas are exactly the same, and we have quirky characters, and scene-stealing Vinnie Jones always ready to slam a guys head in a car door. And of course a lot of underdogs getting to the top by some freak accident. It's differences are the presence of American actors (Benicio Del Toro, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina) and in some ways it is more American. It's a lot more violent than ""Lock Stock"" and has more of a darkness to it. I'm teeter tottering whether I like the more violence and darkness in this Guy Ritchie project. I don't know whether I'm a big fan of the violence in this one, or maybe I just don't like hand to hand combat. The darkness is attributed with characters who have more depth than the characters in ""Lock Stock"". Though Brad Pitt's character is very funny, there is a moment, when his caravan is burning down, of a sad intensity in his eyes, there was nothing like this in ""Lock Stock"". I think Guy Ritchie's character development shows that he has grown more from his first project. Though he is following the same formulas as his previous work, there is more elements added to ""Snatch"". I highly suggest if you haven't seen ""Snatch"" or ""Lock Stock"", I suggest seeing ""Lock stock"" first. Because they are highly comparable (as if you couldn't tell) and ""Lock stock"" will help you bone up on the way Guy Ritchie writes and directs. I also suggest if you're new to Guy Ritchie to get a pad and paper and play connect the dots between all the characters. It's kind of hard doing it in your head like I did when I watched ""Snatch.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Awesome movie.,"This is top-class entertainment. The movie is brilliantly constructed and has its own unique style. Both the story and characters are over-the-top and therefor also extremely fun.This is a movie were basically is very little wrong with. It's some perfect mindless entertainment but with a complicated storyline. So it's still a sort of movie with a story, which you have to pay a lot of attention to, while watching. The movie is made in the same style as the previous Guy Ritchie movie, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". There are lots of similarities between these two movies, so if you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" you'll most likely also really like this movie as well.Main difference with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" though, is that this movie has a 'bigger' cast with some more well known names in it. Jason Statham who made his debut in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" plays the main character in this movie. Brad Pitt plays a very fun role and fits surprisingly well into the typical British storyline and atmosphere of the movie. Also well known actors like Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina fit in very well into the story and the movie in general. But perhaps the biggest positive surprise of the movie was Vinnie Jones. He had been given quite some dialog in this movie and he shows that he really can act. Most movies he plays in, he is given very little dialog, a shame because judging by just this movie, he is a very talented actor.Maybe the movie becomes a bit too complex at times, which is mainly due to the very many characters that play a prominent role in the story. It perhaps gets a bit too much at times but overall it doesn't make the movie any less fun to watch, just more (too much) complicated.The movie has some very fun and original moments in the story, even though the movie is a bit too similar to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" at times. Which is also the main reason why I still regard ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" as a better movie. It came first and therefor it's more original and refreshing. Basically ""Snatch."" is just more of the same. Not that more of the same is a bad thing in this case but it's just of course not as refreshing and original as with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was the case.If you like a well constructed movie with a solid and complex story told from multiple points of views this is a sort of movie that you'll love. Also highly recommendable if you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", of course.

Snatch: A Wild and Witty Cinematic Rollercoaster,"If you're in the mood for a film that's fast-paced, stylish, and relentlessly entertaining, look no further than ""Snatch."" Directed by Guy Ritchie, this crime comedy is a true gem that delivers a knockout punch of wit, action, and dark humor that will leave you craving more.From the opening moments to the final credits, ""Snatch"" grabs hold of your attention and never lets go. The film weaves together multiple interconnected storylines involving a colorful cast of characters, including small-time crooks, ruthless gangsters, and a dogged boxing promoter, all vying for a stolen diamond that sets off a chain reaction of chaos and mayhem.The ensemble cast is nothing short of spectacular, with standout performances from Jason Statham as the cool and quick-witted Turkish, Brad Pitt as the incomprehensible but lethal Mickey O'Neil, and Benicio Del Toro as the enigmatic and dangerous Franky Four Fingers. Each character brings a unique flavor to the mix, adding layers of depth and intrigue to the already rich tapestry of the story.Guy Ritchie's signature directorial style is on full display in ""Snatch,"" with its rapid-fire editing, snappy dialogue, and stylish visuals creating a world that is as gritty as it is vibrant. The film's clever use of non-linear storytelling keeps the audience on their toes, as they piece together the puzzle of events that unfold with breakneck speed.What truly sets ""Snatch"" apart is its razor-sharp wit and dark humor. The dialogue crackles with sharp one-liners and clever wordplay, keeping the audience laughing even as the tension mounts to dizzying heights. The film's blend of comedy and violence is a delicate balance that Ritchie navigates with skill and finesse, creating a tone that is uniquely his own.In conclusion, ""Snatch"" is a 10/10 cinematic experience that fires on all cylinders and never misses a beat. With its stellar cast, kinetic energy, and pitch-perfect blend of humor and action, this film is a wild and witty ride that will leave you exhilarated and wanting more.

Another stylish gangster comedy from Guy Richie,"This film from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' creator Guy Richie is centred on more gangsters, hard men and chancers. The intertwining story lines feature Turkish and Tommy, a couple of unlicensed boxing promotors who get in a spot of bother when their fighter gets beaten by 'One Punch Mickey', an Irish Gypsy, just before a fixed fight... the boys must get Mickey to fight for them if they are to avoid being fed to the pigs by mobster 'Brick Top'. Meanwhile Franky Four Fingers has stolen an eighty six carat diamond in Antwerp only to go missing in London... many people are after the diamond. Inevitably the two plots will eventually collide.There may be a fair amount of violence and few of the characters are really that nice but this film is a lot of fun. There are laughs in most scenes whether it is the sight of incompetent thieves trying to rob a bookies which has no money, a dog that squeaks because it has swallowed a squeaky toy or gangsters armed with replica pistols the gags all hit the mark. The cast is large but the characters are all very distinctive so one is unlikely to get confused about who is who. I don't think there were any weak links amongst the cast which includes the likes of Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones and Dennis Farina amongst others. Not surprisingly Brad Pitt is probably the most memorable with his fine performance as Mickey; a character whose accent is deliberately almost impossible to understand at times. Overall I'd say that it doesn't matter that the film is more style than substance... that doesn't matter when it is as much fun as this. If you liked 'Lock, Stock' you will want to see this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Reservoir Shaggy-Dogs...,"""Snatch."": the tale of a stolen diamond, unlicensed boxing games, a promoter with the most peculiar hobby consisting on feeding his pigs with his enemies or debtors, and Irish travelers with caravans and accents as impenetrable as the plot that tries to tie all these elements together.Oh, did I forget there's also a little dog that can swallow everything, from a squeaking toy to... a more valuable item. Well, I think this dog is the living metaphor of whatever Guy Ritchie expect from us, viewers: to swallow anything, as long as it is funny. In fact, the film is quite funny, with a few outbursts of sheer comedic genius, but it's not as easily digestible as Ritchie's 1998 hit: ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"".Guy Ritchie has been accused of exercising in style with his second film, but he could also give the Hitchcock answer about style being only another name for self-plagiarism. And he wouldn't be totally wrong because ""Snatch."" can be looked as a plagiarism in tone and story structure of his 1998 hit film, same assortment of characters with colorful nicknames, same intertwined plots, same use of frenetic editing, slow, fast or stop motions, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Tom Ford reprising different roles and a screenplay loaded of one-liners, quirks and wisecracks, though not as memorable as the first.So accusing Ritchie of the whole ""style over substance"" isn't just pointless, it's unfair in the way he didn't attend to do anything substantial, his ""Snatch."" Is as much a joke as ""Lock Stock"".But he can't get away with this argument either, not totally. I saw the movie again and found myself amused most of the time, but never really riveted to the point that I would miss nothing from the film. It's like the style of Ritchie didn't allow the movie to bloom by itself, everything was more an excuse for a few throwaway gags and the character were only the foils of a deliriously intricate plot. A comedy where the focus is the story can afford slower moments, in the case of Ritchie's movies, it depends on who's on the screen and on that level, there are three characters steal the show.Vinnie Jones, as Bullet Tooth Tony, provides a monologue that almost equals Dirty Harry's description of a Magnum, and with the same intimidating effect, Tom Ford as the nasty-looking bespectacled Brick Top is quite convincing as someone to make you curse your mother for giving you birth if you ever owed his money and Brad Pitt overplays his mumbling accent as if he was conscious that the whole thing didn't even need to be clear, a stunt that reminded me of Benicio Del Toro in ""The Usual Suspects"". That his 'Mickey' would make an accent worst than the cockney slang they used is a great running gag by itself, that with his extraordinary punching skills. Not to mention that Brad Pitt looked great, and you could tell, he still had the 'Fight Club' look.Benicio Del Toro is another asset of the film, making a hilarious entrance as a pseudo Rabbi with an interesting lecture about the Virgin Mary... wait a minute, black-clad men walking together talking about 'Virgin'? A feeling of déjà-vu deepens. Anyway, Del Toro was great as Frank Four Fingers but wasted too soon. I guess he had to work for the movie that would earn him the Oscar the same year, the more serious ""Traffic"". The film has so many great and inventive characters, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) or Boris the Blade that not all of them have a real shining moment. Even Statham who has such amazing lines as ""Turkish"" in his first scenes becomes the passive observer he was in ""Lock"". Characters seem like the rather interchangeable elements of a plot too sophisticated for its own good. Even the build-up with unlicensed boxing games doesn't lead to a really satisfying resolution.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film for the most part of it, but thinking about it again, I'm wondering if it's not the sort of experience you can have as well by watching the best parts on Youtube. Ritchie rearranges all the moments like many clips of a parody series, and while it worked in ""Lock, Stock"" because it had a common thread, a major story-line... even the seemingly disjointed ""Reservoir Dogs"" had a plot.In ""Snatch."", everyone is important enough for the story but not enough so that we care, it's funny and entertaining, but the film lacks structure. It is possible that Ritchie wanted to replicate his formula, with an all-American cast, and that was enough a novelty but maybe the detractors wished it was less than a replica, and more a Desert-Point-Eagle-type of film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Surely someone can understand Brad Pitt's accent...,"If you thought that Guy Ritchie's first movie was whacked-out, then get a load of this! ""Snatch."" has a rather convoluted plot, but the pace makes it worthwhile. Focusing on several groups of criminals trying to capture a diamond, it's basically a series of crazy situations. The weirdest (by which I mean ""coolest"") aspect is of course Brad Pitt's incomprehensible accent. But the other characters also have their own things to reveal about themselves.All in all, a great movie with lots of fun. Pitt, Jason Statham, Stephen Graham, Alan Ford, Dennis Farina, Rade Serbedzija, Benicio Del Toro and Vinnie Jones all do a great job.

"A Glorious, Enthusiastic Mess of a Film","Guy Ritchie's `Snatch' is a highly entertaining crime caper featuring innovative (and often brilliant) direction as well as a horde of memorable, over-the-top characters. The direction and the characters are so good, in fact, that it's quite easy to overlook the threadbare story buried at the bottom of the film. `Snatch' is a great example of a film that excels at flash, flair and extraneous details . . . but has some significant problems with its basic foundation. The end results are still remarkably good, but the flaws  while covered up incredibly well -- are enough to keep `Snatch' from achieving the greatness that it comes so close to grasping. (Or snatching, as the case may be.)The film begins with underground fight promoter Turkish (Jason Statham), a decent guy running with a bad crowd, agreeing to put one his fighters in a fixed bout for the big-time criminal Brick Top (Alan Ford). Meanwhile, Franky Four Fingers (Del Toro), who has recently stolen an eighty-five carat diamond for his boss Cousin Avi (Farina), has decided to place some bets on Brick Top's fixed fight.  Nothing goes even remotely right for anyone, of course, and soon there's a mad search on for the diamond by a number of low-life hoodlums, as well as some problems arising from Turkish's new bare-knuckle brawler, a Gypsy named Mickey (Brad Pitt). .  .`Snatch' is a film that's pure eye candy, which is why it's such a joy to watch. Give Guy Ritchie massive amounts of credit -- the man's quite a director. He's a master at editing scenes together in innovative ways, and putting together otherwise ordinary scenes with ingenious and creative methods. `Snatch' is a veritable how-to handbook on visual directing techniques, and it's almost a downright guilty pleasure watching Mr. Ritchie construct this film into such a vibrant, dazzling-looking finished product. The same must be said for the characters, who seem to have come from a place somewhere between `Dick Tracy' and `Reservoir Dogs' -- each and every character in `Snatch' is a distinct and memorable creation, worthy of starring in their own movie, every if they're only on screen for a few moments. (Cousin Avi, Doug the Head, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris the Blade .. . good gravy, where does Guy Ritchie get these wonderful names?) All the characters in `Snatch'  and the terrific actors playing them -- are simply awesome. If any deserve special mention, though, it's Jason Statham as the beleaguered fight manager Turkish and Vinnie Jones as the villainous Bullet Tooth Tony. (Any mainstream action film producer would be wise to cast Vinnie Jones as the main villain in any upcoming summer blockbuster; it's almost scary how well Mr. Jones can play a cold-blooded killer.) The characters are an utter joy to watch, and they're filmed in such a highly original and entertaining manner that `Snatch' actually stands apart from other standard action films and independent Tarantino wannabes as something worth watching.The real problem with `Snatch', though, is that for all its wonderful scenes and awesome characters . . . there's simply not enough story to go around. There's two basic storylines for the film, both pretty good -- but even combined, these storylines are barely enough to last an hour. On the commentary track for the DVD of `Snatch', Guy Ritchie states that his goal for the film was to make a lean and mean story -- well, he succeeded at that goal, but the lean, mean story gets completely bogged down from the weight of its overwhelming horde of characters. Despite how good they are, `Snatch' either would've benefited from a reduction of its cast, if only to provide more time to focus on the storylines; or the addition of a third storyline giving some of the characters more to do also could've helped. (It also might've helped if there was more correlation between the two storylines; the relationship between the two is cursory at best. What's going on in one storyline usually has only slight, minor repercussions affecting the other, and most of the time `Snatch' feels like two distinct and separate small films.)`Snatch' is a terrific joy ride of a film. The only problem is that the ride really doesn't go anywhere. Still, `Snatch' is one of the best-looking films of the year, and even if it's not necessarily the most satisfying of films, it's certainly a heck of a lot of fun. Worth checking out, for sure.

The Worst Movie of 2000?,"""Snatch"" may well be the worst movie I have seen over the past 12 months. Who ever told Guy Ritchie he can direct? Probably the same person who told him Madonna would make a good wife.There are so many places where this film went wrong, I don't know where to begin. But, I'll give it a shot.1. The movie is just too slow. Ritchie certainly is taking us for a wild ride, but the pace is almost as slow as an 80-year-old grandmother driving on the interstate. Ritchie spends too much time spinning his wheels before moving on.2. MTV-Style cinematography. Nothing really wrong with this, provide it is actually used to further the story and the pace of the film. But Ritchie uses it as a gimmick. His lame attemps to dazzle me actually bored me.3. The use of ""ethnic types"" and ""ethnic humor."" Again, I have nothing against the use of ethnic humor or the use of race, provided it is not done in a mean spirited manner. Ritchie doesn't cross the line, but he does tread it. Actually, from his portrayals I can see that Ritchie's knowledge of ethnicity is limited to whatever is white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. His use of ethnic humor makes Ritchie look like an idiot.4. Eccentric characters. I love to see really eccentric characters in movies. But again, this is something Ritchie can't handle. Half his characters aren't eccentric enough, and the rest go so far off the deep end that they are not even credible, just one-dimensional. Its as if Ritchie is trying too hard. Also there is a lack of ""normal"" characters for the eccentrics to play off of.The only positive thing I can say about ""Snatch"" is that this is the best acting I have ever seen from Brad Pitt. He totally disappeared into his character. Unfortunately, even with Pitt ""Snatch"" is not worth the time or money to see.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch does have a theme,"Greed. It's everywhere if you just look for it. The fact that the film is called Snatch shows the main theme of the movie. The word ""snatch"" means to seize something in haste, which shows that greed is the motivational factor for all characters in the film. Vinny and Sol's use of fake guns b/c they were cheaper than real ones. The movie ends with the circle of wealth still being passed on to others. Boris shows his greed in the scene where he cuts off Franky's entire arm, he obviously only needed to cut his hand to get the suitcase, but took more than he needed. Recurring instances of pigs show greed also, sausages, Brick Top's pigs, etc. When the dog is given the toy, it greedily swallows it whole. Many instances of fighting for money.The movie has a widely diverse cast, which shows the interaction between cultures for the purpose of trade. Each of the character's names represents a common quality of their individual culture. In most societies, Men are dominant in the making and handling of money. This is why the film has no females in it's cast. Women are shown mostly with wealthy men, possibly possessions of these men. Greed is brilliantly presented in subtle and extreme ways throughout the entire movie. It makes the film more interesting to watch after you think about this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Another point for Britain,"This movie had one flaw...Diction. The britsh was so cockney I couldn't understand a word they were saying. But other than that it was badass. It worked so perfectly.

"Better than ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" - more fun, more lively, and generally just better","I saw Guy Ritchie's ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and thought it was an extremely disappointing piece of '90s cinema - I specify it was made in the 1990s because it's another one of those Quentin Tarantino rip-offs that borrow his directorial trademarks - the violence punctuated by irony and dark humor, the intertwining stories, the morally dark characters who have no remorse.""Snatch"" is a great deal better. Some people claim it's Guy Ritchie selling out to the American market because it stars Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina. If he's ""selling out,"" he's buying something better with the money - this is a lot more fun to watch than ""Two Smoking Barrels."" Simply put, it's directed much better. I felt like ""Barrels"" was a British TV commercial extended to full length - all style over substance. ""Snatch"" has similar style but there's more substance.As for the performances... everyone is great. Del Toro opens the movie with a bank robbery - he steals a precious diamond and tries to sell it. This moves on to Jason Statham, as a boxing promoter, and his story ties into the previous one. This goes on and on and invites new characters into the mix.The standout is of course Brad Pitt. When I lived in England we had Pikeys living around us and they annoyed the hell out of me. They were constantly speeding down our road and stealing stuff. Once they smashed their van through a neighbor's fence, then fled the scene of the accident - as if the police wouldn't figure out who it was.Watching ""Snatch"" I was reminded of this and thought it was particularly memorable because I've never seen a ""Pikey"" in a movie before. Brad Pitt basically mumbles his way through the movie and he and his pack really do come across as genuine Pikeys.I hate to sound like a typical American when I say ""Snatch"" is better than ""Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels,"" but I honestly think the plot, the direction and the acting is superior here. Statham is still great and Pitt is surprisingly effective in his role. The movie is lively and fun to watch, cleverly scripted with good dialogue and although some scenes are reminiscent of Tarantino, the overall product is far better than anything else Ritchie has done - and provides more originality than his other movies, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Absolutely brilliant,"An absolutely wild and fast-paced ride that combines dark comedy, intricate plots, and a colorful cast of characters into one entertaining and unforgettable film. Here's my enthusiastic take on this British crime comedy:Directed by Guy Ritchie, ""Snatch"" takes us into the gritty world of London's underground crime scene, where a motley crew of characters gets entangled in a series of chaotic and hilarious misadventures.The film's central plot revolves around a priceless stolen diamond that becomes the coveted target of various criminals, including a group of small-time boxing promoters, a pair of bumbling thieves, and a ruthless gangster.With its witty dialogue, sharp humor, and rapid-fire storytelling, ""Snatch"" keeps you on your toes from start to finish. The quirky and eccentric characters add an extra layer of fun, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud at their absurd and often ridiculous antics.Jason Statham shines as Turkish, a boxing promoter with a knack for getting into trouble. His performance is both humorous and charismatic, making him one of the standout characters in the film.Brad Pitt's portrayal of Mickey, a bare-knuckle boxing gypsy, is another highlight of ""Snatch."" His thick accent and offbeat personality add a unique and unforgettable dimension to the movie.The film's non-linear narrative keeps you engaged as the story weaves back and forth between various plotlines, culminating in an explosive and satisfying climax.One of the things that make ""Snatch"" so enjoyable is its clever and memorable dialogue, filled with British wit and humor. The banter between the characters is a joy to watch, adding to the film's overall charm.The stylish direction, snappy editing, and energetic soundtrack all contribute to the film's fast-paced and dynamic atmosphere.""Snatch"" is a roller-coaster of humor, action, and clever twists that never lets up. It's a crime caper that revels in its own madness and leaves you thoroughly entertained.If you're in the mood for a quirky and fast-paced crime comedy with a dash of British charm, ""Snatch"" is an absolute must-watch. So, gather your gang, sit back, and enjoy this wild and hilarious journey into the world of underground crime! You won't be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Absolutely perfect,"What's amazing to me is that American filmmakers keep churning out movies with no plot, bad special effects, terrible dialog, horrible acting, cartoonishly fake fight scenes, and the public simply goes crazy for it. Hollywood is to movies what fast food is to fine cuisine.Here is a great British movie that didn't get a lot of hype. It's fresh, different, edgy, and creative. Why Guy Ritchie didn't do more like this I couldn't guess (Lock, stock & 2 smoking barrels is also a must see). Unlike most American movies, the acting is all around phenomenal, but the best performances go to the actors playing Brick Top & Bullet Tooth Tony. The story has so many twists and it'll keep you guessing until the end. The humor in this is very dark, & the film has a certain ""grittiness"" to it that is perfect for the story & characters.Do yourself a favor, & check this out.

American critics they just don't understand a cockney gangster filmwith Balls!,"The basic idea of Snatch is that a botched diamond heist leads to a wild and tangled adventure involving gangsters, boxers, and a detailed look at the London underground scene.The film has many story lines that seem to weave in and out of each other so seamlessly that it gives the film a unique style. Explaining the story is a real pig but here goes - The story goes something like this - Franky Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro) arrives in London to deliver a consignment of stolen gems to Doug ""The Head"" (Mike Reid), In the capital, Franky crosses paths with a ""sneaky *beep* Russian"" Boris ""The Blade"" (Rade Serbedzija), who is planning to half-inch the prize diamond for himself while Franky is at the bookies. Unfortunately, Boris's accomplices make a pig's ear of the stick-up, and the rock ends up in the stomach of a deranged mutt.Meanwhile in another plot line would-be boxing promoters Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) find themselves in a ""tight spot"" with local kingpin Bricktop (Alan Ford) in a forthcoming illegal boxing match when their fighter is accidentally knocked out by Irish gypsy Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt). Unable to cancel the bout, the pair persuades Bricktop to allow them to enter Mickey in place of their injured man. Unfortunately, the ""pikey"" Irishman refuses to obey orders to ""go down in the fourth"", embarrassing Bricktop and his associates and losing him a few bob in the process Unafraid to use bloodshed to make his point, Bricktop exacts a terrible revenge on Mickey's family to stress the point that when he says go down in the fourth, he means it.This film is amazingly more of a cockney comedy than a serious (""the getaway"" game style) London gangster plot. Vinnie Jones excels in the role of a London hard nut it's what he does best and the accomplices of the Russian are brilliantly funny and lighten the dark and gritty reality of the plot considerably A definite work of extreme style form Guy Ritchie with an urban soundtrack to match the plot, this film is a welcome follow-up to ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" which is also worth watching. No offence but this isn't one for heart warming characters or American critics they just don't understand a Great British gangster filmwith Balls!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch is best movie of the year so far,"The cinemas in my city are so crappy about getting movies that are off the beaten path of the mainstream, that I was surprised we even got Snatch. I had never seen Lock Stock and the only thing I knew about Guy Ritchie was that he was married to Madonna. But some friends of mine talked me into going, and it was just fantastic. It had that hard edged comedy that Pulp Fiction seemingly invented. As a matter of fact, except for Fight Club, this may be the best movie that has come out since Pulp Fiction. This should definitely be up for an oscar, and Brad Pitt for best supporting actor. You can't understand a word he says but he still manages to say more than most actors do in a 5 minute monologue. Another highlight was Benicio Del Toro who, while not in the film for very long, steals every scene he's in. Vinnie Jones surprised me because I had never heard of him (I did recognize him though) and he was such a good tough guy. Now that this movie is out for rent, everyone can see it, and it is definitely the better choice than Save the Last Dance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Funny and Visually Exciting,"I saw this at a preview showing 5 days before it came out in the UK and am glad I did.  Well what can I say basically 'Snatch' is 'Lock Stock' but with a diamond.  However, don't let this distract you from what is a very funny, well-shot and visually enjoyable film.Guy Ritchie propels the story along with blistering pace trying to fit a fast range of characters and in some cases this can become confusing to who is who and what is what.  In any normal case this would make the film a poorly put together piece however, it is down to Ritchie's exciting visual style, which keeps you, hooked to the brilliant ending.  You certainly won't get bored cause of the amount of images being throw at you, is incredible.This all round down in an astonishing final fist fight involving Brad Pitt, which mixes all the elements before hand into a visual adventure, with every trick included 10 times as good as any fight you will see in 'Fight Club'.

in the quiet words of the virgin mary... come again,"Snatch has a convoluted and preposterous plot. It's also full of dreadful London gangster stereotypes. But this isn't going to be a negative review. In fact, Snatch is a hugely enjoyable film. It's very dynamic, and a marked improvement on Ritchie's previous Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, which certainly had its moments too. Snatch is full of memorable lines and great humor. The editing and direction keeps the film moving at a cracking pace, and there's always something happening so it never drags. It possesses a great soundtrack, and excellent performances from an eclectic selection of colorful characters: Alan Ford's 'Brick Top' has to be one of the most despicable yet highly amusing gangster characters ever to grace the silver screen. Worth noting too is the excellent presentation and content of the Region 1 DVD release.

The dialogue is terribly sub-Tarantino, the story messy and incoherent, the editing headache inducing and the acting is woeful for such a good cast. The film lacks any depth, not that it aims for any, and the humour that it tries to instill instead is puerile and based mostly around swearing. Having said that though, the film does have some merits.

Guy Ritchie's stylish and quirky gangster classic,"Known for his British gangster films, Guy Ritchie got people's attention with his directorial debut Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but it was with Snatch where he really made his mark.Snatch revolves around a priceless diamond that a Russian gangster, violent bookmakers, boxing promoters, incompetent robbers and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight for to get their hand on.This is a very fast-paced film that entertains all the way through. The film is very dialogue heavy and Guy Ritchie's script is an absolute winner. Whilst this is a gangster film, it mainly acts as a comedy and the script is filled with many hilarious situations and a great amount of jokes. The comedy works extremely well as I found myself laughing many times throughout. What also makes Snatch really fun are the characters. They all have a distinct quality to them that makes them memorable. The names Ritchie gave to these characters are very quirky and is another reason why they stand out. I love it when directors add their own unique voice to their films and Ritchie makes this film seem like only he could make it. Snatch is a very stylish flick filled with crazy camerawork and editing techniques. It brings a lot of energy to the film's world which matches the wild nature of its story.This entire ensemble cast put their best foot forward. Ritchie's writing was already sharp but the way each actor performed made it even better. Jason Statham and Stephen Graham are excellent together as Turkish and Tommy. The storyline with Robbie Gee and Lennie James as the robbers was extremely funny. Brad Pitt really stood here as the incomprehensible boxer Mickey and I liked how self-aware the film was with his character. Do make sure to turn on subtitles otherwise it can be very difficult to understand what Pitt says most of the time. Alan Ford, Vinnie Jones, Rade Serbedzija, Benicio del Toro, Ade and Dennis Farina were all incredible in their roles as well.Snatch is a Guy Ritchie classic and will forever be known as one of his best films to date. The insane story, the quirky characters and Ritchie's excellent writing make Snatch worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Does this film snatch your imagination or what?,"This is my first review on this website so bare with me! I was really excited about seeing this film as people had been telling me about it for years. I wasn't really sure what to expect at first, but it soon became clear that it was a fantastic film.The blackmail, the mindless violence, and of course, the cockney slang all made this movie a classic London gangster case. I thought that the camera shots all added to the live effect and made it all the more real.The storyline was fantastic, twisting and turning throughout the whole time. It never once bored me, and all the characters acted to the best the of their abilities, including the star of the show, Brad Pitt.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes London gangster flicks.

As funny as a film about murderous gangsters can be,"Boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) and his hapless buddy Tommy (Stephen Graham) get mixed up with London hard-cases, unkillable ex-KGB agents, incompetent thieves, cunning Pikeys, disreputable diamond merchants, and klepto-dogs in this high-speed, hilarious gangsta-comedy from Guy Richie. The script is full of rapid-fire patter and colourful Brit-slang, and the characters are unforgettable, especially (to name but a few) enforcer 'Bullet-tooth Tony' (Vinnie Jones), murderous pig-keeper Bricktop (Alan Ford), 'sneaky Russian' Boris-the-Blade (Rade Serbedzija), and Mickey, the nearly incomprehensible Gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion (a priceless Brad Pitt).

"See it on the biggest screen you can--this is about the ride, not the destination","Snatch (2000)Director Guy Ritchie is most famous as a filmmaker, and that says a lot, because he could have become known as Madonna's husband. And he survives (and thrives, commercially) on two knock out, inventive, slightly zany and slightly brilliant films, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" followed by this one. Both have a bigger than life, faster than life, slightly impossible feel that is something like Tarantino in ""Kill Bill"" or maybe Jarmusch in ""Ghost Dog.""""Snatch."" is the second of the two and is a bigger budget, more mainstream movie in some ways, and this might seem to be a good thing, though there are avid fans of his first film for its fresh intensity, for sure. ""Snatch"" is kept alive by the constant breaking of the time line, the really absurd and kinetic presence of Brad Pitt (who is brilliant), and the overall plot line(s) which are filled with twisted archetypes. It's also well constructed and filmed without becoming slick. But in the end, you'll find that the two movies are too similar to make sense in some ways. And both films have this sense of being actually about nothing, in the end. They are just wild rides.But such rides. Sometimes you just want to get in your car and drive and have things happen, and so they do here, and it's totally Fun. Fun capital F because in a way, why not make that the goal. Clearly there is no social message or deep psychology at work, which is just fine with me. And so you need to position yourself to float in this world, and see how richly constructed it is, you just watch and have things happen. On those terms it's remarkable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great!!!,"This is one of my favorite movies.It is directed by Guy Ritchie and stars many famous actors like Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro.

"Flashy commercial style, directing overshadows (flat) acting.","Watching this (often) fast paced movie, I got too much the impression that acting was being overshadowed by all these prominent smart-cuts, transitions from one scene to the next.  The only real joy to watch (acting-wise) was Brad Pitt, playing the gypsy boxer.  Benicio del Toro was a big disappointment as a leading cast for his mere cameo appearance, and a lousy one at that.Calling this movie innovative or ""highly original"" is giving way too little credit to earlier movies like Lola Rennt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A classic British gangster comedy.,"This classic British gangster comedy is just the type of film Quentin Tarantino might have made if he had been born and raised in London's East End but Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch"" is a lot funnier than anything Tarantino has given us and it's got one of the best casts, as well as one of the daftest, yet most original, plots of any 'heist' movie although any attempt at summing it up would be wasted.This is a movie that is best approached raw; just sit back and revel in Ritchie's quick-fire direction, his brilliant and, at times, incomprehensible dialogue and that terrific cast, (Brad Pitt, who may as well be speaking in tongues, might just be giving his best performance here). All you need to know is that involves a very large diamond, a lot of very incompetent gangsters, a load of gypsies, of whom Brad Pitt is one, and Benicio Del Toro as a gambler called Frankie Four Fingers. This is a movie you might even call obscenely enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Loved it,"I find it quite interesting how most critics poo pooed this movie while almost three quarters of a million people gave it a stellar 8.3 star rating.Now, what does it mean? Are people so superficial that they would like any kind of schlock? Or are the critics simply fully of it?You make the judgement. One of the critics said that Guy Ritchie was lacking talent, just like his wife. Seriously? Madonna has no talent? You may not be a fan but to say that she has no talent is just stupid. How about Michael Jackson or Prince? No talent either? Another critic said Sean Penn's movie are better then Guy Ritchie's. Well, that's like saying, I don't like strawberries but I like to drive fast cars. Ever hear of such thing as apples and oranges?I guess my judgement has been rendered on clueless people who dismissed this movie.Regarding the movie itself. It's one of my favorites. Guy Ritchie has his own style, like Quentin Tarantino or Wes Andersen or Jim Jarmusch. Granted, he is not exactly in the same league as those three, but his movies are fast paced, fun, quotable, and Snatch is my favorites. I loved everything about it. its quirkiness, and its funky characters, and its interesting story and the whole plethora of accents (love that word, plethora).My advice to people who haven't seen Snatch. Ignore the critics. Give it a try. You might discover that you love it just as much as I do. Worst case scenario, you might learn the meaning of the word ""nemesis"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Brad Pitt seems to be crossing his buff bod from FIGHT CLUB with his cheerful madman from 12 MONKEYS.

The 'professional' critics have NO clue ... Snatch is one of the Crime genre's greatest films ever produced,"The 55 metacritic score is an affront to the truth: Snatch is cinematic greatness, and it deserves a spot on the top shelf of any individual who considered themselves to be a genuine cinephile.The editing and camera work really elevate Snatch above Richie's other popular comedy-crime movies like Lock, Stock and Rocknrolla. But it's also the satirical spirit of Snatch that propels the narrative along at a pace and execution that turns the typical 'diamond-heist-gone-fubar' story into an unforgettable 100 minute black-comedy dive into London's criminal underworld.The intersecting story lines and screwball characters in serious situations gives Snatch an almost Tarantonian quality to the whole thing. Every character is memorable, from Pitt's indecipherable Mickey the Pikey lead down to the Gypsy dog who swallowed his chew toy whole and squeaks constantly when barking. Of particular note is Brick Top, who does a fantastic job at being a greasy, mean, nasty villainous S.O.B. that enjoys chopping up and feeding his competition to his pig farm swine--he makes it easy to hate him, and he does it perfectly.Snatch is one of the most rewatchable movies around. I've seen it a good 70 or so times since I bought it on DVD nearly 2 decades ago.If you like Tarantino movies, enjoyed Lock, Stock, or dig british/foreign crime film in general, you're going to be charmed by Guy Ritchie's masterpiece.

Snatch is the quintessential guy movie!,"Guy Ritchie has become a tour de force director. His gangster movies are guilty pleasures! I thoroughly enjoyed RocknRolla (and am hoping for a sequel) but Snatch was brilliant! Did Brad Pitt get any recognition for his performance? If not he certainly should have! I understand movies of that genre generally aren't considered for Oscar's but Brad's performance blew me away and he had me convinced he was indeed a 'Pikey'! Guy I love your Sherlock Holmes movies and no one has done them better but do not give up on the gangster genre because you seem to know it so well, any particular reason for that?

Classic Guy Ritchie,"The film is probably one of the most memorable pictures of the classic Guy Ritchie. The crazy development of the plot, the inimitable play of the actors, perfectly written dialogues and, of course, the recognizable style of the maestro in every frame. All this is a ""Big jackpot"".The movie from Richie, as always, starts with some fragments of certain destinies of the characters. Each storyline is replete with its memorable dialogues, the behavior of the characters, the distinctive features of these very heroes. Richie always keeps his finger on the pulse of what is happening in his project, noticing the necessary details that will definitely play a role in the development of the plot.There is no point in retelling the plot. You can get confused in the retelling, and you need to see such a picture yourself in order to feel the degree and nerve of the narrative with every cell, which is so characteristic of the works of the eminent British director.The master skillfully immerses his viewer in a unique story that seems unlikely to happen in reality. His characters are remembered, colliding with each other, attract attention to themselves, and the viewer necessarily gets into each of them.Richie manages to show the developing situation from the angle of unrealistic plot development. His ""wards"" necessarily face difficult circumstances that lead to unpredictable consequences.The cast is great. What is Brad Pitt worth in the role of a wild gypsy who talks surprisingly fast, often behaves in an inappropriate way. The transformation of the actor into Miki is simply baffling after having previously seen the actor in the image of Death in ""Meet Joe Black"". This is really a professional.Statham and Graham, Ford and Del Toro, Fleming and Farina - each of them is a true discovery and decoration of this work. The guys have created memorable images that you really believe in.Guy Ritchie's work deserves every praise and over the past couple of decades has become truly iconic. This is high-quality work: excellent script and production do their job. The film will give almost two hours of positive emotions thanks to the intricacy of destinies that the screen will show.An important component, in my opinion, is a high-quality and cheerful translation by Dmitry Puchkov Goblin. The work allows you to immerse yourself even better in the world of English bandits and feel the whole atmosphere of what is happening.I strongly advise you to view this picture. This is a real and classic project from Guy Ritchie. Excellent production, well-developed characters, great dialogues and necessarily high-quality humor, which you will definitely appreciate.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

20th Anniversary!,"Beware of anyone who owns a pig farm is good advice going into a Guy Ritchie film. Hungry pigs can crunch through a 200-pound body in about eight minutes is just one of the interesting pig related factual tidbits tossed out in the earlier scenes, and it isn't long into the film before the pigs get fed either. An underworld of dirty dealing Russians, New Yorkers, wild gypsies and other criminals and mobsters converges around a rigged boxing match and stolen diamond. There are plenty of itchy trigger fingers and hungry pigs to go around, and for every action there is a reaction.Totally deranged, wacky, hilarious and fun, Snatch is full of authentic, crooked characters. Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio del Toro and others bring them to life. The lines come fast and furious, and each one is worthwhile to appreciate and contemplate such as ""do you take sugar?!"" ""No, I am sweet enough already."" As dim-witted thugs bumble into circumstances beyond their control and even seasoned pros commit unexpected mistakes, Snatch keeps you guessing at every moment and on the edge of your seat.

"Over the top, pretentious and generally bad","What a complete waste of time. Reminded me of Tarantino films (Death Proof, Dusk to Dawn, Kill Bill) etc.: sick and horribly overrated.I just don't understand why anyone would like this type of film. It is gratuitously violent, extremely foul-mouthed, totally unrealistic, you can not understand much of the dialog, has a stupid story line, etc.This type of film (add Goodfellows, etc.) appeals mostly, but not exclusively, to immature young men who most likely suffer from sexual dysfunction and the ""tyranny of being cool."" This film's plot is nonsense and not at all funny; the only smile that one may get is from their cutesy names. The characters are overdrawn and not even interesting enough to be pathetic. The viewer has no sympathy for any of the characters because they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Chewbacca is more interesting than anyone in this film.Rating this in the top 2,000 would be inexplicable, let alone in the top 200. This shouldn't surprise me; IMDb users put Pulp Fiction in the top 10 and Scarface in the top 200; I wouldn't put any of these films in the top 1,000.

The story, or should I say stories, are connected through many twist and turns ranging from the violent to the funny.

Guy Ritchie is one of the most underrated directors of our time!,"To simply put it, this is my Generations Pulp Fiction. With that being said I know there are people on IMDb who would disagree but that's just because this movie is not meant to be taken too seriously. Just like Tarantino, this movie is heavily character driven which is anchored on very clever set ups. The only deference is that the story for the most part is told in a linear fashion and it also happens to be much more lighthearted considering all of the violence. If you are a fan of knuckle headed crime dramas that are filled with over the top exaggerated characters, than this movie is for you. It has action, well fleshed out characters, hilarious dialogue, and a very intriguing premise that once you start watching, you can't help but want to know the films final outcome.

Two minutes Turkish!,"This movie is so good it hurts. Literally. When you're laughing so much that you can't breathe- but not during the movie, although it is funny then, but when you're quoting it to death with your friends afterwards. Because that's the sort of movie this is; the kind of movie with awesome one-liners that you will quote for the rest of your life; the kind of movie with a killer cast that surprises you repeatedly with it's compatibility; the kind of movie with the no-holds- barred style of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels combined with the fast-paced, twisted action of I don't know what. Each separate inter-weaving string could almost be a tale on its own, but is so much better when weaved together. And best of all, it's the kind of hard, rough n tumble, non-pretentious cinema that I love and that most directors would do a good turn watching.

Communication Breakdown,"It's too bad I was feeling like a space cadette from bronchitis when I saw Snatch because I missed a few of the key jokes (or maybe it was due to the variety of british accents). At least I was consistently stunned visually. I have to hand it to Guy Ritchie for putting together a story that is completely discombobulated in its presentation and yet comes full circle. Not to mention that this is twice in a row that he's put together a good movie (keep in mind that not everyone likes a fast cut, semi nautious approach to film making). The story of a jewelry heist is classic, but the characters set this one apart (just take a look at their names and you'll understand what I mean). The casting was great; a subtle blend of big names and not so big names, each performance outdoing the other (and keep in mind that this is a comedy). It's hard to pick a favorite character, but I  make it a tie between Turkish (our friendly narrator) and One Punch Mickey O'Neil (the gypsy boxer played by Brad Pitt, who mind you is excellent although incomprehensible at times). I definitively recommend this movie to people who enjoyed Ritchie's last movie, but you'll probably need to see it twice if you want to understand everything that's said.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

And if you didnt like this movie you havent seen it ""enough"". If it didnt make sense, go back and watch it a second and third time. And rather than trying to compare this work with Tarantino, etc. take some time to contrast the characters at work here. The mad logic of the ""unhinged"" Bricktop played by Alan Ford vs. the subtle cool of Turkish, played brilliantly by Jason Stratham, a former real life street con(see opening scene in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""). The ruthless machinations of Boris the Blade vs. Bullet Tooth Tony's cold blooded efficiency. And of course Brad Pitt as the leader of a pack of roving gypsies is the highlight of the film.

A Cinematic Rollercoaster of Crime and Comedy,"Released in 2000, ""Snatch"" is a British crime comedy film directed by Guy Ritchie. Known for its fast-paced narrative, eccentric characters, and witty dialogue, the movie has become a cult classic in the crime genre. Ritchie, who previously gained acclaim for ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998), once again delivers a unique cinematic experience that blends humor, violence, and intricate storytelling.The film's title, ""Snatch,"" is a slang term for stealing or grabbing something quickly, and this perfectly encapsulates the essence of the plot. At its core, the movie revolves around the chaotic pursuit of a stolen diamond and the intersecting lives of various characters in the criminal underworld.One of the standout features of ""Snatch"" is its ensemble cast, featuring memorable performances from Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio del Toro, and Dennis Farina, among others. Each character is distinct, adding layers to the intricate narrative. Statham, in particular, shines as Turkish, a small-time boxing promoter caught up in a web of crime and chaos. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Mickey, a bare-knuckle boxer with a penchant for unintelligible speech, adds both humor and unpredictability to the mix.The narrative structure of ""Snatch"" is non-linear, with multiple storylines weaving in and out of each other. This approach keeps the audience engaged and adds an element of surprise, as seemingly unrelated events eventually converge in unexpected ways. The film's brisk pacing, coupled with Ritchie's signature visual style and sharp editing, contributes to a sense of urgency and excitement.The dialogue in ""Snatch"" is another highlight, characterized by its sharp wit and dark humor. Ritchie's script is filled with memorable one-liners and exchanges that contribute to the film's distinctive tone. The colloquial language and slang used by the characters, often accompanied by subtitles for Pitt's character, further enhance the film's authenticity and humor.Visually, ""Snatch"" is a feast for the eyes. Ritchie employs dynamic camera work, stylized editing, and a vibrant color palette to create a visually compelling experience. The film's soundtrack, featuring a mix of rock, hip-hop, and electronic music, complements the on-screen action and adds to the overall energy of the film.While ""Snatch"" is undoubtedly entertaining, it is not without its critics. Some argue that the film's reliance on stylized violence and eccentric characters may overshadow the depth of its storytelling. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of the narrative may leave some viewers struggling to keep up with the intricacies of the plot.In conclusion, ""Snatch"" is a bold and exhilarating cinematic ride that showcases Guy Ritchie's distinct directorial style. With its memorable characters, clever dialogue, and non-linear storytelling, the film stands out as a gem in the crime comedy genre. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its frenetic pace, for those who appreciate a unique blend of crime and humor, ""Snatch"" remains a classic that continues to captivate audiences even years after its release.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Strange poetry,"A lot of people are going to like this film for a lot of different and overlapping reasons, which is a dandy recommendation for any film.  Then again, a lot of people are going to pass on it because it seems to deviate from storytelling, which it does.  This is entertainment, like at a carnival; every corner you turn is something different but when you get ready to leave you look back and see it was all one thing.  Dark comedy, tragedy, people you don't necessarily care about but become seriously curious about.  The poetry is in the way the story is told; it plays with time but it plays with time in an ironic and thematic way.  The poetry is in the story, poetry as old as storytelling because in a nutshell it is about a really bad deed getting what it deserves, the tale just veers and twists and dances on the way to justice.  The poetry is in the visuals, in scenes that follow the plot and in scenes that own themselves, like out takes.  I'm not a huge fan of Brad Pitt's though I think he's navigating that line between good and great, but in this film he gathered me up and made me his buddy.  I just sat down with him in this and liked his character the way I like an outcast cousin.  Guy Ritchie did good.  I've heard it said that if a film has three really good scenes, then it was a success.  This film has three great scenes of irony, three great scenes of melodrama, three great scenes of humor, three great visual scenes ... don't watch this film with expectations.  Just put on your seatbelt, settle back and enjoy a near miss with greatness.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch,Clever comedy about boxing promoters and unscrupulous henchmen. Not a dull moment but kind of off the wall criminal humor,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This game of chess has a lot of moving pieces,"This movie is fast paced and jumps as soon as a scenario has told it's story. Stathams narration is soothing and complementary to Ritchie's directing style. You have a variety of camera angles as well as characters but in the background you have a monotone Statham fleshing out the film with English context. It's ironic that you have narration so the story could be precisely told while in the same movie one of the protagonists is a Pickeys who is characterised with his incomprehensible speech.The movie is quite easy to follow and their is enough context provided to prevent you from getting lost and overwhelmed but the dialogue is quick and although story beats are emphasised and repeated, the humour can fly over your head. In particular I'm referring to the many English phrases that might take a second viewing to catch as you're familiar with the story.Brad Pitt steals every scene he is in. All the other characters are enjoyable as well with each having a clever nickname to make them memorable. In this short film no time is wasted, a quick introduction and conclusion allows for a dense middle act with plenty of schniangins that tie together seemlessly. The soundtrack is energising, matching the pace of the movie.The only issue that prevents this film from being elevated slightly is that with its short runtime there was an opportunity to make the conclusion more impactful that what it is. Everything is tied together neatly and the suspense is lifted early. There was great tension after the climax but rather than linger in it there is a quick resolution without any form of consequence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guy Ritchie at his worst,"Mind you, I didn't hate this movie completely. There actually are some fun parts and a great performance by Brad Pitt.

too smart for its own sake,"Same as with Lock, Stock and whatever, really. Guy Ritchie, an o.k. director at best, should pick a decent screenwriter for his next project to tone things down a bit.

Being rude and spouting profanities doesn't make it funny in itself, although Roy 'Chubby' Brown would disagree on that one.The British think they have a Tarantino on their hands, but that just proves a cliche about the British and their tendency of overrating themselves.Horrible stuff, watch Pulp Fiction instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Sometimes over-the-top, but generally entertaining","This film starts out, after a brief stylish introduction, with a TV-like introduction sequence that lists all the characters by their nickname in flashy stylish manner and for much of the film, keeps with its flash. But for all of its fast-cutting, special-effect-happy direction and montage, there's still a decent semi-comedic caper film in there at the same time and that keeps Snatch from falling into the pit of being all looks and no substance.Most of the characters are really one note, which is fine because the cast is enormous. The humor is very British (not surprisingly) but also broad enough that most audiences should be able to pick it up. As for the story, it's basically a story about dumb luck and a lot of it during a series on crimes that all lead to people dying, winning or losing, whether by fortune, misfortune, or in some cases, actual planning. The worst of the baddies get their due. The least bad of the baddies, sometimes get away, like in all straight caper films.The over-the-top style of the film is a little distracting at times and I often wanted writer-director Guy Ritchie to settle down at times because it was detracting from my ability to coherently follow the story, but sometimes the inserts, cuts and camera tricks added value to the humor and the situations (my favorite being the Franky Four Fingers still inserts). Being the only Ritchie film I've seen, I don't have much to compare it to, but I'm hoping that he's learned more discipline in knowing when to apply his tricks and when to hold back and let his writing do the work.It's not a very complicated film, but it does its job well as a fun caper film and it doesn't really aim to be a whole lot more than that. So I say it's an enjoyable way to spend an evening. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Another dose of Diet Tarantino,"""Snatch"" is really just the same as ""Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", only here, the clever dialogues are replaced by f-words. If I want to hear the f-word 153 times, I'll just call a Detroit tech support. So once again, a bunch of criminals get themselves into the most standard situations available, like being in debt with Harry the Hatchet uhm, Brick Top, stealing diamonds (where would he get that from?), betting on illegal boxing matches etc. It's pretty obvious the only crime Guy Ritchie has ever witnessed is when Madonna gets her pay. Obviously, everybody needs nicknames again, Boris the Blade (he has nothing to do with blades but hey, it's an alliteration), Frankie Four Fingers, Doug The Head, you get how it works by now. Obviously the movie is still quite good because it's so like Tarantino that you can't help enjoying yourself and I suppose it's Guy Ritchie's specialty (I'm not saying it's great, I'm saying I've seen ""Swept Away""). But to put this with the 250 best of all time, let's get real.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" Revisited","In 1998, when ""Lock, Stock..."" came out, Ritchie was relatively unknown, and that was part of the charm of the movie.  The comedy was refreshing, evenso with visual effects and story teller tricks;  the great surprise was the ""everyone""-finale.  The movie was an alternative and commercial hit, which is not an everyday achievement.  The conception of ""Snatch"", however, cannot be driven by anything different from commercialism: it is an exact copy of ""Lock, Stock...""; Ritchie didn't even try to hide it.  Plot, characters and effects are exactly alike - to give an example, the only change made to Vinnie Jones' character in ""Lock, Stock..."" is the name.  What makes it even worse, is that Ritchie needs visually not entertaining features (stills, name-tags, arrows) to tell his story.  Two highlights, however, are the performances of Alan Ford and Mike Reid: as evil as can be, and therefore entertaining.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch me a Pulp movie,"A new bread of films are out and yes Guy Riche is posing Tarantino with His lock stock movies. drama+comedy+crime+noir = Pulp...

Dont kid me wrong this is an acceptionaly good piece of junk- one of the most beutifull trash piles ever compiled by an englishman (honestly the best thing thats come out of England since the 60's). Snatch Adds crazy camera angles, Bizzare cinematography, Frame hopping, and twists and turns that will leave a viewer with his head up his ass.

This is not as good as its brother (Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels) but is alot funnier. Magnificent Directing By Riche and even better acting by the cast members.

A Diamond In the Rough,"""Snatch"" has proven director Guy Ritchie to be the British Quentin Tarantino.  This movie is bloody and violent, but still funny and exciting. I loved Brad Pitt as One-Punch Mickey, the mush-mouthed Irish gypsy.  Other enjoyable characters are Sol, Vinnie and Tyrone, the hapless pawn shop gangsters, Avi, the brash New York diamond merchant, and Brick Top, the baddest movie villain as ever tossed an unlucky soul to the pigs.

"Brazen, unadulterated cockney crime madness","The brilliance of ""Snatch"" is its pure mayhem.No sentence is wasted, threat without menace, or decision without consequences. The ragtag cast of misfits, elite thieves, mercenary thugs and illegitimate jewellers all connect via a web of misdeeds and criminal activity, allowing the story to expertly weave several stories together over the course of under 2 hours. Narrated by the pseudo-lead character, a boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham), the progress of a large diamond robbery is charted throughout the bowels of London, causing a chain-reaction of events to shake the crime world.The cast is exemplary: Statham, Vinnie Jones and Benicio del Toro all play central roles, and Brad Pitt even requested a part in the film, such is his admiration for Guy Ritchie's work. Bright characters populate the world, giving each actor more scope to really embody their roles. The quickness of the script makes every interaction biting and aggressive, with the potential for a fight to break out any second. Guy Ritchie's personal cinematic tropes are also on full display: quick-cuts, split screen frames and tracking shots are all used to maximum effectiveness, enhancing the quirkiness of every scene.The story almost becomes a subsection of the film - the novelty of the experience itself and the crass British humour really makes ""Snatch"" special, with a well-written script merely promoting its excellence. This film also has a degree of rewatchability that most films of the genre would lose - especially in a comedic sense. ""Snatch"" is unapologetic in its execution, and well worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brilliance amidst a sea of flotsam.,"There have been a small handfull of watchable films in the past twelve months.

"""It's not too subtle, but effective""","Guy Ritchie is not a satisfying writer-director and nor do I ever think he will be. The cocksure, pop video excesses and smart-arsed, stilted, would-be clever dialogue is the same as ever in Snatch, a mite better than ""Lock, Stock..."" but still a clear ""5"".Snatch, the smug, self-satisfied title, is, as well as a word for stealing; also a slang term for the female member, a point that I doubt was lost on the producers. Rather appropriately then, this is a male-dominated film, with women having no role (apart from the wooden-as-a-crate twin daughters of ""Tony the Head"") except to bare their breasts. This laddish, sixth-form sexism goes hand-in-hand with the usual sub-racism and homophobia that punctuates a Ritchie endeavour.In many ways this is worse than the comparatively laid-back Barrels, as its clumsy post-modernism is even more apparent: a quote from Pulp Fiction is used, the Michael Caine homage is more heart-felt, and Reservoir Dogs is referenced even before the close of the beginning titles.The contrived plot and action-led pace are, however, thrown together with such veracity that, like Lock, Stock..., it is readily watchable, if not actually any good. For a first time viewing, at any rate. What crushes it is Ritchie's need to make every line a ""funny"" line, which takes away all sense of reality. Look at the scene where a betting shop assistant is held at gunpoint, refusing to hand over money, and being told: ""I ain't f****** buying that!"" ""Well,"" she replies, a tad unrealistically as she's under threat of death, ""that's fine, cos I ain't f****** selling it."" You suspect that if Ritchie had the guts to make a serious, sincere UK gangster movie then it would be more bearable, rather than one which gorges on the rotting carcasses of superior stablemates.Where the film crucially falls down is in it's casting. How so many bad actors could be in one movie is staggering. What is worse, the few that do give a decent performance are given minimal roles, or roles that make the least of their talents, with a ""was he actually in the film?"" appearance from Trainspotting's Ewan Bremner. Alan Ford is okay as Brick Top, though others – most notably Ade in his movie debut – are awful, though doubtlessly hindered by the weak script. Mike Read appears as Tony the Head (which sounds less like a gangster, more the male equivalent of Linda Lovelace), though is wasted by being reduced to a cursory cameo role. He doesn't even get to say ""wot are yer, some kind o' pilchard?""The other two decent performances come from Brad Pitt, and, surprisingly, Vinnie Jones. After humiliating himself with a lame turn in Gone In Sixty Seconds, he does better here than most of the ""professionals"" with him; even though when he uses big words, you doubt if he knows what they really mean. Brad is, of course, the main appeal, almost unrecognisable as a tattooed, nonsense-Irish speaking bare-knuckle fist fighter. When he's on the screen, it almost lights up, only to darken again when he leaves it. Not a wholly successful addition, the standard of his acting and obvious presence make you think he's in a different film to most of the third-rates walking around pretending to be Bob Hoskins. Yet it is clear Brad loved his role in a low-budget Brit movie, and even appears to ad-lib his obscenity to an over-zealous dog. (Also look out for the hastily cut scene where Vinnie starts to crack up as another dog gets carried away and attacks an actor he wasn't supposed to). There are precisely three laughs in the movie, all of which are unintentional. The first two I've just detailed, the last sees dance artist Goldie indulging in some attempted thesping. ""Stick to being a gangster, Lee, leave this game to me and Sol,"" he is told by Robbie Gee.One last moan? The self-consciously cool music score (soundtrack already available in stores), which, idiotically, has no relevance or association with what's on screen; be it The Stranglers' ""Golden Brown"" being set, for no reason other than it's a good song, to a bout, or ""Ghost Town"", The Specials' satire of my home town, being commercialised and stripped down to gain brownie points from muso-nostalgists.This is a film that will be lauded by Loaded readers, a lazy retread of a weak first film that largely wastes its resources. The picture concludes with Huey ""Piano"" Smith singing ""ha, ha, ha, ha"" through the end credits. Good luck to you, Huey – you're the only one laughing.POST SCRIPT - September 2015. I can only conclude that I was in an incredibly bad mood when I wrote this somewhat churlish review 15 years ago. Yes, Snatch isn't especially deep, but it's very entertaining, something only highlighted further by the existence of the YouTube spoof ""Snatch Wars"" in the interim. There's a lot I didn't mention in the review above, such as the inspired metaphorical underwater sequence, and the performances, in hindsight, seem a tenfold better than I gave them credit for. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Thrilling crime drama that does Britain justice,"Thugs, smugglers, thieves and Gypsies all become involved in a diamond smuggling case.British cinema. Sharp, issue driven and entertaining. Fact. So how does Snatch rank compared to all the greats surrounding it? Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, The Italian Job, Kidulthood and the Bond franchise are all memorable British crime hits that tell crime as it is with that cutting edge representation of the difficult British culture. Snatch is arguably one of the finest Brit Crime films eve created and with some thrilling performances and direction, it can sit highly among the British kings of cinema.Guy Ritchie takes that sharp format of dangerous gangster life and puts a riveting spin on it with some flowing and surprising direction. The opening montage with Jason Statham's narration is excellent as the camera zooms all over the scene and changes on a consistent basis without the viewer knowing what is really going on, which makes it almost humorous. Very artistic and almost simple, the direction is a consistent device that is properly used to tell a sharp story about diamond smuggling.Encoded with too many characters to count, Snatch gives an intellectual look upon the British underground business. Written by Ritchie, we see his thoughts acclimate through diamond smuggling, unnoticeable boxing matches and a bizarre concept of murder (you will never look at pigs the same again). British cinema is all about issues as American cinema often shies away from being too in your face whereas Brits don't care and just do it, which is exactly what you want. Despite these heavy concepts of real life, this 2000 hit is often funny. Black comedy is often a questionable device in crime cinema particularly when it doesn't work (such as in Kidulthood) but all hail Ritchie who hits it spot on.Plenty of blood, plenty of swearing this is a proper gangster film which isn't quite as sharp and understandable as Pulp Fiction but contains enough entertainment to be looked at in the same way.Good performances all round particularly by Brad Pitt who seems to be able to play anything or anyone.Snatch is all about the complicated story and where it isn't too clear as to what happens come the conclusion, it is evident that when you re-watch it again and again, you will always pick up more laughs, more thrills and learn something new.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

You'll get lost in this movie,"Movies like Pulp Fiction make you forget you are watching a film and make you feel as though you are seeing real, albeit strange, but nonetheless real characters at work.  Snatch does that as well.  Most of us have very different lives.  We all punch the clock, go to work, play with the dog, watch sports and whatever else it is that we do during our day.  But in Guy Ritchie's labrynthian like tail, no one is normal.  No one does things that the rest of us would do.  They are all bound by the Tarantinoesque laws of fiction.  And those laws dictate that if there is trouble to find, they find it and if there is a situation that calls for impropriety, it is here, in this film.Snatch is a lot of fun.  When you inhabit a world that shares it's space with guys like Bullet Tooth Tony, Doug The Head, One Punch Mickey, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris The Blade, Turkish, Brick Top and Cousin Avi, you can't help but to have fun.  The story is quite complicated and by the time you figure out exactly what is going on, a different angle to the story is introduced.  But in some way or another, every member of this story is involved in one way or another, with a diamond that has 84 carats to it. Frankie Four Fingers steals it, Boris the Blade wants it, so does cousin Avi as does does Bullet Tooth Tony.  Turkish gets messed up in it somehow and then so does BrickTop, which brings in One Punch Mickey.  Confused, you ain't seen nothing yet.What it comes down to though is that you don't really have to know exactly who fits where in the story.  I stopped keeping track of everyones importance about a third of the way through the film.  I was having too much fun.  Once again we are treated to Benetio Del Toro's mastery of accents as this time he brandishes a Turkish/Russian/Arabian accent.  The man really is the best actor out there today.  Too bad he dies early in the film, I would have liked to see more of him. Then we are introduced to Brad Pitt and he has a ""whoknowswhatkindof"" accent.  As they say in the film, it is not Irish, not English, just Pygmie.  Half the time you have no idea what he saying and the other half you are just barely making it out.  But he is incredibly humourous and when he is hard to understand is some of the best humour in the film.  Brad Pitt is one hell of an under rated actor but with films like this, he is sure to get a little recognition.Snatch is violent and it is mean but it does it so stylishly that it becomes fun.  I think this is a Pulp Fiction like clone.  It is not as good, nothing ever will be, but it is a worthy imitator.  Having fun at the movies is what being there is all about.  Snatch never forgets that.9 out of 10- One of the films that will probably make my ten best at the end of 2001.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Snatching at straws.,"Possibly the most loathsome film that I have ever had the misfortune of encountering. The script a joke, the direction a joke, the story a joke, characters a joke. Not a joke in the ha ha sense but in the sense that you wish you had more than popcorn to throw at the screen.The main problem with this picture is that it is trying to be something which it is not. A - it tries t be humorous B - it tries to be original and C - it tries to be that great white elephant, cool. Possibly if one hadn't seen Lock Stock... this would have passed the time with a slight modicum of enjoyment. But no, we get a rehashed, regurgitated, reject. The witty raconteur between characters in the ""Bleedin' barrel o' cockney monkeys"" (to quote the Fast Show) style becomes irksome and boring after about five minutes.

I'll try and explain. 1) Cut from previous scene. 2) Loud music with heavy beat. 3) Man/ woman walking. 4) Said man/ woman stops walking. 5) Said man/ woman says something witty to other character. 6) Other character retorts with something equally witty. 7) Cut to next scene and repeat.When I watch wrestling I may enjoy this style, but I would rather wrestle a bear with an eating disorder than watch this drivel again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch,"A ""pikey"", or piker as it sounds coming from the mouth of Jason Statham's character Turkish, is a slang term for an Irish Gypsy. Brad Pitt plays the role of Mickey the leader of the pikey's who are a drunken crew of trailer dwellers with a love for fighting and dogs (degs). Pitt's character is a bare-knuckle boxer with a reputation for one-hit knockouts. Between drug-dealers, thieves, fighters, and boxing promoters and even hit men, there are countless entertaining characters to watch play out the true theme of the movie which is the fight for a priceless diamond, it ends very well and is definitely worth the watch. One of my personal all time favorite movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""You should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity.""","Guy Ritchie executed the unique style of the movie to perfection. The cinematography and the editing stayed consistent throughout and you could feel right away that this was going to be a special movie.So funny too, every joke lands.Cast was excellent, Brad Pitt's Irish accent was insanely good, perhaps my favourite member of the cast, but the likes of Jason Statham, Stephen Graham, Vinnie Jones, and many more were fantastic in their roles.The intertwining stories were magnificent, albeit a little difficult to understand.I'm giving this a 8 because it just didn't feel like a 9 or 10 out of 10 movie, but then again I was extremely tired during the latter half so I struggled to pay as much attention in those moments. I will definitely have to give this a rewatch one day but what I can say is that this film impressed me a lot and I ultimately really enjoyed it. I can't actually think of much of a flaw, my rating is purely out of gut feeling.But yeah, I would definitely encourage you to check this out if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Ritchie and Vaughn's Seedy Second Effort Puts the Spirit of the Late '90s in a Bottle,"Certain films innately embody the spirit and flair of a particular point in time. In Snatch's case, the essence of the late '90s is laced into its DNA. From the groovy, thumping soundtrack to the flashy, in-your-face visual motifs; the grimy criminal subject matter to the extreme sports-inspired camerawork, it boasts an impressive collection of very specific, time-sensitive pop culture calling cards. Watching this now, almost a quarter-century later, is like cracking open a time capsule. Imagine Pulp Fiction as produced by MTV.Motivated the ultimate MacGuffin, a diamond the size of a cueball, the plot follows a number of desperate London criminals as they conspire and connive to pull one over on their rivals and reap the riches. We've got high-profile mob bosses and blue collar boxing promoters, ex-KGB agents and common street thugs, each armed with their own peculiar bag of quirks and colorful idiosyncrasies. Though most parties are unaware of the others, their paths constantly interlace and overlap, and the whole mess eventually falls together in a great dogpile during the final act's frantic, crowded, hilarious payoff sequence.Snatch is an essentially dark comedy, stuffed with all manner of eccentric lowlifes, surprise twists and grim, ironic punchlines. It is a Guy Ritchie / Matthew Vaughn joint, after all, and following hot on the heels of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, their successful debut, it punches a number of the same buttons. Reuses many actors, too, with Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones the most recognizable of the bunch. It's newcomer Brad Pitt who steals the show, however, in his spectacular turn as an unintelligible, tattooed, caravan-dwelling boxer. His whole community is a riot, in fact, a tight group of lawless drunkards who honor no set of rules. Their unpredictability is just the fuel this film needed to bump its fire from a small blaze into a lofty inferno. Is it dated? Sure. Is it still entertaining? Yeah, that too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Fast paced and sometimes ridiculous events strung together with seemingly natural developments,"Lock, Stock ... and Snatch - these two masterpieces of Guy Ritchie have a common format: fast paced and sometimes ridiculous events strung together with seemingly natural developments. Both of these movies tend to explore the London underworld and they have made me believe that this underworld is really small - any action taken by any goon affects the whole scheme of things. With a plethora of characters, Guy Ritchie spins such a web of events that beyond a point of time, I stopped trying to remember the origin of any development and just soaked in the fast paced beauty of the current sequence - whether it is (black) comedy or gore or a music video on techno-beats. These movies have a very cynical tone - things never go the way they should, or, more correctly, the way the characters would like them to go. The resulting despair leads to more things going wrong until the whole mess of characters clears up with the help of enough bloodshed. Whether it is a squeaky ball eaten up by a mobster's dog resulting in a squeak whenever the dog tries to bark (Snatch) or a gangster making a totally one-sided deal with two street smart goons to steal antique guns (Lock, Stock .) or a self-confident pea-brained monster of a goon beaten up to death by a small gypsy (Snatch) or a whole gang of mobsters annihilated by a victim's drugged girlfriend who stumbles upon a machinegun (Lock, Stock .), the dry and dark humor inherent in almost every sequence makes these movies very different and interesting.Both the movies have mostly British and talented ensemble of actors. Direction, film editing and presentation are very music-video-ish at times and that adds to the chic and youth nature of the movies.These movies are recommended for those who a) want to indulge themselves with fast paced, dry and bloody comedy, or b) want to learns the tricks of the trade of London underworld",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Diamonds Are Composed Of Carbon.....,"....so it`s fitting that a film that centers around the theft of a diamond is a carbon copy of Guy Ritchie`s debut hit LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS . We have the same basic plot featuring much of the same cast playing the same characters directed in the same style as LSATSB. The only real difference is SNATCH has one eye on the American market with the casting of Benicio Del Toro , Dennis Farina and more importantly Brad Pitt. I can`t help noticing SNATCH has made a bigger impact on the American reviewers than LSATSB. Perhaps it`s more to do with the fact they saw SNATCH first rather than the American cast ?I had high hopes for Ritchie after seeing LSATSB but there`s rumours his next film SWEPT AWAY will be released straight to video and there`s also rumours Ritchie`s next project will be another gangster film . Come on Guy show us you`re not a one trick pony , if you need any advice on how to reinvent yourself ask your wife",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Wonderfully Written, Superbly Acted","Ever since the first time I saw the trailer for ""Snatch"", I was intrigued. It looked witty, fast, and very entertaining.  When I finally saw the film, that's exactly what I got; I was hit in the face with a 400lb gorilla of wildly entertaining fun right from the start.Brad Pitt's character, Micky, is extremely well written and very well played.  Dennis Farina hasn't been this good in years; it was like the part of Avi was written just for him.  This may sound a bit on the wild side, but the dog's scenes were some of the best in the film.  It's almost as if he had a humans brain, and could take acting cues right along with the rest of the cast.Richie has managed to balance the entire cast nearly perfectly; no one character dominates the screen.  This is evident even in the plot(or should I say plots).  Many times when a film tries to balance two plots, there's always one that stands out in your mind.  This isn't the case with ""Snatch"". The main plot and sub-plot mesh together perfectly, without one overpowering the other.It's not the greatest film to ever grace the big screen, but with the superb writing, the monstrous acting, and the fast-paced flow, ""Snatch"" will be one of the year's big hits.   I loved it. :)9/10-Khabal",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A daily comment from Midget Emma: Snatch (2000),"This movie has a lot of things. Action,Comedy,drama,Brad Pitt as an Irish boxer and a massive diamond. It was great.

Brad Pitt was great as the Irish boxer who no one can understand. Vinnie Jones plays a great gangster but i didn't like how his character was wrapped up at the very end of the movie. Dennis Farina(who i know from law & order)was very surprising. This has to be my favorite Jason Statham performance.As this is a gangster movie there is violence in this.

A Diamond in the Rough,"Snatch is a brilliant and wildly entertaining film, a masterclass in British crime comedy. Directed by Guy Ritchie and released in 2000, it weaves a chaotic web of interconnected stories, each bursting with eccentric characters, razor-sharp dialogue, and a uniquely stylish flair that is unmistakably Ritchie.The plot centres on the theft of a priceless diamond and the chaos that follows as it passes through the hands of various criminal factions. At the same time, a parallel storyline unfolds, following the misadventures of boxing promoters Turkish (Jason Statham) and his hapless partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) as they become entangled with a ruthless gangster, Brick Top (Alan Ford).The ensemble cast is exceptional, with each actor bringing their character to life with remarkable energy. Jason Statham is effortlessly cool as the calm, exasperated Turkish, while Brad Pitt delivers a standout performance as Mickey O'Neil, a fast-talking, unpredictable Irish Traveller with a flair for bare-knuckle boxing. Pitt's portrayal is both hilarious and captivating, his nearly indecipherable accent adding an extra layer of charm and intrigue.Ritchie's direction is impeccable, combining quick cuts, creative camera angles, and a non-linear narrative structure that keeps the audience engaged and on edge. The film's dark humour and clever dialogue are delivered with pitch-perfect timing, making every scene memorable. The intertwining storylines build to a chaotic and highly satisfying conclusion, showcasing Ritchie's knack for complex storytelling.The soundtrack of Snatch is equally iconic, featuring an eclectic mix of tracks that complement the gritty and energetic tone of the film. Songs like The Stranglers' Golden Brown and Massive Attack's Angel add to the unique atmosphere and style that permeates the film.What truly sets Snatch apart is its ability to balance comedy and tension, creating a world that feels absurdly funny yet genuinely dangerous. The richly drawn characters, snappy dialogue, and fast-paced storytelling ensure that the film remains compelling from start to finish.In conclusion, Snatch is a masterpiece of British cinema, blending crime, comedy, and style into an unforgettable package. With brilliant performances, a clever script, and a distinctive aesthetic, it stands as one of Guy Ritchie's finest works. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates sharp, stylish, and endlessly entertaining films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Well made street movie,London underworld is featured in this well directed movie which is a classic due to it's uncompromising style and great performances.Not as good as PULP FICTION yet can be said to be on it's level in quality.For it's genre it is great.The only nitpicking that can be done about it is the complicated and unlikely plot which can be hard to follow due to the unapologetic and energetic pace of the film.It may take a second viewing to really follow the specifics of the story although the film can still be very well enjoyed without really knowing exactly what is going on and that is what the director intended.One with a good sense of humour will find themselves laughing without having the exact specifics of the story and characters.A general idea of the plot is more than enough for the viewer to have a ball watching the film as long as the genre is appreciated.That is the magic of this films style.Pitt was incredible.He ruly has my big respect now in seeing his performnce in this film.He may be the next James Dean if he keeps it up.Only for fans of action and gangster films........,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Diverting,"In spite of appropriating both the essence and part of the story of `The Watch' section of `Pulp Fiction', this is a pleasant, though violent, diversion, fast-paced and filled with a large ensemble of memorable characters with lots of juicy lines to say. The writer/director, Guy Ritchie, doesn't seem interested in much more than showing what he's learned from watching Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese and providing a rip-roaring good time; the actors seem to be having fun as well. It's a crime comedy about a large diamond that gets passed around the underworld boxing scene in London and although the dialogue is mostly delivered with thick Cockney accents, the injection of a sizable Hollywood contingent (including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and, as a gypsy with unintelligible diction, Brad Pitt) as well as the directorial influence gives the film a decidedly American feel.

More of the same.,"Let me preface this by saying that I very much dislike Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. (If you liked that, you'll probably like this.) I say the same thing for this new piece of drivel by Ritchie. Why? How could I dislike such a riveting piece of modern cinema by such a visionary young director? Oh, come on.... There isn't that much to like here. The style is more of the same - stealing, as I've said before, from the likes of Trainspotting and Tarantino (with Scorsese added in here for good measure?). This is not creative stuff. He takes what they've done and churns out a completely shallow, worthless rendition of it, creating what so many people in this post-Tarantino era do: this brand of ""hip,"" violent cinema, with the aloof, jaded humor about the whole thing. What is lacking is any sort of redemptive value at all; there is no depth, no character (people seem to love the characters in this; they're all more of character sketches, of violent criminals at that), and really there is little here that could be called a human emotion. If not substance, then what? The humor is generally lacking and low brow, attempting to get laughs off the most base, disgusting things. The entire content of this film is like staring into a toilet really... Don't misunderstand me. I'm really not just a huge prude - afterall, I like the aforementioned film and directors. I simply feel that there should be something in all of this nonsense which makes it worth my while. There isn't... This is empty virtuosity (where it is even that). Unlike someone like Scorsese, Ritchie will make us bask in filth with no payback; instead, it may glorify it and is rather like watching a kid play with a new toy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The plot is convoluted and intriguing. There are two issues: a huge diamond and boxing match that needs fixing. Sometimes when so many cooks are involved, the broth gets pretty strange. These guys are all at the top of their games, each looking over their shoulder to see when the next shoe will fall. It would be fun to see it again, knowing the relationships that developed throughout. There are delightful performances all around and we actually find some of the characters naive and rather playful.

Anything to declare? Yeah. Snatch is marvelous,"Guy Ritchie's debut ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was a refreshing, lean, original, and very funny British mixture of Action Comedies/Gambling Dramas/Crime Thrillers. ""Lock, Stock.."" also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. Ritchie's next movie, Snatch, was my introduction to his work. It is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond as huge as these historic celebrated stones you might have seen on display in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom in London Tower or Washington Museum of Natural History or in The State Diamond Fund of Moscow Kremlin. No wonder that every character in Snatch tries to get it. Among them, low-levels gangsters of all sorts of mafia, including Jewish, Russian, and London based. Add to the mix the Irish Gypsies ""who can't be trusted"" because whatever they say could not be understood even by the native English speakers. Don't forget a sadistic crime boss who keeps huge pet pigs with very specific diet. And then there is a dog that likes to snatch and swallow things. All sorts of things.I can watch Snatch from any scene and I would not switch the channel on it. I think it is the best Ritchie's film. It is so perfect in its nastiness. It does not preach anything; it does not have deep message or any other purpose than to entertain and entertain it does. I've seen it so many times that I happily expect the familiar hilarious quotes or scenes or exchanges between the characters which are the best part of the movie. I pay attention to the soundtrack and to Ritchie's style that is known for frequent fast cuts and quick edits. The same technique was also successfully used in his Rocknrolla in one of the most hilarious sex scene I've ever seen. Ritchie likes to return to the same point in time several times to tell the story (or to show it) from the different points of view. The scenes of violence, sometimes grotesque, have been staged and choreographed so well that you can't help admiring them and smile while watching. I enjoy acting by everyone and I believe that the famous (and not so famous but very talented) actors had as much fun playing their outrageous characters as I did following them on the dark and gloomy streets of London underworld.Snatch is enormously enjoyable -on one condition though. You have to appreciate this kind of dark humor that goes together with strong violence. Otherwise, I have something to declare - stay away from it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It has great film form and the generic conventions are tied in brilliantly into the film. It creates a real sense of expectation from the narrative as you are driven though the story. It is stylishly shot with great angles which give the real effect of the film. It has a typical grimy look to it just like London it is typical of British cinema.

Snatch.: 8/10,"In a recent issue of Premiere magazine, The Italian Job director F. Gary Gray called Snatch. the greatest heist movie ever. It has numerous twists and turns, and, like all good heist films, you don't know what's going to happen at the end. However, for Snatch., I had no idea what happened during the entire movie! Guy `Swept Away' Ritchie directed this snazzy, modern crime film, but isn't consistent all the way through.Although it sounds like I didn't like the film, I did. A lot. What appealed to me was Ritchie's boldness to do weird camera tricks and shots. (Please keep in mind that I have not seen Ritchie's previous critically acclaimed work Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.) At times, mainly during the heist scene at the bank, shots were flipped upside down, and weird transitions were used. It looked really cool and modern. Also, despite the often voice-overs (usually by Jason Statham's Turkish), a quick and effective way of transition was used. It was used a few times, when characters were changing countries, and I really liked it. You'll recognize it.In this convoluted script, which was also quite funny, Turkish tells us that he's under interrogation with his friend Tommy (Stephen Graham). He tells us of a diamond heist, with a group that includes famous robber Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), and the subsequent hunt for the 84-karat diamond. Subplots include underground boxing, gypsies who you can't understand but look like Brad Pitt, and a dog that swallows a squeaky toy.Even though I had no idea what was happening, who all of the characters were, what they were doing, and everything, I still really enjoyed Snatch. Why, I don't know, I just had a really good time trying to figure out what was happening on screen. Statham is a really good actor, not like Vin Diesel, who may be a good action star but can't act his way out of a paper bag (note to self: avoid clichés like the plague). All of the other characters just kind of `go along with the flow,' but I wish I did learn more about how everyone was connected. Other than that, Snatch. is a high-octane and extremely enjoyable heist movie that may not be the best ever, but is still really good.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence, language, and some nudity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Blags, slags, lags and gags","Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was one of the most popular British films of all time and spawned a plethora of London gangster movies - all of them far inferior to their inspirer.  (And yes, I'm including Gangster No. 1 in that.) This has raised expectations for Guy Ritchie's Snatch inordinately.  And it doesn't disappoint. In fact it's probably an improvement.However this is not a radical departure, in fact you get exactly the same elements but with a completely different story. So expect witty realistic dialogue, awesome cinematography, clever plotting, cool art direction, flash direction, dark humour. And violence. Lots of it.The film centres on Turkish about to do a deal and he narrates the flashback to how he got there.  But just like Lock, Stock it isn't a simple journey. The breakneck pace and intricate plotting leaves little room for more than sketchy characterisation but that isn't a problem because at the very least you know the motivations for every single character and you believe them. One can only admire the juggling act required to keep so many characters and plots going and not drop a ball.  Guy Ritchie the brilliant screenwriter too often gets subsumed into Guy Ritchie the brilliant director.However let's get back to the violence.  Ritchie has been quoted as saying ""I disapprove of violence"" which is a touch disingenuous.  To be honest there were one or two points in the film where I felt a little uneasy.  It is the similar difficult balancing act which Lock, Stock - the film and the television series - tried to achieve where violence is both cartoon-like and realistic and it isn't always successful.  But the unease wasn't enough to stop me being swept along by the story.While Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones will be the actors most talked about, this is very much an ensemble piece - every actor does an excellent job and should not be overlooked.In conclusion Snatch doesn't break new ground but it treads over old ground in a fresh, entertaining way.  And hopefully this will put an end to the London gangster movie for a while and not launch lots of crap imitations again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
MAN--Guy Ritchie is a f***ing genius!,"SNATCH has two main plots. The first is of an unlicensed boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) and his sidekick Tommy (Stephen Graham), who get ordered by Brick Top (Alan Ford) to arrange a fight and then throw it. After Turkish and Tommy's original fighter, Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty), is made unable to fight by the gypsy Mickey (Brad Pitt), the pair convinces Mickey to fight instead. When Mickey fails to go down in the fourth as Brick Top instructs Turkish and Tommy to make him do, he puts the two in a potentially lethal position if he doesn't come through the next time.The other plot is about a diamond heist. Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and his men steal it initially, but then the diamond is stolen by Vinny (Robbie Gee), Sol (Lennie James), and Tyrone (Ade). Soon Avi (Dennis Farina) and his men, who were supposed to receive the diamond from Franky Four Fingers, come looking for it, putting Vinny, Sol, and Tyrone in potentially lethal situations as well.Got all of that? I know, it's a lot for just one movie.But man... SNATCH has to be one of the best movies I've seen recently. I saw it on TV one night and was blown away even then, and knew I had to rent the unedited version. I was very, very impressed. The four main things that make SNATCH so good:1. The screenplay. It's absolutely hilarious and very well-written. For the most part it's very lighthearted and fun, but there are a couple of really powerful scenes as well (the burning of the caravan and after Gorgeous George gets knocked out). And, might I add, the plots and the way they, and the characters they involve, interact... is genius.2. The acting. All of the actors are brilliant and perfect in their roles, adding the right amounts of humor and seriousness at the right times. It's hard for me to pick out any standout actors, because they're all terrific--but, if I have to: Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, who make a great pair; Robbie Gee and Lennie James, who also make a great pair; and specifically Brad Pitt as Mickey. Every Brad Pitt movie I see, he proves himself to me more and more as an actor--but this film really sealed the deal for me. Everyone is terrific in this one. The characters are tough and yet wimpy, and there is no definitive good or bad guy, which I really like.3. The style and creativity. Honestly, from the moment I learned there was a character named Turkish in this movie (by far, the coolest character name I've ever heard), I knew I would think this was an awesome movie--so, from the first line, basically. And this hunch was confirmed by the sequence in which all of the characters are introduced. It's such a slick, stylish movie, and you can tell it's not trying too hard either.4. The direction, cinematography, and editing. The reason I lumped these three together is because they work so well to complement each other. There are three examples of how well they work together: The diamond heist occurring across the security cameras; the sequence of all the characters being introduced; and the hare coursing scene. Even when I look at any of these scenes individually, I think, ""Wow! They're so stylish and well put-together. It's amazing."" And it really is. Guy Ritchie is, in my opinion as of now, a f***ing genius.The only real complaints I can make about SNATCH are that the accents are really, really hard to understand. Although maybe they were made that way to add to the humor, which they certainly do. But I, for one, had to turn on the closed caption if I wanted to understand a bit of what they were saying. Also, there's so much going on and so many characters to keep track of that it can get confusing. I know a couple of details were lost on me, but repeated viewings fix this flaw.I reserve perfect scores for films that really blow me away, and I don't have a problem giving a perfect score to SNATCH. After watching it, I just sat there shaking my head at how creative and well-done it is. It's an amazing heist movie. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Amazing, This is the best movie ever made.","Without a doubt the best movie of all time. ""Pulp Fiction""-like plot with flawless acting and directing. There is no doubt in my mind that no other movie will ever be made that is even close to as good as Snatch. Guy Ritchie is an incredible director, and I cant think of more than 1 movie that has a better cast than Don Cheadle, Brad Pitt, Jason Statham and the dozen other unbelievable actors in this film. You will never again see a movie that is as good as this, it is as well written, acted, produced, and directed as ANY other movie in the history of film-making. An absolute must see, if you only see three movies in your entire life, make it Snatch, Pulp Fiction, and The Matrix. (The three movies are listed in the order in which it is most vital that you see them before you die.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best British Films,"A fast paced, hilarious British crime comedy/thriller.A great follow up to Lock Stock from Guy Richie, (where did it all go so wrong for him???).A superb array of interlinked characters who help the movie flow seamlessly. This is also Brad Pitt's finest hour in my opinion, despite being unintelligible for almost the whole film! You watch the film and your loyalties for the characters changes as the film progresses, basically wondering how it can work out OK for all the characters, you won't be disappointed by the ending though.Basically watch this film, you will enjoy it tremendously!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
funny as hell,i couldn't belive how hilarious this movie was. brad pitt and vinnie jones and basically all the cast were awesome. i think this should have gotten more awards though. at least it was highly recommended. guy ritchie has got a quirky sense of humor-the script was funny! i have GOT to go see this again.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"not bad,but not great","Don't get too excited by the votes. If you've ever seen a Tarantino movie,you'll see what this movie is loosely striving for. It wasn't horrible,but it wasn't anything all that new. It has the trademark attempt to shock with violence,and the trivial dialogue that Tarantino usually has. The humorous parts are what saved it for me,along with a few neat camera tricks. Nothing revolutionary though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
what an amazing film!,"This is such a excellent film , it's so witty. The best part of the film is probably the connection between Turkish and Tommy they both compliment each other so well. Another good part of the film is Brad Pitts role. Not because it's so well acted (although i'm not saying it it's not because he does carry the Pikey accent extremely well) because he is not treated like the one and only star like most Hollywood actors are. So hats off the Guy Ritchie for making it not only a fantastic film but it's so equal from the actors point of view. It's only a matter of opinion but to me it has the best memorable quotes from any other film! Five star!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Looking to be entertained-- and nothing else?,"Neither Guy Ritchie or anybody has outdone themselves with this film. It's mediocre enough and exaggeratedly mainstream, but then again there's no shame in earning the day's due pocket cash is there? Although the film quite obviously disguises some clumsy acting with a varying of delightful accents that doubtlessly pull in the non-British/-Irish audience, the overall production does marvelously for what it's meant to be: pure entertainment.

Lock stock and a much more A-list cast,"It's widely regarded that Guy Ritchie's first film, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is pretty much a classic modern British gangster film. Therefore, much was riding on the – er – 'sequel', simply titled 'Snatch.' Now, first of all, it's not a sequel, although some people may think it felt like one.Alternatively, if you're feeling even less charitable, you could even call it a 'remake' (or 'soft reboot' as has been used post 'The Force Awakens'). Because, even die-hard fans (of which I confess to being one) have to admit that it's basically the same story as Lock Stock, with basically the same characters, shot in basically the same style. Only with Brad Pitt thrown in there (and he's awesome).So, despite a fair amount of cynicism associated with Snatch, it's actually pretty damn good. Yes, it is a slight copy of Lock Stock, but, when a film was so perfect as Lock Stock, it's difficult to hate anything that replicates it so well. To use another term, Snatch feels like it's set in a 'shared universe' (only with gangsters instead of Robert Downey Jr).The characters, despite most being copies of its filmic predecessor, are still pretty memorable – despite Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham playing almost the same roles as before and the evil mob boss not really straying far from type, we also get a trio of hapless pawn store owners, a Russian hit man who just won't die and Brad Pitt. Did I mention he's in it? Brad Pitt is the standout for me. Too many times he's been written off as a pretty face only, but (as with 'Kalifornia') he proves that he's as good at acting as he is looking (and I sort of hate him for that, but still...). He steals every scene he's in as the hard-as-nails gypsy bare-knuckle boxer and has everything from the mannerisms to the accent down perfectly.If you like gangster films of any nationality then you have to watch Snatch. Yes, it may not be quite as original as Lock Stock, but it's still worth a place in anyone's DVD collection.Pity about 'Revolver' though. Don't know what happened there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Stylish, hilarious, terrific","Turkish and Tommy promote unlicensed boxing for a ruthless mobster. Mickey wants to buy his mum a caravan. Franky is on his way to New York, via London, to deliver a huge stolen diamond. These stories then progress and intersect in interesting and funny ways and contain a large assortment of interesting and funny characters.Obviously influenced by 'Pulp Fiction' but this is a brilliant and original film in its own right. Featuring a terrific cast of many known and not so known actors all creating a character that you will remember and be able to quote by the time the movie ends. That makes repeated viewings all the more fun. Also featuring a clever screenplay and a stylish and very creative direction from Guy Ritchie. Far, far surpassing his feature debut - 'Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels' - in almost every way imaginable. Here the deliciously absurd tone and painfully funny dark humor is spread throughout the entire film, which is where 'Lock, Stock' was thrown off balance. It tried to combine humorous elements with scenes that were just plain old grim.Guy Ritchie fixed that here and that makes for what just might be the best crime/comedy since the original 'Italian Job.' 10/10Rated R for brutal violence and considerable profanity",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great film,"Enjoyed it very much. Good gangster movie. A lot of plot lines going on. Statham did a great job as did Dennis farina. The bad guys were very good bad guys. Brad Pitt did a great job as the Gypsy. His accent was very funny. A lot of original scenes unlike some gangster movies, that rehash dialogue and scenes. Many funny scenes too. The dog was a great add on to the movie. Being from NY not used to hearing all these English phrases that were used in the movie. Fight scenes were done well too.

"as good as lock,stock","With the success of Lock,Stock under his belt, Expectations for Guy Ritchie's next one was going to be high and thank god, he succeeded, easily as good as Lock,Stock and while comparisons could be made with Pulp Fiction ( the beginning features the back of a bald head just like pulp ) and it might take a while to get your head round the plot but trust me this is as good a follow up to Lock,Stock as you could hope for. With excellent performances by Vinnie jones as Bullet Tooth Tony, Brad Pitt as boxer one punch mickey, Mike reid as an Jewish diamond dealer, Jason Staham as the main hero,Turkish, Stephen Graham as his mate,Tommy and Benicio del toro as Frankie four fingers, this is an dazzlingly scripted work which scores on all counts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Crime comedy from a fresh perspective,"I must first admit that I've seen this film close to 20 times. I never get tired of seeing it (I'm starting to understand pikey!!). The characters are memorable, the script un-Hollywood, the humour sharp, and the directorial genius of Guy Ritchie is evident. There are slow motion shots, split-screens, and all kinds of other orthodox film-making techniques. These, together with beautifully written dialogues, great performances (Especially Del Toro, Farina, Ford, Pitt, Graham....I could go on forever), and the great integration of different story lines come together to make one helluva flick.

good film but somewhat overrated,"If you have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels than you will know what to expect from writer/director Guy Ritchie's latest gangster flick.  The plot revolves around a stolen diamond and involves a rigged boxing mach, a group of hapless crooks, and a dog that can swallow just about any thing. Most of the cast in Snatch was present in Lock Stock and features great performances from British actors that are practically unknown in North America.  The exception to this is the film's big American star Brad Pitt, who is quite funny as an Irish/English gypsy with an accent that no one can seem to understand.  When Lock Stock came out Guy Ritchie was immediately compared to Quentin Tarantino, and with Snatch that seems even more evident. In a sense Snatch is like Tarantino's Jackie Brown, not as edgy or bloody as his previous but more mature with a greater focus on plot and characters. I don't know whether I liked this better than Lock Stock or not, they are both very entertaining films and I gave them both 4 stars, but if you could only see one, see Snatch its a fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
From the opening scene it shocks you,"For those of us who are sold of the cliche that for a movie to be good it must have the world's biggest cast and budget, snatch is a delightful reminder that good movies are made because of good storys and that's exactly what snatch is, a wonderous 2 hour acid trip like experience that you can hardly understand yet you understand that you want to watch.

I like the 'dag'!,"Excellent, that just about sums this film up.Fast moving, clever storyline entwining (a la Pulp Fiction), great action and very funny to boot.I found the violence not too gratuitous, and the comedy very British, and very funny.Yes it is smells a bit of 'Lock, Stock...' and as earlier stated 'Pulp Fiction' but this is a must see. Brad Pitt is excellent and his accent is great. Vinny Jones plays another great role, he is turning out to be a better actor than how he played football for Wimbledon thats for sure.The rest of the cast are great too, with Mike Reid (of Eastenders Fame) and Dennis Farina (Get Shorty) on top form.

Average,"I admire Guy Ritchie as a director, and anyone who has seen Lock, Stock... can attest to his ability, but I can't help being disappointed by Snatch. Where Lock, Stock... was thrillingly original, Snatch is confusing and overly complicated. The characters are less convincing, and the performances are pedestrian. Had this film been the work of anyone other than Guy Ritchie, it would have been touted as an unoriginal, commercialised and inferior Lock, Stock... clone. This movie proves that a bigger budget does not a better movie make.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Just a couple quick comments,"Firstly let me say, yes, this film is very much in the Lock,Stock mold. However, simply because a movie features gangsters, violence, intertwining plotlines and snappy camera-work, IT DOES NOT MAKE IT A TARANTINO RIP-OFF!!! This type of statement is coming from ignorant, self-important Americans.Secondly, I too am a little surprised at the place this film currently holds in the top 250. It simply doesn't belong there. Yes, it is clever and well-made. But it is simply not significant enough to deserve that spot.Ok, that said this is an entertaining movie, along similar lines to Lock, Stock. Good luck trying to understand Brad Pitt's 'Pikie' accent.My vote 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
best movie i've seen in a while,this movie is great it has everything from laughs to action .Something you should definitely rent . Brad Pitt's performance in this is amazing and masters the dialect(even though noone could make him out)I believe that this is one of the best movies ever made. Benicio del toro also gives a great amish impersonation. Guy Ritchie made two great and similar movies with Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

It's so good your brain will explode,"This is a movie buff's movie. It's so damned full of life, so flamboyant, so fast paced, so wild, so full of rich characters -- I know I'll watch this at least two more times, and I NEVER do that.On the down side, it's one of those movies that has *alot* of characters, and a real multi-tentacled plot, and it does involve a stolen diamond (but there's no people in black suits on wires avoiding laser beams I assure you). There's an evil guy in here about 65 called Brick Top who looks like your grandfather but he's got this eye that just roves around. Damn this is a good movie. Brad Pitt is even more amusing here than he was in Fight Club, and he's just a secondary character. And the plot coalesces like a complex puzzle.Sometimes you see so many bad movies in a row you lose faith in humanity. This will cure what ails you.

Humorous and stylish British gangster flick,"I haven't seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which makes this the first Guy Ritchie film I've seen, and the only one I've seen so far. I had heard plenty of good things about this film, and I do believe that I've seen some of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels(though that didn't impress me much, actually), and after seeing some advertisements for this, I was looking forward to seeing it. I must say, it did meet my expectations, though it didn't exceed them. The plot is great, very interesting and constantly developing. It also has a good pace, you're never bored, which can also be attributed to the many quick cuts and great editing. The acting is great, I really enjoyed Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones, not to mention Jason Statham, though they were all great, I think. The characters were diverse, well-written and credible, not to mention quite entertaining, though at times they became a little lame, in obvious attempts at humor. The action is great, though there is fairly little of it; it's mostly sacrificed for the sake of more humor. Don't get me wrong, the humor is mostly good too, but sometimes it just seems like there is too little action in it, though, when there is action, it's good. The camera work and overall filming style is, well, stylish, and looks very cool. I liked the use of slow-motion, fast-motion and instantly changing angles, not to mention the well-placed quick cuts. The way the diamond constantly changed hands in the film was great, though a fairly basic way to keep the plot going. I liked all of the things that didn't have anything to do with the diamond, like the gypsies and the boxing, but I did think the plot revolved a little too much around the diamond. All in all, a very entertaining film, that couldn't have been much better or much more professionally made, but was lacking a little. I recommend it to fans of British/violent humor, and fans of the actors. I guess people who liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels will enjoy this too, though I can't say for sure, as I haven't seen it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not the Pulp Fiction sequel we had hoped for.,"Expectations were high, I'd loved Lock Stock and was eagerly waiting to see if Guy Richie could do better 2nd time round when thrown a bit of money - ala Quentin Tarentino. To answer simply: no he couldn't.Snatch is a good, slick film but it lacks something. Maybe it's originality? Very similar to Lock Stock - different storylines weave and turn crossing each other's paths in unexpected twists, but this time maybe we're expecting them?It lacks flow, it tends to stop and start. We end up talking about the 'good' bits instead of the film as a whole.The direction is good, Brad Pitt is excellent [it hurts me to say], the soundtrack is definitely worth buying and the majority of the acting is very good.Snatch [7/10] is definitely worth seeing but know you're pretty much getting more of the same... and if you haven't seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels yet see that instead!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guy Ritchie's pinnacle film,"One of the only films where a dog is the most important character, and that's saying something with a cast featuring Brad Pitt and Jason Statham.

The film follows a series of characters all in pursuit of a jewel the size of a golf ball and the desperate measures and menacing attempts they take to get their hands on it.

Chock full o' cliche goodness!,"For being a post Pulp Fiction, post Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, post Usual Suspects movie, Snatch is terrific (8 out of 10). I wasn't expecting much from this latest entry in the ultra-hip/chaotic sequenced/violent-funny/tangled plot movie, but I was won over in a big way.I liked all the characters in Snatch, and it didn't matter to me that they were all stereotypical bit players. Even though it had a WWF flavor to it, with the ""uber-individual"" cast of characters, it was still entertaining. I felt all the actors did a great job in bringing life and a hint of realism to each of their pigeonholed parts. Pitt in particular is terrific as the ""Pikey"" who is virtually unintelligable throughout.The movie is stylish, and even though the devices have been used to death in other pictures, I felt Ritchie brought enough freshness to Snatch to make it work. And even though I saw the old ""all-points-converge-here"" plot developing within the first couple of minutes, it didn't matter much--I was entertained throughout.Basically, if you've seen a bunch of movies from this Pulp Fiction genre lately, you'd be better off not watching Snatch for a while. It isn't original enough to stand out among the rest, and it will be impossible to give it the objective look it deserves. On the other hand, when viewed on its own, it is quite good, and I think worth a high standing in the cool action flick category.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Snatch this one up.,"Turkish (Jason Stathem) is a struggling boxing promoter who just wants to earn a living promoting boxing. He and his wanna be tough friend, Tommy (Stephan Graham), find out the hard way that certain people should not be dealt with if you want to stay out of trouble. Two of the people they find out who shouldn't be messed with is, One Punch Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), and one boxing promoter/ Kingpin, Brick Top (Alan Ford). Turkish and Tommy end up dealing with these two characters and realize that there is so much more to them then meets the eye. Mean while there is a huge diamond that has been stolen and every gangster and mob man wants it. This adds a whole big twist in lives of not only local gangsters and mob men, but also local jewelers and thieves. While Turkish and Tommy end up trying to deal with their new ""friends"", the whole rest of the gangster community fights over the diamond. Though out the whole movie the diamond changes hands and in the end, it ends up with the most unlikely character.This movie had great potential and came through. It was a great action comedy that kept me glued to the screen. It had everything from Fights to Shootings, to people getting limbs chopped off. Great, I know. The comedy that went with it was something that of a man getting hit in the privates. You know you shouldn't laugh but it was so hard not to. It was mostly dark humor, dealing with death and violence so you kind of feel bad for laughing but they set it up in a way were it worked.The British dialect was a bit hard to follow at the beginning, but after a while you get used to it. It was definitely one of those movies that you would have to watch again just so you could catch every thing that was said. The hardest character to understand would have to be Brad Pitts. They do this on purpose because he is supposed to be a non-educated gypsy that no one can understand, but again as the movie digresses you start to learn the dialect and get to love his character.This movie had lots and lots of characters, but seemed to keep them under control. It reminded me of the movie ""smoking aces"", in the fact that there were many characters. Almost too many in the beginning but the movie did a great job of either killing them off, or just kind of pushing them aside and you forgetting about them. It also jumped around a lot. They would go from character to character and not give a lead to the scene change. I some what enjoyed this part of the movie but others could very easily get lost.The narrating part done by Jason Stathem really did add something to the movie. He has played in other movies were he has played the bad ass that beats everyone up. In this role he really does show that he can actually act. I am a big fan of the starting a movie at the end of a movie and the narrator going back trough and telling you how they got to were they were. I think when directors do this they always have a great way to end the movie. In this movie they definitely pulled it off.So I would have to say you would really enjoy this movie if you don't mind the dark humor with violence. If you love stories were there really is no really clear cut good guy. It doesn't end like you thought it would and tons of big guns and people getting what they deserve, you should definitely ""Snatch"" up this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Resist the temptation to stop watching it,"""Snatch"" spent only a brief time in the theater for those committed to actually sitting and watching films. I did see this during its short US theatrical release, having been fortunate enough to be in a larger market city on business at the time. Back then I never found time to post a review, though. Now it's on DVD and I took another look. Same movie, smaller screen, just as good. I predict ""Snatch"" will be one of the most rented but least watched' home videos of the year because its plot is so incomprehensible (though not near as much as Guy Ritchie's previous, ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels""). People will give up on it after a time and go get a sandwich, iron clothes, play cards, etcetera. But it's fun enough to keep on as background static just for say, the bits with the dog who eats the squeaky toy and Brad Pitt's hilarious, unintelligible Irish(?) accent.Just a few words about Brad Pitt: he's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, mostly because of how he completely commits to every role he's in. He has a healthy, George Clooney-like mentality toward his choice of projects (like George, he's chosen a Coen brothers production, ""To The White Sea"" for his next), saying pooey! to the Hollywood hit machine and choosing roles that are actually interesting. Occasionally he'll earn a paycheck with dreck such as ""Meet Joe Black."" In this film he plays Mickey, a gypsy (or to your average Welshman, ""piker"") with an iron jaw and a monster right hook.Pitt plays Mickey with such genius. See, when you need to understand him, you can. When it's just for laughs, well, you'd need subtitles. The accent (I could be wrong on this), like the lazy eye in `Twelve Monkeys,' was his idea and is intended to poke fun at the way American audiences couldn't understand a word anyone was saying in ""Smoking Barrels."" Pitt's every move is calculated, but he does it with such abandon you have to give him credit.Grade for `Snatch': A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I HATE BRITISH MOVIES!!!,"But, I loved Snatch!  It is a rare exception for me to like British movies. The accents make it hard to understand what the characters are saying and also, I find that British movies tend to be rather boring and tediously short on action.  Snatch is fast, frenetic, and funny.  The brief camera shots of a high strung and nervous Cousin Avi crossing the Atlantic ocean on the Concorde is just hilarious.  Comparisons to Quentin Tarantino movies are unavoidable - then again, who cares? (Oh, I know, some of the supremely jaded movie watchers who critique the movies at imdb).  In other words, these people want to see an ""epic"", each and every time they go to the movies.  I could watch movies like this hundreds of times.  Some moviegoers actually like all of the plot twists and the large ensemble cast.  Unless you are being paid to critique movies, try to relax while watching them, instead of looking for every weak part, or trying to compare this movie with that. Let each movie stand(or fall) on its own merits.  Really, what you can pay for drinks, candy, and/or popcorn is where the real critiquing should begin(and end). I took off one point because, as I stated earlier, the dialogue is hard to understand at times.  Brad Pitt being the exception, we weren't suppose to understand what the hell he was saying.  Good job Guy Ritchie, now I have to check out Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels - not for comparisons, but to hopefully enjoy another movie directed by the same person. 9/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Stylish Chaos with Some Misses,"Snatch is a wild, fast-paced ride filled with quirky characters, sharp dialogue, and an interwoven storyline. The movie's energy is undeniable, and the humor lands well. The editing style, quick cuts, and multiple intersecting plots keep things engaging.That said, while the film is entertaining, it sometimes leans too heavily on style over substance. The pacing can feel frantic, and with so many characters, some arcs don't get enough breathing room. I enjoy complex storylines with unexpected twists, but this one felt more about the ride than the payoff.Overall, it's a fun crime-comedy with great moments and unforgettable scenes, but it doesn't quite hit the top tier for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Excellent movie,"Snatch is just hilarious. Wow. Great stuff all round. Brad Pitt is great as usual. Jason Statham is hilarious. And also, this may be my favourite Vinnie Jones film ever because personally, I don't consider him the greatest actor ever. Anyway, back to the film, as I was saying, it's great. Snatch is all about two guys who are involved in illegal boxing and one day they decide to buy a new caravan and all of a sudden it turns into a rip-roaring ride of hilarity which is full of revenge, back stabbing and downright stupidity. The cast is great (even though there are sooooooo many characters), the plot can be a bit confusing but it doesn't matter because it's funny. This movie is slick, funny and bizarre all at the same time. If you are looking for a movie that will keep you laughing for hours after it has finished then I highly recommend Snatch.Enjoy it. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of the best action movies of the year,Snatch was the one best action movies I saw in the year 2001. Just the action visuals and Guy Richie's cinematography are worth the price of admisson.

"Much Better, Mr. Ritchie","After seeing and loathing Guy Ritchie's previous effort, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" I was hardly looking forward to this, his follow up of a similar nature.  However, I was very surprised by the film, because I enjoyed it immensely.  The story was not especially original but I thought the acting talent was a huge improvement and the comedy moments a good deal funnier.  Of the actors involved I was especially impressed by Alan Ford, who was suitably intimidating as Brick Top and also Stephen Graham, who I'd never seen before but I'm sure I'll be seeing him elsewhere in the future. Best of all, however, is Dennis Farina whom I found hilarious in the role of Cousin Avi and felt he lit up every scene he was in.  Of course, the traces of the ""Lock Stock"" bad acting regime was still there, with Jason Statham just appallingly bad as Turkish.  I shudder in recollection of it.  Vinnie Jones just plays himself as usual but I'll admit he has improved slightly since ""Lock Stock"".  Who knows, ten films down the line, he might border on competent.I recommend the film to anyone, even if they hated ""Lock Stock"" as I did. It aint perfect but it's an enjoyable film all the same, if you can put up with the tiresome, self-indulgent camera tricks that Ritchie uses throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It's very entertaining to watch all the different characters interact with each other as they all bumble their way around. Even though the all star cast of Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina, it is Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony who shines. Jones is the ultimate bad ass, I could watch this guy all day he is just amazing and hilarious. Pitt is also very funny as a boxer who is very hard to understand. There are many very funny scenes in here, one of the best is when the three black guys try to hold up Tony with fake guns. Guy Richie sure does have a knack for directing hilarious trash and he is in top form here. If you were a fan of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels this all out madness is not to be missed.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
British translation of Familiar American Crime Caper,"I was going to watch Snatch a while back but ended up turning it off. When I saw that it is still in the top 100 at imdb, nearly 20 years after its release, I decided to give it another try.Snatch is entertaining enough, I suppose, as it does build suspense and offers several twists and turns. It came out about the time of Fight Club, so my best guess is that there is a large contingent of fight-loving fellows rating films at this site. Lots of blood and gore and dark comedy which oscillates between slapstick and sociopathy.The voice-over style used was of course made popular by Goodfellas (Scorsese) and by now has certainly been seen many times since. The tone of the crime caper, too, is found in movies such as the Ocean series (albeit with much less murder). So maybe Snatch is considered a genre-bending antecedent, sort of a cross between the Coen brothers and Tarantino? Not sure. Not really my kind of thing.I remain mystified by the longevity of the high rating. I mean is this film really supposed to be better than Taxi Driver, Lawrence of Arabia, Double Indemnity, I Ladri di Biciclette...? What may have happened is that most of the 700K+ reviewers of Snatch posted ratings in the brief period after the film´s release in a state of post-viewing euphoria induced by violence-induced adrenalin rushes. Perhaps they were also still riding the testosterone wave of Fight Club.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fantastic plot pieces brilliantly put together made this movie even better than pulp fiction,"Man, this is one from the category ""I couldn't stop watching it over and over...""

Starting from Turkish, leading to Brickface and so on...

To all of you who enjoy a good action full of unexpected events and turnouts this is a must-see.

'Lock Stock...' but 20 times more annoying,"This movie is really dreadful. Like 'Lock Stock...' but 20 times more annoying. There are loads of famous actors (and Vinnie Jones), all wasted in stupid and underwritten 'character' parts. The dialogue is cliched mockney rubbish, the plot borrows totally from every other british crime pic of the last 50 years, the whole thing is just embarrassingly awful. In fact, the only good thing is Brad Pitt's performance as an Irish gypsy.

Just a slice of everyday life for we Fenlanders!,"If you find 'Snatch' confusing, just come and live in my area for a month - it will all fall into place very quickly!

He is just dirty enough, dishonest enough and unintelligible enough to make you think he really is a pikey! I was equally impressed with the rest of the cast - sterling performances all round! Considering Ritchie is an old Harrovian and has lived his life just about as far away as you can get from the world of the itinerant pikeys, he recreated their world to perfection. Well done!I can well understand that many of you out there in the wide world would have found the dialogue almost completely incomprehensible but all praise to the director. He has sacrificed clarity for realism and come out on top. The plot, of course, is total nonsense but, so what, it's not a documentary, is it? The film has plenty of plusses.

The most delightfully insane thing I have ever laid my eyes on!,"'SNATCH' was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Jason Statham, Brad Pitt and Alan Ford. ​Illegal boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) convinces gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) to offer bets on bare- knuckle boxer Mickey (Brad Pitt) at his bookie business. When Mickey does not throw his first fight as agreed, an infuriated Brick Top demands another match. Meanwhile, gangster Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) comes to place a bet for a friend with Brick Top's bookies, as multiple criminals converge on a stolen diamond that Frankie has come to London to sell.This is the most insane, weird, amazing movie I have ever seen in my entire existence. The story is insane, the characters are insane, the acting(I'm looking at you Pitt!) is insane - it is the actual definition of what in God's name is going on.... and I love it.The plot is delightfully insane. It really is. It is a slow buildup of several loosely related plots that combine into one mad, insane overarching story to create an equally insane outcome. Something I did not expect from this movie was non-linear storytelling. This is often a risk in film but I 100% think it worked here.There are a LOT of characters in this film and I can't even hope to mention them all. A good place to start, however, will be with our lead man. Jason Statham portrays Turkish, our lead man if you couldn't guess, and does a fantastic job at it. Turkish is a really good protagonist and his street nature gives him the fun edge over other characters.I could spend days picking apart Brad Pitt's fantastic portrayal of Mickey but I wont for the sake of time. In short, Pitt gives a truly memorable performance and brings a character, which really shouldn't work on paper, to life and makes him the funniest and most entertaining character in the movie.Alan Ford is great as Brick Top. Brick Top is a genuinely terrifying, yet also strangely humorous, villain that will gives you chills and laughs at the same time. A genuinely great performance.Rade ​Serbedzij was great as Boris the Blade, a very mysterious, intriguing character who was handled exceptionally well and was very entertaining. I will now say a sentence I NEVER expected to have to say: I liked Vinnie Jones in this movie. I really did. Bullet Tooth Tony was an intimidating muscle and served his role to the movie very well. Robbie Gee and Lennie James were both good as Vinny & Sol respectively. Dennis Farina was good as Cousin Avi. Benicio Del Toro was great as Franky Four Fingers. I obviously left some people out but there are so many characters in this movie and they are all so amazing, I couldn't possibly mention them all.This movie is more Guy Ritchie than if Guy Ritchie had a child with himself and that child was forced to sit through ONLY Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels for their entire life before having a child with themselves. I love Ritchie's style and cannot fault it. Many, many people will hate this movie purely because of Ritchie's style but I still adore it.The costume and set design is amazing.I love this movie. I regret not seeing it sooner. It is an awesome, hilarious, fantastic crime-comedy-thriller? I can 100% recommend you check it out if you can handle Ritchie levels higher than the distance to the moon and back, if you are standing on Pluto.

Brilliant from start to finish,"Once in a while you encounter a movie which rings no bells and rises no expectations. You just sit and watch it hoping it won't suck. Snatch, to me, was one of those movies and BOY have I enjoyed it. Sure ... it's violent but I like that sometimes.This movie has an excellent plot, trend setting camera-work and editing, a multitude of brilliant actors doing even better acting, several compelling stories asynchronously intertwining and above all ... large chunks of well placed humor. The only thing that lacks in this movie (thank God) is romance.The characters in the movie are very believable caricatures of people that, all in their own way, live life avoiding the law. In Snatch these characters (with hilarious nick names) get to develop fully since the law doesn't show itself until the very last moments of the movie. Until that time theft, murder, betrayal, brotherhood, fighting but above all British humor roam freely through the story.Brad Pitt does what he does best in this movie and entertains the audience with a masterpiece of acting. Vinnie Jones establishes himself as an icon almost equal to Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) in Pulp Fiction. Jason Statham does his most enjoyable acting ever. I could rave on about this movie but if you haven't seen it and you really like an action-packed knockout from the unexpected corner; watch this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Best picture of the year,"I read several reviews of Snatch before I took the chance to see it, and many critics seemed disappointed with the fact that it is so similar to Lock, Stock... Well, I don't think that is a reason to trash this movie. It really is the best movie I've seen this year! It is even better than Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.Guy Ritchie is one of the best directors ever - I mean it! He plays a lot with the camera, and the result is more than excellent. The opening credits is among the best I've seen. One fact that strikes me is how fast-paced and full of energy the movie is. Not one second more than necessary is in here, and with this many characters and stories taking place, quite a lot takes place during the almost-two-hours.The ending scenes is so beautifully shot that my heart stopped for a few minutes. Now I thought Fight Club was beautifully shot in its similar scenes, but this is even better. Brad Pitt makes his part quite good, but he shouldn't be the reason why you're seeing it. A LOT of guys could have played his role just as good.Warning! I saw the movie twice in a row and absolutely loved it, but when I forced my parents and my brother to see it, they lost interest after a while and didn't finish the movie. They just didn't think it was funny. First of all, I guess this is a movie for boys. And you probably have to enjoy violence. I mean, it isn't real, it's not like I go out and kill someone after I've seen it.

Cockney Gangsta's were never so cool!,"Foul mouthed, gun wielding, double 'ard b**tards is what the film and its promo suggests, and this is exactly what you get.

How many people who liked this film will refer to a jumbo jet the next time someone moans about the size of a parking space! For anyone who finds reasonable strong language, violence and the kind of content that makes it the '18' rated it is, then this film is a definite no no.

Fun but way overrated,"As a caper movie, Snatch is excellent, but Madonna's hubby Guy Ritchie, at least IMHO, tries to get way to artsy in his cinematography and storytelling, sometimes to the point of confusion.  The way he often bleeds timelines of the various characters both together and apart was done much more effectively in The Limey than it was here (though the car accident sequence was handled very well).Brad Pitt leads the cast as the odd-speaking Piker, and both his and the ensemble's acting is superb.

made with real flair,"""Snatch"" is a movie that takes a little patience to get into. The first 15-20 minutes are a bit confusing. There are a lot of characters to introduce, and Ritchie's fitful editing style - reminiscent of music video-style flash - is something the viewer will have to get used to. But once it settles down and we get into the flow of it, it is a very entertaining, even hilarious, movie. Brad Pitt does a superb job and shows once more why he is not only a big star but a fine actor. All the actors in this are excellent. It's a film about confusion, dumb plots, and drastic mistakes made by people who think they're smart when really they are all dumb as lamp posts.This movie is made with real flair and an ear for ""talk."" I would suggest watching it with English SUBTITLES ON. This is the great innovation of DVD and it makes the picture a bit more coherent. There is a section when Pitt delivers one of his prodigious mumbles that the subtitles simply give up. It is actually totally invented by Pitt.

One of the best British Movies ever.,"Snatch is a superb masterpiece by Guy Richie which amazed me after my first viewing. It left me speechless. After the last 16 viewings of it, I still enjoy it as much as the first viewing as every time it amazes me. It was the first movie which I bought on DVD and it was a risk as I had never seen it before. It was proberly the best $40 I have spent all year as it has been thrashed on my DVD player. The bonus cd on the DVD has some surprise specials in it with some hidden bits in it including a lot of swearing from the movie. The movie itself is exceptional from the humour between Turkisk and Tommy to the hostility between Bricktop and anyone who gets near him. The movie includes some great one liners that I have repeated many times since such as 'You can't underestimate the predictability of stupidity' Bullit Tooth Tony. The camera shots by Guy Richie are amazing from the quick zoom onto Turkish and Tommy when Mickey drops the other boxer with one punch, and also the shot of the guns showing REPLICA and DESERT EAGLE .50.I have discussed with many people what is better between Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and most people cant decide.

Very South East London gangster reality!,"Following Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels would have been no easy task without the input of Brad Pitt. However he obviously saw the potential of this film and, I believe, offered his services for next to nothing. Having said that it was an enormous risk to star an American actor in the role of such a strangely particular person as ""The Pikey"" and I am so impressed with Richie's bravery and Pitt's abilities. The editing of the film is such an incredibly cohesive representation of the reality it seeks to portray. The violent and comically black survival humor it depicts, along with the adrenaline rush of street lunacy it encompasses was and is about as accurate as you can get.

Funny and well done,Snatch tells the story of the British underground crime scene and its numerous amounts of dubious characters.  The plot is  displayed in a genius fashion with quick switches between the  groups of characters showing how they all end up fitting together.Perhaps the only down fall to this film is the hard to understand British accents which most of the characters use.  However if the viewer can get past this s/he will surely enjoy a movie full of laughs and violence as Snatch is a well thought out story of jewel thievery that turns into a gypsy bare knuckled boxing match.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not Lock Stock.,"A gangster story revolving around the sale and subsequent loss of an 84-carat diamond. Much undercover goings-on, with some fine performances directed by Mr. Madonna, Guy Ritchie. Vinnie Jones, Mike Reid and Brad Pitt all play their parts, but the story primarily follows the adventures of Turkish, the boxing promoter-cum-inept criminal and his efforts to promote Mickey (Pitt) in bare-knuckled fistfights, which are rigged for the sake of the reddies. Very much character driven, the story lacks depth and plays the 'Lock, Stock' card far too often to be called original in any sense. Entertaining nonetheless, but in a forgettable way. A film that has tossed away it's best lines without too much care and attention. 'This is a boxing match, not a tickling competition', for instance. As I said, the plot is thin and it appears that the story fell together by accident, though the characters are both credible and believable. Thumbs up for the casting and acting roles. Not something I would take my children to watch due to the choice language and graphic violence and also not a picture I would choose to view again, though it was enjoyable in a one-off sense. The writers could do better than this, as could the actors who agreed to be in it, though not desperately so. Acceptable for it's target audience, but would be found wanting by most others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Tarantino Wanna-Be Who Made it Big,"I am not sure, but I believe that Quentin Tarantino should be entitled some of Guy Ritchie's earnings. I mean, without 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs', this guy would be making documentaries for the BBC if he was lucky. Both ""Lock Stock...' and 'Snatch' are Tarantino rip offs and the only reason this is not obvious to everyone is because the movies are made in Britain.In fact Ritchie is so inspired by Tarantino that I am not sure whether the Madonna references are there because of him being married to her, or because of the 'Reservoir Dogs' Madonna intro.'Snatch' is better than ""Lock Stock'. Ritchie's rhythm has improved, but he still is no Tarantino and the semi American cast helps a lot. Also the humor is great at times, maybe at larger doses than expected, which makes 'Snatch' a comedy more than anything else.By the way, has anyone noticed that in Guy Ritchie's movies everybody pronounces 'TH' as 'F'? ""Come wiF me"", ""I'll do anyFing""? That thing drives me nuts!6/10 (half of it goes to Tarantino)",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Fast-paced, funny, and with engaging characters","This movie is about a few small-time crooks who get involved with a few big-time crooks. The reasons are a boxer, a gypsy boxer, and a very big diamond.All through the movie, I sympathized with the small guys who kept ending up in worse and worse situations. Like having two big guys force you to do two opposite thingss... you always wonder how on earth they're going to get out of the mess.It is a rather violent movie, like its predecessor from the same author: ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". But the violence is never glorified nor dramatized. It just happens that people die when bullets hit them. And bullets happen to be fired by violent people in a violent world.The style of story telling is like ""Lock Stock..."": rhapsodic. Short cuts, sometimes back in time, sometimes forward. Two second-long cuts can be enough to give a very good impression of what is happening.What really brings the humour out is the understated british style. With an american accent and attitude, this movie would have been a disaster.All in all, a very enjoyable movie. Even my girlfriend liked it, despite some doubts at the beginning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones, ... Everyone rocked the show! The scene in the bar with Vinnie Jones and the three masked blacks was THE SCENE of the movie. Vinnie Jones did a similar role to the one in LSATSB but gives it a new freshness that doesn't let you get bored of him. Brad Pitt really impressed with the Pikey accent. Way to go Guy Ritchie.

"Lock, Stock and not much else","Guy Ritchie is a tremendous visual director, but someone needs to teach him how to tell a story.  Snatch is a shallow, undisciplined, poorly structured piece of work.  Undeniably, its very entertaining but a little more substance is needed in order to make great cinema and Snatch does not provide it.The film is so unstructured that even the trailer and the video description fail to accurately synopsise this music video of a film.  If you are a product of the MTV generation and have little more than a three-second attention span then you'll probably like it, but I couldn't possibly sit through it again because there cannot be anything more for me to see.Like Lock, Stock this film is a classic triumph of style over substance and like Lock, Stock it left me feeling like I'd seen the work of an adolescent schoolboy.  Snatch was ultimately frustrating in that - not unlike Pulp Fiction - it presented a number of great ideas that in themselves would have made good films but failed to adequately explore any one idea to a fulfilling conclusion.On the positive side, I liked Jason Statham's performance and I particularly like his real life girlfriend.  Brad Pitt was a revelation as the totally incoherent ""One punch"" Mickey and the comedic aspects of the film worked very well.  The plotting, however, though initially fairly tight developed into little more than a series of sketches based upon the loose theme of the stolen diamonds.  Hence, my feeling that I was watching an immature piece of work.  A less visual and more plot driven director could have made Snatch into a funny yet gritty drama on the pursuit of the diamonds by the various criminal elements. Instead we're given a hotchpotch of, funny, but loose ideas and very, very violent sketches giving an overall impression that's massively different from the impression we're given from the trailer.  I found it very disappointing.I have to apologise to all the people who have written positive comments on this film and also to instruct the bloke who's seen it sixteen times to get a life, but the movie Snatch has much less to it than meets the eye.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant stuff!,"I loved the originality of lock stock and 2 smoking barrels in the form of its story layout and character presentation, and we have Guy Ritchie to thank once again for bringing it back to Snatch.The story surrounds the theft of a 84crt stone that is then passed around and stolen from a string of corrupted low life characters who are all wiling to get there hands on the rarety of the jewel.The film starts off very explosive and strong and finished with an excellent climax that you would come to expect from a film with such a talented cast. Alan Ford who starred as Bricktop i felt stole the screen due to his willingness to hate everyone he meets in the film, it really was great to watch. bradd Pitt also does the business as usual as he is casted as a Gypsy bare-fist champion 'Micky'.Overall just as good as Lock stock - in some ways better, also very good on DVD!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Style reigns over content. Still an enjoyable watch, if you dont expect more than a good B movie..","Seen it multiple times now and I really think that ""Snatch"" tries too hard to be funny and cool. It is the british wannabe brother of Tarantino. It does make for an enjoyable watch though, but the style over content attitude becomes tideous at some point. Still it is funny at times. A lot of action, you wont get bored. And there is some good acting by Brad Pitt amongst others.A diamant gets stolen. And stolen again. And again. That's the story. Next to that there is another ""storyline"" in which Brad Pitt needs to go down in a boxingmatch in the 4th round to please some gangsta boss. But he wont go down. And he wont go down again. A lot of chases, threats and shootouts is what follows.The speed of ""Snatch"" is suited for kids wiht ADHD. The cussing is suited for whoever likes it. It looks like a trailer for a movie instead of being a movie itself because the speed of this thing is so fast that it becomes boring at times. As I said I have watched it multiple times already, so there is definitely something that is enticing, but there is something lacking also. Good B movie, for those who prefer style over content. And there is definitely a market for that. Me being one of those people, because sometimes I just like to see a mindnumbing action movie. When I watch it with that attitude in mind, ""Snatch"" is rather enjoyable...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

snatch.,"This is seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen.  In my opinion it is WAY better than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  All the characters are developed and explained well and no two are the same.  I actually felt emotion for the main characters, unlike in Lock, Stock.. and I loved all the characters a lot more.  (Dennis Farina is the BEST.)While watching this movie I was constantly wondering what Ritchie was going to come up with next and I wondered that until the last frame.  This is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen because of the way the movie takes its comedy so seriously.  The comic moments are real and not designed to make you laugh on purpose, unlike most comedies.  You laugh about other people's misfortunes and the way they meet their demise and if a movie can do that; it's a winner in my book.  The only character that I didn't laugh at when they got theirs was Brick Top and that was because he was the only non-funny character. (I also love the ""making fun if other people's accents"" humor... and the ENGLISH English language is funny no matter what they say.)9/10 and possibly more if I didn't have such a high standard for movies.

"Sharp, stylish, and fun- ""Snatch"" is Tarantino-lite","Somehow, this movie is ranked #93 on IMDb's list of the best movies ever made. I don't quite agree with that, but Snatch is certainly a fun time to be had.Snatch is a movie about two guys who help run an underground boxing circuit. Through a lot of hijinks, they end up getting involved with jewel thieves, dangerous gypsies, and mob bosses.Ritchie's talent is obvious. He writes funny and irreverent dialogue and has a very in-you-face directing style that fits right in with the tone of the movie. The pace of the movie is constantly in overdrive, meaning that the viewer is always engaged.If you take the wit and color of Ocean's 11 and combine it with the excessive violence and fractured story of Pulp Fiction, you end up with Snatch. That's pretty high praise, and the movie deserves that praise.When the credits roll, you haven't learned very much about the world, or about yourself, but you had a good time. Snatch is a light movie, and a fun movie. If that's what you want, this is a movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The most pretentious film I've seen in a long time,"I really did like Guy Ritchie's debut ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", but ""Snatch"" is really over the top. It has some funny moments, but all in all, this is not a good movie.First off, as many critics and viewers alike have citied, this is pretty much the same movie as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". I'm sure people who liked this film will argue that I'm wrong and that's just a generalization, but the two films are so alike, its not even funny.Secondly, Ritchie has taken his ""hip"" style to the utter extreme, here. I enjoyed the way Ritchie subtly used his quirky camera effects and quick shots in 'Lock Stock', but the key word here is ""subtly"". In ""Snatch"", he goes for the overkill and the whole movie ends up feeling like a 90 minute music video. It was so bad that I honestly felt like walking out of the theater only 10 minutes into this film. The whole film felt like a giant forced exercise in pseudo-coolness for the MTV generation. Christ, I was surprised not to see Kurt Loader or Carson Daily standing anywhere in the film, holding a microphone with screaming fans in the background. As you can expect from this description, it is filled with so many shots that just scream ""Hey, look at me. I'm Guy Ritchie. Look how cool this shot is. I'm so cool"". Reminded a lot of that modernized ""Romeo and Juliet"" movie that came out 4 or 5 years ago (with DiCaprio and Claire Danes). It's dumbed down, wannabe slick, cool and hip entertainment for people who like to think they are above, say ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" or ""Scary Movie"", but are certainly well below the works of David Mamet or The Coen Brothers.Thirdly, this film seems very stereotypical to British culture. I would be very surprised a British born director would give his characters such fake brit/cockney tripe dialogue if I wasn't already aware that this film was so obviously made with an American audience in mind. I would also have a very hard time believing Guy Ritchie was really British at all and wasn't just an American posing as a Brit if it weren't for the fact that his American characters in this film were just as fake and badly stereotyped. Brad Pitt wasn't half as bad as I thought he would be, but he certainly wasn't funny, unless you happened to be a North American male in Junior High that still thinks that a stereotyped British accent alone is funny enough. And Benecio Del Toro's fake (insert nationality here of which I honestly can't remember in the slightest) accent was even worse, in my humble opinion.That's not to say this was a really bad film. I did laugh several times and enjoyed the scene's with that big, tall, brute hit-man guy that was also in 'Lock Stock', but all in all, this was a very pretentious and useless re-hash of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and I'm not impressed with the masturbatory filmmaking direction Ritchie has taken. I'm aware that Ritchie was a TV Ad director before deciding he was a filmmaking protege, but that doesn't give him an excuse for making a film like a TV Ad (let's just hope that Spike Jonze doesn't make the same mistake).  Nothing worse than a show-off filmmaker, just ask Brian DePalma's and Oliver Stone's critics. I give it a 5/10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Amusing Crime Story,"I went to see ""Snatch"" by accident due to confusion over movies listings.

My friend thought it was very music video style.The ethnic references were vaguely unsettling, including Benicio Del Toro's exaggerated Yiddish accent and a prominent menorah in the diamond dealer's office -- oh yeah we Jews all keep Hanukkah ritual objects around the office.But gypsies (or maybe they were Irish Travelers) were probably also unsettled at being used for jokes.I did like that the American movie stars were secondary to the Brit character actors and there's no corny romance.It is an amusing hour and a half or so.(originally written 1/28/2001)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Snatch will be a moderatley good late night movie 3-4 years from now, but right now - fuggedaboutit.He tried, as in LS&2SB, to interweave several seemingly disparate stories into the one.

Superb!,"What an excellent film, I personally think it is better than Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (which is also superb!).People (majority of Americans) slate this movie saying it is a complete Pulp Fiction rip-off. This is rubbish, Pulp Fiction flitters between storylines, like Snatch does, but in a different time order. For example Vincent and Julius in the cafe being the final scene, but in the scene before Butch killed Vincent. Snatch does focuses upon storylines of a certain number of people, but does not flitter between time.Brad Pitt puts in a great performance here, one of his best ever. Yes you can't always understand what he says, but that is part of his character being a 'pikey'.An extremely funny and clever film deserves its place in the IMDb top 250 despite what some people say!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A movie that has it all,"First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens on screen without it having an effect on the plot. By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once. There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points. Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully. The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying ""Zee Germans"" and things like ""It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?"" quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
That's Guy Ritchie.,"One of Guy Ritchie's best works. Dozens of nominations and awards, received quite deservedly. In the film, we are introduced to two unsuccessful thieves who decided to get rich at a price. If you are already familiar with the works of Guy Ritchie, then you can imagine what awaits the viewer in the future, what complex plot weaves and denouements will be ahead. All the events of the film take place in a typical British city and its surroundings, with all the resulting groupings, nationalities and confessions. For example, our new acquaintances Tommy Gan and Turkish are side by side with other authorities of the criminal world. This neighborhood will bring them a lot of problems in the future. But the more problems there are, the more interesting it is to wait for their resolution.Again, I would like to say that in this film Guy Ritchie is felt from the first to the last second. By the time of the denouement (if you are not familiar with his works), you will be simply shocked at how everything is connected to each other.I highly recommend it for viewing to all my friends and acquaintances.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Jolly Good,"A hodgepodge of plot lines comprise this comedy about the low-lifes of London, featuring characters such as ""Franky Four Fingers"" and ""Boris the Blade."" Ritchie's followup to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is far superior because he has much better script to work with. As with the earlier film, Ritchie goes a little overboard with his hyperactive camera-work, but is not as distracting because of the amusing situations and funny dialog. The running joke is that nobody can understand boxer Pitt's Irish Gypsy accent; ironically, to those outside Britain, it is hard to understand what most of the characters are saying.

"WiTTY, SaRCaSTiCaLLY FuNNY *8/10*","Tag-Line (EUR): ""SNATCH- now you see it, now you dont!--you wha-?""Snatch was voted the best film of 2000 in the United Kingdom, and stayed a favourite for months in the charts of Europe too. The build upto this film was more anticipated in England and Europe than it was in the US, because of the initial impact of Guy Rithice's recent 1998 independant release of ""Lock, Stock & Two-Smoking Barrels."" Snatch uses pretty much the same script plan as Lock, Stock, only with a much larger budjet at hand, as well as some big hollywood names in the pan. The film's identity is dogged down with the appearance of Bennico Del torro (FRANKY-FOUR FINGERS), & partly by Brad Pitt (MICKEY). But somehow in an odd way, Pitt balances out nicely and does the film jusitce with his exellent take to a seedy pikey (Irish-liek slang, but either Irish or English dialect) accent, and dodgy make-over. Dennis Farina (COUSIN AVI), without making any offense...does a great, if not comical job of portraying the frustrated, greedy American/Jewish diamond jewller intent on getting things flow his own way, fed up with the constant ""alienation"" from his much-loved artificial world of ritches, facing upto a hunt into the heart of the seedy British underworld.

Terrific,"Obviously influenced by 'Pulp Fiction' but this is a brilliant and original film in its own right. Featuring a terrific cast of many known and not so known actors all creating a character that you will remember and be able to quote by the time the movie ends. That makes repeated viewings all the more fun. Also featuring a clever screenplay and a stylish and very creative direction from Guy Ritchie. Far, far surpassing his feature debut - 'Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels' - in almost every way imaginable. Here the deliciously absurd tone and painfully funny dark humor is spread throughout the entire film, which is where 'Lock, Stock' was thrown off balance. It tried to combine humorous elements with scenes that were just plain old grim. A superb array of interlinked characters who help the movie flow seamlessly. This is also Brad Pitt's finest hour in my opinion, despite being unintelligible for almost the whole film! You watch the film and your loyalties for the characters changes as the film progresses, basically wondering how it can work out OK for all the characters, you won't be disappointed by the ending though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of those films that will always be great,"If you haven't seen this film yet then go and rent it now. It is a must see for anyone with a good taste in films. I know that people's opinions are supposed to be just that; opinions. But this film is just brilliant. Fact. I can't understand how you can't like this film. Perhaps the accents will be a bit too much for Americans. I remember seeing an episode of Ripleys Believe It Or Not in which they used subtitles for an interview with an English woman. So I'm thinking that the Americans might have a bit of issue with the English accent. But it shouldn't be that much of a problem. While we're on this subject I have to say that Brad Pitt absolutely butchered the Irish accent but its OK because it was funny as hell. The only other problem I can think of that people may have with Snatch is the violence. It doesn't bother me in the slightest but I guess that some could be put of by it. Even if you don't like violence in movies I would still recommend that you see it, give it a try. In conclusion this film is hilarious and has a great story with many unsuspected twists.

Snatch and its' off the wall characters will make you laugh,"*Please note that I do not feel I have given any of the important or ""good bits"" away in my review, but I do have a lot of detail in it, so if you are into watching movies without details about them beforehand (wait...why are you reading reviews then ??), then you might want to skip this one !*I've never seen such an eclectic group of actors, as well as characters, that worked so well together.  Snatch brings together Hollywood major-leaguers Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, and Dennis Farina and throws them into an off the wall British comedy with hilarious results.Loosely, Snatch is about a diamond heist, gone horribly wrong.Frankie Four Fingers (del Toro) and friends pose as Hasidic Jews to steal an 84 carat diamond in Antwerp.  The plan is for Frankie to take the diamond back to New York (via a stopover in London) and give it to Avi (Farina).However, he is waylaid in London by Boris the Blade, whom he goes to for a gun. Boris is tipped off by one of Frankie's collaborators (who just happens to be Boris's brother) about the stone, and about Frankie's gambling addiction (how do you think he came to be minus a finger ?).  Boris devises a plan to get the diamond for himself.Enter a slew of characters that are as hilarious as they are diverse:Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee), petty thieves running a not-entirely-reputable pawn shop, and their oversized getaway driver (`What the hell can he get away from ?' Vinnie asks Sol at one point) Tyrone (newcomer Ade);  Brick Top (Alan Ford),  a vicious modern day gangster that arranges (and rigs) all kinds of illegal fights (of both the animal and human variety);  and last but certainly not least Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephan Graham), partners (but not the kind that `hold hands and take windy walks,' as Turkish puts it) in running an illegal bare-knuckle boxing ring.What follows is so fast-paced and intertwined that it is hard to describe it.In short, Tommy has to buy a new caravan-cum-office for Turkish from some low-brow gypsy types, and ends up getting ripped off.  So he puts his boxer Gorgeous George up against one of them and losesso badly in fact, that for several minutes he thinks Gorgeous is dead.  Turkish and Tommy have to inform Brick Top that they've `lost Gorgeous George' (`How the hell can you lose him ?  It's not as though he's inconspicuous, now is it ?'), which puts them in his debt, not a good place to be.  They make a deal to replace Gorgeous with the Pikey (a derogative term for the gypsy-trailer trash type that he's one of) that knocked out Gorgeous, and Brick Top insists that the Pikey throw the fight.Intertwined with that, Doug `the Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid) informs cousin Avi that Frankie Four Fingers is going to be at that illegal boxing match. Avi is so furious with the idea that Frankie will wager his diamond, that he flies to London to seek him out (and trust me, Avi loathes the idea of going to London) and stop him.  At the same time, Vinnie and Sol are set to rob Brick Top's bookies and get the diamond, when things really go to pieces. There is no money for them to steal, due to the fact that a fighter was replaced at the last minute, and they end up minus a gun and locked behind the security door, in what is claimed to be a mock-up of a true life robbery attempt here in the US.I'm really giving too much away here, but I loved this movie so much that I find it hard to keep it to a minimum when discussing it.  I haven't yet found a review that truly did it justice, and I'm sure I'm not doing much better.  But trust meeven if you're not `into British humor' you'll love Snatch.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

7 on snatch,Snatch is an experience of an experiment on film showing fast editing from shot to shot with a continuous slow pace on the film.

"Snatch versus Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.","Did anybody out there prefer Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels? Although I, myself, am a big fan of Benicio Del Toro, and Brad Pitt was excellent, I thought the predecessor had a slightly more raw quality to it, as it was not quite as polished off as the Hollywood version.Albeit, Snatch may well have been funnier, but I'm always one to tip my hat to that which presented the really original idea in the first place. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels was absolutely its own thing, and therefore gets extra points from me. And seriously, nobody beats Sting. And I also thought Vinnie Jones' character had an extra irony to it when he was always trying to set a good example for his son while beating in people's brains. Also, that ending scene to LSTSB was terrific.A lot of what made Snatch so great was the cinematography, but a lot of that was directly taken from LSTSB, as was the juxtaposition of subject matter and music.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Everything that Fight Club tried to be,"This movie will blow you away! Although in essence, Guy Ritchie has just made a slicker and more creative version of Lock Stock, this is a movie that feels far superior to the original.The plot balances humor, tragedy, violence and just plain ""gangster-cool"" perfectly, and has a complete air of unpredictability from start to finish.The general standard of acting is high, with Vinny Jones showing a great improvement over his Lock Stock performance and Brad Pitt stealing just about every scene he features in.To summarise: If you want to see an intelligent, fast paced and funny film and can stomach the violence and ignore the fact that it is a clever rehash of it's prequel, then you will have a ball!And if Fight Club disappointed you, then get yourself down to see Snatch!

Make sure you grab it!,"Snatch - Guy Ritchie and the cast and crew should grab a load of Oscar nominations for what is the best film to come out of the UK since...Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.If you enjoyed Ritchie's previous work, then you're guaranteed to like this cleverly interwoven tale of diamonds, dogs, dodgy geezers and dead bodies. You'll even notice some striking similarities to Lock Stock, as once again we see Vinnie Jones modifying someones skull in a car door!However, there's plenty of new twists and turns to the tale, and far more humour than I was expecting, which the whole audience seemed to enjoy enormously. Brad Pitt does well in his role as One Punch Mickey, but be warned, you'll find it difficult to understand anything he says, but this is all part of the plot.Without doubt, some Politically Correct interest group will bleat on about the potential racial stereotyping of gypsies, but it's a film for God's sake, and a very good one at that.

"Style over content, but manages to work","With the initial fear that Snatch would serve as little more than a Lock, Stock part 2, I was pleasantly surprised by what turned out to be a better acted, and in places, better paced second film by Guy Ritchie. Although at times the editing does much to jar the flow of the story, it still manages to hold the attention, and provides a number of great set pieces and laughs. Praised for his first foray in front of the screen in Lock Stock, Vinnie Jones goes one better in this film with an extremely good cameo. It is also great to see the underrated Benicto Del Torro in use, all be it under-used yet again. Brad Pitt manages to work a great comedy performance out of his boxing pikey, and, with the labourious Nick Moran and the ridiculous Dexter Fletcher dropped for this film, the acting seems alltogether more professional and more believable at every level. Ritchie shows more flashes of inventiveness, and with an amazing finale, Snatch will undoubtedly stand on its own merits rather than being dismissed as formaliac under-performance from all involved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, eh eh, eh eh, cuba cuba cuba cuba...","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsGuy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock opens with Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) two unlicensed boxing promoters getting roped into rigging a bare-knuckle fight with feared local kingpin Brick Top (Alan Ford.) They find a contender in the shape of loose-cannon Irish gypsy One Punch Mickey O' Neill (Brad Pitt) who doesn't play up to his part of the deal, setting off a violent chain of events. Juxtaposed with this story is one of a diamond thief and gambling addict called Frankie Four Fingers (Bencio Del Toro) who has gone missing in London. Interested in finding him is American head honcho Avi (Dennis Farina) who enlists the help of feared local goon Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) a hard-man with an inexplicable love of Madonna's hit single Starlight. These are just some of the crazy characters that fall into this crazy equation.I went out my way to see Lock, Stock when it was released a few years earlier, so why I've waited this long to finally see Snatch for the first time I don't know but now I have, as well as seeing the other non Ritchie Brit gangster flick Layer Cake a few years ago. Having seen it, I'm surprised actually how this ended up with an 18 and Layer Cake was awarded a 15, despite the violence actually being considerably worse in that film. Sure, there is a scene where a guy blows his brains out and we see a load of blood splatter on the wall, but to a sensitive 15 year old, that could just be explained as a tin of paint exploding, as opposed to the actual blood laden shootings we do see in Layer Cake. There's also the big hand chopping scene I'd been built up to in this film but that turned out to be a big non event.As for the actual quality of the film itself, we do have a very impressive gangster film on our hands here, with very intricate characters in a very intricate story. A lot of Brit gangster films get accused of trying to copy American films like Goodfellas or the Godfather movies, but Pitt himself wanted a role in this. As well as him, the film has a whole colourful cast of recognizable faces.Despite all the swearing and violence going on, the film somehow manages to maintain a very light-hearted tone through-out, with some very funny characters in the shape of the incompetent black yardies (and their dog!)

This director has obvious potential but he's gotta get away from this format that he seems to have and kinda innovate and variate on his style.

I feel sorry for the jewlery store owner and his friends though. Glad to see a Brad Pitt movie without Julia Roberts in it. I hate her.

"In 1983, Sonic Youth said: ""confusion is sex"". Well in 2000, ""confusion is snatch""!","""Snatch"" is a movie that I wanted to see for a long time because I heard a lot of good things about Guy Ritchie's movie. So I watched it and I must say that I was absolutely amazed. I mean that I didn't feel happiness but disappointment, a big disappointment...However, at first, ""Snatch"" is a promising movie thanks to a catchy story. In short, it deals with a pursuit around a priceless diamond in which (too many) characters and a dog are involved.But the main problem of ""Snatch"" resides in its screenplay. The quality of the screenplay is identical as Brad Pitt's way of speaking in this movie (he acts a gipsy who's keen on boxing). It means that the screenplay is so confused that it makes the movie hard to follow. You could even think that the plot is non-existent. Indeed, instead of following the unifying thread of the main plot, you feel that the movie is divided in several individual little plots apparently without any link. The screenplay is also muddled due to an important number of the characters.Moreover, Guy Ritchie obviously wanted to make a black comedy. This is in itself a good idea but here, we deal with a black humor that isn't very well exploited. So as a consequence, you don't laugh a lot.As for Ritchie's directing, well we can say that it's lively, maybe a little too lively to leave the movie an impression of botched up in spite of interesting and clever ideas. Ritchie must have been influenced by ""Fight Club"" (1999) by David Fincher because his making contains likenesses with Fincher's making in the quoted film.At the end, ""Snatch"" is a disappointment and an unfunny movie.

Too Much Can Sometimes Be Enough,"1 September 2000Guy Ritchie's SNATCH is a movie that has a complex plot that not a lot of people will understand or be able to follow. There are also so many characters and different side stories which makes it hard to cope on the main situation. You want to know these characters but it's difficult when we get a thorough and detailed look at 15 different people. The viewer has to pack in so much information minute by minute so it quickly gets tiring.The most interesting segments of the movie is where humour is included but don't get me wrong this is not a comedy. Brad Pitt's accent sounds hilarious because of how unintelligible and in genuine it sounds. It feels forced but I still have to give him props for taking a difficult role which requires to talk with a heavy and unfamiliar accent.The violence is present in the dialogue, ""pigs eat bones like butter"" for example. Most of the characters are heartless and would do the most horrific acts. It also gets very physical, especially during the fights that Brad Pitt's character takes part in. Very similar to ""Fight Club"", bare-knuckle boxing.The problem with SNATCH is that it goes too far in it's character development, storytelling and direction. It has a plot that is very hard to follow because there seems to be so much going on that the viewer ultimately gets lost. I cannot recommend ""SNATCH"".",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
finally a brilliant film from Hollywood,"this is probably one of the best films of the last decade.Snatch is new, refreshing and quick.

I hope these kind of films are the new trend for the hollywood films, because then there is hope. brad pitt has saved his career with this film, and after seeing the fight club he has become one of my favorite actors. if he keeps making films like snatch and the fight club. the same goes for Vinnie Jones. he just maked a film called the mean machine. it's a remake from the longest yard, and it is very rare that i find a remake of a movie better than the original. go and check it out.greetings from Gijs and the rest of the Netherlands.p.s. e-mail me what you think of the movies i wrote about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"""Less entertaining in the third time.""","The first time I saw ""Snatch"" three years ago, I was intensely amazed. It's a unique fine film, one of a kind, but it was then when I haven't seen ""Lock, Stock"" and now that I've re-watched both films in order, I realized that ""Snatch"" wasn't the first film with this theme, although it was both directed by Guy Richie. So I've decided that they're equally great, and I'm putting it one notch below my original rating to be fair, but it will remain on my all-time favorite films and it will never leave that list. I very much enjoyed this film, but I must say it wasn't as exciting as the first viewing, it's my third time watching it. There are films that even though how many times you've seen them will still remain as effective and fresh like the first viewing, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Fight Club"" which I have repeated the most. And there are some films that are effective in the second viewing, like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" which I've re-watched recently and I was more into it than the first time, it's maybe because I wasn't in the right mood then. ""Snatch"" is still a clever film, a brilliant creation by a creative director, Guy Richie. ""RocknRolla"" is my highest rated Richie film, and maybe I need to watch it again and see if it's still as great as it was a year ago, the reason I loved it very much although it's now a familiar theme and it's only a recycle of his first two films, is because I missed the style and the almost-clever-more-lucky characters that he has in this kind of films.

Snatch,"The English wind has a faint chill that makes me feel chilly just looking at it. In the company of the violent wind, he watched unconscious episodes of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Cigarettes, a personal classic. Standard London gallows humor, and even the plot design is strikingly similar, without much scrutiny, but Vinnie Jones's villain in both films slings his head with a car door when lecturing. If you only watch one of them, you may not have such a comedy effect. When you watch two of them together, and see the same actor playing the same character and doing the same actions, the strange sense of joy will automatically come out from your body. The so-called humor, maybe this is also a kind of, many years after a movie to help you recall the scene, and then secretly happy, just because it can not be said with people black humor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It's just that. Just a story.,"Snatch is shorthand for ""convoluted plot, unintelligible dialects, quirky styling, superficially gratifying, and wildly entertaining film-making."" Indeed, Guy Ritchie's 2000 follow-up to the fan-favorite Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels follows a familiar formula, delivering a picture that's not exactly coherent but not particularly difficult to follow on a base level. Fortunately, there's little to Snatch beyond the surface, making it easy to digest despite the many obstacles that keep it from being more readily accessible in a traditional narrative style. Snatch interconnects two major plot lines, neither of which are of any moral, spiritual, emotional, or otherwise philosophically important structure or value; instead, the film cares only about the visceral aspects of the violent, corrupt, and complex world it weaves, a world where anything goes, a tone that's reflected in Ritchie's haphazard and highly kinetic but wonderfully effective visual approach to the material.Snatch follows two stories that interconnect by film's end: that of a stolen diamond and a series of fixed boxing matches gone awry. The former begins with the theft of a flawless and particularly large 86-carat gem by the skilled Frankie ""Four Fingers"" (Benicio del Toro), and he and the diamond become the object of desire by a broad spectrum of sleazy and unscrupulous individuals: American Avi Denovitz (Dennis Farina), hit man Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinne Jones), Doug the Head (Mike Reid), Boris the Blade (Rade erbedija), and assorted low-level goons. Meanwhile, illegal boxing promoter Brick Top (Alan Ford) has a rigged fight lined up, but when his underling Turkish (Jason Statham) sends Tommy (Stephen Graham) and boxer Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty) to secure him a new camper from a group of ""pikeys,"" George is severely injured in a fight with Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), leaving Turkish and Tommy with no choice but to ask Mickey to enter the ring as George's replacement.No matter the ins-and-puts of the plot; Snatch is more about the experience than the story, more about understanding the hows rather than the whys. Few films can succeed on style alone, and Snatch seems to go out of its way to prove itself the exception to that rule. Though its narrative isn't impossible to follow, it's moderately difficult for a myriad of reasons: borderline unintelligible accents, a plethora of main characters, varied motivations, interconnecting stories and fates, and a highly-charged and unorthodox visual style. All told, Snatch seems the epitome of a film destined to collapse under its own weight and convoluted collection of elements, but Director Guy Ritchie handles the entire spectrum of cinematic no-nos with tongue seemingly planted in-cheek, lending to the film a none-too-serious tone despite its dark and violent elements surrounding England's seediest Criminal underbellies and enterprises. Indeed, Snatch -- and Ritchie's other films -- is of its own personal style, a genre of its own, a film that can only be imitated but not duplicated, for few films enjoy such a mind-bendingly unique approach as this.Snatch is a product of style, and as such, elements other than story prove more valuable to the experience, and the movie benefits greatly from its collection of talent found on either side of the camera. Guy Ritchie's direction is fluid, an organic ensemble of elements that give the film a life of its own, and it's complimented by a frenetic and terribly loud soundtrack that jumps into the mix and injects an additional jolt of energy into the experience. Together, the film's look and sound define the high energy concept, and both help in equal parts to energize a picture that otherwise suffers from the aforementioned issues that would seem to spell certain doom for a picture that dared take itself even the least bit more serious than Snatch. On the other side of the lens, Snatch's entire cast turn in memorable performances within the context of the film. The accents are thick but the dialogue is witty, and each character seems fully immersed in the film's helter-skelter style. Brad Pitt is particularly engaging as the ""pikey"" fighter Mickey O'Neil who encapsulates the entire experience, speaking with a particularly thick accent that even the other characters in the film have a hard time discerning, but he also makes for the most complex character that suffers greatly but also reaps a particularly handsome reward. Snatch also enjoys wonderful performances from a combination of name stars (Jason Statham, Benicio del Toro) and plenty of character actors at the top of their craft (Dennis Farina, Alan Ford).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A very funny film with great characters.,"SNATCHThis is one of those movies that I was never really interested in watching because I couldn't stand watching Brad Pitt. I was never a Brad Pitt fan... Until I made a deal with a friend of mine. He hates Tom Hanks, but I said he had to see Saving Private Ryan. He said he would watch it if I watched Fight Club. I watched Fight Club and loved it, he still needs to watch SPR... he is putting it off well. Since then I have grown to like Brad. He has made some great films.Anyway... back to Snatch.I thought it was brilliant. A great comedy with plenty of action. I really liked Lock Stock so am not really surprised that I liked this.The film is about a diamond... a big diamond that it seems everyone wants. I would say the main character is a guy called Turkish. He is a boxing promoter, and a dodgy one at that. He makes a deal and fixes a match for a very dangerous man named Brick Top. Turkish gets a pikey named Mickey to fight for him as he knocked out his prized fighter, but Mickey does not like to play by the rules. Whilst all this is happening, there is still the small matter of the diamond that is being killed for by a few people and are chasing it around London.The story is kind of all over the place, but it is great... it is not hard to follow and it has some great comedy moments in there. I was laughing at the situation and the reactions of the characters.The cast list is also very impressive. It stars Jason Statham, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Brad Pitt, Alan Ford and Mike Reid. Yes, that's right... Frank from Eastenders. Everyone acts great in here. It is a proper cockney gangster story with a comedy twist. But this is definitely what you would expect from a Guy Ritchie film. It is as good as Lock Stock.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very funny and with some great characters.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One Of The Best Crime Movies Ever,"Three different gangs go after the same huge diamond...I'm really starting to like the genre. Don't know what Guy Ritchie has done before (besides Lock Stock...), to me he is just Madonna's new boyfriend. But this is one hell of a movie. The criminal point of view has never been so funny.I couldn't stop laughing with all the jokes and silly things. I've seen a cow that just doesn't die before, but when one of the criminals is shot (not gonna tell who) and doesn't die, it's hilarious, and it was a great touch not showing him as he agonizing.The black guys gang was the best, they could fail on everything they did and still come out alive.It was a good cast without first line actors, of course I'm not talking about Mr Pitt. His gypsy character was terrific, he had a mind of his own and didn't care about everyone else.And when you think the film has consumed every way out and is doomed to have a lame ending, something happens and there you are again watching bodies roll and a lot of people chasing the same stone.Also some of editing was outstanding, like when Dennis Farina flies to London and with the best scene of all, the car crash... I guess these people have 9 lives because when it seems they're dead, the come out again and again the rolling bodies...Enough talking, I'll give this one a 9/10 just because",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch,"Posh Tory public school boy roughs it up again as a faux cockney gangster geezer.After the success of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Ritchie has a bigger budget and more American stars but it is very much a kinetic rerun of his first movie which itself was a Tarantino imitation.The theft of an 86 carat diamond in Antwerp brings Franky 'Four-Fingers' (Dennis Farina) to London to retrieve it on behalf of a New York jeweller with connections to American-Jewish organised crime.Boxing promoter and arcade owner Turkish (Jason Statham) and his buddy Tommy (Stephen Graham) get mixed up with mumbling Irish traveller Mickey (Brad Pitt) who knocks out Turkish's fighter. This scuppers an underworld prize fight unless Mickey takes over as a replacement fighter.However Mickey refuses to lose in a rigged match. Add in some inept robbers, a dodgy Russian and some contrived criss crossing of various characters. Hey presto, another London gangster movie.Snatch is a jumbled up comedy heist thriller.

A smartly put together crime adventure,"Rating-8/10Snatch is a gangster film full of dodgy deals and of course crazy gangsters, from the mind of a true gangster film legend, Snatch manages to bring together a big cast and put them to good use whether they be an Irish bare knuckle fighter or a very crazy mob boss Snatch uses them all. I felt this film was just about a great and excellent movie, and here below is why.The story is smartly done and for a gangster film it is quite surprising as many would just have big gun fights and little dialogue, but because this is a comedy too the film contains some great lines and can be thoroughly enjoyed all the way through. I especially enjoyed the ending which was well done and all the build up to the end is crafted very well too, the film has no ""slow"" parts but can become a little repetitive in the middle part, but I think the ending puts an end to any parts that are less fun to watch.Jason Statham puts in a performance that is hard to judge, on one hand the character may seem un emotional, or maybe Statham was just being a bad actor here, but in any case it doesn't ruin the movie and goes quite well actually. Brad Pitt as the Irish boxer is hilarious and with his fast words to match his punches he makes this film flow nicely and makes it more fun than it already is. The cast is full of great faces from those who play Cockney traders all the time to New York mob bosses, the film has all the elements that a London based crime film needs to be great.Guy Ritchie over see's the entire project with style and grace and manages to yet again make not the first but the last of his epic gangster works. The script is one of the highlights of this film with such good lines and even words I swear he makes up, Ritchie delivers yet again and maybe even matches his work on ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". I liked the fighting as it seemed intense and real and even certain deaths kind of make you feel slightly disturbed as to the reality of the corpse's.The film is a bit simple it is fair to say and although I have praised the ending on this, the plot it follows is nothing new and sometimes even seems similar to Ritchie's past work. Some violence can seem unnecessary and only there to add a fear factor but I will stick by my rating that this film is a great film as I did truly feel the plot is smart toward the end, the acting is solid and overall it is fun and best not to just pick at constantly.Those who love a good gangster film will love this as it contains all the elements and packs a real punch that should make viewers enjoy it all. Film goers who like a kind of action movie with a comedic twist will also enjoy as it contains hilarious things at times with some truly great fight sequences that can put you on the edge of your seat too. Those that won't like it, basically anyone who dislikes gangster films or bloody violence, it is more of a rating thing I feel.I give this a 8/10, just about a great film, nowhere near superb but also far away from just being a simply good film, is it excellent. With this if you watch with a little cheeky smile you will surely enjoy this and even the horrific threats used throughout this film still don't seem to add much effect to your sense of enjoyment as it is all tongue in cheek. I believe Ritchie truly delivers here what we want to see, some more work in the future from Ritchie too because judging by this film , he is one smart writer and director.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

However, I was surprised to discover that this is actually an extremely entertaining film. Some of the quotes I heard in it still linger in my mind.

"ovie Review: Snatch (2000) - A Wild, Action-Packed Masterpiece Starring Jason Statham","Movie Review: Snatch (2000) - A Wild, Action-Packed Masterpiece Starring Jason StathamSnatch is a fast-paced British crime-comedy directed by Guy Ritchie that takes audiences on an exhilarating ride through the gritty streets of London's underground criminal world. Featuring a stellar ensemble cast, including Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, and Benicio Del Toro, this film stands out as one of the most entertaining and cleverly crafted heist movies of its time. With its sharp dialogue, dark humor, and intersecting storylines, Snatch delivers a thrilling cinematic experience that continues to captivate audiences to this day.At the heart of the film is Jason Statham's character, Turkish, a small-time boxing promoter who finds himself in over his head when he gets tangled in a diamond heist and an underground bare-knuckle boxing match. Statham's performance is both charismatic and commanding, marking one of his breakthrough roles that established him as a leading action star. His dry wit and cool demeanor make Turkish a relatable and likable protagonist, even as chaos unfolds around him.The plot of Snatch is brilliantly intricate, with multiple storylines intertwining in unexpected ways. The film follows several characters and their quests to obtain a stolen 84-carat diamond, each with their own motives and schemes. There's Franky ""Four-Fingers"" (Benicio Del Toro), a diamond thief with a gambling problem; Brick Top (Alan Ford), a ruthless gangster with a penchant for feeding enemies to pigs; and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), an eccentric Irish gypsy with unmatched boxing skills.One of the film's standout aspects is its unique storytelling style. Guy Ritchie employs a non-linear narrative structure, fast-paced editing, and quirky visual techniques that keep the audience engaged from start to finish. The use of split-screen shots, freeze frames, and quick cuts creates a sense of urgency and chaos, perfectly reflecting the unpredictable nature of the plot. R.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guy Ritchie's best one,"Snatch. I watched it the first time 2015, the second and third time 2016. I mean when Jason Statham plays an illegal box promoter and Brad Pitt a Yankee, what do you want more? I was so surprised about the story lines which cross each other. The film is just a masterpiece and one of my favorite films of all time! Statham had his debut also in a Guy Ritchie film: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But in Snatch he is much better and plays an important role. Of course Guy Ritchie made films like Sherlock Holmes or Codename U.N.C.L.E. but this flick is just a masterpiece.

The off-voice also becomes really unpleasant as we're no teens and we like to think sometimes. Now the pros, the better acting here is clearly delivered by Brick Top (Alan Ford a TV actor semi-unknown) he is funny and terrifying at one time. The second best is delivered by Vinnie Jones, a one-face tough boy actor but why should he change if he is good at it?.

None of the characters seemed conventional this time around. Ritchie takes the formula he used in his first film, and creates new, hilarious angles on them. Creativity wins in the end. We follow two mob groups, and they all intersect and scrap up within the final act of the film. There's boxing, and jewel thievery, and everyone trying to get the job done without being fed to hungry pigs (literally). While his last film was a tribute to Tarantino, this film, to me, seems like a parody of him.

"More of the same, but you can't complain about that","During one of the first scenes of Snatch, I got worried.  I was worried that Guy Ritchie was a fraud(well not so much a fraud as a fluke.)  While Franky Four Fingers and his crew were stealing the diamond in question, Ritchie utilized this cheesy camera technique of zooming in real fast while turning it at an angle, I looked like a bad music video, or someone trying to look like Guy ritchie, and it looked way to polished)not to be confuded with good)  Anyway, this turned out to be a misconception on my part, as the rest of the film blew me away.  Ritchie is certainly a talented, even revolutionary filmmaker. I keep hearing alot from critics about how his movies have too many characters, the plotlines are too convoluted.  I couldn't disagree more. Ritchie deftly rolls out story lines weaves them together, and keeps you guessing til the very end, all the while spewing out classic lines of dialogue.  His frenetic pace, although not at all traditional among the film community, is representative of modern pop culture, and works magnificently if only you let it. Anyway, I can't believe anyone would have a problem with being exposed to all these great characters anyway, Ritchie truly has a knack for creating awesome, fleshed-out and altogether sordid characters.  Even though some of the ones in Snatch were really just re-hashing of ones from Lock Stock, everyone has such an individual quality that makes them stand out on their own. Also, I really want to point out what a damn fine actor Alan Ford is, and that Brick Top is just about my favorite villain EVER.BludgeoN",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A gangsta/crime/comedy movie with a funny and and simple plot, that manages to deliver","I wouldn't say that ""Snatch"" is a groundbreaking movie, at least nowadays, but I am pretty sure that it was not even 20 years ago when it was first released. After I have watched the most recent ""The Gentlemen"", (which in my opinion has an improved formula), I have decided to travel back in time and give a shot to this gem.The plot is pretty simple, but at the same time very much curated: there are different storylines that eventually will collide by the end of the movie, in my opinion in an ingenious, but not very believable way. I won't be too harsh on some choices that the director made at the time, because in the end all elements combine well and the script just work as it is. The cast is composed by really good actors, and their interpretation is convincing. I appreciated in particular Brad Pitt, Jason Statham and Alan Ford, which completely stole the scene to all the other characters. Tyrone and Bullet-Teeth Tony and Boris the Blade were also a nice addition, but the rest, was pretty much unmemorable, including Guillermo Del Toro, that is in the fabulous intro, but then his character is never developed properly, a small disappointment for me.I loved the fast-pacing editing, photography is neat, there are a few very inspired and particular shots, not many special effects, no over-complicated and confusing camera pans, or zooms. From a technical perspective ""Snatch"" is simple, very much enjoyable and easy to follow. I wish that major blockbuster can return one day at this kind of simplicity, because in my opinion is very effective. It is clearly a solid formula that still work today after two decades.

Balls to the Wall Crazy Energy,"*Snatch *is an incredible comedy crime film. It is absolutely nuts and very high energy. It takes a lot of British crime tropes and mocks them. It's certainly mocking itself and using anticlimax and situational irony very well. It subverts your expectations and perfectly uses a multi-narrative to tie in two stories of diamond-stealing and an underground boxing ring. It's very confusing and hard to keep track of everything, paired with the *Fight Club*-esque quick editing, canted angles, and constant breaking of film rules. But, this confusing and chaotic energy fits perfectly with the psychotic characters and situations in the film. Everyone is guns blazing and rampant in the film, but with little direction, which leads to these funny situations where no one gets what they want and it.

Ritchie out does his previous effort and provides us with plenty more escapist gangster shenanigans with Snatch.,"I can remember seeing Snatch. for the first time and being a little confused; it didn't help that I saw it on commercial television and frequently had the then what seemed to be complicated narrative broken up by advertisement breaks. Since then I've seen it several times, uninterrupted, and it's just the sort of film that grows on you. The film is funny, it moves at an enjoyable pace but includes its fair share of long takes cranking up the bizarre atmosphere it has and most of the scenes are accompanied with some brilliant dialogue. This is classed as a British gangster film, despite its post-modern touches, but I feel it can hold it's own up there with the greats of the genre in that respective cannon.The funny thing with Ritchie's gangster films is that they rely on that message of entertainment. Ritchie's films are not about deranged and disgruntled post Second World War youths alá Brighton Rock and nor are they about fish-out-of-water individuals travelling to far off places to do battle against pornography and murder alá Get Carter  neither do they attempt to tackle issues to do with Britain as a whole such as the rise in prostitution (Mona Lisa) and globalisation twinned with the threat of the IRA (The Long Good Friday). No, Ritchie's gangster films carry an air of escapism rather than realism and very much keep the gangster in the world of their own, very much fixed on problems of their own.In its essence, Snatch. is similar to Ritchie's prior film Lock, Stock in the sense its about a collection of individuals whom are in debt to a more powerful, more ruthless criminal. That criminal here is Brick Top (Ford) and he is much more menacing than Hatchet Harry. The persons in debt are Tommy (Graham) and Turkish (Statham), a twosome instead of a foursome as seen in Lock, Stock. Then there are the little connections you spot such as Boris (Serbedzija) being able to 'get anything you like' similarly to Nick the Greek in Lock, Stock and the visual approach of the fancy transitions and thoroughly amusing voiceovers.Snatch. plays out like a noir infused electric shock; opening up with a voice-over in a gloomy room by the lead character and then hopping around sending us on a long and complicated journey which adopts a multi-strand approach. But this is not a pulpy detective story, even though it has several characters chasing a specific object, and it is not a study of seduction and betrayal. Snatch. covers a diamond heist and the resulting jewel getting mixed up in the crazy world Ritchie creates but more-so focuses on the two individuals of Turkish and Tommy in their ongoing struggle with Brick Top.If the British gangster genre relies on gritty realism and hard as nails characters wading through a seedy and down right nasty location in search of the truth then Snatch. perhaps ignores this and adopts the aesthetic of escapism. Erratic subtitles shoot across the screen to the sound effects of mock pistols firing; split screen telephone conversations that pop up and retreat again when someone speaks and wired crash zooms on the text written on the side of guns accompanied with bizarre sound effects make up this gangster film. Snatch. is not set in Newcastle circa 1971 what with its seacoal dispatchers and its chimneys and factories; nor is it post Second World War Brighton with its grimy looking streets covered in terrace housing and racecourses that turn into switchblade death-traps as a superpower struggles to re-build after the war. Snatch. is proud of where it's set and a lot of the grimy locations are accompanied with music that sounds sarcastic, the scene in which Tommy and George approach the Pikey campsite being one. Along with this, it has the audacity to make it all seem very funny.Two such examples where Ritchie suspends all reality in this film occur when an American diamond dealer is on the phone to the man that stole it, who is at a tailors - he is seen in several different outfits in very quick succession which is obviously impossible. The second example of which manipulates time in an equally carefree manner happens when Turkish explains hare coursing to Tommy  their conversation takes place over a series of cuts spanning three locations that I can only assume would've taken a fair amount of time to cover; it begs the question what they spoke about during the in-between cuts. The conversation starts at the campsite, covers the car journey and ends in a muddy field somewhere as Turkish explains something in very little time.But Snatch. will remain one of my favourite films; a sort of escapist gangster film that ties in elements of the gangster-heavy thanks to Brick Top's character but keeps the mood relatively light with characters you're not supposed to understand and others whose hapless journey through the underworld will see them in body bags; holding up a bounty hunter in a pub letting off extra loud blanks in moving vehicles. It's fast, it's abruptly named, it's quotable and it's one of my favourite films ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Perfection,"Everything about Snatch is perfect. The casting, script, storyline, creativity, editing, soundtrack and direction are all outstanding. I literally do not have a single fault with this movie, to me; it is one of the greatest examples of how a film should be made.The casting is brilliant, every actor transforms themselves into their character superbly, and there isn't a single actor who doesn't give a convincing performance. Snatch is so successful thanks to its flawless script, every scene is perfect with countless memorable one liners such as: 'In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?', 'Protection from what? ""Zee Germans""?', 'I'm sorry, I couldn't get the bin-noc-u-lars out in time' & 'You'll raise Hell. Never mind pulses'. It is hilarious one moment & tense the next.There are two plot points in the movie, the chase of an extremely valuable diamond and the organisation of an illegal underground boxing fight. It is a story that involves a boxing promoter, a fat getaway driver, a wheeler dealer who pretends to be a Jew, a diamond dealer, a gangster who feeds his victims to his pig farm, an aggressive Gypsie, a hit-man and a sneaky f****** Russian!The pace of this movie is spot on; it doesn't slow down from the first second to the last. There are so many different characters and the story switches between them often but not once do you get confused, which is usually very hard to achieve. It is so well made and the characters are that convincing and have so much depth that you feel for every single character. They are all likable in their own way. You can tell this is a Guy Ritchie movie straight away, his directors style is shown off to its fullest here. The camera angles, the edits, the sound effects & the soundtrack are all done to perfection.

More thoughtful than it might seem.,"Those content to see Guy Ritchie as an opportunistic poseur might be surprised at the range of references in his new movie - the British Hitchcocks (the plot is a mere excuse for a series of very funny music-hall turns, where practised comedians come on stage and do their thing); Godard (the gangster mechanics are constantly disrupted by digressions and alienation techniques); Melville (like 'Bob le Flambeur', this is an engaging portrait of the underworld as a (multi-cultural) community); Damon Runyon (characters are called things like Boris the Blade); Tex Avery (characters knocked down by speeding cars get up and into the action again); Altman (the varied plot strands).Obviously Ritchie hasn't the discipline (yet) to touch these masters, but he's cannier than we thought, and you can't argue (literally.  Yikes!) with a frequently uproarious film.  Vinnie Jones' development as an actor is a pleasure to watch, Brad Pitt is hysterical, and the Pavlovian responses to the word 'gambling' of Franky Four Fingers had me in stitches.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Do you like dogs?,"Cheeky short but sweet review.During a day of intense and resilient boredom I watched Snatch and Fight Club for the first time. Needless to say I had a pretty great day, and these two films immediately made it into my top 5.Exposing the hilarious nature of your everyday thugs and thieves is one of Guy Ritche's directing traits it seems, and this greatly unique screenplay and classic twisted comedy is something only he is capable of.As well as being (undeniably) one of Brad Pitt's Career highlights, this film uses clever narrative/ visual styles mixed with perfect casting and a more perfect soundtrack to form a gritty, unpretentious picture.Buy it, steal it, stream it, just do it now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

In this movie there are a bunch of thugs after a twenty-something carat diamond, and no one can seem to hold on to it for very long. A star cast guarantees wonderful performances and they deliver. The story by itself is great, but the cinematography makes the movie amazing. Especially during the boxing scenes, how the camera is slowed downed at just the right moment to see Brad Pitt flying through the air is classic. Not only that but the use of colors in the character's wardrobe no doubt depicts what a bunch of characters they are.

:::T0P Shelf,"Snatch is a Top Shelf movie. If you're a fan of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, then this movie is for you. Its got V.O.C. (Variety, Originality and Creativity). It dominates within its genre and takes pages from others. The characters have great depth in personality and are easy to fall for. The story is original, but for this day and age, the shock value lacks a bit, but is made up for through its original comedy, action, random dialog (including pi key language) and the twisty plot. SNATCH IS my favorite movie, you can tell by my email address. On a side note, this movie is one I can say none of my friends would ever enjoy if watching it with me. I kid you not when I say I've memorized every line and accent of this movie.

Call me Susan!,"I generally do not like this type of film and I hated Layer Cake and Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels was not too good for me either, but I actually think that Guy Ritchie found the right balance with this one.I'm not a fan of animal cruelty and in day to day society I don't think that much swearing is really necessary, but it's fine in this context, but I was glad that we didn't have to see all the other gory bits, it's best to leave it to the people that want to imagine it.A great cast, I was surprised by Brad Pitt's performance and I really enjoyed his take on the Irish, but I think the stand out star was Alan Ford.

The soundtrack is pumping, and even manages to fit in a (personal joke?) Madonna track.Every principle, of which there certainly are a few, turn in excellent performances, bringing their cartoon character gangsters to life. Bullet Tooth, Four Fingers, Brick Top? Do people really have names like these?Brad Pitt manages to invent a whole new language (pikey), Mike Reid shows he does have a life outside of Eastenders and smutty stand up, and there's even a chance for Ewen Bremner to roughly reprise his role as Spud in Trainspotting.Catch it before ze germans arrive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This Snatch is slippery,"Guy Ritchie, the Man Who's Married To Madonna, directed this movie about missing jewels in London's boxing underground. Played out in the Goodfellas vein, there are characters with colorful personalities to match their colorful names, including Franky Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth Tony, One Punch Mickey O'Neil, Boris the Blade, Turkish, and Brick Top. Stylish and violent - but not in an off-putting way, if you're a fan of the genre, Snatch is all about ice, doublecrossings, fights, guns, blood, guts, ah, the fun never ends.   Brad Pitt plays a pugilistic gypsy (he's ""One Punch"") who delivers a wonderful engaging performance, speaking his lines in an almost unintelligible dialect. You see, everyone in the film (except for Dennis Farina, who plays Cousin Avi from the U.S.) is British. If you've never heard any Briton speak other than the high-class West End junk that the Queen uses, you'll be in for quite of a shock here. But once your ear gets tuned in to the accents, you'll be fine. (Of course, Pitt's Mickey was given that garbled tongue as kind of a way for the writer to poke fun at Britain's own dialects, which are understandably tough for non-Britons to decipher.) There are fixed fights, botched robberies, a dog who may have eaten a diamond, carnivorous pigs, and a getaway driver who has trouble getting away. You remember when Quentin Tarantino reintroduced the caper-gone-bad genre with movies like Pulp Fiction and reservoir Dogs? This one carries the torch a little bit further, and it's carried by a solid ensemble cast that includes Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro (Frankie Four Fingers), Farina, and Pitt. The rest of the gang you might not recognize, but they're also not characters that simply dissolve into a scene, either. You know the kind - in a subpar gangster movie, all of the hitmen look alike. Not here. This is a cool, fun action film with panache and a touch of humor in the right places (sick humor, though).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Not as good as Lock, quite massively overrated","I get that at the time this came out, there weren't legions of such action packed convoluted rougher type comedies, but for crying out loud 'Lock' came out before this, by the same Guy Ritchie, and it was heaps better. If anything, strangely enough, it feels like Lock was the more mature film made some years later, not before.It's not as smooth in the action sequences, it's got too much talking that doesn't amount to much effect, pretty stupid braindead type dialog, supposedly witty but really completely forgettable banal lines, tries hard in many places; something like Brad Pitt's character was good in concept but honestly could've been much funnier in execution, they could've really made him sound hilarious when here he's just confusing to listen to.Where 'Lock' had lots of well incorporated subplots and micro-twists, this here gets overcomplicated too fast, too many characters, and the viewer can't be screwed to put in all that effort to remember insignificant details, as the film never makes it a point to warrant your full attention on every aspect of this very ordinary production. Too much focus demanded for far too little a reward.5.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

But that is ok, it's more a spitting successer than a rehash.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Finally. . .someone gets it right!,"I wanted to hate this movie.  I really did.  I didn't want to like a film that rips off ""Pulp Fiction"" so shamelessly.  I didn't want to like a film by someone who married the world's worst actress.  I didn't want to like a film with Brad Pitt in it.  I wanted to hate this film so much, but I wound up loving it.""Lock Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels"" was Ritchie's ""True Romance"".  ""Snatch"" is his ""Resevoir Dogs"".  Ritchie succeeds where all the other Tarantino wannabes fail for two big reasons.  First, because he is the only post-Tarantino filmmaker who even approaches Tarantino's intellect.  He knows it's not just about swearing and carnage.  It's also about new ideas and cool dialogue.  The second reason he succeeds where others fail is that he takes the now-familiar formula away from Los Angeles and to London, where he takes full advantage of the range of British dialects to be heard in and around town.The story involves a jewel heist, underground boxing, and the mobsters who run those enterprises.  The cast is uniformly great.  Dennis Farina is excellent as the jewel fence Avi.  Benicio Del Toro is just plain cool (as always) as Frankie Four-Fingers.  Alan Ford frightens as Brick Top.  And Vinnie Jones in the role of Bullet-Tooth Tony could teach John Wayne and Clint Eastwood a thing or two about being a tough guy.As to Brad Pitt: In the first half of the '90's he was a shallow pretty boy. In the second half, he was pompous and overrated, trying too hard to live down his looks.  But in ""Snatch"" he finally delivers a performance that I actually liked as Mickey, a gypsy boxer who seems at first glance to be only comic relief, but turns out to be a pivotal character.The film is not perfect.  One questions why everyone has a silly nickname, and some of Ritchie's stylistic flourishes serve only to distract from the story.But overall, the film is wonderful.  Six years after ""Pulp Fiction"" spawned countless bad rip-offs such as ""Romeo + Juliet"" and ""2 Days in the Valley"", somebody figured out how to do it right.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best Caper films ever!!,"I am a graduate of the director admirers theory in life. You like a few films the director does and you should find something redeeming in most of their works. I cannot even say I will watch a film for the actors alone. Like when I watched this film, I was more interested in the director than Brad Pitt being in it and I count myself as a Pitt fan (Seven, Fight Club, the first Ocean's Eleven). I wanted to see what this director could do (I had never seen his work), I had heard from my male friends that it was great but I form my opinions myself.It was to be a surprise and it turned out that it wasn't in the video collection so they went out and bought a copy at the local video store. Yes, Virginia, it is that good if you don't have a copy to show, you go out and buy another. So we settled in to watch the mystery movie.I have to say that through out the whole thing, it wasn't the story that got me so much as the angles. The cinematography was AWESOME. There were scenes that you would NEVER see regular directors trying. It was so beautiful. The story, let me get back to that, was fast-paced and frenetic. It was cunning and articulate.In the end, or near to it (I hope y'all know what moment I mean) I clapped!! I cared for the characters in a way that hasn't capture my emotions for a long time, maybe that is just the girl in me talking though....Its a good solid energetic film with the best cinematography I have seen in so many years.

Brad Pitt Shines in Snatch,"One of Guy Ritchies best movies along with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. First of all it is very well written by Ritchie himself mixing action with humor. There are several laugh out loud moments which are combined with gratuitous violence. The movie also has an excellent British cast along with Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro who both play very funny roles. Pitt plays a gypsy who is also a very good boxer and has a very funny accent while Del Toro plays a thief who has a gambling problem. There are several other characters who contribute to the humor in the movie and each character intersects with another in one way or another. The movie is very entertaining and the ending is clever. There was a great parallel action sequence in which the dogs chased a hare while in the meantime a few gangsters were chasing a thief. Overall the movie was very entertaining, funny, and had great action scenes with very interesting and varied characters. I also think this is one of Brad Pitt's funniest performances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

If you liked Fight Club...,"My reaction to this movie was a lot similar to fight club for various reasons. There is crime, intense violence, cool color pallets and brad Pitt fighting for sport. The story was not nearly as intellectual as fight club, it was just hard to follow. You have to know a lot of the jargon related to things like bookkeeping, betting and gypsies to understand the plot at all. I can't imagine watching this movie without subtitles because Brad Pitt's accent was barely coherent. It had moments of suspense but the intertwining of storylines was so overly complex that I wasn't invested in any particular character and I could really remember their motivations. I'm not really sure about the takeaway from this movie. There were no profound insights about life. There was no Jules from Pulp Fiction to quote the Bible, if you know what I mean.

It is one of the few film in which every actor shines, especially Robbie Gee, Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones. I could rave on about all the characters like Bricktop and Boris ""the blade"", but it would take forever, as there are so many to praise.

Guy Ritchie is the british Tarantino,"Although I don't consider ""Lock, Stock,..."" to be as good as ""Reservoir Dogs"", I believe ""Snatch"" is the brittish version of ""Pulp Fiction"", with different sense of humour and coolness. There's no Samuel L. Jackson in ""Snatch"" but there is a funny (and excellent) Brad Pitt; there aren't as many colours in ""Snatch"" as in ""Pulp Fiction"", but there's a lot more red blood (!); ... All these comparisons can be easily made between these two movies, but ""Snatch"" will never match up to ""Pulp Fiction"": this ""new wave"" of gangster movies is born right out of their time. And why does Guy Ritchie like to confuse the audience with a large-numbered cast? He did it in ""Lock, Stock, ..."" and he does it here again!

Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a fun watch with a pretty well written story and iconic editing sequences but is pretty simplistic in terms of its execution.Decent Direction (Able to progress the story forward and cuts the film very well, but pretty inconsistent in terms of setting tone and getting the most from his actors), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (The cast as a whole is judged as it was more of an ensemble effort for the characters to help progress the story forward (Some performances to highlight were Brad Pitt in his ability to play a Pikey very well and Jason Statham who is not his typical tough guy character (though he does show a bit of inexperience with his acting))), Good to Very Good Story (Does a good job in having the different parallel story lines converge at different points to show how they were all going after the same goal but in different ways), Good Screenplay (A bit repetitive at times but there were some good foreshadowing and symbolism that was surprising for a movie like this; also the jokes and dialogue were a bit simple, but it was overall pretty enjoyable), Good Score (really helped fit and set the tone for the movie), Good Cinematography (helped in setting the distinctive editing sequences, though the filter made it a bit hard to see the film), Pretty Good Sound, Great Editing (was a bit amateur at first but really helped in showing why the fast-cutting/hip-hop montage were a main-stay in the early 00s), Plot Structure was unique as it was different parallel story-lines converging at different points in the story with each having their own plot structure, Pacing was incredibly fast so it was a bit hard to keep up (though this was the point of the movie so it is fine with me), Build to climax was there; climax was definitely a memorable part of the movie given how it twists at what it was building at, Tone was very distinct in what it was trying to do but was a bit inconsistent in being set as it felt like it was trying too hard to play at both ends of the crime-comedy genre, the movie started off not that good but over-time it got better and better so it is definitely a slow burn that gets better the more the movie goes on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A British and crime caper classic,"Guy Ritchie's endlessly quotable crime comedy caper is such a joyous watch that it's not hard to see why it has become the renowned genre classic that it has established itself as today and is testament to the skill of Ritchie as a filmmaker that went missing for decade or so in the 2000's only to return once more when he took control of a certain well known British staple.Snatch is one of the finest ever examples of an ensemble comedy piece, every character both large or small feels totally brimming with life and personality and every single actor brings their A-game to material that must've been a blast playing out. Ritchie's script offers something new each time you watch the film, as it's witty and sarcastically tinged undertones keep the film fresh even to this day. It's a real credit to the makers of the film that a seemingly simple story of a particularly large diamond, some wannabe boxing promoters and a deceptively smart bunch of Pikie's works to the level it does. While Ritchie's direction is energetic and smooth, skills he would virtually perfect with his stylish Sherlock films, it is his direction of his actors which is arguably the biggest reason behind Snatch's success.It would be worth bringing up that action staple Jason Statham has never been better, his Turkish a character that remains his most memorable. Statham is both funny and appealing in his role and whether surrounded by the then up and coming Stephen Graham as his business partner Tommy or the vile yet incredibly memorable Alan Ford as the evil Brick Top, Statham is on excellent form. While Statham may be the glue that holds the story strands together every actor and their respective creation gets a moment to shine. Fantastic bit plays are produced by Lennie James as store owner Sol, Vinnie Jones as the tank like Bullet Tooth Tony and Rade Sherbedgia as determined Boris The Blade all shine but all are overshadowed by one of Brad Pitt's most memorable incarnations in the form of bare knuckle boxer Mickey. The way in which Pitt earned his role in Snatch is now a thing of legend and his barely understandable yet utterly awesome unwashed Pikie is a joy to behold and it's a credit to an A-lister to appear in such a low key production.A cleverly constructed and thoroughly entertaining film, Snatch is without a doubt one of, if not the crowning achievement in Ritchie's filmography. With one of the funniest comedic scripts in recent cinematic history and with a raft of memorable and unique characters, this is British film at its most recommendable and ridiculously entertaining.4 and a half anti-aircraft weapons out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Squeaky Keen,"First off, let me state that the first time I saw Pulp Fiction, I thought it was ""okay"" (I later upgraded my opinion to ""very good"", but that's beside the point). I didn't think Reservoir Dogs was all that fabulous.But I am a sucker for a good caper flick, and Snatch was that.There were moments when it seemed like Snatch was straining, or trying too hard, but it succeeded in being good, stylish, fast, furious, and above all FUNNY. Even the moments when it seemed Richie was trying too hard managed to be witty and make me (as well as the rest of the audience) laugh. As a matter of fact, I haven't been in a theater where the audience was this spellbound in the past year++, and I haven't been to a movie that I haven't been able to preguess within the first 15 minutes in a very long while. That's the first thing you might realize about Snatch, after the credits start rolling -- it sneaks up on you -- you don't even realize that you haven't even TRIED to think about how it's going to end -- it just flies too fast, and too furious. It's no Usual Suspects, but it isn't trying to be. It earns a solid 8.5 in my book. See this movie.

Guy Ritchie works his magic again,"I had no idea what to expect when I went to see this film.  I was happily surprised at what I saw.  Guy Ritchie is another director who knows how to use high quality music video style, snappy editing and directing.  Ritchie has written another wild, snarled plot in the tradition of Pulp Fiction. Actually, this film is extremely similar to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - identical would not be a stretch.  But Ritchie is not plagiarizing - L, S, and 2SB is his film also. Like Run, Lola, Run, the music video style is used here only where it helps the film, not impedes it.  The most inventive use takes us across the Atlantic in about 3 seconds - you'll have to see it to know what I mean. Almost all the characters have incredibly thick accents, requiring complete attention on the part of the viewer to catch the dialogue.  But that only adds to the overall quirkiness of the film.  All the actors are fairly good. The one who really shines, though, is Brad Pitt.  He wallows in his seediness in this film, and appears to love doing it.  His impenetrable Irish accent is really impossible to decipher, and creates some very funny moments. The other thing Ritchie plays with is time.  A spectacular scene where three cars and three story lines interact is done in reverse.  This scene is absolutely hilarious and very inspired. Warning note to guys:  This is quite the guy's film.  Think twice about taking a date with you to this one. With that said, I need to go reserve my copy of the video before it comes out.  10/10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Huh?,"""Snatch""...what a perfect title for a movie made by a guy married to Madonna...maybe someday he will cofeature it with Amanda Peet's ""Whipped"".Not to say there is not a lot to like in ""Snatch,"" at least the colorful characters, flashy editing and great sight gags.  I even found the dialogue witty, once I turned on the close captioning, so I could understand it. The best (and truest) line in the movie comes from Dennis Farina (""For a country that spawned the English language, you think somebody'd be able to speak it.""  The BEST English comes from the three blackand quite luckless thugs.  Is there a message here?  To complicate things even more, Brad Pitt, playing a gypsy, speaks a language even the Limeys don't understand.Perhaps it is just as well writer / director Guy Ritchie made ""Snatch"" verbally incomprehensible.  Certainly, there isn't too much to the story, which opens with a diamond heist and involves a predictable series of misadventures which follow.If you have a DVD player, be sure to rent the DVD; it has a very funny deleted scene involving Benecio Del Toro (Frankie Four Fingers).

A UK Tarantino film with fantastic dialogue,"I don't think I've ever watched a film where practically every single line of dialogue could make you laugh. After not being the biggest fan of Guy Ritche's 'Lock Stock', I watched Snatch out of morbid curiosity and I VERY much prefer it. Better characters, better plot and an overall funnier film, despite me not being the biggest fan of the style of storytelling carried over from his last film.Snatch is funnier than most comedies I've seen, and features Tarantino-esque back and fourths with a strong cockney twist to them that I think even non-British viewers would find a laugh.The only negative I'd say is Brad Pitt's gypsy character felt too forced. Of course mr Hollywood is going to play this overly anarchic badass traveller who can knock people twice his size out in one punch. I doubt he would have settled for anything less. Just a pet peeve, though, its still a good(?) performance and it serves the narrative, just a bit on the nose for me.Overall Snatch is a brilliant, hilarious watch that I'd definitely recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

An intelligent comedy with terrific characters and a well thought plot. May need to watch it a few times too truely 'get it'.,"I can't get enough of this movie, Snatch has to be the most well-thought out comedy ever to grace the screen.

Seen it before - but it's ok,"""Snatch"" is almost exactly the same movie as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". The similarities are so great that it's almost like watching the same film with a different cast. But it's ok, because this one is just as equally funny.The two leads scheme to get their hands on fat wads of money, but as the plot thickens, they just want to get out of it alive. In ""Lock, Stock..."" there's a bunch of young, witty blokes who want to earn big money but in the end just want to live through it all. There's a criminal leader of a spectacularly brutal kind who just wants everything his way and has underlings that carry out his wishes to the fullest. In ""Lock, Stock..."" too. A couple of smart but completely worthless small-time crooks are put into the plot to add a pivotal but seemingly meaningless (and funny) part in the whole criss-cross of events. That's almost exactly like in ""Lock, Stock..."", with the notable difference that the crooks in the latter are seriously stupid. The plot is advanced by a series of coincidences and strange twists that accelerate into a blur of weird events and finally comes to a halt just when it can't get much more insane. That is also exactly like in ""Lock, Stock..."". And then there's Vinnie Jones, who is not merely exactly like his character in ""Lock, Stock..."", he _is_ that guy, he just has a different name and a bigger gun.But, like I said, I don't really care. Both movies are very, very funny, and extremely entertaining to watch. It is excellently filmed and cut (or should I say ""mixed""?), and some shots are just breathtaking. The details, like the dog swallowing the squeaky toy or ""the fact that I have 'Desert Eagle point five-oh' written on mine"", are just so insanely funny, it doesn't really matter that Ritchie seems a bit stuck in a loop. Why change a concept that works? But let's hope that he can do something about it to the next time, or it _will_ get repetitive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Another helping of great, AAA+++ Guy Ritchie nonsense, better than many films","I've said it before in another review of one of Guy Ritchies films, you either like them a lot or you hate them a lot. There is nothing vanilla about Ritchie. Me? I'm a sucker for them (well, most of them - I wasn't too taken by his King Arthur effort, but that's for another time).In one way Ritchie, more or less, tends to make the same film. Each has a slightly different 'story' but who cares: it's a great film and you go away - metaphorically as I've just watched this on Netflix lying in bed - after a lot of enjoyment.There's an irrepressible energy about a Guy Ritchie film, a dark humour and more then enough Brit-style jokes to entertain most of us. That, of course, if you like his films, but I've already admitted that I do.This one is his standard convoluted mash-up of about ten plots which all somehow fit together and are all somehow resolved. It's all presented in a - well, I was going to write 'punk' style, but there's more than a touch of sophistication in his direction and cinematography, so 'punk' would be wholly misleading.But what the hell. You either know what I'm talking about or you don't and if you do, you either love it or you don't. If you do, go for it. If you don't I can't see you and I mixing much socially, either.Oh, should perhaps mention that it features several of Ritchie's stalwarts but also no a few top-class Hollywood names, and they are not about to lend their talents for any old nonsense. And they don't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
best black comedy ever,"What can I say. It's been ages since I've had the opporotunity to feast my eyes upon such an elaborate masterpiece. With whacky characters, all with unique and hilarious personalities, the film excels in demonstrating how greed can drive humans of all sorts to such extremes as dismembring limbs, feeding people to pigs, and burning down caravans. The brightest point in the film is without a doubt Brad Pitt playing Micky, a bare-knuckle boxing gypsy. His attitude, facial expressions, and strange,almost ununderstandable accent will keep you laughing from the first meeting between him and Turkish, to the startling climax at a boxing match. The rest of the movie which includes a man with a briefcase attatched to his arm, crude gangsters, and a dog will leave you with a complete feeling of satisfaction despite the questionable overabundance of violence.

"Funny, but not funny enough to illegitimize its violence.","An atrocious comedic drama which glamorizes criminal activity, violence, and almost mind-numbingly pervasive profanityI had a hard time finishing it. Rest assured that your potential for gaining new insight or finding life-enriching meaning of any kind is slim to none; you definitely will not be uplifted. Even just measuring it in terms of simple entertainment value, its wit & humor don't come close to compensating for its violence. The kinds of flashy bloodshed and theatrical cruelty which are found in films like Snatch desensitize fragile minds and corrode morals in a way that, yes, does in fact facilitate real-world violence.Brief example: the film's analysis of the efficiencies of pig farms for human corpse disposal - some people inevitably walked away reflecting on the strengths & weaknesses of different corpse disposal methodsa topic in which they would not have otherwise invested mental energy. I just wish we could have more honest conversations with ourselves and each other about the impact the media to which we expose ourselves has on us individually, and on those among us who are most malleable. Not to be preachy, but that there is any real market for this movie ought to be unsettling to those of us who value human life; this film almost entirely implies that it is worthless.

A classic,I could not as for more from a film that what has been seen in Snatch. If you look at the ratings I've given there are only three films I have ventured to give 10 and this definitely deserves to be one of them.The plot is confusing initially as are many Guy Ritchie films but stick with it and you won't be disappointed. A priceless diamond was stolen from Antwerp by Frankie Four Fingers who stops in London on his way to New York. Russian ex KGB turned gangster Boris the Blade attempts to set him up by getting 3 small time crooks to rob the bookies he is in in order to steal the diamond. The bookies belongs to local crime lord Brick Top who is also looking to use the gypsy Mickey in a rigged boxing match. I told you its impossible to explain but if I talk any more I will give away spoilers and don't want to give it away.The acting is first class all round surprisingly. Jason Statham narrates the film as Turkish very effectively and performances from Alan Ford and Vinnie Jones stand out as some of the most convincing and the most hilarious ever seen in British film. You grow to love each character in their struggles.The directing is superb and builds on Ritchie's previous film Lock Stock but definitely far surpasses it. This truly is British comedy at its finest and I am proud to have the DVD in my collection so see this film on my highest recommendation.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"A decent watch, but I just don't get the love reviews...","Convoluted plot, fast paced (so fast, it's hard to bond with any of the characters, assuming you can follow them through the convoluted plot). If that doesn't make for enough audience confusion- be sure to turn on the subtitles. Without them, you'll be confounded by about 25% of the dialogue (Brad Pitt plays his character with a thick English-Scottish accent, further processed through a Roma/gypsy accent, and spoken fast and garbled. What he says IS accurately transliterated by the subtitles; but it's all but inaudible to the average American viewer. I can't imagine seeing this in the theater- it would be intolerable.

Ritchie favourite Vinnie Jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary Bullet Tooth Tony (a role it would seem is only a step away from his real life persona) and Russian actor Rade Serbedzija creates a simply classic character as arms dealer 'Boris the Blade'. Character actor Alan Ford makes for an exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark 'Brick Top', and Robbie Gee and Lennie James are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves.

"""In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?""","Snatch is Guy Ritchie's second feature film and a spiritual successor to his first film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It has a similar style, setting and mostly the same cast from that film. With some filmmakers this could risk being repetitive and failing to live up to a previous success. But fortunately Ritchie seems to improve upon what he did in Lock, Stock in every way remaining loyal in style whilst creating a wholly original and hilarious comedy.Its narrative is similar to something like Pulp Fiction, since there's no single plot that the film follows. Instead it follows many insane characters as they navigate the world of London crime and watch as their stories collide in to each other (both literally and metaphorically) as they try to do every crime from rigging boxing matches to stealing a 86 carat diamond.And seeing these characters interactions is definitely the best part of the film. Watching their over the top personalities collide is like watching a dark British version of old Looney Tune cartoons. Even if this film had no plot at all, it could probably be sold on these insane characters alone. To match their larger than life personalities, most of the characters will also have weird but memorable names including Borris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) a Russian gun dealer with the ability to dodge bullets and Brick Top (Alan Ford) a British gangster who rigged boxing matches and has an aggressive streak, chopping up any person who crosses him in to pieces and feeding them to pigs.But no character in the film is quite as bizarrely enjoyable as Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt). He's a Irish Gypsy traveller who is a bare boxing champion with the ability to knock his opponents out in one punch. He's given an Irish accent that even an Irish man would find hard to follow at points, largely in response to criticisms in the first film that many of the London accents could be hard to follow for American audiences. So this character was made so both the audience and other characters couldn't understand him. And he uses this to his advantage, setting up unfair deals and swindling all the English men out of their pockets.Even beyond the main characters, every side character are also very enjoyable. They seem to have a Coens Brother kind of charm to them when even if they were only on screen for 30 seconds, they kept you laughing so much in that short time that you'll still be able to leave the film thinking of them. Either because of the short dialogue having a distinct British charm to them or just because of great casting (like having a slow moving fat man as the getaway driver for a heist) that just ensures the characters all leave a lasting impression.Another great part about the comedy in this film is Ritchie is one of the few directors to still use the visual medium effectively to bring the laughs in his comedies. As smart and quotable as the dialogue in the film is (""Why do they call him the bullet-dodger?"" ""Cause he dodges bullets"") the films visuals are where Ritchie real skill takes over. The use of clever editing tricks like freeze framing on a stupid face or fast editing taking you off guard in a split second allows this film to have its own distinct mark on you.Out of all of his films so far this is definitely Ritchie's career high point. Its impressive soundtrack, instantly quotable dialogue and memorable visuals are both very enjoyable and easily re-watchable. It's quite easily one of my favourite comedies to come out in years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Don't Snatch!,"After the success of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Guy Ritchie quickly became hot property and a follow up film was expected. Ritchie decided on bringing the audience another comedy-gangster caper and he had the added clout of attaching big name stars like Brad Pitt and Benicio del Toro.Snatch tells multiple but interlinking stories set in the London underworld. A 87 carat diamond had been stolen by Frankie ""Four-Fingers"" (del Toro) in Antwerp, Belgium. He is sent to London to have it evaluated by the diamond dealer Doug ""The Head"" Denovitz (Mike Reid), for an American gangster Avi (Dennis Farina). Frankie is a meant to stay low but his gambling habits play havoc on that idea. Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) are organisers and promoters for underground boxing fights A ruthless gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) recruits them and demands that their fighter throws the fight so he could make a killing for his gambling empire. When Turkish's fighter is unable to fight he is forced to recruit an Irish traveller Mickey (Pitt) to be his boxer: but Mickey does not play ball. Boris ""The Blade"" (Rade erbedija) also wants the diamond and he hires two hapless criminals, Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee) to steal it from Frankie. But to do this they end up stepping on Brick Top's turf, who quickly becomes involve in the fight for the diamond.Ritchie as a writer has a limited range as a writer, he often does these mockney gangsters with interlinking story lines, macguffins and over-the-top characters. He is often a man who thinks he is smarter then really is. But even with this formula Ritchie does make a fun film with a lot of comedy and the story elements fit well together. It shows a number of story lines can work if the writing is good. This is of course not a serious take on London gangsters which is a shame really because British filmmaker have made some real classics like Get Carter and The Long Good Friday. But as a comedy take it is still pretty good and there is plenty of action throughout. But there were some really silly things throughout like the names of some of the characters, the use of mockney English because no one speaks like that and the way some characters act throughout the film. Ritchie is stylist in his direction with some brilliant shots throughout and there is a visual kinetic style. The film is fast paced and Ritchie knows how to deliver a action, with the boxing fights and the gun fights. There are some moments of real flair like in the beginning when it uses CCTV screens to follow a group of robbers.There is a excellent cast in this film. Of course the Hollywood A-Listers are good in Snatch, del Toro effectively playing a European gangster and it had to take an American actor to give an over-the-top Irish accent with the ultimate amount of slang. The Stath shows that from his origins as a model and a driver that he can be good actor and shows that he has some real comic energy in Snatch. Ford was very effective as the top gangster of London with a remorseless nature and James and Gee were decent comic folly.A good film, but Lock, Stock is Ritchie's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Turkish style,"Watching Snatch felt like revisiting the joy I got from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels!

His nearly incomprehensible accent and those wild fighting scenes take the film to another level. Seeing Pitt in such a quirky role was fantastic. His charm and that hard-to-understand yet hilarious accent fit the character perfectly. The fight scenes with the gypsies also gave me strong Lock, Stock vibes, reminding me of those chaotic yet brilliantly funny moments.The storyline, with its con artists and constantly intertwined plots, felt just like Lock, Stock, where every character's path hilariously crosses. The absurdity of the underground world and the way things constantly go wrong is classic Ritchie. He has this incredible ability to make everything seem like a beautiful mess that somehow all makes sense by the end.On top of that, the music and visual style are pure energy.

Excellent entertainment with a lot of style.,"Snatch is an excellent action movie with a lot of style. First of all, the cast is excellent, the best being Brad Pitt, which is impressive as ""One Punch"" Mickey O'Neil. The story is simple but told in a way to make it a bit confusing, a bit like Pulp Fiction did. It's not revolutionnary but it is very good. The characters are awesome. But the biggest reason why this film is not just another action movie is Guy Ritchie's stylish directing. His style reminds me a bit of Danny Boyle, one of my favorite directors, but he uses more slow-motions and it is clear that he has done music videos. But while some directors don't know how to use this influence to make a movie instead of a 2 hours long music video(for example, the incompetent who directed the awful Charlie's Angels), Ritchie uses strange camera angles and effects to give style to his story and create images which are hard to forget. Snatch will neither change the way you look at movies nor will it tell you anything about the meaning of life, but you will have a great time and you will not forget some of the images for a long time(I won't tell you which ones because I would give away the story). Anyway, I highly recommend it and after a year of so-so movies with a few exceptions, it is fun to see a really good one.81%",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Every diamond has a flaw...,"As far as crime capers go, Snatch certainly delivers the goods, if often in a rather disappointingly average way.

Vinnie Jones is largely wasted in a very good role while many of the attempts at humorous banter appear unrehearsed and consequently pretty lame.A solid ensemble piece, Brad Pitt should be highlighted for his consistently funny Irish gypsy and Mike Reid excels himself.

What a movie it is! One of the best crime flick with a taste of slight humor,"I watch crime and thriller movies but my taste for them is always limited as very few of them will reach through my mind delighting me. ""Snatch"" will rank the top in this genre. What a movie it is! The story is centered around the 84 carat diamond rolling in different hands! It starts slowly picking up a pace and holds the viewer right till it ends. The dialogues are awesome! I think the screenplay is written so carefully that it holds the meaning in every line. To not to loose any good lines I enabled the subtitles on, literally! Brad Pitt is good! Perhaps this one is one of the most liked character of mine so far. Jason Statham in a different style as well. The way the director and writer has given slight touch of humor just makes this flick watch worth and do not make it wrong in any way. In fact the humor has been taken care of so closely that it just don't spoil the original thrill and crime theme in it and balance the movie throughout. After I watched this one, I really felt being away from such a masterpiece for so long time. I mean the movie was made in 2000 and I got chance to watch it after 11 years! Overall, nice movie to go for an entertainment if you haven't watched it yet cause it will still give the same pleasure even if time changes and we are in the completely changed world!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Awesome multiple storyline dark comedy,"If you like movies with multiple story lines and some dark comedy, then you will truly love this movie.I watched this movie only 3 times in the first week.You really need to watch it at least twice to pick it all up.The accent used by Brad Pitt was a bit difficult to understand, but after a second or third viewing the context was intelligible.There are great characters, with some really awesome lines. If you like to quote lines from movies, then this will really give you a lot of material. Probably better than Crash and 11:14, though those are also good movies with multiple story lines.A great flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Instant Classic!,"This was an instant classic when it came out, one of the best films ever, and it's hilarious too.

Fantastically kooky British heist film.,"While my favourite film in this genre is still Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels this is nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable British heist film. Without giving anything away the film is about the heist of a huge diamond and the convoluted and comic path it takes as it changes hands between various members of the British underworld. Jason Statham is as usual pitch perfect as is, surprisingly, Brad Pit whom I don't usually really love. The rest of the cast is made up of a collection of very well cast character actors, all of whom shine. Especially noteworthy is a wonderfully sinister and kooky mob boss played by Alan Ford. The exception to this is Benicio Del Toro who plays a suave, slick, gangster / hand off man. His fake Jewish / eastern European / who the hell knows what accent is so thick and off the wall that one can't help but laugh at his character (and not in a good way). Brad Pit's accent may be just as thick but he manages to pull it off in a wonderfully goofy way while Del Toro just comes away looking stupid. Thankfully he plays a relatively small role. Speaking of accent, accent plays such a central role in this film, both as comedic relief and general backdrop that one almost feels that it becomes a character in and of itself. Like many such films in this genre it's well worth a 2nd watch just to unravel it's complex plot and character interactions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Beyond the ""Snatch"" of a diamond - ""I Went Down"" is a gem of a sleeper","Writer-director Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch"" is full of British humor and jabs at the underworld of thieves, swindlers, and the not-so-smart crooks. Its visual presentation maximized graphic design communication styles like typographic key words and symbolic icons as connections or suggestive rebus. The whole movie is kind of like flipping through a comic strip, albeit it's breezy and fun, enjoyable if you like that sort of thing. It's an ensemble cast with catchy names: Benicio Del Toro is Franky Four Fingers, Brad Pitt is One Punch Mickey, Rade Serbedzija is Boris The Blade, and Dennis Farina is Cousin Avi. Watch out for the little dog - you might say Ritchie's attention to details includes direction of this star of a dog.Another film that comes to mind on 'quirky' small time gangster tales is the Irish flavor ""I Went Down"" 1997. It has more substance and depth of plotline and characters; another darn good performance from Brendan Gleeson (who was superb as Martin Cahill in writer-director John Boorman's ""The General"" 1998, based on true life story.) Peter McDonald of ""The Opportunists"" 2000 was the reluctant protégé alongside Gleeson in this small gem of a sleeper. ""I Went Down"" has its equal fun logic, yet it's a crime story with a difference beyond Hollywood hang-ups. A tip: do not try to see ""I Went Down"" in a hurry, it's kinda like a steady road trip, as the two leads get to understand each other better, and perhaps reveal the purpose/philosophy of it all. After all, there's more than meets the eye (or ear, rather) the banters we hear between Gleeson and McDonald - it's a well-written script by Conor McPherson, and directed by Paddy Breathnach with Irish finesse.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
My favorite movie,"What can i say? From the story to the cast everything is perfect in this movie! The fight scenes are awesome, the way brad Pitt talks is a little touch that makes the whole difference, the jokes made by the characters, and even the characters themselves are funny as hell.It's a movie with no fear of being different and original, with simple and little touches that make seeing it time and time again not a bad thing since every time you see it you pick up another great detail you missed the last time you saw it and that is what makes it so good and enjoyable.10 out of 10 no doubt in my opinion",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch-Conversational gangster movie.,"Snatch is not a classic or a block buster movie.But still it is considered as one of the best gangster franchise movies.This movie is directed by Guy Ritchie. Guy Richie is known for his non linear movie editing style as the scenes will not be a sequence but it will be shifting back and forth.This movie is part of his franchise gangster movie called as Rock n rolla,lock stock and barrels.What I Liked in this movie is its narrative style and his engaging dialogues like in martin Scorsese movie.This movie has lot of thumping scenes where we rouse to clap our hands due to its dialogue. Inspite of having complex characterization and scenes in the movie,audience is not confused and they ought to enjoy this movie.Obviously the movie is gross in few scenes one reason being a gangster subject and another one being a gangster movie.I am sure that gangster movie fans will like and love this movie!!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Top 10,"Here is a movie I never cease to enjoy, the colorful characters, wittiest dialog ever and winding plot are the best. I wish Guy Ritchie would make more films like this, I know others have attempted, but few come close. Although Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is fantastic as well. I was steered away from the film because of the title, but once you watch it, you'll understand why the name. Brad Pitt's performance is one of his best albeit a small role, and this breakout role for Jason Statham is the reason he is a major star today. There are other great characters like Bullet Tooth Tony by Vinnie Jones and other characters that will be hard to forget. I think if I could wear out a DVD, this is one that has been put through the paces. Anyone who has seen this is likely to have seen it a few times, and if you are 'movie guy' can likely quote at least 10-20 lines from the rich dialog.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Just as much fun,"The movie Snatch is weird, twisted, and confused. Permit me to say that again. This film is absurd! This is what you get, my friend-imagine the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid. It may surprise you to learn that this widespread bewilderment and total lunacy is quite fascinating. There are issues with the film. To begin with, those of you who have watched Snatch's forerunner, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, are aware that Guy Richie, the writer and director of both movies, approaches camera angles, movements, and cinematography in a manner reminiscent of music videos.

jusco's review: Snatch,"Snatch is an eccentric, original film that combines both gangster and comedic elements to create a relatively successful and refreshing film ('original' is subjective; it's supposedly too similar to Guy Ritchie's previous film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but then again I haven't seen that yet). The plot follows two interlinked story lines set in the London criminal underworld: one revolves around an attempt by several parties to steal an 86 carat diamond, the other about a boxing promoter and his unfortunate dealings with an unmerciful gangster. Despite the seemingly simple plot, the various twists and turns are surprising and even hilariously absurd. Think deadpan comedy with imposing guns and terrifically witty dialogue. It's like watching a slapstick cartoon come to life. Edited rather stylistically, contrary to the conventional theatrical manner, it moves at a faster pace than most films and has a cool, fitting accompanying soundtrack.This film features an impressive ensemble of actors (I just now realise the lack of female characters; this is a 'manly' film). But the two standouts were Jason Statham and Brad Pitt, two widely-known actors; the former known for being one of the iconic 'action heroes' in films such as The Transporter, Crank and The Expendables, the latter known for being a 'pretty-boy-but-still-immensely-talented actor' in films such as Seven, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, just to name a few. Imagine my surprise then at Jason Statham's impressive delivery of Guy Ritchie's brilliantly written dialogue. I was unimpressed with his action flick performances, but in Snatch, he proves he is capable of more than just throwing punches and shooting guns. Brad Pitt had an interesting character to play; how did he pull off so well an Irish gypsy (or derogatorily known as 'pikey') who excels in bare-knuckle boxing, is obsessed with his mum and whose heavily-accented words are completely indecipherable? One of my favourite of his performances.Snatch thrives on the ability to entertain audiences with its unique deliverance, laugh-out-loud dialogue and outrageous happenings. However, that's as far as it goes. Halfway through the film, the dialogue starts to feel a bit stale and overdone, the style of editing is a bit vexing and the story seems to go nowhere. Some of the performances were mediocre, as if the actors were unable to grasp the true character they were tasked to play. This was one of the films where the entire journey failed to overrule the unsatisfactory ending. This film is smart, make no mistake, but Guy Ritchie shouldn't have overdone it for his own good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Sit back and enjoy,"Like I said in the intro, just put on this movie and sit back and relax and allow yourself to be entertained. Guy Richie does a masterful job of assembling an all star cast and giving them all an opportunity to shine. From Brad Pitt to Jason Strathom everyone seems to actually enjoy being involved in this movie and as a result, they have put on a stellar performance. The action is nonstop and the storyline moves along at a great pace as all the parties involved speed towards each of their ultimate resolutions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Morra the Same, Gorra Problem wif that, Mate?","Someone commented that Guy Richie can create more laughs with editing than others can with dialogue and acting...I think they have a point.

Good film,"Good film. I could also say criminals as absolutely everybody in here has gotten their hands dirty one way or another. This includes all kinds of robberies, brawls, illegal fighting, blackmailing and even murder. The latter also includes the scene I found the funniest. (Actually, I did not find too many scenes in here funny I have to admit, it mostly seemed pretty try-hard to me.) I am talking about a scene where one guy shoots another and the guy hit by the bullet keeps insulting the guy who shot at him. And this goes on and on. Another bullet, another insult, another shot, another insult etc. He just didn't want to die it seems and told him frankly and openly what he thought of him. This scene was laugh-out-loud hilarious. But it was really the only one and there aren't too many entertaining sequences in here. Still, comedy was probably the film's biggest strength as storytelling and character development were really weak in my opinion. Ritchie had a fairly decent cast here and I found it pretty underwhelming what he made of it. This film is actually inside the IMDb top250 films and this is truly baffling as this film does not have any substance.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Lock Stock 2?,"Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels 2? Wouldn't really sound right would it? So what do you do? First of all you don't change the plot outline much (London gangsters in a pickle) but you do make a couple of slight cast alterations. Brad Pitt? Ah, why not he's a good looking guy after all. Only here, he is a gypsy boxer and puts in one of the best performances of his career. In my humble opinion Guy Ritchie is a fantastic director. His style is cool and dialogue hilarious. He is a cross between Tarantino (for the plots) and P.T. Anderson (for his knack of coaxing out great performances from less than great actors). So why did he do Swept Away?!Personally I don't think snatch is as good as LOCK STOCK... but is lighter and funnier. ***1/2 out of *****",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Guy has obviously a passion for these fast and energetic films, so don't expect any different from him, the question really is, are they really any good?","Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch, are almost completely identical films, (except maybe in the lengths of the titles) but they use the same narrative styles, storylines, themes and even characters. Guy has obviously a passion for these fast and energetic films, so don't expect any different from him, the question really is, are they really any good?The film 'Snatch' is based around a group of London's underground gangsters, criminals and mobs. Three individual storylines meet and part, only to meet again, and then part again, combined with excessively fast cuts and sequences this makes the storyline difficult to digest for the average audience member the first time round. These set of gangsters; however all are in it for the same thing, in some way or another, a diamond which is a big as a small fist. These are also linked to a group of sub-plots which weave into the storylines of the different groups in the movie. Creating a well defined storyline, although this for most of the film will leave the audience slightly disorientated. Of course because of films Black comic nature, half the characters are the same way.The editing style used in Snatch ranges from incredibly fast cuts and sequences, to slow and long dialogue's between characters, including a long monologue of the 'usefulness' of a pig's digestive system. Just because the film is in English, doesn't mean that we have gotten over the language barrier with international film yet, while the accent is much more understandable there are some characters who it seems even other characters can't even understand, an example being Mickey (Brad Pitt) who speaks in his own dialect only few have mastered. Overall the storyline is complicated to a degree that it makes the film unpredictable yet still understandable (well, maybe on the second viewing)The script is an interesting component of the movie as it creates some interesting characters, Avi (Dennis Farina), an American business man being only one example. However the storyline seems to cut in and out of storylines, characters and times too quickly, the beginning of the movie seems to introduce the characters too quickly then dumps you into the middle of the story. It takes some time for the audience to catch up with each of the groups within the story and figure out how each are related. By the end of the film the audience has just got to know the characters, and aren't really concerned for them by the time they make their 'exit,' let alone relate to any of them, although this would be an impossible task for any realistic person anyway. The characters are interesting and dynamic, but when it comes down to it not real and believable. However I agree with Roger Ebert in that: `.no movie can be all bad that contains the following dialogue:U.S. Customs official: 'Anything to declare?' Avi (Dennis Farina): 'Yeah. Don't go to England.' Roger Ebert (See Bibliography)Guy Ritchie's 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' follows a similar formula so those who enjoyed 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' will most likely enjoy Snatch. However I feel this film was let down by an undeveloped and erratic plot. Ben Waugh",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny taste,"What kind of story was the movie? I can't reply if I'm asked. I may say ""black humor and punching movie""
It was a long and half-stitched story that was concocted with unique and sticky camerawork, acting, cutwork, and music, but it was fun and fun until the end. Since there are many characters and the episodes are connected in terms of human relationships and time, it need concentration, you cannot understand unless you watch it hard. In other words, you need to watch keenly. It is the tactics of this film for involve you.
I don't think it would be interesting to make something like this. This is the egg of Columbus. The role of Brad Pitt, who was only a supporting role in the story, was very effective and made the whole movie interesting",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One-trick pony?,"Dead good fun, with the emphasis on the word 'dead' - there is so much violent death in this film that it would be shocking if it wasn't all so tongue-in-cheek.

But spot the difference between this film and director Guy Ritchie's equally quirky and fun 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' - there isn't much, in fact. Both have in common various London low-lifes after a valuable 'MacGuffin', an identical in-your-face style and Vinnie Jones.

Many characters but it still works,"This has got to be one of my favorite Guy Ritchie movie. Now I don't really like all of his work but this is one of his best. This movie might not have that absurd and yet snappy dialogue and the level of humor compared ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". But the dialogue is still pretty cool and the other areas just got enhanced. Especially how it's more coherent and comes together in a more nicely wrapped package despite multiple different storyline of different characters. But it comes together much better in the end as a whole. This is one of those movie the more times you watch it the more you will appreciate this film. The way the characters act amongst each other is very entertaining to watch and what adds to the humor is the incompetence of some of the characters. In some movies it might get real annoying real easily, but in this it works. Jason Statham was a jewel hustler in real life before he became an actor and he portrayed a street hustler in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". Anyways he was really good as one of the protagonist and fit the role really well as the narrator with his charismatic voice. Vinnie Jones is also back again in this, he plays the intimidating and yet engaging character really well. This time around he is more mean and merciless when he has to get his job done. Brad Pitt is in this and he plays a memorable and iconic character and is one of the character that Pitt would be well known for playing next to Tyler Durden. He is simply a scene stealer in this and not in a negative way either. There isn't really a distinct main character in this movie but instead has multiple characters that are interesting and actually fleshed out for the most part which is a hard task to do. Despite there being a lot of characters in this movie it all fits together quite well, just about every character has it's moment. Overall this is a great movie that is most definitely worth seeing. Especially for those that enjoy character driven movies with interesting characters.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not bad,"Snatch (2000) is an energetic and chaotic crime comedy that blends multiple storylines involving stolen diamonds, shady boxers, and colorful characters. While the film's fast-paced nature and quirky humor may appeal to some, I found it difficult to follow at times, with too many characters and plot twists that felt overwhelming. The absurdity of some scenes, though intentionally comedic, didn't resonate with me, leaving me more confused than entertained. However, the film's clever moments and unique style are worth acknowledging.

A Surprisingly good movie,"When I entered the theatre to see Snatch, I had some idea of what to get. But I got a little surprised as well. I had read some reviews of the movie, and they were telling me that this was a movie, pretty similar to ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"". And the movie was, by all means.But sometimes there is more to a movie than just the plot. Consider the details that you experience in this movie, and you'll know what I mean. First of all, the ""Gipsy-Pitt"" is a geniously played part. You'll understand 50% of what Brad Pitt is saying, but that's how it is supposed to be. Another detail that is excellent, is the cutting from L.A. to London. Three small cuts, that is mixed together, and makes it understanding that a person leaves from one city to another. Great details here.As when it comes to the actors, I would say that the two best ones here, is Benicio Del Toro, as a gambling diamond robber (by the way a good Rabbi), and Brad Pitt as a ravelling gipsy. Two genious actors that is escalating the complete picture.Overall, go see the movie, and judge by yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Gritty and very funny.,"This finger snapping, episodic comedy is very well done. Lots of graphic violence and a total dearth of P.C. hypersensitivity punctuate an intelligent, albeit cynical, screenplay. I was particularly impressed with its use of real Brit pleb-speak without subtitles. (Three American 20 somethings behind me were left utterly and amusingly clueless.) I enjoyed watching Dennis Farina in a character part that was perfectly suited to him. Brad Pitt's gypsy was great, and suitably folded into the story to mute his superstar/superhunk appeal. There were too many great characters to name, but Alan Ford, as Brick Top, had that remarkably funny and sadistic edge of Hopkins as Hannibal. Likable henchmen, a squeaking pit bull, no silly romantic subplots, and fast pacing make this a fast and giddy ride through the seedy side of the UK. A great film to see in a large audience.

A proper British gangster film, with all the top cast involved, and even a perfected role for Pitt too. Maybe this won't be for an overseas audience? Primarily because they may not understand a word of what's being said, but stick subtitles on and enjoy a perfect plot performed brilliantly by everyone involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch A Viewing,"I wasn't drawn to Snatch upon it's original release but again, having heard it referenced so many times in the subsequent years I decided it was time to check it out. I can see why it has some serious fans out there, and for the most part I too enjoyed it. The characters are interesting, the plot and script are kind of fun and witty, the performances are all solid, and the pace/direction is unrelenting, which kind of worked for me too. I can see how this may not be for everyone, but I think it's definitely worth checking out,",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The coolest movie of the decade,"The story starts off with Franky Four Fingers stealing one of the biggest diamonds i have ever seen. It leads to the intertwined and ironic lives of Turkish & Tommy; Sol, Vincent and Tyrone; Brick Top; Doug 'The Head' & Franky; Boris as well as Mickey & his gang of gypsies. The characters are linked in a witty farce satirical triangle. For instance Mickey > Turkish > Brick Top. The movie also plays out a series of unfortunate events that seem to plague the characters making this show astoundingly entertainment and humorous. Be warned. The slapstick humour will catch you when you least expect it and before you know it you will not be able to control your laughter. A personal note : you will absolutely love how the show ends! The plot is brilliant and throws you in lots of directions that makes you want to watch the film to see what happens next. Watch this film, you will love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Witty Film For Those England Lovers!,"An amazingly made film, about comedy, teamwork, and utter crime. I could not believe my eyes when I first watched this movie. It brought out so much inspiration for the young wannabe filmmaker, but may I forewarn you, it isn't for the faint of heart when it comes to comedy and blood.I have always loved British films, BBC Charles Dickens, Jane Austen etc. ever since I was a kid. But Guy Ritchie is one of the most astonishing English Directors of the 21st century in my vast opinion.""Snatch"" a brilliant story about how gluts and criminals fight over the goods. A mere diamond, stolen by criminals disguised as Jews brings a wide range of characters into a subject of mystery, death, friendship, and most important of all, money. Brad Pitt's acting is phenomenal and the dialog is hysterically astounding. My eyes widened as the plot got thicker and thicker. It drove me over the edge of happiness and enthusiasm to the point to where I fell into a pool of laughter and cunning only to which, I had to be ""snatched"" back into reality. 5 Stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Always funny, even when you know what's coming","Snatch is Guy Richie at his peak. The script is tight, the comedy constant and the cast is perfect.

A Stylish and Hilarious Crime Caper Full of Twists and Colorful Characters,"*Snatch* (2000), directed by Guy Ritchie, is a fast-paced, darkly comedic crime film that weaves together multiple storylines centered on a stolen diamond, illegal boxing matches, and a cast of eccentric characters. The film's clever dialogue, rapid editing, and unique visual style have made it a cult classic in the crime genre.The ensemble cast, led by Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, and Benicio Del Toro, delivers memorable performances, with each character contributing to the film's chaotic yet entertaining plot. Brad Pitt stands out as Mickey O'Neil, an Irish gypsy boxer with an unintelligible accent, whose unpredictable nature adds a layer of wildness to the film. Statham, playing Turkish, serves as the more grounded center, narrating the story with his usual cool and dry wit.Ritchie's direction is a key element in *Snatch's* success. His signature style of frenetic editing, non-linear storytelling, and quirky humor keeps the audience engaged throughout. The film's fast pace, combined with snappy dialogue and memorable one-liners, creates a sense of energy that never lets up.Visually, *Snatch* is packed with stylish cinematography and inventive camera work, often using freeze frames, split screens, and rapid cuts to heighten the sense of urgency and chaos. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of rock and electronic music, further amplifies the film's edgy tone.While the film is highly entertaining, its dense plot and numerous characters can be overwhelming at times, and some viewers might find it difficult to follow all the intertwining stories. However, the film's wit and charm more than make up for any narrative confusion, as *Snatch* is more about the journey and the colorful interactions between its characters than about reaching a specific conclusion.Overall, *Snatch* is a fun and stylish crime caper that showcases Guy Ritchie's distinct voice as a filmmaker. It's a wild ride from start to finish, with enough humor, action, and twists to keep audiences thoroughly entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Snatch,"If you loved Lock Stock, then without a doubt, you will also love Snatch. Both films are very similar with Snatch being more serious. But Snatch has everything that Lock stock. For one the characters are so well written that the leap out from the screen. Statham and Graham are brilliant while Pitt delivers with being a Pikey, a role in which it nice to See Pitt doing . The others also do a brilliant Job specially Ford and Vinnie Jones . Ritchie has a nack for creating brilliant characters and this follows with great one liners. The film doesn't roll more than 5 minutes without a line that will make you chuckle are sticks in your head.There a lot going on but not enough to make you confused. If you loved Lock Stock, then there no doubt you will love this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
good movie,"I saw Snatch with a group of very loud friends, even though they were incredibly loud, I still enjoyed this movie emensely (sp?). It has what at first seems to be a simple plot (a bunch of people going after a diamond) but when you begin to peal back the layers you have one of the most complicated things that I have seen ever. If you liked Pulp Fiction, you should like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One hell of movie!,"So today I watched this movie Snatch, directed by Guy Ritchie. What an amazing movie!! A delight to watch; I mean I had heard that movie but this good.I had never expected.So the movie is basically about all these criminals trying to snatch things from each other. Story starts when a man named Franky Four Fingers smuggles an 84 carat diamond to London to sell to a jeweler on behalf of his boss. And then a lot of crooks and biggies get involved. And everyone is trying to snatch something from others; hence the name Snatch. Now this storyline may seem very familiar to you; and in a sense it shares some flavor with The Departed and Babel, but the real killer is the way story is told. I have got to give to Guy Ritchie. I mean what a comedy! The criminals in the movie are not white collar ones, they are the bums for whom crime, violence, theft, debauchery is a way of life. And each of them has his own idiosyncrasies; which ultimately screw him up at some point or another. And still all of them continue so nonchalantly through all the mess. And I just can't describe to you right now how great the way story is told is. One of the best I have ever seen. And the performances from all the characters are mind blowing. Especially the one from a character named Bullet Tooth. And as for me, it showed me the world in way I had never seen.So I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes gangster movies in general and would like to watch a hilarious spin on it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious gangster comedy with original photography and good story line,"I can only confirm the comments of the previous commentator, but perhaps add that, if you are a guy, you may not have to fear your girlfriend does not like the movie because of the violence. Although there is violence in the movie, most of it is indirect and actually very originally shot (as is the whole movie) --- but apart from that, Pitt's performance is just grand with his incomprehensible accent, not just to mention his performance in the boxing ring, which may also be appreciated by your girlfriend. By the way: I noticed one minor possible blooper --- when discussing about a camper for his mother, a dog suddenly jumps up to Pitt and that frightened him somewhat while uttering the four-letter f word, and then continued with his lines but with a smile on his face --- I don't think it was part of the script, though. Did anybody see this as well? Anyways --- great movie, I like it more than Pulp Fiction!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Fierce Joyride of Coincidence,"This film is a very visual form of every great O. Henry story. While not quite as well put together as ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" this film has got it where it counts and rolls very well onto the screen as a celebration of the unexpected and how coincidence and mishaps affect us all, even the makers of the best plans. A fun, fast film, not quite the same enjoyment level as the Guy Ritchie's film which proceeded it (Lock, Stock...) but better than most of what airs in the U.S.A. Ritchie proves that he is most decidely the fresh blood american box offices need, along with Troy Duffy, whose excellent work, Boondock Saints, should be viewed with Ritchie's films as a new approach to Noir. The entire cast make the film fun, and it is great to see Vinnie Jones return as a merciless hitman. A great cast, some fun turns, and an all out joy to watch. Can we get some of this stateside, moviemakers, other than the excellent aforementioned Duffy?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

richie does it again,"Snatch is the followup movie to lock stock and is guy richies second movie i think. Snatch does remind me a lot of lock stock in the sense that you have this group of criminals all wanting the same thing. Though this time around it is a big old diamond, brad pitt joins the crew as irish talking micky. Now micky is a boxer and creates some comic relife with the accent he has chosen. We also have statham as irish. Stephen graham. Vinnie jones and lenny james. There are some great one liners and a lot of fun to be had as well as rough punching and some sad scenes in places. Overall snatch is another richie classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Best,I love Snatch ! I like Lock Stock but not wow. I wow Snatch. It is the best and I have watched it time and time again. The cast is great. Brad Pitt scrubbing in from Hollywood with an majority British cast. Mike Reid is fab. His character suits him as if it was written for him. I like Turkish and Tommy. The bond between the two is strong and jumps through the screen. I don't want to yap on about this movie too much. I just love it. You may not. Just watch it and watch it again. Guy Richie has excelled to my highest standard. Movies are a very personal and this is my personal best. I like the music tracks. Even Vinnie Jones who is not the best at stringing words together plays a good role as Bullet tooth Tony.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Jones,the baddest guy on earth,is the right man to play ""Bullet Tooth Tony"".He convinces you only with a look. Statham as ""Turkish"" is the man,with this ""i don't care about nothing"" face.

Clever movie,"I guess this movie has the essence of the pure and sophisticated comedy, without parodies or aggressive jokes (which are sometimes very funny either). The movie itself is very unusual, crazy, alternative, and reminds very vaguely the atmosphere of Pulp Fiction.The beginning is intricate, but as the happenings go on, the relations between the characters get more solid and the situations, funnier.The acting couldn't be better; all of them were perfect for the roles, but Brad Pitt raised the level even more.I recommend this movie for the ones who are open-minded, by the fact that this is not a typical commercial movie; it innovates in some aspects and the result was a clever and sophisticated movie that may not be the taste of everybody.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guy Ritchie has done it again!,"After such a classic piece of cinema, like ""Lock, Stock..."", you'd think the pressure of making his second full length film, might weigh down the plot or direction. I'm happy to say that Guy Ritchie has done it again, making a movie that will no doubt become a classic action film. Set in London, ""Snatch"" is the story of Turkish and Tommy, two unlicenced boxing promoters who get in trouble with a gangster named Brick Top. Turkish's boxer, Gorgeous George is supposed to go down in the 4th round but when Tommy and George got into some hot water with a group of gypsies led by Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt, in one of his best performances). George gets into a fight with Mickey and Mickey knocks George's lights into the next world. Turkish decides to substitute Mickey for George in the big fight but when Mickey doesn't go down in the 4th, Turkish and Tommy sink deeper into trouble.In another plot line, jewish diamond thief, Franky Four Fingers (Benico Del Toro) steals a diamond ""the size of a fist"" and is then robbed buy 3 stupid jewelry wholesalers and their crazy gypsie dog. But they run into one small problem, the case with the stone in it is chained to Franky's arm, so they take Franky with them to meet the buyer, russian ex-KGB assassin, Boris the Blade. Back in the USA, Cousin Avi (Denis Farina, playing another foul mouthed mobster) finds out that Franky has been robbed and he won't get his giant diamond. Avi flies to London and must find his 86 karat stone with the help of Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) a man who took six bullets to the head and is still tickin'. He even had some of the bullets molded into teeth to replace the one's he lost. Sound complicated? Don't worry, it's not. With his brilliant directing style, Richie has made a movie that will make you laugh, cry and maybe even puke if you have a Really weak stomach. Plus some of the best boxing sequences filmed since ""Raging Bull"" Any way you slice it, ""Snatch"" is a winner! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A movie to be re watched,"This movie is amazing, all the actors fit well in it. The story is really funny and have its own twists, as you would expect from a Guy Ritchie movie. Much like it's predecessor, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it has a few story lines that will connect in the end for a great ending and with a few actors from the previous movies as well. Jason Statham is great as the Turkish, Brad Pitt is really funny, and Brick Top is a great villain, great job done by Alan Ford.One of my favorite movies of all time, I never get bored watching it again and again.I highly recommend to watch this movie.

A movie gem in hiding,"Had never heard of this movie and feeling lucky we picked the movie, Snatch. I loved it although at some points the accents made it difficult to understand the dialogue.

Stealing On and Off Screen,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Madonna's hubby is no dummy.  He steals from the best.  The influence of Tarantino is obvious, but in ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" I see a great deal of Scorcese as well.  When you learn from these two and throw in a twisted, darkly comical screenplay and amazing acting from the ensemble cast, Guy Ritchie provides us with this years best guilty pleasure!  I found myself alterately laughing and squirming with the unique mix of violence and a remarkably high number of scenes where at least one character is asking himself, ""What am I doing here?"".  Alan Ford steals his scenes as Brick Top - a perfect name for such a charming guy.  Brad Pitt turns in a beautiful performance as a character right out of the Paul Bunyon school of Tall Tales.  Although brief in screen time, Benicio Del Toro again shows why he is well on his way to stardom.  I just hope he continues to be very selective on his roles and doesn't turn in to Kevin Bacon, god forbid.  No real tidbit on this other than make sure to enjoy the dialogue.  It is, for the most part, easily understood if one concentrates.  I did not find it to be a distraction, and I am from TEXAS! Looking forward to more from Guy Ritchie, but I do hope he learns to minimize the visual distractions (clever camera work) to the point that it does not interfere with the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

THE FIRST GOOD FILM OF 2000,"Snatch the new film by Guy Ritchie is a mainstream masterpiece. And without doubt the best movie, not to mention most descent move of the year. Almost all movies this year thus far have been complete c**p. All hype and not living up to its word, something which Hollywood is fond of. However Snatch rises above all that jargon and comes out as a sly comedy that is well acted and even better written. I came into the theater and kept telling myself that this wasn't a direct sequel (although it did use most of the same actors from Lock Stock) and to watch it as if I never knew Guy Ritchie's work, and it worked. But some viewers might find this hard due to the fact that Lock Stock was such a good movie, which it was. But in my opinion this was better. The movie itself is very high paced and fun. So if you live in the U.K and have a hole burning in your pocket, go see Snatch. Your pocket and your head will thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Brad Pitt's charachter Mickey wasn't too hard to understand, but if you do have a hard time understanding his dialect, thats ok, thats the point.In closing, I'd sum it up as more of a European ""Pulp Fiction"" with a thicker story and better direction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It has several different plot lines that all weave together in to one story.  It was very funny, I laughed until my stomach hurt, and it had THE BEST ending I have seen in a movie in a long time.

One of the most unique movies of the year.,"There should be more movies like these.  When i saw this movie, i was forced to watch it again, not only because it was smart, funny in a dark way, but the acting by the cast was truly amazing. Boris the Blade is my favorite character in that movie, i saw him in MI:2, i didn't know he could act that well, he is a great actor, and his Alan Ford (Brick Top), he is one of the meanest SOB's i ever saw, his acting is oscar worthy, especially his face expressions.As for Brad Pitt, i didn't know he could work as a pikey, but he did a pretty good job, and Benicio Del Toro, i don't know why people said he was so good, i don't see anything special in his acting.  Whoever chose this cast was indeed a genius.  Guy Ritchie should be given a lot of credit for this movie, most people say it's like LS&2SB, trust me this is way better.

Dynamic Cinema 101,"It might be the movie I've seen the most in my young life. Guy Ritchie really put up a beauty with Snatch. Really, it's one of the best entertaining movies i've seen in my life. There is many reasons to that. First of all, you have a polyphonic plot with a lot of good and bad guys. Who cares if they are stereotypes? Really...it's cinema. The editing follows the incredible speed of the movie. Fast cuts, active camera, lots and lots of plans are Ritchie's forte here.Cinema purists might not like it, but it comes down to what are you researching in cinema. Sometimes it's good to ask yourself questions, but sometimes it's good to see a well made, dynamic, fun entertainment. This is also the one liner paradise, like most of the masculine movies anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A funny non-genuine comedy,"Snatch got me from the very beginning, because of its original dialogs and colorful characters, as well as because of the funny narrative. Brad Pitt and Rade Serbedija play brilliant, and imagine that both characters are against their origins.The film has a very interesting plot. Some people compare it to Pulp Fiction. In my opinion, Snatch is a little more original, but I definitely prefer PF. However, Snatch can be considered a lighter version of Tarantino's breakthrough or even the British equivalent.All in all, Snatch is an absolutely amusing film, both for its comedic and action scenes. I highly recommend it to those who think that hardcore crime moves (ie without humor) are sometimes boring or typical.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"If it's not broke, don't fix it.","It's good to see that Guy Ritchie's next movie is set far from London's criminal underworld, because it's fair to say that he has probably wrung every last drop of entertainment from the (identical) subject matter of his first two features.  In fact, he wrung the flannel dry, because one of the twists in SNATCH (an attempt to sell goods back to the person they were stolen from), is a direct lift from LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS; Now, I don't mind this sort of thing going on when an old idea is re-processed, but, as a writer, if you find yourself stealing from your previous work so soon, you don't ask how much is left in the well, you wonder how much was in there in the first place.SNATCH contains the same frenetic pace and kinetic direction as its predecessor, and a gritty, bleached-out colour, while having much more of a sixties feel (despite the surfeit of 70s/80s music), and containing a lot more quirky (or flashy, depending on your opinion) touches.   Where this movie does improve on LS&TSB, however, is in injecting a potent dose of pathos into the necessary elements of the plot.   It's a shame, then, that a certain sense of self-satisfaction on the part of writer-director Ritchie is evident in the over-elaborate stylisation.The strands of the story bind together well as the movie approaches its climax (although the conclusion of the black guys' tale is a little lame), and Ritchie coaxes a far better performance from Vinnie Jones than the one he gave in LS&TSB.   Brad Pitt is especially good in a role that he should have stunk in.I liked this movie a lot, although you might not think so from what I've written.   Maybe that's a testimony to Ritchie's undoubted ability to deliver a well-made and entertaining story that is strong enough to overcome shortcomings that will, hopefully, be addressed as his career progresses.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Very entertaining!,"This is only Guy Ritchie's second film, and he had already showcased his storytelling abilities. While his debut film, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" hinted at his unique directorial traits, this film takes them to new heights. It is undeniably a much better showing than his first feature.Not only is it more action-packed, but it also has a more coherent narration. Most importantly, the writing on every character produces effective outcomes, which was lacking in his previous work and left me unsatisfied, to be honest.Furthermore, I appreciate the humour this time. Even though It maintains the same brand of black comedy as before, but it somehow feels more refined and works its magic, as one would expect it to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Guy Ritchie's Best,"Snatch is a fixed up cocktail of just the right ingredients. From the unlucky underground boxing manager (Jason Statham) to the inarticulate fighting gypsy (Brad Pitt) to completely incompetent jewel thief's, these guys make up a cast of characters that are utterly hilarious when put together.The witty dialogue makes the movie what it is. I feel wittier just by watching it. As an American, its just amusing to hear these quick-tongued Brits go at it. Nearly every scene involves a quip or sly remark. Cop: ""What's in the car?"" Turkish: ""Two seats and a steering wheel.""But beyond the cunning wit of the dialog, you have a story of a group of lowlifes, thugs, gangsters, hit men, and gypsies all trying to get the same thing, whether they know it or not. Although, its more like two completely separate stories are being played out simultaneously, but end up converging into one in the end. I won't get into how or why, you'll just have to watch it.My only quarrel with the film is, if you've seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll notice a lot of similarities between the two movies. In fact they're almost exactly the same in terms of general plot techniques. Even used some of the same actors filling similar roles. While this isn't enough to discredit this film, I actually think Snatch is far superior, it makes me wonder what Guy Ritchie was thinking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pure fun,"While the acting is a bit hit and miss, this film still kept me laughing and cringing the whole time. Brad Pitt is a standout",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pitt is hilarious,"Brad Pitt can really be funny. He is a bare knuckled Irish boxer Mickey O'Neil and he nails the brogue so well that I was convinced that he was from the Emerald Isle. Unlike his ex-wife Madonna, Guy Ritchie actually has talent. He directs Snatch in a non linear fashion and with enough off beat dialogue to invite comparisons to Quentin Tarantino.Benicio del Toro is jewel thief Frankie four fingers and he is in London to sell a huge diamond that he has stolen. He gets double crossed by gangsters who run a dog fighting ring and expand into boxing. Mickey winds up fighting for them and when they lose money due to the Irishman not taking a fall, all hell breaks loose.Several kidnappings, killings and every crime known to man soon follow as Snatch becomes a full fledged, violent ride with a satisfying conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Music Video Populated by P.G. Wodehouse Characters Updated to Modern London's Crime World,"Cinematic prototypes lean toward having an agelessness about them, an idiosyncratic appeal that exceeds years and settings. A relatively new model has been trying its frontier, the consciously stylized gangster. These incessantly stylish, exaggeratedly talkative, morally vague antiheroes have crowded the cinema backdrop. An exciting cross-reference to the question of whether or not the stylistically cutting-edge criminal is consistent and attention-grabbing enough to last is put into high-gear in Guy Ritchie's sophomore raid on the modern London gangland. Packed with jump-cuts, high shutter speed, a loud multi-generational pop soundtrack, harsh locales, style-sprayed dialogue and heaps of comic irony, Snatch. can be seen as the premier template for hyper-stylized testosterone cinema of and since the new millennium, except a closer going-over---and you'd not be in the minority if you gave it numerous---exposes something even more thrilling.Snatch. is essentially a manic fusion, mongrelizing the Gen X and Y movie gangster with a varied range of archetypal potboiler constituents. Indeed, there are enough quaint, glib villains in it to give Mamet, Tarantino and even Scorsese at least a blip on the radar screen of their challengers, but at its core is a classic caper comedy. It's not ridiculous, actually, to picture Cary Grant playing Mickey fifty, sixty years ago were that heyday the time for this fast-paced amalgam of the underworld mythologies of the fixed boxing match and the diamond heist. Ritchie is the cinematic counterpart of a disc jockey, sampling traditional British thriller plotting and mixing it with ultra-modern atmospheric ingredients to form a witty and exhilarating mélange.Ritchie's rearing in commercials and music videos give Snatch and its chronic freeze-frames a gasping pace, owing to cinematographer Tim Maurice-Jones and editor Jon Harris, who move heaven and earth. John Murphy's score lightheartedly varies on Jewish and Slavic formulas that sustains a tongue-in-cheek tone of buoyancy, at the same time the production design suggests one after another frayed London lower-class scene with stark naturalism. Ritchie keeps everything whirling frantically and cheerfully along, with all the audacious excitement of a bright kid intoxicated by the utter thrill of flying his own kite.The chaotic, tricky plot is given its much-needed bookends by Turkish, an unlicensed boxing promotoer attempting to expand by dealing with formidable figures like many-tentacled crime lord Brick Top. In an effort to rig an impending match for Brick Top, Turkish solicits Brad Pitt's movie-stealing gypsy Mickey, who appears incapable of correctly taking a dive.Across town, a flawless gem has been stolen by Benicio Del Toro's unassuming Frankie Four Fingers, who is expected to deliver it to America for Cousin Avi. Though, as one might imagine, there are snags: Rade Serbedzija's calculating Boris The Blade wants the diamond, and it's up to hired gun Bullet Tooth Tony help retrieve it.As the film begins to unfold, the various cliques of characters appear to trail independent fates until Ritchie's cunning script lures them together in the last 40 minutes. Less domino-like in structure than Lock, Stock, Snatch manages these innumerable brackets of people and interlaces their paths. The dialogue is lively like its predecessor's, though cheekier instead of riotous, while composed in the same breed of Cockney Runyonesque.The quality of more peripheral performances is conspicuously flimsy, but let's not lose sight of the overall upshot. The performances fluctuate in quality, but all are distinguished by a good-humored liveliness. Big splashes include Dennis Farina's frustrated American Avi, excavating a cornucopia of crass-American-traveler humor, Vinnie Jones' pokerfaced drollness as a more gentlemanly, if bullet-toothed, variation on his Big Chris in Lock, Stock, and Alan Ford's menacing eccentric Brick Top. Of exclusive reference is the impeccably cast dog that features more significantly in the action than we initially expect. Less flashy, but softly holding the whole lot together, is Jason Statham's bone-dry breakthrough as Turkish, who along with his sheepish partner, the memorable Stephen Graham as Tommy, gets more than he bargained for.This indelibly quotable audience fave is far from faultless cinematic art, but it's an electrifying exercise and a halcyon cult-smash stand-out by Ritchie. For those who grieve for the old Ealing comedies or the farces of McCarey and Wilder, and don't disapprove of a spot of gunplay, blood spatter and dismemberment, or an immensity of profanity generously strewn throughout, this is a refreshing and stirring experience. May the post-modern gangster standard keep on coming, as long as they keep as imaginative, as hilarious and as absorbing as the hyperlink tapestry of Snatch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
indescribably delightful,"... but I'm going to try to describe it anyway...The characters: Every character in this film is a fabulous story alone. Sure, most of them are only one- or two-dimensional, but those dimensions we do see are hilarious, twisted, and unique. Nearly all of them are selfish, violent, mentally ill, loveable criminals.The plot: A bizarre tale of back-stabbing, lying, cheating, and all things illegal. The story twists and tangles over itself like a nasty ball of twine.The filmmaking: As surprising and entertaining as the story and people. The camera is very much a character in this movie, and made me laugh and shake my head in wonder.See this film at least ten times. I promise you'll get something new out of it with each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brad Pitt,"Oh my God Brad Pitt in this movie.First, This is one of my favorite movies.Guy Richie is amazing. His unique way of delivering a story is absolutely enthralling.He is clever, awe-inspiring and is able to keep your attention throughout the entire film.Brad Pitt was spectacular.His acting was so on point, you get completely sucked in.It was shocking, and hilarious at times.This was the first Guy Richie film I'd seen and it made me an instant fan.The scene where Brad Pitt's character is trying to get into his mother's camper, will haunt me forever. Powerful, funny and one you can watch over and over.I do own this one I felt it had to be a part of the collection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Wonderful Crime Farce,"Friday was another movie day,  sorta catch up to see the some of them before the awards, and specifically the Foreign films since I will be attending a symposium with the foreign film nominee directors/producers at the Academy two days before the big-time awards.SNATCH is not unique in the genre of farce story telling of gangsters stepping on other gangsters while pulling off independent schemes of getting their piece of the pie the easy way.  Well, the easy way is not that easy when independent plots converge on cops-and-robbers after many laughs of robbers-and-robbers that carries the film.This is an oddly funny film once one tunes the ear to British country way of speaking.  What?  What did they say....?It is always nice to see a movie with a cast of actors who want to bubble to the top -- and clearly have their day in the roles in this movie.  Two actors were strangely placed.  First, Benicio Del Toro (""TRAFFIC"") appears as Franky Four Fingers which was a distraction as I asked myself, ""Where do I know that person from???  My 30cent a gallon WATER store owner in Culver City?""   And then the star with bottom billing while giving his best performance in recent filmology, none other than Brad Pitt (One Punch' Mickey ONeil ).The planned snatching of a prized diamond only sets the stage for a strange and wonderful adventure in the English craving for good, innocent crime (s) that excels in complicity all things that would shock Sherlock plots.Just tune your ears, and don't worry about One Punch' Mickey ONeil.  Only his gypsy mobile home travellers can really enjoy his jokes and dialogue.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great movie. One of the best!,"Snatch has it all! Great fighting, great actors, great storyline, goodcomedy, except beautiful women.

headline,Although the story was split through various subplots seeing it all come together made the movie really enjoyable. seeing the antics of each group and how it affected the next added flavor to the already conflicting personalities of each character. the film is funny and the cast did a good job.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Packed! Must've been tough keeping the film as short as 104 minutes.,"Definitely a film to buy for keeps! Unlike the movie ""Unbreakable"" (which I still maintain, should have been say 30 minutes long), this movie is packed with so much action. So much so that many scenes had to be in fast-forward, with others being omitted so that you the viewer can fill in obvious blanks. Like most sequels (if I may call it that), it borrows motifs from ""Lock Stock"". It however manages to remain original and (have I not mentioned yet?)very very interesting",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Cool action-film!,Snatch is a very cool action-film that a few people know each other and then it will be a fight between them.I like this sort of films which fight each other and it will be a terrific fight until the end of the film.I like actor as Benicio Del Toro and Brad Pitt and they act very well and Guy Ritchies directing are fantastic! Guy Ritchie can make a action-film with much exciting and fighting and that is fun to watch.I recommended Snatch to everyone who like to watch a film with fun and action!I want to warn sensitive persons of a few violent scenes!,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Best British Gangster film of 90's?,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review: Guy Ritchie's finest hour, Snatch is a far more mature movie than Lock, Stock and better for it. Alan Ford steals the show as Bricktop but Statham is close behind, showing the star promise that has lead him to bigger (but not yet better) things. One of the finest British films everBest Bit: The Final FightIMDb Rating: 9/10If you liked this try: Lock, Stock (8/10); Layer Cake (8/10); RocknRolla (8/10)Phil Hobden For more reviews check out: http://www.mod-life.net/modlife/index_ugly.htm",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
