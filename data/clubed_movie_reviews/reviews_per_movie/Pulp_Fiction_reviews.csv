The masterpiece without a message,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A masterpiece of screenwriting,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The rebirth of a genre – and film history,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My Favourite Movie,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Simply The Best,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An enjoyable noir story,"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!","My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I don't get it,I don't understand why this is the 8th highest rated movie of all time. I saw how highly rated it was so decided to watch it. After the first half an hour I found it enjoyable but my mind wasn't blown. As the movie continued I kept waiting for something to happen that warrants its 8.9 stars. Nothing actually happens in this movie. I hope its just me because through my eyes its the most overrated movie of all time.,4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Movie that redefined a genre,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unbelievable.,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece,"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Enormously Overrated,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Fun cult film, tad overrated","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pulp Fiction Is Not A Film,"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium .",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few.The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time...

"Overrated without a doubt, but nevertheless well made","This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.I was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, ""oh, hey, I recognize this image!"" That was the most joy I got out of this.By no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance.

Awesome!,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I can't understand why this film got this high ranking!,"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high.

The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION.

"Hands down, the best film of the '90s.","Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliantly constructed.,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece? Do me a favour!,"A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw.Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens.I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable.Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely.People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't.Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction.It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tribute to On the Waterfront,"I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson:Marsellus: ""In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it.""Butch: ""In the fifth, my ass goes down.""Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In ""On the Waterfront"" Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando ""coulda been a contender."" So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in ""On the Waterfront."" I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention.Also, for Tarantino fans, watch ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

There was nothing for me to grasp to make me care about what the characters were doing and why they were doing it, and the overly gratuitous use of the f-bombs put me off completely. It's almost as if swearing was substituted for wit and clever dialogue.

The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable.

There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond?

this is a fantastic film,"Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations.
Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe.
The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance.
Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry).
In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rashomon,"" which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the ""banality of evil, but the ""hard-boiled"" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence.

I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. You can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime. Despite originally thinking it was slightly overhyped, seeing it again and again has brought me to realise what it is. It's 'Pulp Fiction' and it's amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Will the overrating stop?,"I thought that the ""best"" of Tarantino's work is this one, considering the fans and the rate, but it was not far from the others. I expected a better violence cinematography, but was bellow Once upon a time. It was better and it was the only thing I liked about it: the storytelling, but that's it. Most of the plots were predictable. I think most of the fans loved Samuel's character journey, but for me wasn't enough and impressing, a bit dull even. He almost deserved that Oscar nomination, Quentin too, but Uma and John weren't worthy. Their screen time were too short and inconsistent to be that praising as everyone does.

Perfection ... sheer perfection!,"Not one movie can claim to have half the entertaining dialogue that this movie has. From beginning to end, not one word is out of place, or boring. Many movies may have one piece of dialogue that elevates the movie enough for you to like it, but Pulp Fiction is sheer joy of conversation, paired with situation after situation of pure excitement.I am sure I will never seen a movie that will be this much fun again! In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction!The movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous.The acting is compelling. The cinematography is masterful and just sets a nostalgic mood that makes you want to return to. The direction is ... oh well ... Tarantino. And the dialogue is the best ever.

One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino... but I think it's not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.,"This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a ""safe bet"", but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.The film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.For many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).These are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the ""pulp"" literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't... watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible... it's the kind of ""literature"" that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.The actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Is revulsion now entertainment?,"I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great,"Good day, dear friends and dear readers of reviews! Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions.

The most over rated film of all time. 225 people here have commonsense.,"Try this experiment : Ask any tarhead or Pulp fiction fan one thing about this movie, and the first thing they will reply offhand is the incredible number of f words (271) found in this, and of that being the largest amount in any movie in history. So it may not seem unreasonable to conclude that this movie's incredible popularity stems from preteens and teenagers who think that the f word is cool and hip. Doesn't paint moviegoers in the best light does it? While I liked Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill 1 and 2, I simply cannot understand how this movie was voted into the top 10 or maintains such a huge fanbase? Dogs and Kill Bill were both groundbreaking and Tarantino flicks themselves may be a kind of acquired taste but there is enough offensive material in this movie, totally wanton, to put anyone off. Overall it is nothing special and outstanding.Now since some of his other movies were really good, Tarantino must have obviously done something right in Pulp fiction. So what could have possibly been that makes this movie so popular?Realism - Like all his other movies, this movie is very realistic. But there aren't enough outstanding scenes where realism adds an extra touch. There are only scenes of violence, extreme and explicit drug abuse, sodomy and boring conversation. The open use of racism can be considered realism but it is simply so easy to implement if one wants to.Dialog - Mostly long and highly trivial. French McDonalds, killing people, coffee...wtf? You can only make something great out of it only if you overanalyse the dialog and then put your self in a delusion of being a great analyst or philosopher. Too many f words, n words and racist lines. This is not cool, kids. Its garbage. Or I guess that a lot of people converse on trivial lines and it is uplifting for them to see the same type of boring talk in a big movie?Acting - Pretty good but once again, there are too often uttering long and trivial dialog. None of the characters are likable or even dispiseable to the extent that they have such depth. They were all pretty shallow.Plot - Mostly nonexistent. You could probably extract a story of redemption from it but too many people put all sorts of philosophical angles which were simply not intended. A bunch of different chapters intersect at one point. Harvey Kietel's character is pointless and is just thrown in as a deus ex machina. Tarantino's character and dialog are also pointless.Actions scenes, special effects, twists and all that - None. Most scenes are well done but they simply boring. A simple scene well done but nothing special happening in it.One teenager probably goes and tells another teenager how cool this movie is for nothing other than its explicit use of offensive elements (drugs, violence, sodomy, bad language) and he tells his friend and so on, the chain reaction makes less than mature minds fall for this movie. When someone speaks out against how bad this movie really is, they are labelled as idiots so are afraid to speak their mind. I'm glad that 225 reviews here were at least accurate. Screw the peer pressure and speak your mind, kids.Sorry, this anti-movie just leaves more of a negative impression than any positive. It also drags too much. Its quite revolting although some scenes are quite memorable.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good Yet Over-rated,"Quentin Tarantino is a good director who has a knack for combining wildly imaginative music selections for his movies that seem to work so well you have to laugh with joy.He also is known for dark comedy, combining unexpected twists that dismay audience members to the point they often refer to him as a ""genius"".The problem with ""genius"" is that what is genius to some is mundane to others.Tarantino is also known for his plot twists. However the excessive focus on plot twists creates an expectation from the audience, which opposes the basic appeal: the element of surprise.In Pulp Fiction, twists are introduced with little finesse. Tarantino has improved with the years, but Pulp Fiction, an early film, becomes boring before it is over.Certainly worth watching, but early and raw compared to Tarantino's later films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The most ludicrously inflated reputation of any film,"The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My Reviewing Style discussed via the lense of Pulp Fiction,"Let me however extrapolate, embedded in a Pulp Fiction review which I couldn't care less for - on my film review style - from someone who has a media degree in film studies, and began their career wagging school at fourteen to watch French Cinema; and you know what they say about people who have experiences at an impressionable age - it sticks! I gave up on Hollywood in approximately the early seventies after Easy Rider and Zabriskie Point. I even walked out on Five Easy Pieces, even though in retrospect, that wasn't the film's fault, in those days we were keen on life and not on introspection and reflection. Though retrospection, tells me that was a good film. In fact it is the kind of film that the baby boomers now crave, good writing, and good characterisation from a period in history when just being alive was an entertainment, and not bogged down with crazy little computer screens and cowards with their wise-arse messages tweeted because they are too afraid to speak, possibly because even the modulation of the voice has been colonised by trendoids, who are so post-modern and wise-arsed they know everything; but at the head of the pack are a bunch of no-talents who have clamoured to the high ground. And that list is endless in entertainment, now: Quentin Tarantino (highlight-dialogue in Pulp Fiction, ""In Holland, they have mayonnaise on their fries."" - conclusion - lame) Johnny Depp (the guy can't act, get it? That's why Australians get Oscars now, as Hollywood is beyond knowing, who can act]; Russell Crowe (just because Hollywood couldn't get anyone else to fill out a Roman general's tunic except maybe some wooden ex-wrestlers), he wins the Oscar-but in his next movie, A Beautiful Mind, everyone gets an Oscar except him, because basically, when you play a screw-loose professor, exchanging walking around in circles for walking around in squares, it is not acting! It is a guy walking around in squares cos he worked out that was a riff on walking around in circles]; Saving Private Ryan, though I hate to admit it is a brilliant film - through its depiction of my grandfather's generation, who when I was growing thought wasn't cool; but mine who made every piece of furniture in their house to a French polished standard; as well as, the P. A. system for my Uncle's successful band including the foldback cabinets-which even The Beatles didn't have-as well as keeping a 200 acre dairy farm as a hobby. Cool, I don't think I knew the meaning of the word; but the Juden angle in Saving Private Ryan which is shoved towards the POWs by a man brandishing - a Star of David (on his dog-tags?)-as the POWs march past-I'm not buying because usually and in that war in particular - it is the politicians, the military hierarchy and their bureaucratic underlings who systematically entrench racism as a tool of their propaganda and the common soldier is generally ideologically neuter as they have to follow orders or get shot - otherwise on the western front in 1915 both sides would have turned around and marched home. But that was the only glaring error in my opinion but this ethno-stereotyping, though understandable has spilled into other films, especially the Star Wars epics, by George Lucas, wherein Cowboys and Indians in Outer Space in the early films becomes metaphoric American foreign policy in latter films... to be continued...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Popularity and gameplay victory,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy.
Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities.
""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it.
Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Energetic and imaginative - making up for it's lack of real heart with a great wealth of dialogue and characters,"Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Hopefully some folk might learn a few things about film making , in my modest opine ?","I submit this film is actually ( albeit crime ) actually a redefined renewed genre ! As in R D this narrative takes risks in its
style of of story telling which is virtually a Tarantino invention ! yes it is true of course, every director has his or her unique
style of moulding and honing their story , Tarantino aims his tails in a unique mix of his own well thought out concoctions .
I cannot think of any examples , but anyone who loves cinema will have seen some films that failed in their attempts to
copy Tarantino. Therefore, that statement , it seems to me , is clearly indicative that this director has always triumphed
over all attempts to either go one better than him or out fox Tarantino in the hope of overpowering his style of sculpting .
That is how uniquely brilliant Tarantino is, similar to Gaugin or Michael Angelo he is a true artist in his creations
As has already been said, to try and get some level of comprehension of this film , it needs to be seen a number of times.
The same appreciation and more clarity of understanding is precisely the reason we continue to learn more and acquire
more depth of real academic learning every time we return to the National Gallery in London or the equivalent American ,
Italian or French art galleries . Every viewing of the Mona Lisa we see something previously overlooked, or did not previously
fully understand ! The first page of training for a successful film director comes from his or her hours and hours of intimate study
of form, substance, and colour , of photography also. Kubrick began his career as a monochrome photo journalist , thereby learning
about framing and all the artistry that follows that ! Tarantino i suggest either had a natural eye and sensibility of form, or ( possibly and )
studied from a very early age, as much as he was able with regard to form, framing and colour hues ? And only at a slightly later time in his younger days started writing story lines and ideas ?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Lives up to the hype,"After hearing so many great things about pulp fiction I was intrigued. A story consisting of a bunch of smaller stories that interweave is an interesting concept. And Quentin Tarantino absolutely doesn't fail to make it great.The story is driven by multiple but few characters characters that all serve their own purpose. Pulp fiction is filled with incredible action scenes while also keeping a realistic feel with personal conversations, regret, and emotions.With great performances by every single actor involved especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta who both do amazing jobs in keeping the movie realistic while also showing a lot of emotions.The movie is also incredibly filmed. With amazing angles and shooting scenes that make Pulp fiction a beautiful film with beautiful scenery, it's truly one of the best films from the 90s.I highly recommend you watch Pulp Fiction, it's a beautiful film with amazing acting and actors that all perform incredibly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's best film yet,"Well my first review just accidentally got deleted so here is for a second go of it.. Pulp Fiction has an excellent ability to interweave multiple dissimilar narratives into one cohesive story. It has a knack for balancing tense, dramatic moments with witty, comedic relief. Scenes such as the pawn shop basement with Zed, the hit men's clothing change after hiding a body with the Wolf, and Captain Koons' monologue showcase Tarantino's warped sense of humor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I like the vibe to the movie,"I really like the way this film was orchestrated: from the way the story is told to different camera shots, you can tell a lot of time was put into making it. I watched this film as it is a cult movie (one everybody should watch) And it is arguably Tarantino's best film. The overall experience was great as you can really connect with the different characters and quickly get sucked into the movies plot.

"A pure classic, an incredible fun ride full of surprises","If this movie is so famous and so many people rank it among their top 5 or top 10 there is a very good reason, it's absolutely awesome!!!!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Deserves all the praise it has gotten over the years,"Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Tarantino's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World !!!","This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
several unusual tales going on all at the same time,"I loved this madcap yarn about 2 hitmen for the mob, a mobster's nutty girlfriend, a punch drunk boxer, and 2 ineffective bandits.

The lives of all the players criss-cross with each other forming a collection a mini-stories guaranteed to captivate the viewer. Unusually done film, very entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
7.6/10 - Fits Its Title Perfectly,"Relatively close to the beginning of my deep-dive into cinema - you know, writing reviews and all - Quentin Tarantino managed to become one of my favorites almost instantly. Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained - all of these really blew me away, and even when watching some of his still-popular-but-not-as-much films, he never missed for me. Needless to say that for several years now I've been wanting to watch this movie, but I haven't, because I wanted to make my way towards it up the IMDb poster. And well, look at that. Here we are, on the second feature we're watching from the top 10. Let's get to it.Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's second film, and it's honestly quite a tough one to explain, plot-wise, without getting into spoilers. Let's try to approach it like this: Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is a ruthless, cold-blooded mafia boss. Throughout the film we have three stories, each of them related to his shady business. Our three main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) - a smooth, charming agent under Wallace, Butch (Bruce Willis) - a boxer who has made a dangerous deal with Wallace, and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) - a theatrical, dramatic agent of Wallace who operates alongside Vincent in some of their tasks. Three characters, three interconnected stories.When people think of cool cinema, many of them think of Tarantino, and especially this movie. Tarantino has his way with cool writing, he sure does. Every movie of his I've seen had at least several moments that were really memorable and badass. I wouldn't say that this movie per se is where it shows most - maybe he's still trying too hard, at times, here, considering it's a rather early movie of his, developed from early ideas- but generally, yeah, this movie has some moments that will definitely make you appreciate Tarantino's badass-ness. Something about the casualness of all the violence here (like the old comedy song says, cool guys don't look at explosions) has both comical and awesome nature.The dialogue here plays into this idea of being nonchalantly violent and in danger - characters in life threatening situations can talk about foot massages or coffee like it's nothing. It creates some iconic moments for sure, and this movie is indeed very quotable. Only two significant characters here are poorly written, in my opinion: Winston Wolf and Mia Wallace. Without getting into spoiler territory, I'll just say that the actors (Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman) can do so much better, and pity that they weren't given characters that are fuller, less amateurish.Talking about rough-around-the-edges: the term ""pulp fiction"" refers to books that were provocative, full of sex and violence, but also not so good - only made to sell and entertain. Despite this movie being good, I think that the title does fit it. Just look at the poster - it's like a cover for a book that's supposed to lure you in, stories that teenagers will read and hide because they're supposed to only be for adults. The short-story structure, the general violence and crudeness, how it tries to appeal to guys more than to gals. In the end of the day, it is what it is - a fun film, an entertaining one, but far from being a life altering experience for me.The soundtrack is great, as always. Tarantino has some of the most iconic soundtracks out there, and not only because he picks good songs, but because he knows how to make it fit to the scene perfectly. Usually they have some cool subtext, and they just turn the iconic-meter up almost every time. Always memorable soundtracks.The structure of this movie is unusual, and it's definitely one of the things that it's famous for. It's a cool idea, and though it disturbs the momentum of the movie a little bit it's nothing serious. I do feel like it makes everything a little messier, less consistent, but it's not necessarily a bad thing - this is sort of the point, and I can appreciate that, for better or worse. I also feel like the gold watch story was better than the other ones, btw, but it's not that big of a gap in quality.To sum it up: Pulp Fiction fits its title very, very well - just like a pulp magazine, this movie is a little rough around the edges, but fun and entertaining nonetheless. From the classic poster to the dialogue - everything is screaming violent, crude, hot pulp fiction, and I kinda like it overall, despite (any maybe also because of) its roughness. Feeling a 7.6/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
9 IMDb? Really?,"Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I love violence and language but this is an excessively crude film from a show-off video store clerk turned director.,"""Pulp Fiction"" has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis ""Gimp"" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me.

The Rebirth of Storytelling,"No matter which way you try to look at it, this picture is a masterpiece. The angles are nice, the cinematography is strong, the acting is good, the soundtrack is unmatched but the most important thing this film offers is its storytelling. The story pushes itself in a way that differs it from the other Hollywood movies made at the time. It doesn't really follow a normal ""Guy wants something, gets it"" kind of storyline. Instead it barricades a more Leonesque technique. The kind of storytelling which one would see in old and mostly forgotten pictures like ""The Trio"" or ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" where the story is much more complex than a guy wanting and getting something. This revitalised, superb storytelling, when combined with Tarantino's more down to earth dialogue and imagination, gives us the classic film that is Pulp Fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Yes there were some funny bits, particularly Christopher Walken and the thing about the watch.  Yes Mr. Tarantino coaxed some very good performances out of some fairly mediocre actors, and yes they were aided by one very capable actor (Samuel L. Jackson).  What I don't get is the way everyone seems so enamored of the dialog.  As I recall, it competed for an Oscar that year with Much Ado About Nothing, starring a guy named Denzel Washington, written by a guy named Bill Shakespeare, and the best line from this 154 min. glamorization of our baser instincts seems to be ""What do they call a quarter-pounder with cheese?"" !!!????? As for interleaving plots, I'm wondering if any of the folks so taken with this have ever seen anything made by Robert Altman?

Talk Fiction. Overrated and overpraised disappointment,"I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes.

Tarantino's magnum opus.,"Have you read my IMDb review of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs? The one where I say that, although the film is far from what I would class as original, the director unashamedly plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema, the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right?Same thing applies here. Only more-so.Pulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie, stitched together from ideas, elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk. Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist, the film is a marvel to behold—over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago.Bold and bloody, with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast, a flawless soundtrack, witty (and highly quotable) dialogue, and even a character called Brett, this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Any other year it would have grabbed every Academy award possible, but Tarantino had to settle for only one i.e., Best Original Screenplay.Probably one of the best display of non-linear screenplay, this film revolves around eight characters Pumpkin (Roth), Honey Bunny, Jules (L. Jackson), Vincent (Travolta), Mia (Thurman), Butch (Willis) and Marsellus Wallace (Rhames). Not to mention some of the great cameos from Keitel (The Wolf), Walken (Captain Koons) and Tantino himself as Jimmie.

"The Ultimate Slice Of Culturally Significant Pop-Culture. ""Pulp Fiction"" Is A Morality Piece Beyond Anything You've Ever Seen","Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a ""to-be"" classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from.Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable ""cool"" of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality.Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the ""coolest"" and ""hippest"" films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the ""freedom"" of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms.Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted ""boxer-thug"" performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, ""of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character"".Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy.One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of ""bravo-film-making"". The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be ""sinners"", yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the ""gourmet"" of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of ""lots of cream, lots of sugar"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A creative and slick waste of time,"You want to do something really neat? Take the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on!

"Violence and Redemption Underscore ""Pulp Fiction""","""Pulp Fiction"" is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, ""Pulp Fiction"" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of ""Pulp Fiction.""Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with ""The Bonnie Situation."" The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence.Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor.The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is ""The Gold Watch"" section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his ""Die Hard"" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. ""The Gold Watch"" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family.""The Bonnie Situation"" may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally ""shot Marvin the face."" ""The Bonnie Situation"" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he ""walks the earth."" Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny's"" last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Too long, too boring with poor story development","It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn't work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn't.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He ""played"" a dance, which isn't the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn't dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn't a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren't just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn't like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn't have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn't last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn't a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don't know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don't really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"I dare you, I double dare you if you don't love this movie! 8/10","First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest.

Quentin Tarantino's second strike.,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.A lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""The Presidio"" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing ""Pulp Fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.There are essentially three stories in ""Pulp Fiction,"" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""Deliverance.""Back to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction."" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates ""Pulp Fiction"" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.5/5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Damn Near Perfect,"I just finished watching Pulp FictionTarantino nails his screenplay again. This type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. You either have it or you do not. Sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like Tarantino.Too many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. The dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. I'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again.I think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.Whilst this movie revived John Travolta's career, it's Samuel L Jackson who steals the show. Every time I watch the movie I think he should have won the Oscar. Then I watch Ed Wood, and think Martin Landau deserved it. My opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies I last watched.Harvey Kieren (in his second Tarantino flick) is great as Winston Wolf (I really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) Tim Roth (also in his second Tarantino flick) and Amanda Plummer fun and I can not believe I never noticed it was Steve Buscemi (also in his second Tarantino flick) as the waiter Buddy Holly at Jack Rabbit Slim's.Pulp Fiction was a massive hit.

What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further.

'And you will know my name is the lord!! When I lay my vengeance upon thee....',"An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece.

Classic Pulpy Amusement,"It's no surprise that 'Pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clichéd and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also there's a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. There's also a certain ambiguity about it. It's not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then there's the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt there's anything to say about 'Pulp Fiction' that hasn't been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies.

It's hard for me to think what someone viewing it more than a quarter of a century later would make of it. Hopefully it can be viewed in context and see how revolutionary the film really was.One striking thing, which was quite novel at the time, is how the scenes aren't shown chronologically. What at first seems like a gimmick makes more and more sense as the film progresses and on repeat viewings.

Decent but it's not a masterpiece to me,"Throughout the years I often heard how Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time. It wasn't until today I finally had taken the time to sit down and watch this for the first time from start to finish to see what all the fuss is about. Needless to say, this is a very mixed bag for meWhat I like about Pulp Fiction is the plot being all jumbled up and not straight forward like many other movies where you see how everything begins and ends. Pulp Fiction doesnt do that. It's back to front so to speak starting at the end but going backwards. It feels disconnected and out of place as it tells different stories but they are actually are all connected in a wayI also liked the deep themes and talks of existentialism, nihilism and philosophical talks of God with some of the characters. It also helped the movie had a great star studded cast to give Pulp Fiction and extra umph to itWhat I dont like is the subplot for Burce Willis's character that involved him and a mob boss being tied up and were about to be raped by two guys with the mob boss getting raped. I hate rape and I hate how it's used in media. It's just awful and always feel sick about it. If I had known rape was a factor in Pulp Fiction I would not have bothered at all. Thankfully though the rapists get what's coming to them in the endI also didnt like how some scenes and dialogue with the characters fell flat where nothing really happens and it just drags on and on. I actually didnt start to like or get interested until Bruce Willis is in a shootout with the mob boss character but then the rape part comes ugh.Overall this movie was decent and I have no regrets in taking the time to watch this for my Sunday morning.

I didn't expect to like it, I was only watching it for Frank Whaley, but I hated this movie, really hated with it with it's various plot holes that do not make sense(watch ""Short Cuts"" if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people), obnoxious, unsympathetic characters(I wanted to cheer when John Travolta died, or did he die? I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being ""cool"" and trying to have ""catch phrases,"" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as ""daring"" ""good"" film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Do the Right Thing"" for my least favorite ""good"" movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture.,"It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture.It's an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years. Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).Though, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character.If I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues.Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Action packed,"It is a good movie, Action packed and interesting use of time. If you like Fight Club you will like Pulp fiction. I found the acting to be well done with an amazing performance from Samuel L. Jackson, and John Travolta. This movie can be comic and sad at the same time and contains very many different view points about how life works. I found that this movie is not at all rated for children and should be avoided by those who are easily offended or have weak stomachs. Drug use is prevalent in this movie. I am very pleased with the overall final result, great flick.

The Quintessential '90s Film,"I saw this movie nine times in the theater when it came out; it resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genres.The second directorial effort from then fairly unknown Tarantino but it was a brilliant sophomore effort hitting the proper notes on all the main categories; directing, score, cinematography, acting / casting, plot, writing, etc. I cannot suggest this film to everyone; you need a certain sense of humor and a certain means of looking at a plot-line to truly enjoy it, but for those that have those prerequisites this is required viewing.This film in my top tier and one that can be watched at any time.

Stylistic Brilliance,"If I may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. This film. Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that.This is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinée screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days.I hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max: Fury Road.One thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MM:FR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Unadulterated dreck,"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent.

It was not the first Tarantino movie i saw, nor the 2nd,3rd, or 4th but it should have been. I now know why this movie is so well known. The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion.

Pulp Fiction is Perfection,"After Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino was asked to direct Men in Black, Speed and numerous other titles, however he refused all so he could concentrate on writing the masterpiece that has now become the daring, hilarious and beloved Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction was originally planned to be three separate stories all written and directed by a different person. Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer.
The film is a glorious ""F you"" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch.
Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself.
Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech.
Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to ""normal"" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction.
The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Sad Commentary on today's world,"It is very sad for me to see such an awful, immoral movie on any top list. Much less number 19.  This high rating shows how desensitized the world had made us.  That people would rave over a movie that shows a man raping another man, that uses the f-word 200 times in the first 10 minutes, that shows what is supposedly pieces of a man's head splatter in a car, and that shows people overdosing on drugs, is very, very disturbing, disheartening, and sickening.  There was no redeeming value to this movie.  It was awful and should not have been given a rating R, or, for that matter, have ever even been released to view.  I guess if you are morbid and over 30, they should have rented it to you, but no one under 30, and certainly no one under 21, should have been able to see this movie.  I was sixteen when I saw it, and I was appalled.  I was not impressed by the colorful display of language, drugs, sexual immorality, or violence in this movie.  They should have created a new rating for this movie, no one with any type of morals should see this movie, whatever letter that would be.

Deserves all the praise.,"Pulp Fiction is clever, funny, well acted, well directed, thought provoking and extremely entertaining. Best performance of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta's careers as well as an amazing addition to Quentin Tarantino's Filmography. The film is darkly comedic and makes you laugh hysterically over moments that you would otherwise not find amusing. The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative.

Meaningless genius.,"I think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. It can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, Pulp Fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
10/10. Not much else to add,"It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An exceptional script but devoid of anything but nihilism,"I can certainly respect this movie. As a form of art it is fantastically unique and masterfully eclectic. It is the epitome of a postmodern film - with no conventional story structure, no central conflict, no clear moral, achronological 'storytelling', and so on. It definitely needs to be appreciated for its incredible style.But as with most postmodernist art, tossing aside everything that makes traditional art good sure stands out as bold and unique, but it comes with its negatives. And unlike most reviewers I don't think being 'unique' is a sufficient substitute for being devoid of the traditional things that make a film good.For instance, this movie does not have great pacing. Partially a result of the lack of (conventional) plot development and story structure, but also partially a result of the often (deliberately) mundane dialogue. I realize postmodern art can often be very self-referential, but I personally can't see why a lot of this dialogue had to exist. It doesnt immerse you, it doesnt engage you, or advance the plot... its usually not even funny. So whats the point?But what is the point in general? Pulp fiction meanders around without really giving any core messages. Perhaps right at the end in the epilogue scene, it says something meaningful and ties at least some of the themes together quite well. And masterful as Tarantino is, the scene is just ambiguous enough to keep people talking about what exactly it means.So yes, this is a great movie to analyze and critique, but its missing too many ingredients that make a story great to experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Crazyness all over the board,"for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The greatest movie about absolutely nothing,"Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.Pulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100.

You know what they call a 1/4 Pounder with Cheese?,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

the most over valued film of the '90s,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pulp Fiction (1994),"This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
8 - Great,"Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue.This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
How to make a cool movie,"Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just don't like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50"" plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has ""COOL"" this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Pulp Fiction. It is the REAL DEAL.,"Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not.Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry.Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible.Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Sensationalistic crime flick missing one ingredient.,"Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting.

The worst movie I've ever seen,"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Cinematic Standard. Bold Film-making. A Classic.,"This is the most reviewed movie for which I have ever attempted to craft an original review - almost 2,800 posted reviews here on IMDB, so far. I'm sure everything has been said already, so I'll keep this review short.'The Twist' scene with Travolta and Thurman was courageous film-making from a young director, and it took even more courage to include it in the final version of the film. At the end of the day, if we don't all agree that 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) was genius, then Tarantino looks arrogant and we all point to that scene as an example of a has-been actor and an over-rated young director. Instead, I watch that scene and hold my breath, because even without dialogue, Tarantino used two cameras to make magic on the screen for those few minutes. That scene is a microcosm of the entire film - bold & brilliant.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"""Take a trip with me to a masterpiece of the 90's""","PULP FICTION is a singular show. The best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the living room with the television and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images. This is complemented with one of the funniest, smartest, and filthiest dialogs I have heard in a long time. There is no other movie I can compare it to. It has the adrenaline flow of SPEED, the intelligent dialog of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, the violence of the goriest part of the GODFATHER, and the comedy of AUSTIN POWERS. All that having been said, it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects I just mentioned.If extreme violence (e.g., brains blown on car windows) is something you can not endure, if 700 uses of the F word is something you can not tolerate, if heavy drug use is something you care never to see (cocaine is passe we learn, all of the in-gangsters now do heroin), then do not pay your money to see PULP FICTION.On the other hand, all of the above really works in this show. This is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one. This is a show that takes one chance after another. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are nothing short of terrific in it. Oscars are possible here. They play the hit men for a major bad guy (Marsellus Wallace). The bad guy is also paying a boxer (Bruce Willis) to take a dive. Harvey Keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple of two-bit crooks who like robbing restaurants because nobody else does that. Eric Stoltz plays a low class drug dealer and Rosanna Arquette plays his girlfriend who has rings in every part of her anatomy (yes, there too). Christopher Walken shows up in a single long important scene. Uma Thurman plays the major bad guy's wife. Whew, and I probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting.The major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter. He was also the director - Quentin Tarantino. The script went from funny scenes like a restaurant where all the staff were 50s famous look-alikes to a scene where the two hit men were first discussing what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in France and why to a discussion of whether it was okay to kill someone for massaging your wife's feet.This is a movie that to describe it will only make you want NOT to go see it, yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful. The intensity level of the movie is off the scale. People were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too. Other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud ""oh, my god"". Several scenes were worse than the finger cutting scene in The Piano.The camerawork was mainly standard stuff, but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental. The best example is the long scene of Wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy, whom we have not yet seen, delivering a long lecture. It then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while Willis listens for quite a while more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino breaks out,Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece of Characters and Dialogue,"Pulp Fiction (1994)**** (out of 4)Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Highly Overrated..Suppose to be a Gangster film???,"Pulp Fiction is the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Reservior Dogs had released and was the talk of the town. Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare.

nomen est omen,"When Pulp Fiction hit the theaters it had an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation. And Palme d'Or cemented its reputation. Bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. Therefore it was a must see. And after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: Was that it?Some years down the line i've seen more contemporary TV shows from the US and it became clear why Pulp Fiction stood apart. As the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. Why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isn't. There were other things where Pulp Fiction excelled. For example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any CD collection at the end of the 20th century.The way i understood Tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. Although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it.Overall, Pulp Fiction is an exercise in marketing. The title, as well as author's statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. However, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating it's reputation to being one of the best movies of all times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Evil, Blood and Gore Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption;  and WHAT?""","SpoilersThis movie says that life sometimes sends a message from God so we should listen. This plot moves in and out of several related stories and the time-line jumbles around so that the way it is presented, it enables us to see the hand of God. We see justice served and spirituality wins out and the evil gets killed, and/or embarrassed and/or other nasty things.We start the movie in a restaurant and watch a husband and wife robbery team begin a robbery. There are two hit men in that restaurant. We move in and out of a story of the two hit men who work for a mobster named Marcel. We watch the hit men pull off a hit and get the money that the victim (played by Frank Whaley) owed the mobster Marcel. I got a real kick out of Whaley repeating ""What?"". The hit-man points his gun and says: ""Go ahead, say ""What"" again! I dare ya! I double dare ya! Then Whaley's character says ""What?"". BLAM! He is shot in the leg.We watch as one of the hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) takes Marcel's wife out on the town, per Marcel's orders. Vega fears his boss Marcel's jelousy. Additionally, Marcel's wife ODs. Then we watch a frantic rescue effort bring her back.We watch as a boxer (played Bruce Willis) is told and paid by Marcel to throw a fight. Instead this boxer pummels his opponent to death in the first round. Then he attempts to gettaway with the help of a lady cab driver, who was turned on by the killing.There are many more surprises in this movie and a reason why I called this ""Evil Blood and Guts Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?"".

"The Most Important Film,Ever","It took me next to twenty years to review this film appropriately; i should say, it took me the best part of ten years to realise that not everyone might see it my way. Under close scrutiny, the world of cinema goes this way, more or less: Kurosawa, a Japanese, and two italians, Fellini and Antonioni, subvert just about every rule that Hitchcock laid down; then nothing else happens for thirty years, with Hollywood slowly draining the life out of world cinema (see Transformers 2), until a guy called Quentin Tarantino released this second film, after the poor (or great, if you are a traditionalist) Reservoir Dogs, called Pulp Fiction. And it obliterates every rule that every filmmaker across the civilised world ever tried to establish.John Travolta takes flight to a role so high across the sky that no reviewer is ever going to be able to demolish it, no matter the angle. This is the role that will inspire humans for the next two hundred years; this is the Shakespeare of the modern world. The first director to utilise black actors effectively. The first example of 100% quality production after the dust and sweat of traditional Hollywood arenas.Pulp Fiction is a film of such incredible intricacy that it's unfathomable to anyone but a big-brain film school student, and even than, who knows. Do not feel ashamed if you miss its finer points. But for history, this is the one, the only, the film that takes over from Yojimbo, from 8 1/2, from La Nave Va, from Shichinin no Samurai, and more ... and just moves on forward. There is more film in twenty minutes of PF than there is in the whole of a typical Hollywood production of the 70's. So there are those films above this one. Space Oddissey. The Godfather. These are just targeted products. You will never find someone who has a coherent film critique of Pulp Fiction.

Read Some Vonnegut,"Sorry to degrade from the structure of how things go, but this is a hybrid between a review and a defense of the film.As far the movie itself, I could be locked in a room for a few weeks with it. It's what movies where made for. It is entertainment- sure and simple. I'm not gonna dive really into what the movie tries to do, because I see that more as a viewer's perspective. I can say, however, that whatever it it tries to do it does well. The acting, the dialogue, and everything else about it is gripping. The most overarching thing about it to me, though, is the absurdity. The absurdity is concocted at just the right angle so as to create a strange world, but one we can dwell our minds in. Reality itself is absurd in itself, is it not? This is what particularly draws me into this movie, and makes me like it so much.This is also the reason I think a lot of people hate it. The main insults toward the film regard it's ""lack of plot,"" ""lack of core,"" and ""lack of meaning, or anything at all."" Did I miss some section of the Geneva Convention that mandated how a movie had to be made? Yeah, typically a more linear and mountain shaped plot/ story line give that feeling of satisfaction at the end, but leave that to other movies. There are plenty to spare.People accuse it of being hollow as far as spirituality and meaning go. I find this kind of funny and ironic because I think that is exactly how it emphasizes these two subjects. The interactions and experiences of the characters in this absurd reality are what make it so real. We really don't have lives much different from Vincent and Jules. We're all figuring it out as we go, , under pressure of constantly changing circumstances, making decisions for ourselves in a place where we don't have much direction.If you can't find in this movie what others do, I guess you just aren't catching with them. It's really a matter of choice. These are all things that make Kurt Vonnegut novels what they are. Lack of tangency with seemingly pointless digressions. But that is what makes them brilliant. They place a film on life to view it with a new perspective. It's up to you how much value and entertainment there is in something like that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a thrill ride!,"There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start!I had no idea what I was ""in for"" when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the ""f word""?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about ""gangsters"" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the ""f word"" really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: ""it's ok to do drugs and kill people"".  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the ""it's the movies fault that there are problems..."" tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mildly amusing in parts,"Pulp Fiction is mildly amusing in parts, and in all honesty relies completely on the scene that makes the movie, from where Bruce Willis walks past the clothesline to where he makes up with the hilarious crime boss. Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its ""iconic"" style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The ""modern"" images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men. The Bruce Willis character, and his performance, help salvage this, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Love it or hate it, but I give it ""5"" of 10 for style!","Read the external reviews, like Ebert's or Barardinellis', if you want to know more about ""content"" of Pulp Fiction. Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for ""interweaving 3 different stories."" Ever watch the TV series ""Northern Exposure?"" Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various ""philosophical discussions"", like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as ""Longitude"", ""Nixon"", ""Apollo Thirteen"", ""Amistad"" - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Matrix"". Or thought-provoking ones such as ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""American History X"", ""Lone Star"", or ""Good Will Hunting"".I give low ratings to such films as ""The Game"", ""The Usual Suspects"" - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think ""Pulp Fiction"" exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Redefining the Episodic Film,"This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as ""My Life to Live,"" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).Some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.I understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).What I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.Other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.This movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.4.0/4.0",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the Greatest Dialogues for One of the Greatest Films Ever Made,"Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Quentin Tarantino. It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump.Pulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, a mob boss played by Ving Rhames, the mob boss's wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis. Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson.The part which makes this film so good is its dialogue. About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking, but the dialogue is so well written and interesting, you could sit and watch them for hours. This film deserved its Oscar by miles. All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions, are not going to be impressed due to its long, dialogue heavy scenes.It has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to ""read between the lines"", if you want a film like that, then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a straight up entertaining film which you don't even need to watch all the way through once you've watched it a few times.This film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion, it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers List.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Room 416 prior to entering the apartment to Matthew 4:16,"So I've been a fan of Pulp Fiction since I was in High School. I watched the movie last night for the first time in awhile and was struck by never really knowing what was in the brief case, so I watched the scene in great detail. I noticed the apartment number was #416. So thinking this is probable related to a bible verse I looked up one starting with Matthew 4:16. I don't read the bible often if ever but since the Movie has the lighting up brief case locked at 666, and Jules set for a path of salvation on seriously changing his ways from a gangster to walking the earth in the path of the Shepard I thought to look it up. So Matthew 4:16 reads ""the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."" I think this relates to the brief case, the people who had it, to Vincent which stayed in the land of the dark and ended up dead, and to Jules which turned to ""the path of the Shepard"" as he says. A great light was shone to Jules (which was currently living in the land of the dark) after the bullets whizzed by him and a light dawned as it did for all the others in the room which where also all living in the land of the shadow of death. Just a theory but better than anything else I've looked through yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
pulp,Every Terintino film I've ever seen has been awesome. This is no exception. The movie is so good and just interesting he has like four stories and ends up connecting every single one. The movie is super intense at parts and then really funny at others. The part where Sam L. Jackson takes that guys big kahuna burger and is questioning him is so tense since you know he isn't making it out alive. Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car!

"Coming of age film. No, seriously.","I am not much for writing reviews, so this will be brief, as well as the polar opposite of profound. I saw this movie when I was 17 and it changed my life. Up to that point, movies I watched were one dimensional action flicks with cliché characters and predictable plots. Pulp Fiction made me laugh, cringe, yell out loud, cover my eyes and get nauseated. It was the first movie that I saw that I couldn't stop thinking about for days after. I watched it again and again, picking up new details, and connecting the dots. This film opened my eyes up to a whole different genre of movies and a whole new appreciation for storytelling. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and in some ways, still is.

What is it about?,"Pulp Fiction made Quentin Tarantino who he is today. He showed us what he was capable of with Reservoir Dogs, but with Pulp Fiction, he made his mark in cinema and it will stay there forever. I love Pulp Fiction, I love it so much. It's just one of those movies I could watch on repeat for the rest of my life and I wouldn't mind it. But what makes it so great? It's basically just a bunch of people talking, the entire movie. But it so well scripted and directed, the Pulp Fiction script is perhaps the best script ever written. Royale with Cheese? Hell yeah! Everyone in film school should read the script to this masterpiece. Needless to say, all the actors in the film have reached iconic status and deliver great performances. Pulp Fiction is one of the most iconic movies of all time. What makes it so great for me is the fact that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of random stuff that happens and it has a great script, that's it. But to make a movie about nothing and make it one of the greatest, most entertaining films of all time, is an achievement. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino. Thank you.Written and directed by Tarantino, it's considered by many to be one of the most influential and best movies of all time. In my opinion, it is the best written film of all time. Pulp Fiction is a film driven almost completely by its dialogue: It's two and a half hours of mostly people talking and one would think that's a negative but the dialogue is extremely clever and engaging. The performances are brilliant as it features a pitch perfect cast. The directing choices are awesome, the cinematography is perfect for what it needs to be and you can't talk about Pulp Fiction without mentioning the soundtrack. Possibly the greatest soundtrack in a movie ever. The dialogue is so good it features so much quotable dialogue.I'm a big fan of structure in most movies but the beautiful thing about Pulp Fiction is that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of stories mixed together to create an entertaining film about gangsters, dancing the twist and foot massages. There is only one scene in Pulp Fiction I dislike, because I really feel it does not advance the plot and it feels like it slows the movie down for me and that is when Butch and his girlfriend are in the hotel room at night. The scene lasts like 5 minutes only at it feels like it could have been trimmed to two. However, this is really a minor detail. Pulp Fiction is one of the most entertaining movies ever made and it is an essential viewing for any film lover in general.9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Love-Hate:   Been There/Done That,"From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest.With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.

The Movie,"There is a world of many, many motion pictures, from Roundhay Garden Scene in 1888, to the films of Charlie Chaplin, Ingmar Bergman, to the Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, and Casablanca. There is Titanic and Terminator, there is Night of the Living Dead and Gigli. There is The Godfather and Space Jam. In a world of several hundreds of thousands of movies, the most familiar and yet still original is Pulp Fiction.Perhaps life long cinephilia breeds a great filmmaker? Perhaps ""veteran"" actors are better than more contemporary actors? Perhaps dialog can be one of the most memorable parts of a film? While only a handful of films top Pulp Fiction in terms of quality, and craft, at 154 minutes, it remains cool, cocky, and deeper than what is led on during the first viewing.Not telling you about the plot is probably best for those unfamiliar with it. To call it a film with out a message is incredibly arrogant. Reading between fairly thick lines is a story about human redemption and choices. No mainstream movie maker has attempted what Tarantino does here.The characters are interesting, along with the acting in terms of greatness, and deep, along with the dialog, cinematography, storyline, and direction. Compared to Tarantino's Jackie Brown, it is very in your face, in a good way. You'll actually get to appreciate movies more after you see Pulp Fiction.The violence presented in minimalist, and very tastefully done. But best of all, it is, well, cool. It leaves me feeling shaken, like a powerful wave comes over me.Don't go in with any expectations however, experience it pure. Then you realize how fantastic it truly is.

Tarantino intends to rile people up.After the boxer story plays out, we slide back in time to the previous day, when we learn why the hit men showed up in strange college-guy clothes. It's because after the first hit, they took one of their spies home with them. While gesturing dramatically with a gun, Travolta learns why the first rule of gun safety is never point a gun at something you are not willing to destroy. The gun, as guns do, goes bang; the young man, as young men do when hit by bullets, goes ker-blooie.

Luckily, the scene of Jules in the diner with Ringo and Yolanda had very little foul language, but it's the most powerful scene.

I had every intention of loving ""Pulp Fiction"" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It's violence that's harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.It's a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it's favor is that it's somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that's not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like ""Andrei Rublev"" is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. ""Pulp Fiction"" is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It's very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It's so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it's paper thin. This is exactly what I don't want in cinema",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliant story telling makes this movie an unique one.,"Quentin Tarantino had done it again. If you thought he would just be an one day fly after ""Reservoir Dogs"", you couldn't be more wrong.Once again just like in ""Reservoir Dogs"" the storytelling is unique. The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated, they are not told in the right order. It sound like the story is hard to follow, how ever this is not the case. The story is easy to follow, so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it.The movie is filled with sex, drugs, violence and bad language. All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies.All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken. Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movieA must see unique movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A landmark in modern film making,"This is without a doubt, one of the finest movies ever made. It has an oscar winning script, great characters and some career performances from Jackson, Willis, Travolta and Thurman.This movie is so clever and well thought out. Some people find it confusing. Rubbish!. The structure of this film is one of the things which makes it so good and original. when put in chronological order, the story makes complete sense, the stucture is not a gimmick.The cast of this film is truly excellent. Travolta got nominated for best actor at the Oscars but lost out to Tom Hamks (who was truly deserving as forest gump but, IMO, not as much as Travolta was as Vincent). The character of Vincent is a scumbag but Travolta's performance makes him lovable and funny and likable. Sam Jackson also puts in a stunning performance (The scene in the diner is truly stunning acting).I could talk this film up all day but i wont. Just go see it and you'll see for yourself how films should be made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fantastic! 10/10,"Before I write about this movie, I'd just like to say that this would probably be my favourite movie of all time. The dialogue is witty and the acting cool and slick.Pulp Fiction is a brilliant story split into three tales about different groups of people and how they're lives become intertwined. The events though, do not appear in chronological order. This makes the movie much more interesting. Tarantino arranges his first scene to merge with his final one in a remarkable way. Those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken. The first of the three stories starts off with Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). They are making a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). On their way to this hit Vincent tells Jules that about his upcoming job for Marsellus and how uneasy he feels about it. His job is to take his wife, Mia, out and show her a good time (nothing sus). This story goes on to show us the time had between Mia and Vincent. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."" This is Jules' (Samuel L. Jackson) version of Ezekiel 25:17. And it is this that he recites before he kills. But the rest of the story is about Mia and Vincent and their time together. The Second story, ""The Gold Watch"", is about a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis). It starts off with the story of his gold watch that his dad gave to him. All of the trouble that he went through to giver him his watch. After this reminisces, it comes to the present where Marsellus is paying Butch to throw the upcoming fight. I wont list the events that happen in this part of the movie, as I don't want to spoil anything. The third and final story, ""The Bonnie Situation"", clears up a few things. This chapter ties up the start of the movie and tells us how it got to the point in the cafe. It also introduces Jim (Quentin Tarantino. Vincent and Jules take a dead body to his place in order to clean up the car and so forth. This is where the Wolf is called in. (Harvey Keitel). This last scene is a great example of closure and how the characters lead up to the events already shown in the movie (hope that made sense).An excellent movie. Again, the dialogue was witty and everything in it had that feel that come when watching a Tarantino movie. 10/10. Fantastic. Will be next to impossible to beat",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"So nostalgic, superbly-acted, and so 90-stylish","This is one of movie that raising Tarantino to an apex level. He was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. Reservoir dogs, his first movie, is one kind of movie, using a similar 90s retro theme. Those style was an inheritance of Tarantino, it was his original natural-touch. His 90s movies severely enjoyable for young and mid-aged people. Nowadays, his 90s movie prevalent considered as trend-setter which used by so many directors nowadays, for example lets look at kill bill. Stylish but harsh with slow-mo action shot and consider the raid 2 and kingsman : secret service as its descendant.Pulp fiction is a film which considered as classic. Lets try to analyze it distinctly. First thing first, i am gonna highlight the performance of Samuel L Jackson. Indisputably, Jacksons performance is potent. You cant contest this level of characterization without any serious contemplation, because in this movie, Jackson ranked highly in top performance of all time category. Even an amateur audience could say this level of acting is above average. I even feel scared by his act (interrogating scene), its like I've been really charged by a verdict and witness him ready to gut me was really haunting and obnoxious.Secondly, the writing. Honestly, the plot could drive me from not in a mod into a freak. The joy element implicitly delivered from the writing to the audience. The interrogating scene, driving scene (in early duration), and of course the magnificent dancing scene. All these scenes were devoted by great screenplay technique. For example lets take a look and analyze the interrogating scene. Watch and remember Jacksons movement and watch the camera position carefully. At early, Tarantino using some establishing shot and some full-shot to all characters inside. It brings an introduction message while giving suspense to audience. Jacksons movement from outside the door to in the middle of the room to in front of sofa is a support to these shots. It sends horror expression to the interrogated characters. Then lately, while berating and punishing Tarantino using close-up shot and extreme close-up shot to execute. These give a huge pressure and impoverishing the morale of interrogated person. The force of pressure intensified by slow-paced play as Jackson moving. Those was an example of incredible screenplay and writing technique. This technique also used by legendary director Sergio Leone to his western movies.The 90s euphoria direction was the highest aspect of this movie. It shape the whole film with joyful nostalgic of 90s, such as the music and pop culture. The nostalgic invention of this new movie in 90s permeated to the whole audience until now. It persist as a classic nowadays. Tarantino was a terrific boy these day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

great method of story-telling,"'Pulp Fiction' scores extra stars for setting up an original way of story-telling. The story is told from end to beginning (well, sort of), and it follows a few characters who get caught up in some misunderstanding or mess involving crime or criminal. Thoroughly engaging but often warped and funny, this film is a pleasure to watch. In the final scenes, the viewer learns how the different stories of the characters are connected, bringing an even closer meaning to the film. 'Pulp Fiction' is very creative in its story-telling method. That is what makes this a good film, and without it, this film would be dull and like any other film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Not Something I'd Praise As A Great Movie,"OK first of all I saw this a little while ago and I don't see how anybody could like this film except for the stars: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Peter Greene, Bruce Willis, and Ving Rhames. The plot is all messed around and unorganized making it very difficult to understand. The Characters are all technically bad guys. Like I said the only good thing this film has to offer is the acting. Overall the film makes very little sense the way it is told, the characters are all unlikable. I really believe that if any film should get rated way lower than a 0 out of ten, this is it! I mean just how it got as high as an 8.9 out of 10 is beyond me. I'd continue on ranting about how bad the story is written but this film just isn't worth anymore time. Please if you're wanting to see a great crime film go watch Goodfellas(1990) and if you want to go see a good action film go watch the Hunted(2003). This film rated from me is only a 1 out of 10 since it did have many famous and good actors but Mars Attacks is way better and that was a comedy film!!!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Don't Be A Rectangle,"Quentin Tarantino is a storyteller. With ""Pulp Fiction"" he demonstrates some of his favorite story features, like portrayal of a violent subculture and a cast of colorful characters. As the film tells us at its start, the pulp fiction genre is characterized by the lurid-a word that can mean merely colorful or extremely sensational. His films often border on film noir, but unlike most noir, there is a pulpy depth of character development that comes from extended dialogue.Except for a brief detour into a seemingly unrelated sub-story, the film begins with Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two men on the way to an unknown assignation. As they drive along, they discuss continental differences in language and culture. They philosophize openly and reveal significant aspects of their life views. When the viewer eventually realizes the nature of their outing, there is incongruence between their casual demeanor and the significance of their errand.Tarantino serves up his characters with heaping slices of humanity that undercut the judgments one might make if he was not privy to their internal systems of logic and morality. He reminds us that the old actor's precept is true: all people/characters believe they are justified in their actions.Vincent and Jules are not the central characters throughout the film. The story meanders in a non-linear way and indulges in detours that appear to be unrelated, but Tarantino has his eye on the entire, relevant whole. Though he may indulge in flights of fancy simply for the fun of doing so, he has a cohesive vision. Those flights of fancy are some of the most enjoyable moments in the film, like the restaurant called Jack Rabbit Slim's, where Vincent spends some time with the wife (Uma Thurman) of his boss. It's a restaurant that anyone might want to visit, filled with entertaining design elements and colorful people.As in at least four other films before, Tarantino puts Travolta on a dance floor and capitalizes on his ability to deliver memorable, if not iconic, performances.Tarantino gives us dialogue that is richly quotable. No wonder so many fans enjoy his films.Tarantino is definitely an auteur. His artistic vision is as recognizable as Hitchcock's or Woody Allen's. ""Pulp Fiction"", for reasons I have mentioned, is like a primer on how to engage an audience and take them on a journey. This is a film classic that will, no doubt, inspire other writers and directors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Good (maybe great) film, but not a masterpiece.","When Pulp Fiction first came out, I thought it was the greatest movie ever made and was sure that it would become a classic. Earlier today though, I saw it again after not viewing it for several years and my opinion of it is now a bit lower.It's still a good movie and there are aspects of it that are certainly great. The plot is well constructed and the story lines are compelling. There are a variety of interesting characters and many humorous and dramatic scenes. Several actors (who were at their peak at the time) have juicy roles and give excellent performances: Uma Thurman, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and Christopher Walken. Overall, the movie is unbelievably entertaining.After seeing Pulp Fiction again though, with several more years of movie viewing experience now under my belt, parts of it look amateurish. The shots don't always work; composition is bad, stuff is out of focus, lighting is bad. Although the banal conversations are fantastic, the dialogue doesn't work all the time either, particularly for Samuel L. Jackson's character. When I listened to him, I couldn't help but think that this is how a white dude thinks a black gangster should talk. There are also a ton of obvious continuity and factual errors in the film that are distracting (check the ""Goofs for Pulp Fiction"" page here at IMDB for an incomplete listing of them). In most movies, I don't notice these kinds of errors because they're so subtle, but in Pulp Fiction they're glaring.Pulp Fiction is still cool and enjoyable, but it seems like I can look at it in a more critical light now. It's been almost ten years since it was made and the hype is finally starting to die down. It's a good (maybe great) film, but it's not a classic or a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I can't believe that I have to defend this movie.,"Normally, I wouldn't bother to contribute my thoughts on a movie made back in '94, but I'm doing so for two reasons: 1.) It is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, I've seen quite a few) 2.) I just watched it again last night (on DVD for the first time), which motivated me to go to IMDB and read the reviews.  I was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. The following is more for the naysayers than anyone else.For those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence: well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted.  Summed up in the question: ""does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?"", I believe that it's a two-way street, and Pulp Fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle.  It's a glimpse of a world that I dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all.For those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot: have you never heard of character development?  A lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes.  The ""pointless"" conversation between Jules and Vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is Vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other.The ""pointless"" dialog between Butch and Fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship.  That exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple.  It's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange.And plot?  Well, as it's been stated many times: its redemption, stupid. Not only for Jules, but for Butch as well.  Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness.Regarding the non-linear editing: is there a real problem with that?  Did it really confuse people all that much?  Were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people I saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion?  Did Tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool?  I think not.  I do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note.  The alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been Fabienne and Butch riding off on Zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing.Acting: what's not to like?  Have you seen any of Travolta's movies prior to this?  Utter trash.  With this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled.  Bruce Willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance.  The scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch.  Seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless.Direction?  Are you serious?  The needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  You WERE in that living room with them.  You felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as Vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. That intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent.  The choreography was in a word, perfect.And as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped?  In my own defense, I saw this movie THE DAY it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching Reservoir Dogs. Basically, I knew little of Tarantino, but I knew that Dogs was among the best movies I'd seen in a long time.  Although I had seen and enjoyed Natural Born Killers and True Romance prior to PF, I was at the time unaware that their origins were with Tarantino.Pulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. If you haven't seen it yet, what in God's name are you waiting for?  If you saw it and didn't like it, what in God's name is wrong with you?  What part of the formula for a good movie is missing in Pulp Fiction?Kudos to those who have praised it, and thank you Quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making.  My apologies for the length.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Kinetic and sneaky, narcotizing and primal...","Quentin Tarantino co-wrote, directed and co-stars in this flamboyant, literate, byzantine drama which is structured like a dime-store novel. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are Los Angeles hit-men, Uma Thurman is a gangster's girl whom Travolta is asked to entertain, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run after one of his fights ended in death. Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well, resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's. Is it really that good? Yes, the verbal interplay and canny, cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating, and the performances by Travolta, Jackson and Willis (and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin) are near-perfection; however, the film's mixture of queasy, bloody violence (undermined by the jokey tone) and the barrage of foul-mouthed, low-life characters can easily become wearing. It won't be to everyone's taste, surely, but it's a visceral, gripping cinematic experience nevertheless, one with a knockout soundtrack and an Oscar-winning screenplay. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Whereas the earlier Reservoir Dogs contains elements of the corrupted, overlapping narrative, it delivers its stories clumsily, only hinting at the overwhelming, challenging style that Pulp Fiction would eventually bring. His influence is evident in the way that so many young emerging film makers have emulated his rapidly delivered story lines and fractured narrative structure, from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels through to Go, or Run Lola Run.

Great film.,"I don't deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though.

 very existence of modern society.
 
 There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion, 
 the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's 
 director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start 
 to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an 
 untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The 
 only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a 
 collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely 
 together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude, 
 made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse, 
 accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as 
 cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a 
 highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art' 
 piece is doubly irresponsible.
 
 Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth. 
 There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to 
 perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they 
 perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to 
 what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly 
 likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from 
 perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer 
 and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the 
 film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where 
 an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the 
 'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring 
 Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia 
 herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film 
 throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be 
 developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch) 
 or their actions performed by a completely new character without making 
 a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the 
 subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who 
 is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is 
 the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage' 
 (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill 
 where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit 
 to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of 
 plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could 
 disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was 
 written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job 
 narrative structure enhanced the story.
 
 The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at 
 times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to 
 mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames) 
 uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The 
 only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the 
 ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a 
 flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue 
 which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is 
 unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots 
 talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers, 
 milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some 
 coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but 
 mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with 
 such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking 
 about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring 
 brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no 
 substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they 
 all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the 
 ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance. 
 The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to 
 justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant 
 to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which 
 consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no 
 actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with 
 any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care 
 even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless 
 monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the 
 briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it 
 beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character 
 that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it, 
 combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it. 
 Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion 
 because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some 
 have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings 
 that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has 
 somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As 
 a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself 
 but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the 
 exception.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best film I've ever seen,"Pulp Fiction has a little bit of everything in it. There's brilliant action scenes with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson. There's romance with Bruce Willis and his significant other. There's crime in the opening and closing scenes with Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer. John Travulta and Samuel L Jackson are hilarious throughout the flick. On top of all this, the way the four stories intertwine in conclusion create a wonderfully thought out and executed film that I could just watch over and over again. I wish there was more movies like this. Perfect cast, perfect acting, brilliant dialogue, interesting story line. This is the movie that all other movies should be judged off of.

This was Tarantino's break out flick, and as much as I love reservoir dogs I'm happy that it is. I'm let's face it, this is still his best movie. I can gush about the performances, specifically Jackson because my god is he great in this. I just wanted to mention Travolta, who disappeared after the Grease and then was crapped on after 'B:E' and 'Gotti'. He's not exactly my cup of tea but even I can admit he is great in this

Perfectly made in every way,"PULP FICTION has a reputation of being one of the best movies of all time. It's #8 on IMDB's top 250, it has a score of 8,9 and it has tons of positive reviews. After seeing it nearly a month ago I told myself ''I was right!''The acting is excellent by everyone. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the highlights in the cast and this movie helped their careers a lot. Bruce Willis gives one of his most memorable performances ever as a former boxer that ends to go out of town with his girlfriend after saving his former boss (Ving Rhames) in a holdup. Uma Thurman shines as the boss' wife and in supporting roles Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Tim Roth are very good and entertaining to watch. Quentin Tarantino's direction is top-notch and the cinematography is slick and stylish. The soundtrack is great and memorable.

There's some gimpy sh#t going on here.,"I never thought it'd happen. I've seen a lot of movies. I've given a lot of high ratings. I've never before seen fit to give a movie a ten, though. But I could find not a single thing wrong with this movie.I avoided Quentin Tarantino's movies ever since I saw my first one, which was Kill Bill. I thought it was appalling - the storyline has been done before, the violence was over the top, the gore was stupid, the acting was shocking, and we won't even go into my dislike for Uma Thurman here. I was persuaded to watch both this movie and Reservoir Dogs by my best mate, and after much reluctance I finally acquiesced. And thank all the Gods I did.This manages to be one of the most violent, brutal movies ever produced. However, in a complete paradox to the statement I just made, there is next to no violence in the movie - it runs, much like Reservoir Dogs (but not to the same extent) off the witty and intelligent dialogue, and the incredible acting displayed by everyone involved. And yes, this includes Uma Thurman, despite my hatred for her - I regard her as a terrible actress, whatever beauty she may hold (and let's face it, there ain't much) and I refuse to watch most movies she stars in. She played a small role in this movie, and for once she actually played it well. I extend a hearty salutation.I must give a hearty thumbs up to John Travolta at this point. His character, Vincent Vega, is easily the best I have ever seen him play. Whilst he is a criminal, a junkie, a torturer and a murder, he manages to be extremely likable and you can't help sometimes but wish you were him.To those people who dislike intelligent movies - I advise you against watching this movie. The film grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go until the entire 114 minutes have expired, but if you're possessed of a lower IQ then by the end you won't have much of an idea of what's gone on.The film is constructed in Tarantino's trademark nonlinear fashion, meaning that if you want to watch this movie you haver to do so in one sitting to understand it. you can't just watch bits and pieces of it, otherwise it will make no sense to you whatsoever.I have regained a previously nonexistent respect for Mr. Tarantino with this film, and I look forward to perusing his works in more detail later on.""Get the Gimp!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A timeless classic,"It's crazy to think how I've never seen Pulp Fiction until a few days ago. It's crazy how it's one of the last Tarantino movies I've seen and the fact that it still holds up is mindblowing.Pulp Fiction is a collection of four stories that interwine which include a boxer, two hitmen, a gangster and his wife and two bandits.The amazing part of Pulp Fiction is how brilliant each scene and each character is. Each scene has iconic written all over it. I thought the film was going to be overly violent but that's not the case. It's just characters talking but it's the dialogues that make it so engaging. Seeing John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages for a couple of minutes make them feel like ordinary people rather than just hitmen. There is a feeling of realism between each character interaction. It's something moves steadily without losing momentum at any given point. Then you have characters that only appear for a short amount of time like Mr. Wolf and they have such a huge and memorable impact on the film. If this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best screenplay, I don't know what is.Another aspect that caught my attention was the excellent soundtrack. It's no surprise for a Tarantino film to have great song choices and placements but there's something about the songs in Pulp Fiction that work so well with each scene they're embedded into. It's absolutely perfect. The film's narrative is very interesting as it goes back and forth with each chapter. Each chapter, by the way, is fantastic. All of them are filled with terrific moments and iconic scenes that makes it difficult to lose interest. If that wasn't enough, the performances will surely win you over. It's great to see John Travolta and Bruce Willis give stellar performances especially after seeing them in the films they're currently doing. Samuel L. Jackson has never been better and the rest of the extraordinary ensemble cast are at the top of their game.I love seeing filmmakers express their love for cinema within each of their films and Tarantino has been consistently doing that, creating memorable movies his entire career. Pulp Fiction will remain his masterpiece for years to come. Now that I think of it, it's no surprise how well Pulp Fiction holds up to this day. After all, it is a timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

When i was in the university i made a study about pulp fiction and this was one of the greatest jobs i did in my whole graduation.

Best Movie Ever!,"Must See!! Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a film-goer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hit-man. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the disappointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I Am Completely Baffled By Some of The Reviews. Just Shows a Lack of Understanding of the Film More Than Anything,"Seriously, what is with all of the one star ratings on this film? What a disgrace. What the people HATED about this movie is exactly what makes it good. So many people complain there is no storyline. Bullshit. If you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. Just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. It's called a ""non parallel plot."" Famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. Quentin Tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) If anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine. It's not that complicated of a concept, but the low intelligence of many viewers may result in complete confusion of what's going on.Flat characters? I really don't even need to get into this one. The characters all had their own distinct personalities AND YES, character development. If Jules' transition from crime in the beginning to wanting to get out of the business in the end isn't character development, then I don't know what is. There is an obvious misconception here of what character development actually is.And too much dialogue? That's Tarantino's style. What's with this sudden rule that a film should always be visually told and not told verbally? Bullshit. Art is something like a free for all. It works here. The dialogue is natural and is witty.I heard one reviewer say Tarantino is self indulgent here because his dialogue represents his thoughts too much. WTF? Just because he has a wordy script style means he's too self indulgent? He's simply writing a script with witty dialogue, there is no ego trip here. This claim is simply and utterly ridiculous. And if you're complaining about him being in his own movies, go ahead and say that Alfred Hitchcock was self indulgent and a bad filmmaker. I am very sure many people here wouldn't dare claim that.Overall, this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. And that isn't because it's a fad film like many others say. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that has completely revolutionized the way film handles dialogue and the editing of a film's story. If people are unable to acknowledge that then they are only limiting their perception of what has made films evolve to what it is today. Films like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey,"" ""Psycho,"" ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" etc., are all films with this kind of status. If you don't enjoy this film, then that is fine. However, to deny the importance or influence this film has graced upon the medium is simply foolish and unenlightened on the part of the viewer.This is simply one of the most entertaining films you will ever see in your life if you can keep up with the pace and the story. It may take a few viewings if you're the kind of person that can't understand this kind of plot, but I guarantee almost every time that if you watch this film over and over and study it like I have and numerous other classics, you will notice all of the big and little things that make this film what it is. It's truly a remarkable film. There may be little symbolism beside's Jules' commentary on the bible and reciting of biblical passages, but this film is more so about the entertainment than symbolic storytelling. There are two different kinds of films in that way, the ones that try to allude to something symbolic or important like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and there are other films that rely on entertaining the viewer like this film and ""Jaws."" I'm sure not many people will call ""Jaws"" a bad film either.Anyway, don't listen to the one star reviewers. They simply didn't understand the film, its story, or its style. This film is a real treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Watched it because of the rating, however didn't quite hit the mark for me","Quick disclaimer, I am 24 and have generally not seen tons of 90's movies. I read somewhere that this film is a landmark of modern cinema and has influenced many other gangster flicks after it. That certainly makes sense, has a unusual plot line(if you can call it that) for it's time, has grotesque violence and obviously not taking itself too seriously.Moreover, no subject matter, to me it felt the scenes were purposely constructed to give off artsy notion and not develop the story. It seemed like ''art made for the sake of making art'' which is pretentious in my eyes, however many people obviously find it riveting.There is this sequence of scenes which is so completely out of left field that will most likely make you feel emotionally disturbed (don't want to spoil it). Again, it is completely random, however made me chuckle. You can't help but admire Tarantino's audacity to put the most shocking things in front of the eyes of millions. Did not like him as an actor though, the incoherent digressions were a bit too much at a certain point.If you are expecting something meaningful, skip this one. It definetely leaves you with sense of emptiness when over. The thought ""What on earth did I just watch'' was swirling in my head for some time after.

The most embarrassing thing about this movie is after watching it you will think who is the fool yourself or the writer and directer.Yes this movie is different but not always Difference make something great at least in motion pictures at least.Whatever this is a must see movie for all because you can differentiate the better movies after watching it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino's Magnum Opus Is Cinematic History In The Making,"Every once in a while, a film comes along that changes everything. Whenever the industry went out of ideas & employed the same formula for too long, there always emerged a new wave of films that injected new life into this medium and in the process ended up changing the way we are accustomed to watching & perceiving motion pictures. And Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, one of those movies.Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes & Best Screenplay at Oscars, Pulp Fiction was a force to be reckoned with at its time of release for it opened many realms that were previously thought to be non-existent and in the long run, didn't just influence cinema but other media as well. Everything about it was different from the norm and it remains one of the most original & groundbreaking stories to ever unfold on the silver screen.Pulp Fiction intertwines three different story lines into one and is told in a nonlinear fashion. The first follows two hit men who are out to retrieve a mysterious suitcase which belongs to their boss. The second is about one of those two hit men who's put in charge of taking care of the boss' wife while he's out of town. And third concerns an aging but proud boxer who is asked to drop a fight in exchange for a handsome reward. The lives of these odd people collide in unexpected ways, resulting in some hilarious situations.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, his sophomore effort is even better than his debut feature which was a milestone in itself. Tarantino has injected the script with extensive pop culture references, a vast line-up of idiosyncratic characters & explosive dialogues plus the way this whole story is narrated and its wicked fusion of violence & humour turns it into an endlessly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly refreshing ride that's in a league of its own.What's also amazing is the fact that most of the conversations taking place in the movie is not even related to the plot and is simply a casual discussion on a randomly chosen topic. And yet, without these wisecracking moments, Pulp Fiction wouldn't really be Pulp Fiction. The amount of focus that went into the smallest of details during the writing process is this film's biggest strength and when it comes to pure screenplay wizardry, Pulp Fiction has no equals & probably never will.The technical aspects are no slouch for the picture exhibits a number of new tricks when it comes to bringing the script to life on the film canvas. Cinematography presents Tarantino adding a few more photography techniques to his sleeve that would later become his own trademarks. Editing intentionally rearranges the order in which the events unfold and keeps the viewers on their toes at all times. And the soundtrack is a compilation of rock n roll, pop & surf music that are cleverly chosen and surprisingly fit the accompanying sequences.Two key elements that are highly contrasting in general but, in Tarantino's films, fit together as if co-dependent on each other is violence & humour. He's a rare artist who is capable of making us laugh uncontrollably at a scene that involves a person's head getting blown-off. Now there is substantial amount of violence in this picture but those violent sequences are also its funniest moments and the reason why it works so well is coz the addition of hilarity to such brutality significantly neutralizes the effect gore & violence alone may have had on the audience.Coming to the acting department, Pulp Fiction features a star-studded cast in John Travolta ,Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, & many more, and is notable for launching & revitalising the careers of many. Travolta resurrects himself with a smashing performance in the role of Vincent Vega. Jackson not delivers his career-best work but ends up reincarnating himself for this is the movie that made Samuel L. Jackson what Samuel L. Jackson is today and he will forever be indebted to Tarantino for this.Both Travolta & Jackson play the two hit men and their chemistry just clicks. Thurman plays Mia Wallace and is absolutely electrifying in her given role. Marsellus Wallace is a character whose presence looms over the entire story even during his absence & Ving Rhames didn't disappoint in portraying him. Willis adds another feather to his acting range and does nicely in balancing the toughness of his boxer character with a soft spot for his wife. Keitel steals every moment he is in. Roth & Plummer also have their moments to shine, and each one of them succeeds in bringing these scripted characters to life in just the right dose.On an overall scale, with its surprisingly powerful combination of unconventional structure, stylish direction, remarkable screenplay, stellar performances, energetic pace, mesmerising soundtrack and Tarantino's patented mix of violence & humour, Pulp Fiction succeeds as a delicious piece of pop culture that thrills & amuses in a highly unusual manner and is rightly counted amongst the greatest movies ever made. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, an unsurpassed milestone in independent filmmaking, and a landmark moment in cinema history that permanently engraved Tarantino's name in the annals of filmmaking, Pulp Fiction is essential viewing in every sense of the word.

From my perspective, the only thing that I see in the film that I would consider an original idea about this film is the manner in which the story was presented (ie the sequence of events being presented as they were.)  However, if you really want to see a great and unique approach at story-telling, watch Memento!What it all boils down to is that I don't believe that Quentin Tarintino is any better a director than Britney Spears is an actress; but that's just my opinion!I Rate - * 1/2",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Ultimate Movie,"This film has everthing, in perfect balances - drama, humor, violence, wisdom, love; it has wonderful dialog and interesting characters. I can play this DVD 24 hours a day, the episodic nature of the movie is such that you can watch part of it one day then watch other parts at other times without feeling you missed key plot points.I wish every writer and director took the effort to carefully sculpt and craft every aspect of a movie like Tarantino does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Magnificent,"For those who appreciate great films, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a must see. The movie is Tarantino's 2nd work after having great success with his gangster story of ""Reservoir Dogs"". There are many unique aspects of Pulp Fiction that make it so good. As many of you know, Tarantino's use of dialogue that he gives the characters in his films is excellent, humorous, and intelligent. Pulp Fiction is by far his best in this aspect. From conversations talking about foot massages to talking about filthy animals; PF has the best dialogue of any movie I have ever seen. The movie is shuffled in a way that it tells the story out of sequence, once again a redundant aspect in most Tarantino films. This influenced many different mob films, but no other movie will ever be as great as Pulp Fiction. Film making at its finest.$$$",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A perfect Ten from the beginning and back there again,The most amazing film from seeing it the first time in the mid 90s today has lost none of its magic from the opening scene with shades of reservoir dogs start in the restaurants. The simple setting with immediate addictive dialogue hooks you from the beginning. It is long before the film takes off to a new never before level of movie making the visual brilliance of the scenes and stories The intertwining of the different tales into each other the choice of order and the eventuality of being let back to the beginning makes this for me one of the all-time greatest films and from the very first viewing knowing this is going to be one of the worlds greatest directors. so many amazing performances career defining roles for stars at the top of there games actors aided by an amazing script. which still to this day is timeless like Reservoir dogs before it how to tell when it was supposed to be set what year? which just helps to make the film still perfect 30 years later. Stories could've just as easily be made into three four five maybe even six movies instead what you have is it beautifully mix intertwining timeless tales told by a master who's love of cinema is all over this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
And you will know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!,"I could probably write a ten paged paper on this movie alone. I had seen other films by Tarantino before watching this one many years ago we will say 10 years ago when I was a teenager. And people here and there would mention the title pulp fiction to me and not sure why I just didn't bother to watch it till it was free on demand with comcast and was finally left in awe pondering the meaning of life for probably 30 minutes afterwards with the tv turned off. The dialogue is what sells this film along with the acting. And there are those that claim it is ultra violent and while there's some moments it's nothing like some of his others. The acting is amazing and I realized I wasn't watching a movie it's truly just an experience. This is the type of movie where you don't pop it on with a group of friends or a loved one just hanging out, it's meant to be observed, listened to, digested. There's no way to describe the plot or put it in a genre. It exists on its own. This was the movie that made me realize how important and impactful dialogue can truly be. A film doesn't need to be flashy, have crazy special effects, action every 2 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of my favorite movies,"The 90's was one of the best decades for movies, rivalling the 70's as my favorite. And this movie is perhaps the quintessential 90s movie. The mood, the actors, the comeback of Travolta, the coolnes of Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and of course, Samuel L. Jackson. It's just one of these movies you can watch over and over and over again. Everytime it came on when I was flipping through channels, when that was a thing, I ended up watching it till the end from that point. Every scene is a delight. And the music, man, the music is perfect to a tee!Maybe the best Tarantinofilm, and that is saying a lot. And the movie that really put him on the map, after the low budget ""Reservoir Dog"" made him a young director to watch. And watch him we have. Set the tone for what was the 90s movies. He copied and lend so much from other films, and so many films tried to copy him, but there is nust one Tarantino. And only one ""Pulp Fiction"". It's just perfect!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Most Overrated Movie Of All Time,"I watched this back in the day and thought it was overrated then. Weirdly shot cinematography and random scenes with random dialogue.

And every few seconds of the badly written dialogue is bad language to prove how ""real"" these characters are.I tried to watch again to think maybe I missed something the first time around. Maybe Travolta can all of a sudden act and maybe Samuel L. Jackson won't just yell his dialogue. And maybe just maybe there will be resolution of what is in the briefcase. Instead of the satisfying Seven resolution, it still does not resolve. The movie looks VERY dated. It is still random. It looks like a movie shot for under $10 million.

"Even today, Tarantino's Masterpiece is an Exceptional Crime Thriller","Pulp Fiction was released back in 1994, and now, nearly twenty years later (as of 2013), Tarantino's first real masterpiece can still be compared to some of the crime movies of today. Critically acclaimed across the world, we are presented with four interweaving stories about mob hit-men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a couple looking to rob a diner, and it deserves it's acclaim.Quentin Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, was a word of mouth success. Little was known about this raw, raunchy crime thriller from an unknown writer/director, but it became a cult classic quickly. Therefore, his follow-up film needed to be good, and he delivers.Anyway, on to Pulp Fiction. The Academy Award-Winning film contains four interweaving stories. They are gritty and foul-mouthed, but truly spectacular. Only few times have writer/directors been able to pull off such astounding films. Without dipping into spoilers, I can safely say that Pulp Fiction is like a dive of a cliff for first-time Tarantino viewers. You think it's risky attempting it, but when you do, you're hooked. It's this film that truly made Tarantino who he is today, and it's this film that can still stand the test of time, one of the rare few.Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece I can't wait to watch again. A truly spectacular film on all levels. A beautiful crime drama that accurately dips you into the crime world in ways we've never been dipped before, and I can't wait to get dipped again.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This time It was a totally different experience, it was like it all came together. I have loved the movie ever since, and I must have seen over 10 times now. The acting is sublime. The story is awesome. The dialog is captivating. This movie sat Quentin Tarantino's name stone as one of, if not the best director of all times.

Pure genius!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. My favorite parts are the characters of Sam Jackson and John Travolta Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega. Quentin Tarantino did a fantastic job. Other movies have tried to compare but none will. My good friend out in Los Angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of Jules and Vincent driving around town and having a discussion about Vincent's recent travels abroad. And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that it's the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the ""gold watch"" speech to Harvey Keitel's dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. He combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It might not be the absolute greatest film, the film that snobs bawl all over. But it may be the most entertaining.It isn't pretentious. It just is.

What Is Crazy Anyway?,"There isn't a single normal person in Pulp Fiction. Not a one. And that is what makes the film so memorable. There a ton of things going on, including a bizarre couple robbing a diner, a couple of hit men avenging a rip off of a mobster boss, a boxer who is supposed to take a dive but doesn't, and a mobster's wife being entertained by one of the hit men.I admit it. I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time a couple of nights ago. Why it took me 17 years to see this very special movie is known only to God. To think I could have spent all these years seeing this movie countless times, like I do The Godfather, Casino, GoodFellas, and Love Actually is a bit disappointing. But at least I've seen it now, and now I understand what all the fuss has been all these years.John Travolta made his comeback with his performance as one of the loopy hit men, and deservedly so. He is off kilter enough to be interesting but not so extreme as to be insane. He just kills in his worldly sort of way. Samuel L. Jackson, a killer who obsesses about sin and absolution, is his partner. Uma Thurman is the mobster's wife who Travolta's character is supposed to entertain. Take a look at Steve Buscemi as their waiter.Directed brilliantly by Quentin Tarantino, all of the performances are memorable. The list of stars who shine in this movie are as endless as the subplots that they play in; Ms. Thurman, Messers Travolta and Jackson, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, and Harvey Keitel. Keitel's ability to play twisted in such a straight sort of way is astonishing.The dialog in this film is classic, as I was warned it would be. I was enthralled with the well crafted dialog that comes out of the actors so seemingly effortlessly, and with such entertaining effect.Everyone who sees this film will interpret its meaning differently, especially the ending. As for me, I will never use the bathroom when I am supposed to be knocking off a double crossing boxer.And remember, ""Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
worst movie ever,"After 4 years, I still consider this the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have yet to watch any thing else with QT's name attached to it. Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I was terribly confused as to what transpired the first time I saw it, but then after a few more viewings I began to realize the genius in this film isn't that Tarantino makes the viewer understand the film, he makes the viewer love it. From the ""Big brain on Brad"" scene until the ""Bad Mother F--ker"" scene, this movie aims to please. In that sense it is probably the anti-classic, but since we already have a surplus of sex, drugs, and violence in film and on television why not just roll them all into one, multiply by one hundred, and make a movie out of it.Unfortunately this will probably be Tarantino's last great film judging from the pathetic aftershock which turned out to be Jackie Brown.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great,"Pulp Fiction"" is an iconic film from director Quentin Tarantino that has left a lasting impression on the film industry and audiences alike. The nonlinear storyline, sharp dialogue, and unforgettable characters all contribute to its well-deserved status as a modern classic.The film tells the story of multiple interconnected characters, from hitmen Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L.

The plot weaves together a series of seemingly unrelated events that eventually come together in a satisfying and unpredictable way.One of the strengths of ""Pulp Fiction"" is its memorable dialogue, which is witty, clever, and often shocking. The film's non-linear structure also adds to its appeal, as it keeps the audience engaged and guessing as to how the various storylines will intersect.Overall, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a must-see film that has rightfully earned its place in cinematic history.

Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction, arguably the most iconic movie from culturally iconic filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, is an exhilarating ride that combines comedy, drama, violence, and a nonlinear narrative. Featuring some of Hollywood's most remarkable talents, like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, this film delights with its dark humor and edgy cinematography.Pulp Fiction follows several intertwined stories involving a mid-level hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who takes orders from his mafia boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Accompanying him is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), his colleague and comic relief who brings wisecracks and quotable lines to every scene. They are tasked with recovering a briefcase of mysterious contents stolen by two small-time crooks working for Marcellus Wallace- Honey Bear (Quentin Tarantino) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). We soon learn that the case holds tremendous importance as it contains items that could potentially destroy Marcellus Wallace's reputation if they fall into the wrong hands.Further complications arise when Vincent Vega takes Marcellus Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for an evening adventure at Jack Rabbit Slims diner, where they compete in a twisting competition before she overdoses from drugs prompting Stoltz's memorable line, ""She was brought here by YOU; thus YOU inserted the needle!"" Meanwhile, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is another criminal who must take a risky detour back to his apartment with Maria de Medeiros as his innocent girlfriend to retrieve an important family heirloom-a wristwatch passed down through generations-and Christopher Walken as the grizzled war hero ready to exact revenge on Butch should he fail to comply with his demands.Tarantino has crafted a masterful script richly detailed in dialogue that captures humor and drama more powerfully than any other writer/director today. His collaboration with Roger Avary has yielded one of the most memorable scripts in recent memory, filled with characters that simultaneously evoke laughter, sorrow, and empathy unlike anything else. It often feels like Tarantino himself inhabits these characters throughout their various plot points as he explores themes of morality in crime fiction while simultaneously poking fun at them.Pulp Fiction features dazzlingly kinetic cinematography from frequent collaborators Robert Richardson and Andrzej Sekula, which exquisitely captures both the frenetic energy of an urban underworld filled with criminals but also creates moments of interiority amongst its inhabitants which allows us to see them not just as criminals but human beings too whose lives we can understand even if we don't condone their actions or lifestyles. This combination of frenetic visuals coupled with heartfelt emotion makes for one electrifying experience that sticks long after you've watched it.What makes Pulp Fiction so special is how Quentin Tarantino manages to slyly explore moral grey areas without becoming preachy or sacrificing entertainment value either; it exists somewhere between spectacle and philosophy while giving its viewers room to come up with conclusions on their own terms while still asking more critical questions about life itself, especially when it comes to morality in crime. The casting is also top-notch, featuring some of Hollywood's best, from Travolta and Jackson to Willis & Thurman, all delivering career-best performances that reverberate years after its original release date making this one movie worth watching again & again! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Ploddingly slow too often in an attempt to be arty and edgy, it just exposes the poor writing that the shifted timelines can't save. No investment in characters, or plot.

An Amazing New World,"What ""Pulp Fiction"" does is not give you the normal, rinky-dink, Point-A to Point-B, generic movie. The film isn't about plot progression. What Tarantino does, in essence, is create an entire world. This is a vast, interwoven, interacting, multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid, solid characters. What this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character, but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world, into another life, and accept this ""morally ambiguous"" modern-day epic. Truly, there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer. And, lastly, on a personal level, while I do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history, it is personally my favorite film, and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry. So obviously, it must have something going for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"With a rare authorship and an easily identifiable style, Tarantino, already at the beginning of his career, consolidated himself as one of the main creative minds of his time","Set in Los Angeles, the story brings a series of events where violence and the criminal underworld go hand in hand. Among the main stories told, we have gangsters Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and his partner Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and mob boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). All the characters are somehow related. However, this is just a preface to the unbelievable plot that Tarantino develops.Once again, the filmmaker remakes, in his image, the referred resource of non-linear montage, something he had already outlined in his first film, but which, here, is part of the structural foundations of the narrative progression. We see some great unquestionable classics like ""Citizen Kane"", ""Rashomon"" and ""Annie Hall"" who have ventured down this path, with undeniable success, but with a very personal style of the director, but which was only really possible thanks, again, to the impeccable work of his late longtime partner Sally Menke in the editing room.See, for example, the time jump that Tarantino makes in the middle of the film, when we see little Butch (as an adult, the character played by Bruce Willis) receiving a visit from Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who had lived with his father when the two were prisoners of war. This whole scene, which tells a story only with a long monologue by Koons in a unique long shot, which does not deviate from the character, aims to demonstrate to us the importance of Butch's father's watch. This happens right in the middle of the interrupted narrative that Tarantino imposes on us, but when the flashback happens, we accept it naturally, without being surprised or without even for a moment failing to understand what is happening. Today, we might find this obvious and unimaginative, but try to transport yourself to 1994, when Tarantino released Pulp Fiction at Cannes almost as an experimental work and received a standing ovation for long minutes, walking away with the Palme d'Or.The dialogue, in principle, is detached from the action: the henchmen discuss snacks and foot massages, this on the verge of forcibly collecting a debt. However, exactly in this opposition - followed by attraction - between speech and event, lies one of the greatest assets of ""Pulp Fiction"". The somewhat nonsensical staging of Tarantino, a filmmaker accustomed to mixing genres, giving them a pop look and giving the pastiche a paradoxical originality, embraces almost to perfection both the types given to verbiage before and after killing, and the subtexts that are not rancid and seasoned with irony.Who can forget the twist danced by Travolta and Uma Thurman, she, the wife of the mafia boss, that is, who he can't think of touching for fear of jealous reprisals? And what about the injection of adrenaline whose effect is to ""resurrect"" the same woman, rescuing her from the land of the dead by overdose? ""Pulp Fiction"" advances out of chronological order, packaged by, perhaps, the most expressive and functional soundtrack of Tarantino's career, composed of hits such as: You Never Can Tell, Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon, Son Of A Preacher Man, among others. In the scene in which Butch (Bruce Willis) listens to the plan to deliver a certain fight, for example, Let's Stay Together, a well-known romantic song, plays, here serving as a sonorous and, therefore, dramatic counterpoint to the dismayed face of the impotent boxer in the face of the cruelty of the world and his own weakness.Each of the narrative lines that populate this film in episodes of Tarantino is riddled with dialogues that function as an expansion of what we saw in his first work. While his first film had dialogues that were limited to the same circle of people composed of gangsters or bank robbers of Caucasian origin, in Pulp Fiction we see a profusion of different characters in a duo dynamic (or almost): the couple of amateur robbers who opens and closes the film (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer); assassin duo Vincent Vega (John Travolta, revived by Tarantino) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) on a mission; crime boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and boxer in the twilight of his career Butch (Willis) encountering rapists Zed (Peter Greene) and Maynard (Duane Whitaker); Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) dealing with a heroin overdose and drug dealer Lance (Eric Stoltz) and his wife Jody (Rosanna Arquette) and Vincent, Jules, Jimmie (Tarantino himself) and the ""resolver"" of problems"" Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel) dealing with a nasty situation involving blood and brains splattered in a car. Tight or semi-tight stories sewn together by a single theme in a film that tells them out of order, but brilliantly connects them.Each dialogue is carefully tailored to work with your character and the respective interaction with the other character. There's a bit of everything, in addition to Tarantino's incredible ability to insert pop culture mentions at every turn. The phrases about the small differences between Europe and the United States, about the ""medieval acts"" of Marsellus over Zed, about the quotation from the Bible that Jules uses before killing and several others are, if you like, as empty of content as they are full of meaning. Of rhythm; or as full of social criticism as we choose to imagine, but not forgetting that many of them are taken - some word for word - from previous works in yet another demonstration of Tarantino's ability to remix what already exists and transform it into something of his own. The result is entry of all of them and more into the general culture of moviegoers (who often don't even know they are quotes of quotes) and casual viewers alike. And all this married with a surgical choice of songs for each moment, each situation, in an anthological soundtrack, perhaps the best of its kind, in yet another amazing demonstration of musical curation by Tarantino.In ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino inserts quotes, dialogues and situations that bring direct relationships or allude to elements, mainly, of pop culture. Among the director's influences are Western films, as well as other noir films, such as ""Band à Part (1964)"", by Jean Luc Godard. This, in this case, inspired the dance of Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Other movie references are displayed when Butch chooses a weapon to return to the basement. The hammer is related to ""The Toolbox Murders (1978)"", the baseball bat in the best style of ""Walking Tall (1973)"" and ""The Untouchables (1987)"", the chainsaw to ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)"" and ""The Evil Dead II"" and, finally, the sword, the chosen weapon, makes analogy to several samurai films. In addition, the mixture of long dialogues with explicit violence makes the plot even more interesting, as well as the suspense created around the stories, which are gradually revealed. Still, some elements are fraught with uncertainty. This is the case with the suitcase of the mobster Marcellus. After all, what was in that briefcase? This is really a mystery, Tarantino himself said that its content is not of great importance, what matters is to whet the public's curiosity and give continuity to the plot. This type of resource is used in some audiovisual productions and is known as ""MacGuffin"", a term created by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock.The more we unravel the timelines of the film, the more attached to the narrative we become. In this context, we observe the cycle between past and present, like the story of Butch and Captain Koons. Here, we follow Butch's troubled origins and draw a ""justification"" for his actions - not that this cancels out the character's responsibility, nor does it romanticize him. The question is, first of all, to understand the causes and consequences of the acts of the represented types, through acidic dialogues and remarkable flashbacks. After all, the construction of the figures is so careful that it is difficult to fully demonize or humanize the characters.In direction, Tarantino focuses excessively on the expressions of the figures that make up his work, turning the minimum into maximum detail. The actors' body language, for example, is extremely valued here, through frames that facilitate the connection with the audience. ""Pulp Fiction"" offers a true festival of unforgettable scenes. Perhaps most remembered is Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace's dance, but there's also Jules' speech before killing his targets, the talk of uncomfortable silences, the controversy over how sexual a foot massage is, and much more. The filmmaker uses and abuses symbols that strengthen his objective and, essentially, the development of the narrative, through an obscure, tense and challenging scenario. About the performances, it is valid to point out the incredible harmony between the cast. Interpreters of Mia and Vincent, and exhaling overwhelming chemistry, Uma Thurman - Oscar nominated for supporting role - and John Travolta steal the scene and masterfully defend their characters, raising the level of both to another level.Not behind his colleagues on the scene, Samuel L. Jackson - also nominated for an Oscar - stands out brilliantly with his Jules and turns him into the best performance in the film, being valued as he deserves. A golden trio.With a rare authorship and an easily identifiable style, Tarantino, already at the beginning of his career, consolidated himself as one of the main creative minds of his time and, although he was not the precursor of the tools he uses, the familiarity with which he travels through the various possibilities that the audiovisual offers make clear the reason for its outstanding position among peers. Remembering 'Pulp Fiction' as his best work is far from being a consensus, but it was a watershed for a successful trajectory and a milestone in the history of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the best written-films I have ever seen,"Tarantino (and Avary) put these stories together and created Pulp Fiction, which is the movie that shocked the world in 1994. It is hilarious, and brilliant writing. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson deliver two hilarious performances. The soundtrack is killer, and the directing is slick. It is a very quotable movie, and very memorable. The only ""criticism"" is that like all Tarantino movies, it goes on for a little too long, so it does get a little muddled in the middle. Overall, this movie is a blast.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Great Movie Experience!,"Pulp Fiction is a terrific movie! It has all the characteristics of a perfect movie: engaging plot, memorable characters, excellent writing and directing, and awesome music! Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best film-makers of all time. I love all of his movies and I never get tired of watching any of them! Pulp Fiction is just another example of how awesome Tarantino is as a film-maker.Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that requires a second viewing or more to truly understand it and enjoy it more. Not only does it get better with each viewing but it also becomes easier to understand as you notice how Tarantino focuses on the small details of the film and how the small details relate to the main plot. For example: the connection between Marsellus Wallace's Band-Aid on his neck and the suitcase.There is a fan theory that says that Marsellus sold his soul to the devil and his soul is inside the suitcase. The fan theory states that in order the extract a soul, it has to come from the back of the neck thus explaining the Band-Aid on Wallace's neck. Tarantino has not come out and proved that theory true or not. Personally, I think Tarantino ultimately led the guessing to the fans as they come up with possible outcomes. The acting and dialogue is over the top and straight forward and I couldn't have possibly thought of a better cast to play the characters.When the film was nominated for all of those Academy Awards in '94, there was very tough competition since other films like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption were also nominated. But I won't complain since those 2 movies are really good too. However, I believe Pulp Fiction deserved the Oscar for Best Original Script and I'm really glad it won! In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece that will forever be a highly significant film even after all these years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tarantino's Magnum Opus,"As years pass and I get older, when speaking to people many years my younger and inevitably getting to the topic of movies and film, this is always the first one I enquire if they have watched, and also inevitably demand it is the next thing they watch.It remains possibly the most entertaining script to cross genres, I don't feel you can really pigeon-hole this to a genre, it has a bit of everything. It's one of a select few films you wish you could watch again for the first time, but watching it for a second, third, eighth, tenth time... it still feels fresh and still makes you laugh.The casting is just spot on, and the performances across the board are so memorable, even the bit-parts. I have watched this so many times I could probably recite the entire dialogue with a high degree of accuracy. As many a good film I have seen I would be hard pressed to state a better script, I can't think of many, if any lines of dialogue that don't need to be there. That is an outstanding achievement.
On top of this there's also the awesome soundtrack, when I first saw this I can't say I had heard any of the tracks before, subsequently it was one of the first soundtracks I bought the CD. As with Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's choice of music was incredibly effective for the vibe of the film.There is some violence but it is not gratuitous and adds to the story.

"""Royale with cheese""","Cinema is not like rock and roll, but once or twice in a generation someone will come along and try to reinvent cool for the screen. In our generation, just such a personage is Quentin Tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. Pulp Fiction is arguably his signature movie.It has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. As with Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. There are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as Uma Thurman saying ""five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us"". One of the best things about the Pulp Fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. There is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as Lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were.Tarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. In an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, Pulp Fiction features some refreshingly long takes. It's a very minimalist style – he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. During the Kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of Samuel L. Jackson and the mid-shot of Brad with Jackson and Travolta before and behind him. Some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. This puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. That's not to say backgrounds never matter. Once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of Operation in Lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two.The reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. And as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. Uma Thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive John Travolta. Michael Madsen was the original choice for the role, but Travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. Finest of all though is surely Samuel L. Jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. Jackson is to Tarantino what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them.My only problem with Pulp Fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. There are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when Thurman's ""square"" is literally drawn on the screen. But by-and-large Pulp Fiction is a work of much filmmaking genius, and it's hardly surprising that creativity as vibrant as this will come bubbling through the seams here and there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I'm not the general consensus,"For me, Pulp Fiction is a good movie. It's just not as good as so many say it is. When I took film classes in college, everyone wanted to be the next Quinton Tarantino. I actually thought Pulp Fiction had some brilliant scenes, but also some rather dull and boring scenes that were a struggle to get through. I've seen the movie now four or five times over the last twenty years to see if my opinion changes. It doesn't. In my opinion, it's a very overrated movie. It doesn't mean it's not a good movie. It's a must for any film buff, but the hype is a little over done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pulp Trash,"I have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed, overly and unnecessarily violent, and just plain difficult to understand. I, for one, fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of John Travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable. Focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences, Tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence, drug addiction, rape, and other assorted seedy topics. The plot (if you want to call it that) is non-existent and the scene involving Ving Rhaimes is just flat-out disgusting. For Tarrantino fans, this may be the ultimate. But for me, it's just not a good film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.""","""Pulp Fiction"" is an absolute cult. This was his second vision for me, because the first one had disappointed me I decided to review it more carefully. This time I noticed what everyone calls a masterpiece. Tarantino with this film messes up the lives of several protagonists, then bringing them together with different hilarious and very unusual events. The characters are great: I loved the couple Vincent-Jules, one opposite of the other who fight throughout the film showing their ruthlessness as a killer. Among these, the intense and perfect performances of Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth and the entire cast are to be praised. Thanks to these great actors came out in part this film, they gave great intensity. The direction of Tarantino is perfect, with unusual shots, for example not framing the subject who currently speaks but the subject who is listening with a different and hidden view of the speaker. Also many interesting shots with close-ups in motion or many other really incredible details. Tarantino has also done a spectacular job in the writing of dialogues, with unforgettable moments. The film also has some of the most iconic scenes in cinema history, such as the dance scene between Vincent and Mia. The soundtracks are truly spectacular, with music from the 60s' that perfectly match the randomness and beauty of the stories. The costumes are fabulous and perfectly matched with the characteristics of the characters and especially with the context that offers the film and the fabulous setting. The ending is truly breathtaking. In summary, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that does not follow a chronological order but manages to alternate perfectly all the events, some moments of which are hard and raw, while others strange and unusual, with even a handful of laughs. The film is centred on interpretations, relationships between the characters and monologues, with unforgettable quotes..

Yes he died, yes he left the job but then what ? After that what happened ? We don't know that. The only thing that i don't like about Tarantino movies is that.

Nothing in pop culture comes close to replecacting the quintessential brilliance of the tight script wonderfully acted film that just flows so well. Q.Ts most powerful directoring achievement is his second film. Not only does it launch stars but it gives life to failing stars revetlising failing acters and giving them a shot of life who would go on to command bigger salaries in bigger budget movies.
Unlike Quentin's latter movies that have much more bigger budgets and bloated runtimes the modest budget used on pulp fiction helps the director to sculpt a script and runtime to perfection within the limited budget.

Masterpiece,"Black comedy told through the framework of the omnibus, ""Pulp Fiction"" is without any doubt one of the best and most important films of all time, a masterpiece that has its aesthetics, juicy dialogue and unpredictable acting division greatly influenced by the explosion of the so-called indie cinema in the mid-nineties. we have four weakly related stories in a linear jumps.

The hilarious misadventures in the life of a pair of murderers!,"Describe Pulp Fiction in one word: impossible. Because it's impossible to describe it one word, so I'll use many: a complex, interwoven modern day fable with characters as colorful as an Alice in Wonderland rendition. This film, on the surface, appears to merely be an exploitation flick, mindless in its execution and gratuitous in its violence. On the contrary! The violence, while shocking, serves the purpose of jolting us out of our everyday life - it speaks to us, and ABOUT us, in ways that your average Hollywood popcorn movie can. We get to see the humour in murder. Injected with black as night humour, it tells the tale of a group of criminals ""behind-the-scenes."" We see their everyday conversations, fueled by intellect, wit, and poetry, debunking the stereotype that murderers are devoid of any real intelligence. Pulp Fiction is a film for the ages.In all honesty, I gave this film a low score because it's ridiculously overrated. Personally, I can't stand hearing QT's pretentious dialogue and the ""look-how-cool-I-am"" style really grates on my nerves. It's pretty popular to like this movie, so maybe I just have to hate everything popular, but that's obviously not the case, so...I don't know what it is.

Not a very good movie,"I never really like when a movie gets labeled a ""defining chapter"" of movie making or gets named a classic just cause it's different. Sometimes it is sometimes it's not. Clockwork orange is one of those which i felt was garbage as a movie. Pulp fiction is another. Sure, it has speed, weird characters and slick lines and stories all over the place. For me weird isn't always good as there is no red line, no real story to follow. I don't even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth a watch just cause it's like no other movie. But the story, the substance of the movie is very thin. Tarantino is for me not a very good director. Sure, some of his movies are OK, but mostly he overdo it on many occasions, which makes it hard to takes them seriously. It's no real drama, no action, no thriller, just something put in a blender it seems.

"Hard to say anything bad about a movie made by simply the coolest cat in h-wood, just ask anyone whos gotten backstage with the dude, he's so chill... well, nuff bout Quentin.","Like I started, no flaws at all here, it's basically a masterpiece as with most of Quentins movies, of course all reviews are subjective to what the viewer thinks of the movie, of what he's seeing and here, well, I mean, take the watch scene for example, bringing out such things from a man like (well, we share a name at least) Christopher Walken, one of hollywoods alltime greatest plus one of the alltime greatest when it comes to people wanting to imitate his voice :) either way, I can't find a flaw within this oyster, it's a perfect pearl that deserves (imho) a higher up position, or at least not to be surpassed by people who never even managed to watch through it, its almost like with Stephen King's books that they filmatized, like IT or the stand, ran too long, so had to turn it into a 'tv' mini-series, thus dropping ratings a ton, cause it didnt air, however, nowadays, people who watch movies should be able to stumble on masterpieces like those, yet... do we ratings go up, no? No, they go down on certain movies and up on others, as in, more cgi and oddities... and less acting, sure, I aint saying that CGI does alot, but if you take the Christian Bale Terminator one, that was spoiled, however, the upncomers, be it in a different timeline etcetera... and sadly, actors do grow old, yup, however, Arnold as old, that was a stinger splash right there, hit the sweet spot, same goes for movies like Pitch Black series or the Jeepers Creepers ones.... Horror usually never finds its way into peoples heart, yet I saw one today that totally blew me away, can only hope that Quentin brings this man fourth into the light. (obviously talking about who directed it, etcetera) Since its kinda like the 'lighthouse' which is just insanely good also for being a suspensful, strange, surreal movie... just odd that Daniel Day Lews isnt in it, but then again, considering that Willem DaFoe did such a job, doubt they would've needed DDL. Not saying I'm not a fan, I am, same with this fine and very humour driven actor named Christoph Walz(t?) who's by far blown me and my fellow movie lovers away with his performances and from what i've gathered, using research and such, quentin was the man who found another nugget, heck, he could probably make anyone shine, just cause he's that darn good, plus i love that he loves old school cinema too, them robert rodriguez flicks he made, grindhouse, death proof etcetera, just shows how much he's evolving from golden oldies like this, insanely great movies.... and just cause its from 1994, dont let it fool ya, it will leave any youngun who thinks a movie has to have Michael Bay blowing stuff up for 9 hours non stop, gasping for air after watching a viewgasm like this. a Hundred pints raised from a Tiger born in the sign of Leo, ex-spetznas alfagruppe #1733 Batallion, greetings to imdb and much love to anyone who loves a good movie, cheers from Chris/Sweden.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The films writing is so original and the way the story line progresses and finally finishes is so perfectly fitted to the title.

The humour was spot on evoking laughs at the most inappropriate times which I loved. The soundtrack, spectacular, and what I believe is a major reason the film became the cult classic it did. Perfect for every scene. The leads Travolta and L. Jackson had standout performances, however all performances were great.

12 out of 12 (Imperial System),"My Tarantino retrospective continues with ""Pulp Fiction"" a film I know well, and love. Having been slightly underwhelmed by ""Reservoir Dogs"" a few weeks back I was delighted to find that ""Pulp Fiction"" is as Iconic as ever.Told with a convoluted timeline, ""Pulp Fiction"" revolves around two Hitmen, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who recover a briefcase for their boss, the criminal Kingpin Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Several calamities befall them as they attempt to return the case. Wallace then arranges for fading boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in a prize fight, when Butch double crosses him, Wallace goes after him, which has extreme and unexpected outcomes for both of them.Iconic really is the only word that fits. Each scene is chocked full of quotable dialogue and legendary moments of cinema. So many sections have been parodied in things like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Spaced"", the film is a juggernaut of popular culture. The jumping backwards and forwards in time, help take what is a relatively straightforward story to the next level. There is a good time to be had just mentally putting the film together again in the correct order.Visually, it's a step up from ""Reservoir Dogs"" as the camera is much more dynamic that it was, travelling with characters through sets and shooting locations. Performance wise too it's a lot better, flush with the success of ""Dogs"" Q.T was able to keep the best from that cast, but also attract some enormous talent. Samuel L Jackson is probably the standout. . and this is probably the best performance of his career. Every line, every intonation, every eye bulge is (and here's that word again) Iconic. The music choices are fabulous - just as they were with ""Dogs"". Every song fits the tone of directly into the scene perfectly.It's not totally perfect though. Tarantino's scenes in front of the camera make me cringe. He's not a good actor, and on top of that his use of the N-word seems a bit egregious, or that a character like Jules would let him get away with it.That though doesn't spoil what is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the only true masterpiece in Tarantino's catalogue (I'll see as I check out the rest).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The director of this film is usually not one of my favorite that could possibly be why I do not enjoy the movie as much as other people have it was a well made movie with lots of great acting and lots of famous actors and actresses.

Simply brilliant,"An entire rainbow of characters intertwined in a bubbly imaginative world of neo-noir. The film is great, it's edgy and daring. Composes of seven narrative sequences and three main story lines, titled as the best written film of all time by some renowned critics and it's hard to disagree.. Pulp fiction is set in the world of humour, violence and inflated realism. It's is reaking of popular culture references at most times in the context of the sub-culture and underground. Being highly stylized, direction both visual and emotional, makes this film truly memorable and unique. No wonder it was nominated for seven Oscars and was also awarded at 1994 Cannes..

Do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France?,"After the success that he had with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back strong with his second written and directed full-length feature film, ""Pulp Fiction"". Some would argue that this neo-noir black crime film is his masterpiece. Like his previous film, this offers just as much violence and brutality, which again is wrapped up with lots of style and substance.This film has seven narrative sequences, with three primary storylines, which are all interwoven, making it a hard watch for some people, while others marvel at its construct. Mob hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the protagonist of storyline 1, Butch Coolidge the boxer (Bruce Willis) is the protagonist of storyline 2, and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the 3rd storyline protagonist. The film goes from a prologue (diner hold-up), to Vincent, Jules, and then Butch, before going full circle the epilogue and the diner hold-up again.I enjoyed this in the 1990's when I first watched it, and I've never shied away from watching it again given the opportunity. It might not be everybody's cup of tea and it certainly is not for the younger audiences (even of post 2020!), but I enjoy it and can appreciate its technicality. Having the benefit of 20+ years of hindsight it is interesting to see lots of films that have come out since and tried to replicate part of this film, most have failed too. It is a testament to how good this film is though that it can inspire other people to try, not just in film but other mediums too - games, comics, etc. If you have not seen this film it is absolutely worth a watch, and if you have seen it, why not watch it again and find something you missed last time - or discuss some of the themes, homages, or McGuffin's to try and work out your own messages (the gold light in the suitcase for example - I would love to believe it is Marcellus's soul. It ties in with the plaster on the back of his head, and with the combination of '666' on the briefcase - but this has been widely debunked). A cracking film and an enjoyable piece of art - one of Tarantino's finest films in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Even after 20 years of its release, the film still feels so fresh.","The outrageously funny dialogue of this movie is what really drives it. Quentin Tarantino writes some of the most entertaining dialogue there is to write between two characters.Despite its over two and a half hours long run-time, Pulp fiction does not drag in the slightest as it is basically multiple exhilarating movies rolled into one with an all-star cast that perfectly fits in Tarantino's zany universe. You actually are left wanting for more as the end credits begin to roll. Even after watching the movie more than a dozen times, I still can't remember what scene comes next. However, It's non-linear narrative structure isn't what makes Pulp Fiction a near masterpiece, its true strength comes from the excitingly fresh characters and the crazy events that take place in the film. And of course, the quirky-smart dialogue. The characters in the movie are always talking yet always so interesting. You never really think you'd enjoy a movie about the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits, it all just feels so random, yet it intertwines so brilliantly.

"Not a film I feel passionately about, but still an undeniably fantastic second feature from Tarantino.","Quentin Tarantino had an immediate fan base following his career after the release of the excellent ""Reservoir Dogs"" in 1992, which only grew significantly upon the release of the much-revered ""Pulp Fiction"" two years later. Commonly referred to by many as one of the best films of the '90s, the film was simply a revolution, its impact undeniable. Many - perhaps the majority excepting those who prefer ""Jackie Brown"" - consider ""Fiction"" Tarantino's finest work. Countless film fans worship at its alter. Am I one of them? Not really. I think the film is fantastic for reasons I'll soon explain, but I don't passionately subscribe to it as Tarantino's best either. In fact, ""Django Unchained"" is easily better, and this film has serious claims to that title from ""Inglourious Basterds"" or ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" (YES, I think it's better than number one, okay...easily better, in fact).But why is this film so particularly popular? It's remarkably clever, pop-culture-hip, reference-heavy dialogue is one such reason. There's no wonder it won Tarantino and Roger Avary an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The technique on display only matches the words - Tarantino's patient, passionate direction and Andrzej Sekuła's stylish yet unobtrusive are a match made in heaven.The film is consistently tense, electrifying and unpredictable, and that is aided by its (at the time at least) unique non-linear narrative. It never complies with Hollywood movie clichés, and even in 2016 this approach is refreshing.Fans and viewers which of ""Fiction""'s distinctive four chapters is its best. Some, like me, will place the first chapter (somewhat smug and self-satisfied, like Uma Thurman's performance on re-watches) and the last (overly convenient - how come nobody walks into a previously packed diner and interrupts the goings-on?) the worst of the best. They'll prefer the brutally tense mid-section involving the sexy anti-hero Butch Coolidge (perhaps a career-best Bruce Willis) and the darkly hilarious, clever Harvey Keitel-assisted murder clean-up. They are certainly the film's highlights for me. But the film encourages subjectivity (the suitcase, hello?) and perhaps these different interpretations are part of the fun of this wickedly clever, irrefutably influential modern classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino strikes again with his 2nd film.,"Pulp Fiction: Quentin Tarantino's second film. Is it just as rich and mighty as Reservoir Dogs? Yes. This time, a budget and a cast come along for the ride, a ride that's chopped up into four stories circling a handful of people. There's a mob boss, the mob boss's wife, a boxer, a pair of raucous gangsters and a couple who resemble the contemporary Bonnie and Clyde. Now, you need to look at Pulp Fiction as an adaptation of a comic, and less as a linear story. There's no broad plot, only a smattering of small stories linking the oddballs on display. Surprisingly its style works wonders. Its cool, edgy, bombastic and just as outrageous (if not more) as Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman make the biggest impact with personalities hard to beat. The dialogue is heavy, but witty and clever, the soundtrack glorious and the movie is wrought with memorable scenes.

Entertainment At Its Best,"Quentin Tarantino is a name with which many are familiar, especially if you call yourself a movie buff. However, Tarantino seems to be one of those directors, whose material you either love or hate. For the most part, I think I'd put myself in the ""hate"" category. Neither volume of Kill Bill really appealed to me, and I haven't bothered to see any of Tarantino's other films. Any other than Pulp Fiction, that is, a film which I definitely did not hate.Pulp Fiction's three greatest strengths are the characters, the stories, and the direction. Each character possesses a life of its own and each actor propels that character onto the screen in such a dazzling and eccentric way that you can't help but enjoy the action on screen. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis, actors you would expect to see in a brainless action flick, all put in good performances. Sure, there's no powerful drama, but the interesting stories are the focus here. Each character fits his or her story, and the entertainment increases as the stories intertwine energetically thanks to Tarantino's direction. Also, unlike Kill Bill, the focus of Pulp Fiction is not mindless action, but the brilliant stories and characters themselves.Now, on to Tarantino's famous Pulp Fiction screenplay. Let me begin by saying that, for the most part, the dialogue is as interesting as the characters and the stories, providing insight into their lives. However, as with any movie that attempts to infuse comedy, it's hit-and-miss. There are several more hits than misses, but some of the dialogue in the film is so absurd, that it can't help but detract from the rest of the film.Therefore, if you're looking for a deep, profound film, then I can't really recommend to you Pulp Fiction, as, in my opinion, it's just a popcorn flick. Yet this is a smart, even brilliant, popcorn flick, and I dare you not to be entertained.Final Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Regardless of story line the writing and dialogue are genius,"This is Tarantino's true first born. Everyone who saw this movie felt compelled to see Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown..regardless of your opinion. Just as Taxi Driver & Raging Bull made people watch Mean Streets Unlike Tarantino, personally I'm not blindly devoted to Scorsese and won't say Taxi Driver and Mean Streats we're over my head..I believe they helped get to Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, and Wolf.
Sequencing and Narrative films(Narrative was mainstreamed by Scorsese with Ray Liota, Pecci & DeNiro in Casino & DeCaprio in Wolf). Tarantino uses Narrative in Both Kill Bill films and I'm the Hateful 8.
The other influence adjusted for audiences with a shorter attention Span was Leone..in terms of using Ennio Marricone..(John Williams has nothing on him)..and the pre-violence filming e.g. Uma's 1:1 Face Offs, the emergence of the Bear Jew to bash in the Nazi sergeants brains in etc..

Pulp Fiction: The Classic Movie-Quoting Film,"Even though it was made in the 1990s, this film became an instant ""cult classic"" right off the bat. Director Tarantino did a great job with this film, having all the right actors and doing a fantastic job with the film work of the film. Ever hear somebody quoting a movie, generally it is something from this one. Fans of the film can go quote after quote of this film and hearing it from them just makes you want to see it more. With the story and his style of directing, this movie did a very good job at portraying the art of contemporary films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Do the Twist,"Something so hilariously wholesome about the dialogue in this film. Talk about travel, food, the offensiveness of a foot rub... but also full of violence, drugs, and some blood.

Cool soundtrack too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What's the big deal?,"I really don't know what the big deal is. This is obviously another one of those ""highly intellectual"" movies I am too stupid to understand. The critics compare it to ""The Godfather""... I find that to be sacrilegious! I agree with one critic only when he states that the film ""presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion"", and I would like to put a big emphasis on MEANINGLESS!!! How can something meaningless be good?Another famous critic, Roger Ebert, claims ""Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one..."" That is amazing! One of the world's most acclaimed film critics watches a 'masterpiece', and right after that cannot decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage? Then he goes on to say, 'oh, but it can't be garbage if such an in-director made it, so it must be a masterpiece'. So much for competent individual judgment... I suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that Tarantino simply screwed up this time...In my opinion, the film has a ton of famous actors, an ""in"" director, and nothing else. The plot is practically non-existent, there is no message, no ""higher"" meaning, nothing but violence for the sake of violence..., and above all, it does not entertain either!

"Profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in PULP FICTION","Profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in PULP FICTION, the new movie by Quentin Tarantino. Some may know Tarantino as the screenplay writer for TRUE ROMANCE or the writer-director of the critically acclaimed RESERVOIR DOGS, and just like those previous efforts the heart of PULP FICTION lies in Tarantino's brilliantly written conversations among the various characters. Dialogue fuels PULP FICTION to vividly show the contemptible lives of each character. Tarantino has the gift of propelling the movie along through the spoken word, whereas lesser creators might rely solely on action, violence or special effects. You should note that the movie is shown in a non-linear time structure reminiscent of the critically acclaimed independent film MYSTERY TRAIN, but this should not be an annoyance because the movie is basically a series of three related vignettes that individually add up to one great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Pulp Fiction: the film that's redefined indie cinema.,"Quentin Tarantino knows how to direct an absorbing story and give a movie near-sentient energy of its own. Pulp Fiction is a funny, mysterious, and gorgeously written movie that's a time-capsule for the 90s, like Back to the Future was for the 80s. Pulp Fiction is a darkly humorous, colourful and hard-to-guess story that's still loved to this very day, and for damn good reason: it's a film that has a little bit of something for everyone.Just like nearly every other Quentin Tarantino movie, the story is non-linear, stars Samuel L. Jackson, & pop-music and film references reign supreme in this film. Not to mention the 'Royale with cheese' quote, and 'Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double-dare you motherf##ker, say 'what' one more goddamn time!' This film is basically its own classic moment; from Vince's dance with Mia, to Butch's moment with the Taxi driver, everything is just so well done and just right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Despite my incredibly high expectations and annoyance as a result of the huge subtitles on my screen, I think it's safe to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. It feels so natural, every pretentious person saying the dialogue in this movie is extraordinary and that's what makes it great, is, as it turns out, right!

The story is a good one, complex enough to keep interest but not too complicated like other films can be. From beginning to end, he has you interested.

Great.,"From the point of view of the structure of the play, quentin abandoned the traditional Hollywood way, and with the technique of separating the points of view, the whole film narrative treatment into a kind of echo ""circular structure"". In this novel overall structure, every story in ""pulp fiction"" is told coherently. What's neat about pulp fiction's narrative structure is that it overturns the conventional notion of linear time and space without losing a large audience by being too experimental.
In pulp fiction, violence often goes hand in hand with black humor, and black humor can be surprising and unimaginable, but what makes pulp fiction unique is that it depicts the Christian faith.

An intensely spiritual-and moral - film.,"Pulp Fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time. One critic even called  it a ""glorification of two whacked out hit-men"".Others called it 'flippant', ""nihilistic' and ""cynical'. Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such 'worthless' characters. Yet others called it 'plotless' and 'formless'. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the ""pulp fiction ' on which it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral. Even more, Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues. Tarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson, as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson.To make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film, I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three  episodes. Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved. Yes , there is cynicism, flippancy and studied 'coolness' in Pulp Fiction. However, this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message. This is a film about redemption.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

In my opinion this is definetley one of the 10 best movies of all time ***** out of five,Incredibly good. Not quite as good as Reservoir Dogs but but pretty close and anything that one would come in a mile of Reservoir Dogs must be incredible. In my opinion the greatest writer/director of all time Quentin Tarantino- who is my idle writes and directs this and incase you don't know wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs aswell. This really was and still is ground-breaking so clever and funny with great performences. In my opinion this and Dogs are far superior to the likes of The Godfather- not that that is a bad film thats fantastic but not nearly as good as this and Dogs (in my opinion) QTs next film after this was the excellent Jackie Brown and I can't wait for Kill Bill,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Top 10,"I can't really think of one thing I didn't like about this movie. Everything from the costumes the sets, make up, hair, acting, writing, directing and editing. All the best of the best. Amazing work!PulpFiction, I must admit, is a stellar piece of cinema. A literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully, making you feel their joy and pain. Plot wise, there are numerous twists and turns, as to be expected, but they all manage to fit together rather nicely. And while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end, it doesn't leave the viewer wanting. Dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful, with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk (not unlike the film Lucky Number Slevin). Ultimately the scenes I really like were with Uma Thurman. I think Tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place it's earned in the upper echelons of most critics' ""top 10"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Not as fresh as some said, but just as great","Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction works so well because of its structure. In Tarantino's freshman effort, he used the out of time elements to break up the one set monotony and provide lighter tonal moments here and there. In Pulp Fiction, it's used at the behest of thematic material, and I think it works on a whole different level.It's sort of an anthology film, but the three sections a little too interconnected to just lay it like that. They're connected through a similar set of characters that appear in, or are talked about, in all three, but also with the common theme of choice in the face of fate.In every story, from the dual framing devices (the café and the shootout over the suitcase) to the three main stories, characters are presented with inflection points in their lives, and they chose to go one way or another. Vincent Vega has come back to Los Angeles from several years as ""the man in Amsterdam"". One of his first tasks is to take his mob boss's wife, Mia Wallace, out for dinner, to provide her with company while her husband, Marsellus Wallace, is out of town. There's an connection between them that caps with them both dancing in a twist contest in the wonderfully grotesque nostalgia restaurant Jack Rabbit Slim's. Vincent refuses to take the next step, though. We're not quite sure if Mia would go to bed with Vincent (the way she talks about her husband demonstrates her fidelity towards him), but her willingness isn't the point. The point is Vincent's desire to make a move. He feels it's within the realm of possibility, but he refuses to take that step.Of course, he never really gets the chance because Mia has found Vincent's stash of heroin and snorted it, which was simply too much for her system and she began to overdose. This leads to the most famous scene in the movie where Vincent has to puncture Mia's breastplate with a six inch needle in Vincent's drug dealer's house. It's a great moment of tension with a fantastic shock.Taking a step back from that description of the first major third of the film, I think we can see in microcosm why Pulp Fiction works so well. We have fantastically written characters. We have an exploration of the central theme playing out dramatically. We have some spectacle in the form of the needle episode. It's a marvelous combination of entertainment, character work, and strong thematic material wrapped together extraordinarily well.The second third deals with Butch, a boxer we saw talking with Marsellus Wallace in the first. This also takes place after the third section. Butch has agreed to throw his fight, but he used the quasi-public knowledge of the agreement to cleanup on the odds and win big by winning the fight. He's prepped and ready to go, talking lightly with his girlfriend Fabienne as they spend the night in a hotel talking about the nature of attractiveness (really, her desire for a pot belly), and make fun of each other. He's set for life, and he knows it, but something's wrong. His father's watch is missing, left behind at the apartment. Christopher Walken actually started the story with a telling of the history of that watch (the famous ass watch scene), which he delivers wonderfully. It also sells the importance of the watch to Butch so that when he suddenly loses his cool and decides to brave what should surely be certain death to get it back, we get it. It makes sense. He has to go get it. There's no other choice. He goes back, gets it, gives Vincent a chest full of led from Vincent's own gun, and then accidentally happens across Marsellus Wallace as he drives away.There's fate again, presenting Butch with a situation where he has a choice. After a car crash and a limp-filled foot chase, the two end up trapped in the basement of two perverts (one a cop) who proceed to rape Wallace. Butch uses his opportunity to escape and has another choice. He could leave, scot free, or he could free Wallace. He does the right thing, grabs a samurai sword, and cuts down the perverts (and their gimp with a solid punch to the face). Wallace returns this favor by letting Butch go. They will break ties and have no more to do with each other.The third is where the thematic material comes out most and comes to the best conclusion. Even though it happens before the rest of the movie, the path that Jules follows and how he ends the film is the culmination of the ideas flowing through it. We pick back up with Vincent and Jules in the apartment with the briefcase. An unknown gunman jumps out and fires, emptying his gun in their direction but hitting nothing. After the darkly comic episode where they have to clean up brains from the back of their car, Vincent and Jules settle down in the café that started the film as Jules talks about their miraculous escape and how he plans on facing that with the rest of his life. Vincent considers it a freak accident, but Jules sees it as a sign from a higher power. He's been given an opportunity and a choice, and he's going to take a new path in response to it. He demonstrates that new path by allowing the robbers from the beginning of the film to leave with their lives.Thinking back over the rest of the movie, we realize the order of events as they played out chronologically and discover that Vincent died after the ending of the movie, at Butch's hands. If Jules had kept on his path without diverting it, ascribing the freak gun event as mere happenstance instead of a sign, Jules might have died there too. The universe reached out to both Vincent and Jules, and it was only Jules who read the sign correctly to run off to be like Caine from Kung Fu.So, sitting back, what is Pulp Fiction? First, it's a story that's told out of order chronologically but is arranged in a way that heightens its emotional and thematic impact. It's very well acted, filled with wonderful conversations between well-drawn and interesting characters. It's dotted with great moments of excitement, the kind you expect from a good time at the movies. It's an entire package of entertainment, thematic weight, and great characters.No wonder it made such a splash.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

However, due to the film's cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didn't like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...Why is that?First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didn't like at all...Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantino's films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldn't be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasn't the actors that disappointed me, but the film's script...So, the verdict:It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems I'm one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction...",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"There's no denying it, one of the best movies ever made","My first memory of Pulp Fiction was when I was very young, and my father had borrowed the soundtrack, and he listened to it. And I still remember listening to the beginning, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogue, followed by Misirlou. I don't have any idea why it had such an impact on me, but I remembered that for so long. And the soundtrack of this film continues to enchant me! There are so many songs in this film that are absolute gold. I already mentioned Misirlou, but one exceptionally beautiful track is Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon by Urge Overkill.I saw Pulp fiction for the first time three years ago. I was sixteen then. But this time I did notice there were several details I missed - or have since then forgotten. It's great how you can watch a film again and it still feels kind of new.I love the colour palette of Pulp Fiction. Especially the colour red is very strong. And I have no complaints about the cinematography whatsoever, it really looks amazing. And the design of many locations is great. I especially love Jack Rabbit Slims, the 50's themed restaurant Mia and Vincent Vega go to. It looks absolutely ridiculous of course, very extravagant, but that's why it's so amazing. It's so detailed.Pulp Fiction sure has it's cult classic reputation. I think almost everyone with Internet has seen pictures and GIFs of Pulp Fiction, even if they haven't seen the film itself. That's why watching the film is weirdly surreal. You know so many scenes, but when they are put together, they are perfect, even if so many scenes are legendary even on their own: Samuel L. Jackson's monologue, The dance scene. Several pieces of dialogue. They are all amazing and so many people know them, but when you see them all in a film, it's... surreal.The characters of Pulp Fiction never seize to amaze me. Like I said about Reservoir Dogs, the characters are closer to people than devices to carry out the story. None of them is a hero, none of them is a villain. They have virtues, they have vices. Of course they are devices for the story, that's what characters do, but even when they do their job for the plot, they still have lives outside of the story. Even if the film doesn't shove their regular life to your face, you can still feel it.Pulp Fiction is good. It is most definitely good, it's amazing. Of course I like to think sometimes that it is completely overrated, but whenever I watch it again - or even see an out-of-context piece of the film, I remember that it is one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Rather entertaining,"Enjoyable movie, not dull or anything. Had quite the plot twists & absolutely bizarre and comical moments. The characters I was rooting for had a good ending, which i loved. It's sooo unpredictable, makes you think one thing's gonna happen because it has happened in so many other movies, but something entirely different happens & you're genuinely excited about it. This movie always keeps you on your toes. I love how everything was connected & the soundtrack fit perfectly.But just one thing I wanna know, WHAT WAS INSIDE THAT BRIEFCASE",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

great!!!,"A masterpiece of non-linear narrative film. Ingenious and meaningful structure, wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly moving towards darkness and confusion. Each paragraph does not have a beginning or end, complementary structure, and the beginning and end are connected, suggesting that the plots in similar films in reality always occur and never stop.

Great Movie!,"This movie just shows you how great Tarantino is at making films. He blends many cinematic tricks into one great movie and it worked! This movie is serious and funny at the same time which is hard to come by. I give it ten stars. The actors are great, they are freakishly believable you really feel that John Travolta is Vincent Vega. The supporting actors are just as good.Ving Rhames plays a great role but don't forget about Harvey Keitel as ""the wolf"" great acting. This movie packs a punch, it will be talked about for years to come. It also has a great soundtrack, it has Kool and the Gang! for God sakes! This just shows that Tarantino knows how to make good movies and that he knows good music. It's on my top five favorite movie list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Oscillating Wildly,"Have you ever gone from one extreme to the other on an issue? Our President excluded, many of us change our minds about things on a daily basis. When it comes to philosophies or preferences, we're not static creatures because we realize obstinance is not a virtue. We change, we evolve - that is to be human.Well, my opinion of Pulp Fiction has underwent several cataclysmic upheavals since I first saw the film in its year of release, 1994. I was 14 and, without exaggerating, Pulp Fiction shattered my concept of film. I'd never been so excited, intrigued and in love with a film. It forced me to reconsider what quality cinema was - it was no longer just the greats, the Best Picture winners, etc. Great cinema could be anything - old gangster movies, film noir, B-horror flicks, 1950s melodrama. The film also prompted me to explore film on a more academic basis, as I began reading film theory and film criticism regularly.I worshiped at the shrine of Tarantino and watched everything he put his hands on - be that Destiny Turns on the Radio or 4 Rooms.His other work (even Reservoir Dogs, which, I am convinced, is nothing more than a decent first film) disappointed me, but I never once second-guessed Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown in 1997 re-affirmed my faith in the man, but then he disappeared and a funny thing happened, I second guessed Pulp Fiction.The dialogue, which I once thought brilliant, was not stilted and forced - a little too hip for its own good. The acting was all right, but seemed weaker than I remembered, and the once brilliant story became trite. The masterpiece became, in my eyes, pretentious, though still watchable fare. On my list of 100 favorite films, it fell from the top-10 to the upper 70s.Years went by, I continually found myself drawn to Jackie Brown (I think it's Tarantino's most mature wok and a wrongfully maligned masterpiece), but I avoided Pulp Fiction. A friend who had never seen the film asked one day if we could throw my copy on and it was like watching it for the first time.Everything that seemed forced or trite was brilliant. The dialogue that seemed overly stylized now seemed perfectly stylized and, really, perfectly at odds with the plot, which, though it contains recycled elements, became an energetic, hyper-kinetic, and amazing narrative again.Pulp Fiction quickly returned to the top of my favorites list. Why the swift rising and falling? I have no idea. It could be that QT created a film that is so tied to its audience's state of mind that their reaction to it is a complete crap shoot for him. That's doubtful. What I think truly happened is this: my adolescent mind reacted to its pop-culture references and its manic pace. It was hip and cool, really, and therefore perfect for your alterna teenagers. I matured, grew disdainful of things hip and cool (it was obviously cooler to dislike things that were cool right?), and so began disliking PF. I grew up a little more, became a little more perceptive, and therefore able to appreciate exactly what QT does with narrative and dialogue. Pulp Fiction, though this may seem odd, is a very subtle movie. Its brilliance at first seems superficial, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a film that is narratively amazing and that carries emotional weight. It's not all style; it's not just hip. It's an intelligent and wonderful movie and I don't think that I'll change my mind on it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Horrible!,"OK, so I just finished watching this flick and I found it to be upsetting. I am 20 years old and I heard so many good comments about Pulp Fiction. I purchased it and thought I would love it because I like gangster and shoot-em-up movies, like Boondock Saints and Scarface. However, I do have a disliking of Quintin Tarantino, I hated the Kill Bills and I just don't like Quintin Tarantino as a person. I feel like the movie lacked motivation and moved slow until the last twenty minutes. There were several plot gaps that left me hanging and the twisting story line that was supposed to be theatrical was just stupid and unattached to any part of the movie. The only saving grace for this film was the fact that it had an all star cast. I'm sorry if you disagree and you all probably will but this movie JUST SUCKED!!!",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
pulp fiction,Personally one of my favorite films this movie encases all kinds of different techniques and sort of confuses the viewer until a certain point where the story all starts to connect. i believe that this movie addresses all aspects of american life and what it means to be an american in this day and age. from references to Big Macs and other staple in current american culture this film never has a slow scene and their is always a surprise just around the corner.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
WHY YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM,"You must see this film simply because there's no other movie like it. It's Quentin Tarantino, red hot and constantly in motion, like the flames from the torches carried by the angry villagers in Frankenstein (1931). If you are new to Tarantino, and want to explore the style of this director/writer, Pulp Fiction is your starting gate.Tarantino was clearly running on 12 cylinders with Pulp Fiction, from start to finish, and by the end of the film, you'll suddenly feel as if your heart had stopped beating and you had inexplicably forgotten how to breathe. And for all of its visual intensity and pathos, the film explodes with some of the most witty and cutting dialogue since John Houston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). You could spend all afternoon discussing Pulp Fiction's myriad of memorable quotes.There are so many classic scenes in Pulp Fiction it would be a sacrilege to mention them here (although the ""hamburger scene"" stands out from everything else).This is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest hours, and the film, bold and shocking, remains peerless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A cult Classic,"One of the Best movies i've ever seen,it is the best work of Tarantino. Interlocking different stories into one with black humor, action and thriller are some greatest qualities of this awesome movie.

You will find humor, action, thriller, suspense and new sense of continuum in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best movies ever,This movie certainly deserves the rating of 8.9 and deserves its spot ranked as the #7 movie of all time. Everything is fantastic in this masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino does a fantastic job directing this and not one actor or actress in the movie disappoints me. I personally love the plot of the three different stories that revolve around Marsellus Wallace. This films doesn't leave time for the viewer to be bored while watching since it is so pack full of complex and entertaining characters that bring their witty comments to the screen. There almost seems to be a natural flow between some characters and that draws you in and doesn't let you go for a second.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction (1994) is a crime movie written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The movie tells different stories about two hitmen, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and two diner bandits. It is famous for its non-linear story, violent scenes, and dark humor.I like cinematography. I like how Tarantino captures the shots of actors in different camera shots and they maintain very good depth. The cinematography per se is rich. What is more it has very diverse locations adding more richness and depth to the movie. It's just great. The cinematography is simple and effective and it's not over exaggerated with any unnecessary transitions and rapid camera movements. It goes with the flow. That is why in my opinion the movie is 2h 35min long. The movie tries to make the movie ""feel"" the movie. I love the camera movements during the dramatic scenes, it's just unique. The whole pace of the movie is slow since it also tries to showcase the character development in the movie and more dialogue focused.The screenplay is interesting. It has some witty lines and dramatic sequences and vice versa. It's a unique blend for this movie. I also like the romantic relationship development in the movie. I like how the story is separated into 2-3 different stories with its own unique focus and later those stories come together. The plot gets more complex and explicit, and the film itself is utterly insane. A Grand Theft Auto (GTA) vibe infuses this film.The acting is very good, especially the character development. Accents are clear. The acting feels very genuine and I especially like the dramatic scenes seeking solutions while being emotional. I liked one scene with the dancing part in this movie and for me, it was just gold. I loved it and I was entertained. It brought positive vibes. Of course not all of the movie was like this, there were many dramatic scenes that were just shocking and literally criminal. Moreover, I'm very impressed that the director of the movie himself was an actor in this movie. He did a great job!The film's music selection complements its old-school vibe perfectly. Lastly, the ending is witty, thought-provoking, and complex, marking Pulp Fiction' as a distinctly original film in the landscape of cinema.In short, ""Pulp Fiction"" is notable for its deliberate speed, in-depth character growth, and story centered around conversations. Quentin Tarantino's great camera work and the film's different places make it more interesting. The script cleverly combines humor and drama. The performances are fantastic, especially the memorable dance scenes and Tarantino's acting. The old school music makes the movie feel better. ""Pulp Fiction"" has per se a complex and thought-provoking story that makes a standout film. It showcases Tarantino's unique vision and storytelling skills.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Decent, but what's all the fuss about?","Most people I know who have seen this movie either think it's the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever produced.  I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.  Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the ""story"" meanders and seems largely without purpose.  Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wow!!!!,"I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good. I made it through the whole thing SOMEHOW, and as we were walking through the parking lot I just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and I'll never get it back. I honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing. There is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast (NOT Travolta nor Thurman) and their ability was limited due to the awful script. There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth. It seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an ""F"" word anywhere there was a space. I wouldn't have cared less if Tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash.

its overrated,"""Pulp Fiction"" often stands as a touchstone in cinematic history, but many feel that its acclaim is more a product of hype than genuine artistic merit. While Quentin Tarantino's film is undoubtedly stylish, some critics argue that its layers of complexity can sometimes feel like an elaborate smokescreen for deeper issues.I think that this movie is simply overrated. I am not saying its a bad movie but it is an overkill. I liked the writing and the actors did a magnificent job conveying their roles that's it. I believe the buzz over this movie is too much and to be honest left me disappointed and betrayed after watching it, i was expecting.In summary, while ""Pulp Fiction"" has certainly left a mark on cinema, its storytelling style, dialogue, portrayal of violence, and cultural prominence can lead some to view it as overrated rather than the iconic film it is often considered for me personally.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Worst Film Ever. Pulp Fact,"I rent the film because the fact that it's #9 on IMDb 250 list and my friend highly recommend the film. So I watched it last night, I couldn't believe my eye, what a piece of garbage film-making this is, the whole film is mostly consist of boring & cheesy dialaue in which have at least a million F word in it. the character sucked, I never felt I care about them. And the worst thing is that there's not motherfreaking plot! I watched the whole film and did not understand what the hell is going on. I cannot think of any positive things about this film.And why is this film loved by many and get thumb up from the critics? Here's some of my theory: 1. this is a very unique film for its time, so people get on a bandwagon and start praise this film, so whoever hate this film would considered ""uncool"" 2. Pulp Fiction is so bad that it's good. As mention before, pulp fiction is a unique film, it's so unique that it's hard to tell that it's good or bad, but the critics decided to call it good, soon a bandwagon start.the bottom line is, do not watch this film, don't care about what other people say.

"A classic film that has permanently changed the way I see films. Witty, violent and spectacularly original, one of my all time favourites","At the beginning of the film, right before it starts, there is a definition of the two words that make up the title of this film. One word that should have been defined is the word classic. If you ask me what my definition of a classic film is, it is one that is easily remembered, whether that be by memorable quotes, characters or scenery and thoroughly enjoyable to the point where you will want to see it on a regular basis. I could go on and on about all of that but I will say this is one film that has changed the way I see films. It has become one of my all time favourites as a result. As soon as I started watching it the first time, I knew this was something special. I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched it but I always remember the witty dialogue, the violence, characters, etc. Even thought it is officially defined as a crime/drama film, I can't help but find a few of the scenes as side splitting hilarious. I see perfection as a bit of a myth but to me, Pulp Fiction is as close as it comes to a perfect film. The casting of the roles is very good, in particular, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman, script writing is fantastic, not just because of the witty dialogue but due to Quentin Tarantino being brave by telling this story in a non-traditional, non-linear fashion. Kudos also to Tarantino's direction, showing why he is one of the best modern Hollywood directors out there. Speaking of kudos, I think Pulp Fiction's legacy has grown since being released in 1994 and should have won at least two more Academy Awards, namely Samuel L. Jackson as Best Supporting Actor and Quentin Tarantino as Best Director. Nevertheless, it has truly stood the test of time and is one of the best of the 1990's and of all time as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliant,"Simply brilliant. The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence , the extended dialogue riffing, the trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly  above all else, the sheer direction less excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it.

You can split your live for to part: before watch this movie and after. I like watch this movie which my friend, you can start watching from any part, that is OK. Tarantino is going to great master if he create only this movie, it like icon cinema. I haven't watch movie lake this, i mean so creative and unusually.

One of the best films seen yet..,"Tarantino wrote a screenplay with Roger Avary for one of the greatest films of all time. Amazing shots but an even greater cast brought together by Ronnie Yeskel and Gary M. Zuckerbrod. Each performer brought emotion, hilarity, and a sense of realism to the scenes. One specifically, Uma Thurman's scene as Mia going through an OD, the seriousness within the scene on each character's face and the stillness of Thurman's person and aftershock was scary real. Viewing this from two different age groups (my younger brother saw it with me) we saw the characters had depth and the cast altogether was hand picked to perfection. It's no wonder the box office first weekend alone had brought more than triple the budget! Would greatly recommend to anyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wildly Exciting,Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that has gone down in history for the way it looks on screen and the messages sent throughout the course of the film. The film wouldn't be so eerily brilliant if it weren't for the lighting effects. Sometimes the faces of the character's are 1/2 lit or lit in a different way which really helps bring the concept of being in the shadows to the screen and it manages to make that more of a profound impact on the viewers because the person doesn't look normal or like they should. Another technique that was used very well in this film was the actual film making itself. The subjects were filmed in such a way that they complement the lighting effects but still make them visible for the audience to understand what is going on in the story.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Who would think a man with a foot fetish...,"Could make a movie so good?! There's something to be said about how perfectly Pulp Fiction flows with such a non-linear story line. Quentin Tarantino had already earned his spurs with Reservoir Dogs, and now decided to take everything to the nines with his sophomore film. The beauty of Pulp Fiction is how the story lines are so well intersected, and yet it begins and ends nearly exactly the same way. Not only is it one of the most important films of the 1990s, but it served as a platform for incredible dialogue, a veritable showcase depicting the bleak yet flashy glamour of 90s' LA, and a scenario of sorts of just what ordinary, and not-so-ordinary people can do when under duress.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino creates a masterpiece.,"Pulp Fiction.  The opening of this film consists of a literary definition of the title.  This alone should tell you what you are about to see cannot be compared to anything real.  But have you listened to the news or read the papers lately.  There's stuff going on the world that makes Pulp Fiction look like a day care center complete with cute bunnies.  Tarantino specializes in introducing us to characters, allowing us to get use to them, and he even getting us to like them.  Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesn't give us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The language, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not ""Glorified"" by this movie.  If you make a movie about modern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that respect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.  Then he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite movie ever, but it's definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as those who hate it.  That alone is a difficult achievement.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino once again slips up,"After opening his film-making career with the violent, gritty 'Reservoir Dogs' Quentin Tarantino followed it up with 'Pulp Fiction'. Told with a similar, non-linear storyline the latter follows the criminal lives of many characters, some of which intersect by coincidence. Tarantino's style of film-making is often incoherent, messy, and just plain obnoxious. While one can praise his entertainment factor, it's not good enough by itself to make a remarkable film. Such is this case with 'Pulp Fiction' which often relies too much on clever editing, smart acting, and foul language.The film starts off with two lovers talking in a diner: Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer). As they discuss previous criminal jobs, they suddenly decide to hold up the diner they're in. After they get up with guns, declaring their intentions the film goes to freeze frame and the opening credits role. To describe the entire plot of 'Pulp Fiction' would take too long, and is unnecessarily. It follows the lives of two hit men named Jules and Vincent (Academy Award nominees John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a Mob Boss (Ving Rhames), his oddball wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer at the end of his prime (Bruce Willis). Intertwined among these criminal characters are a myriad of different personalities. There's the twisted Zed, the classy Winston Wolf, and of course Tarantino himself as Jimmy. These characters often come together through different segments and numerous situations. They include a desperate trip to recover a sacred Golden Watch, a case of someone very important overdosing on Heroine, and a botched getaway from a job. The cast is impressive, featuring smaller roles from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Eric Stoltz, and Christopher Walken. While Tarantino has an impressive cast list to boot, other elements of the film often go wrong.The first thing that comes to mind in Tarantino's films is dialog. He works a labyrinth of different personalities, characters, and events while connecting them with one common theme. The main interaction in 'Pulp Fiction' is violence. It is sporadic, but it comes in bursts of graphic nature. There is, like in 'Reservoir Dogs' comedy mixed in with drama and even action. However, stylistically the combination is lacking. Tarantino ultimately has to use the f-word to establish a certain emotion or mood in his screenplay, rather than relying on directional technique. The cast emotes his dialog to their best of their abilities and the tough build of Jackson is impressive. He gets into his character and fully embodies the hit-man who grows a conscious. The rest of the cast are solid, but Jackson ultimately carries the show with his hilarious delivery and tone.Technically speaking, 'Pulp Fiction' doesn't accomplish anything new. There is interesting editing by Sally Menke, although the photography by Andrzej Sekula looks dated. A good deal of Tarantino's filmography deals more with more with the ""sound"" than the ""look"". There is a fun soundtrack thrown into the mix, but everything looks fairly standard as intended. Tarantino's direction feels off base, mainly because the material he gives himself doesn't really go anywhere. 'Sin City' is an example of a film that is purely based on style and looks, while Tarantino as a filmmaker tries to get a combination of intelligence and entertainment. As these two heads collide, things get messy. Does 'Pulp Fiction' really do anything new for cinema? There's quite a bit of swearing, yes, and the film is looked up to as something out-of-this-world but these are not striking elements. In 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' Tarantino once again heavily copies from other Kung Fu films, but in that regard he is able to create something distinctly entertaining and visually exuberant. The characters in 'Pulp Fiction' are degenerates, people who kill for a living and people who use drugs regularly. Tarantino has made personal remarks that he condemns this sort of behavior, yet the film stylizes both these elements as if there is a bigger mystique to them then there really is.In the end, I give 'Pulp Fiction' more than it's fair share of points. It entertains and it has some solid acting-Tarantino's (lack of) ability to really pull everything together for a solid point ends up being his wrongdoing once again.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Are we supposed to be laughing?,"If Pulp Fiction were meant to be a comedy I'd be tempted to give it 7/10 for sheer effort. It's got John Travolta in a wig (check out that ponytail!) Uma Thurman pretending to be a dancer, and Mr Quentin Tarantino himself in yet another cameo trying to prove he can act, and proving beyond all doubt that he can't.Amid the farce and supposedly knowing humour of this film there is one shining light. The performance of Samuel L Jackson as a hit-man stands out as one of the performances of the 1990s. It's a shame the director got his hit men mixed up and put Travolta at the heart of this film; with Jackson front and centre this could have been a first-rate crime drama, with the added intrigue of a man atoning for some truly wicked sins.Travolta is miscast as Vincent. He plays a hit-man who talks about hamburgers on the way to murdering his victims. Not because this is what hit men do, but because Tarantino is so desperate to be seen as cool his hit men simply MUST do something different.It gets worse. Vincent is assigned to look after his boss's wife and duly ends up on the dance floor. Quite why this is supposed to be so iconic I have absolutely no idea. John Travolta moves like a bored polar bear at times, and Uma Thurman may as well be on heavy medication for all the good she is. Rarely do you have sympathy for Hollywood superstars, but watching these two I did wonder whether the pair of them might consider early retirement. If nothing else, I guess this scene offers a cautionary warning to anyone fond of a hamburger; eat too many of 'em and you too could end up like John Travolta.Throw in Bruce Willis as a disillusioned boxer, Harvey Keitel as Wolf, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as a pair of hold-up artists, and, well, you've got a film not a million miles away from a Robert Altman picture of the Seventies. Or indeed a John Cassavetes film.This is my problem with Tarantino; you watch his films and wonder if you've seen it somewhere before. Reservoir Dogs was a deserved success - critically, at least - but with Pulp Fiction we've been here before many times.Its rating on this website suggests it is up there with The Godfather, and that, frankly, is the biggest laugh of the lot. Come to think of it, maybe I was right all along; maybe it IS a comedy after all.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Such a strong use of dialogue! I love it!,"This film keeps the viewer paying attention as there is a lack of chronology in the telling of the narrative. However, this can be slightly troublesome during the first viewing of the film, but if one gives this movie the full attention it deserves, the characters (such as those played by Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and the watch scene with Christopher Walken) and dialogue drive narrative carry this film from the on-screen start to the end credits. The acting in this film is great, the use of the soundtrack paired with the film editing is even better, both of these paired together create a well-thought out, story that will continue to be told for some time. It's one of those ""cult classics"" for a reason. Not to mention, the director, Quentin Tarantino, what a talent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

There are twist and turns throughout this movie that make your head spin! The long dialog scenes reads Tarantino all over it, and also the thick blood and crazy death scenes.

Pearl 90',"A good surprise I've been seeing this film, I had very little hope that this film came to like me, especially has a point engaging and keeps you entertained from beginning to the end without even making the slightest effort, even conversations are curious and entertaining, Tarantino is a director very category by works of cult like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill insuperable. The actors in this film are especially great among all make a perfect union that raise my score.The performances are quite correct, in my opinion highlighting the Uma Thurman, a pretty violent movie and too strong at times, is one of those films that scare even without cause tension and leaves you the willies at times. One of the things that also seemed luxury have been the musical interventions that appear, especially in which Uma Thurman dancing with John Travolta, that scene is epic, music can not be better because stick with the film, despite if not my genre I've been pleasantly surprised, just have errors, almost perfect, is not the kind of film that I usually fix although I have done and I am delighted for movie lovers this noventera wonder can not pass unnoticed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Answering some questions...,"First off, as I read sometime ago, Tarantino with ""Pulp Fiction"" doesn ´t try to introduce and/or play with a plot, instead he introduces you to a world.  His world.  A world where the so-called ""anti-socials"" are far more complicated than the ""normal people"" (as I´m writting this, and I use the term ""normal people"" I laugh, and feel dirty).  These anti socials are haunted by greater problems.  Self-finding issues. Tarantino uses the questions raised by one-self to make the characters of the movie think about their lives.  To think about what they´re doing with them.  As Jules says, he´s trying to be the sheperd.  Even God gets involved.  Even God has a chance.  Even bad guys can change. In more technical purposes, the director (Q. Tarantino), uses an infinity of signs, and symbols to put us throughout the story...once again, not a simple plot, but a whole world.  The camera movement, although not ground-stomping, jaw-dropping, is fine.  One thumb up.  Fine directing. The story, on the other hand...woooow!  Leaves me speechless, breathless, etc.  It´s an extasy just to read the script, just to think of it as a book.  Hats off for Tarantino as a writter...Avary too.Finally, bashing a little bit, Tarantino needs some expertise as a director, but his writting skills are top-notch.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good but overrated,"Tarrantino did what he set out to do in Pulp Fiction - making a wacky, nonlinear piece of entertainment full of gratuitously over-the-top dialogue (or monologue) and violence. He made that clear even in the title; it's just a highly charged but disposable fiction. He succeeded quite nicely.However, many his fans are trying to make it more than what it is, a cool but undemanding movie. While it's refreshing compared to typical banality supplied by mainstream Hollywood, it's far from a truly great classic some fans want people to believe. Interestingly, that's probably not Tarrantino's intention in the first place",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pretty bad!,"The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Tarantino's best work,"In a diner, a man and a woman who call each other Pumpkin and Honey Bunny eat breakfast in a booth. Honey Bunny teases Pumpkin for not wanting to commit armed robberies anymore, and Pumpkin explains that robbing the diner would be better than robbing convenience stores or banks. She agrees, and the two leap to their feet and draw their weapons, before the opening credits roll.Across town, two men in suits named Vincent and Jules ride in a car discussing Europe and fast food. Jules tells Vincent that Marsellus, their boss, allegedly had a man thrown off a balcony for massaging his wife Mia's feet, who Vincent has been instructed to take out to dinner. They argue about the implications of foot massages, before storming an apartment with three men inside. Jules kills one, and recites Ezekiel 25:17 before killing another, named Brett. Vincent retrieves a briefcase, the contents of which glow, from a kitchen cabinet.In a bar, Marsellus gives an envelope full of cash to a boxer named Butch, bribing him to throw his next match. Vincent and Jules, now wearing tee shirts, enter the bar, and Butch has a brief exchange with Vincent on his way out.In the following scene, Vincent buys heroin from his drug dealer, named Lance, and talks briefly to his girlfriend Jody. After buying three grams of heroin, Vincent shoots up and heads to Mia's house. Mia does cocaine in the bathroom while Vincent fixes himself a drink. They head to a restaurant named Jackrabbit Slim's, where they talk about Mia's failed television pilot and the foot massage rumor, which Mia denies. Mia forces Vincent to participate in a twist contest, which they win.Back at Mia's house, while Vincent uses the bathroom, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine and snorts it, falling unconscious. A panicked Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, although Lance is reluctant to help. Vincent is able to successfully revive her with an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. At the end of the night, Mia tells Vincent a joke from her television pilot, which she previously refused to divulge, and the two agree to keep the night's events a secret.A man named Captain Koons visits Butch as a child, giving him a gold watch that is a family heirloom. As an adult, Butch kills his opponent in a boxing match, rather than purposely lose as Marsellus wanted. Butch escapes in a cab driven by a woman named Esmeralda, and calls a bookie named Scottie who plans to collect Butch's earnings. Meanwhile, Marsellus orders that Butch be killed. At a nearby motel, Butch's girlfriend Fabienne waits for him, and the two talk and have sex. The next morning, Butch realizes his gold watch is missing, and angrily leaves the motel in search of it.Butch cautiously returns to his apartment, and initially finds no one there. He retrieves the watch and notices a gun on the counter. He hears the toilet flush, and kills the man who emerges from the bathroom, which turns out to be Vincent. Butch leaves and is spotted by Marsellus at a stoplight. Butch rams him with his car, and an injured Marsellus chases an injured Butch until both men are subdued inside a nearby pawn shop by the owner, named Maynard.Butch and Marsellus awaken in the pawn shop basement, where Maynard has bound and gagged them. A man named Zed shows up, who orders Maynard to get ""the Gimp,"" a man in a full-body bondage suit who sleeps in a trunk. Zed drags Marsellus into another room to be raped while Maynard watches, and Butch manages to break free. Butch is about to flee when he hears Marsellus's cries and instead retrieves a katana sword and ambushes the men, killing Maynard. Now freed, Marsellus shoots Zed in the crotch, and tells Butch that the men are even, as long as Butch leaves town and never tells anyone about the incident. Butch rides Zed's chopper motorcycle back to the motel, and he and Fabienne ride away together.The film flashes back to the scene where Jules recites Ezekiel 25:17, this time from the perspective of an armed man hiding in the bathroom. After Jules kills Brett, the man runs out and fires wildly, miraculously missing Jules and Vincent with his entire clip. Jules and Vincent kill him, and Jules calls the event an act of ""divine intervention."" The two take Marvin, the only surviving man in the apartment, with them, and leave. In the car, the men continue debating ""divine intervention,"" and Jules pledges to give up his life of crime. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, killing him. Jules calls a nearby friend named Jimmie, and they head to his house to deal with the cleanup.At Jimmie's house, Jules calls Marsellus for help, who arranges for a man named Winston Wolfe to come over and help fix the situation. Jimmie tells the men they have ninety minutes before his wife Bonnie arrives home. Wolfe arrives ten minutes later and instructs Jules and Vincent to wipe down the car upholstery. They place Jimmie's blankets over the seat, and Wolfe hoses a naked Jules and Vincent down in the backyard, before giving them old tee shirts to wear. They follow Wolfe to a nearby auto shop, where the car is destroyed. Wolfe introduces Jules and Vincent to his girlfriend Raquel on his way out of the auto shop, and then leaves.Jules and Vincent decide to get breakfast at the same diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are about to rob in the first scene. Vincent goes to the bathroom just before Pumpkin and Honey Bunny draw their guns. When Pumpkin demands Jules's wallet and the briefcase, Jules draws his weapon, and explains to Pumpkin that he now understands the true meaning of Ezekiel 25:17, and wants to find a non-violent solution. Vincent emerges from the bathroom, resulting in a Mexican standoff.

I double dare you to watch the movie!,"Pulp Fiction is an American movie released in 1994 and one of the most impressive films of the 90´s. It´s Quentin Tarantino´s masterpiece and is
categorized as police/suspense. It lasts 1h54 and has the age rating of 18. It was produced by Lawrence Bender and Tarantino himself and the story was written by Tarantino and Roger Avary. Pulp Fiction had a budget of 8 million dollars.
Pulp Fiction was the movie that released Tarantino to the stardom:
Tarantino being the director, screenwriter, producer and actor all together. He was born on March 27, 1963, USA and he achieved fame in the early 90's for his nonlinear scripts.
He loves to use graphic violence, rich dialogues - with a mix of irony and humor - and violence. Pulp Fiction´s main characteristic is the nonlinear narrative,
feature followed by the Brazilian film director Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus. It is a vanguard movie, using and abusing of camera techniques and encompassing movie tricks. It´s a masterpiece that collects high class actors like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackon, Bruce Willis and, Tarantino´s darling, Uma Thurman. The four independent stories, but brilliantly connected by a unique theme of violence, are all magnificent,
bringing up the discussion of violence and moral values. It made Tarantino win the Oscar of best original script besides the Golden Palm in Cannes. The soundtrack - lights on You Never Can Tell by guitar legend Chuck Berry - amplifies the film's immersion into an amazing and nostalgic atmosphere. Pulp Fiction, despite its extreme violence, is a delight to our eyes and ears. So, I dare you! I double dare you to watch the movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

You really do have a lot going on in this movie and it is worth watching still!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Rocky and Pulp Fiction are the reasons I make movies...,When I seen Rocky I felt like I wish I could do that (Make movies.) When I seen Pulp Fiction I was like I have to find away to do that. It's an ADHD brain at it's finest. I believe Jules is the every man character you know anyone whoever wanted more out of their life. Although Butch plays a similar part he's stuck in the chaos. What's in the case is? Hope. Hope for a new life walking the earth and such.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction was one of the greatest films of last century; Tarantino intertwines the story six main characters in an original tale of redemption. The iconic opening conversation about what they call fast-food abroad, between the two mob men, Vincent and Jules, sets a trend of witty dialogue and black comedy throughout the film. Vince (Travolta) seems to be the most thuggish of the pair who clearly enjoys his brutal job, where as Jules (Samuel Jackson) comes across as the more virtuous, spitting out memorable biblical quotes throughout the film. The layered masterpiece must be watched again and again to enjoy its full potential. With a simple yet uniquely assembled plot this film plays host to a string of great characters that will never be beaten, nor will there ever be a film quite like it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not very original,"It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The masterpiece closest to my heart,"The film's presentation style is very beautiful, based on a non-linear narrative narration that shows you a different arrangement than the logical arrangement of events. The film starts with a scene from the end of the film and vice versa.
Secondly, the characters built Quentin Tarentino characters with logical diagonal diagonal proportions in characters and for seriousness in other characters in addition to the amazingly written dialogues that gave the characters depth and deep dimension",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
remarkable film-making,"Pulp Fiction is remarkable in the sense that it doesn't offer anything groundbreaking; yet when you piece the parts together, the unified film is refreshing and captivating. Quentin Tarantino as a fan implements cross-genre references ranging from Spaghetti Westerns to Asian action films. Not entirely bound by any genre, Pulp Fiction reinvents modern cinema in many ways, and QT has created a unique identity with his dialogue-driven stories and implied offscreen violence, among other creative styles.A good film does not necessarily need any jaw-dropping scene by itself, but it must work as a total system. While Pulp Fiction may or may not put you on the edge of your seat at any time, the entire film is well crafted to form a memorable and entertaining cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

nice,"The masterpiece of the non-linear narrative film. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, with wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly going to darkness and confusion. Each paragraph has no beginning and end, a complementary structure, and the beginning and end are connected, suggesting that the plots in similar movies in reality always happen and never stop.
Line: Why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find a truly special person can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"This is a very interesting movie, full of a strange charm.","Although it describes the life of people at the bottom of society, it does not make people feel as vulgar as its title. This film is very interesting in structure, narrative, theme, soundtrack, and performance. It is an unforgettable gangster movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Clever and daring, this high-pitched film never falters!!!!!","Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies. Prizefighter Butch Coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. Meanwhile, two career criminals, Vincent Vega and Jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. While one is asked to baby sit their boss' dangerously pretty young wife, the other suddenly realizes that he must give up his life of crime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"awesome movie with an awesome direction, acting and plot","The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino and is considered to be a turn in the history of Hollywood cinema. It was released on 14th October 1995 and maintains its position #5 in IMDb's top 250 list ever since. The great thing about this movie is the its non-linear storyline which keeps the audience interested. It revolves around the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.. The thing that most amused me is long duration continuous shots and the brilliant acting done by Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman. This movie has some great all time favorite dialog like ""I dare you, I double dare you"" and many more. The music in the movie is great as it very well keeps the pace and rhythm of the movie and keeps viewers interested.Coming to the composition of the movie, the sudden movement of space and time is very well composed and directed. The movie starts from present, goes into the past, then jumps to future and comes back to the present. This is very well crafted so that the audience do not get confused.Coming to awards and nominations, it won an Oscar for the best writing and screenplay and got numerous nominations for best picture, best actor, best actor in the supporting role, best director and many more. Overall it won 62 awards and 46 nominations and an Oscar which is a sign of great movie.So I would like to conclude by saying that it is indeed a great movie to watch with good plot,acting and direction and one should watch it at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Tarantino's brilliant script both imitates and digs into pulp, uncovering meaning and richness","When Quentin Tarantino turned pulp fiction into cinematic art, everything changed. The auteur's second feature film marked the beginning of the rise of independent film in the '90s, but more importantly, it proved that the gratuitous sex, drugs, cursing and violence associated with ""low brow"" fiction could in fact be utilized intelligently for a higher artistic purpose. Essentially, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved that gratuitous genre films can be provocative and have something to say.""Pulp Fiction"" is three connected short stories sandwiched between a fourth story cut in half and used as a prologue and epilogue. The brilliance of Tarantino's screenplay (with story help from Roger Avary) comes not merely from this structure, but the way these three distinct acts tie together in unexpected, poignant ways.Act I, ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife,"" is the film's most memorable. The stylization, the quotable dialogue and Uma Thurman's tantalizing presence as Mia Wallace stand out as the film's hallmarks, even though when weighed on the whole, this act has the least to do with the weightier, more meaningful components of the film.It begins by introducing us to Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two black tie hit men working for Wallace (Ving Rhames) who are on their way to interrogate some young men who appear to have stolen a valuable briefcase of Wallace's. En route, they discuss such asinine things as the level of intimacy in a foot massage and what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in Paris, firmly routing the story in what appears to be meaningless drivel. The feel echoes Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" in a lot of ways. We then follow Vega in a classic ""take out the boss's wife but don't lay a finger on her"" story filled with romantic tension that goes majorly awry.Act II, ""The Gold Watch,"" introduces us to aging boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) as Wallace asks him to throw an upcoming match. We also learn about Butch's father's lucky gold watch, a family heirloom with a crazy history. There's a noir aspect to this part of the story, as Butch of course decides not to throw the fight and run away with his girl (Maria de Madeiros), but the reckoning we expect takes a series of unbelievable turns. As we make sense of the chaos, notions of good vs. bad luck and good vs. evil — or bad vs. ****ing evil — start to appear, even as it plays for pulp entertainment.Act III, ""The Bonnie Situation,"" takes Jules and Vincent down a peg as they too get ""lucky"" but then must deal with a mistake that requires the help of a fixer named Wolf (Harvey Keitel). The whole ordeal has Jules contemplating the notion of divine intervention, and we begin to see all the events in the film as being either about luck, coincidence, divine intervention, or any other number of ways you can look at twists of fortune.By digging into the story and uncovering these deeper themes, Tarantino transforms everything else about the film from hollow pulp fiction to rich pulp fiction. He proves that meaning can come even from the perverted, salacious material. A notion of social responsibility even sneaks its way in by the end.As a director, Tarantino impressively wields suspense in the form of anticipated violence. It has remained his calling card ever since. Nobody can craft a modern day Mexican standoff like he seems to effortlessly do in every film. He also delivers on that anticipation of violence in a satisfying way. He goes big, but he never goes so far as to completely rip us out of this story.The greatest of great films always have unforgettable scenes that are somewhat inessential if not tangential to the story. Vincent and Mia twisting in the '50s-themed restaurant to Chuck Berry's ""You Never Can Tell;"" Christopher Walken's cameo relaying the story of the gold watch to a young Butch —Tarantino's creative choices really pop out, which happens when you've crafted an excellent story.Yet the literary quality that Tarantino brings to this curse-filled and violent film is it's crowning achievement. Even just the Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) scenes that bookend the film have so much to say about fate and free will, and the things that happen to Vincent whenever he takes a bathroom break with a pulp magazine seem to offer a meta-commentary on the entertaining distraction typically associated with these kinds of genre films.""Pulp Fiction"" really tore down walls for filmmakers exposed to and inspired by pulp and other ""lesser"" forms of entertainment who wanted to grow up and make art. It certainly gave Tarantino an audience to keep telling these kinds of stories. From spaghetti westerns to kung fu movies, he finds a depth and richness to them and channels that into his own storytelling. ""Pulp Fiction"" happens to be his finest example as well as one of his first.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
