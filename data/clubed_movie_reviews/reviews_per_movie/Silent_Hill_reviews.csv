A review for the clueless who didn't know this is an adaptation of a videogame,"Yea I live in a cave. Not only am I over a decade late to the Silent Hill party, but I had no idea that it is an adaptation of the famous 1999 PlayStation game Silent Hill. If this describes you as well then read on because it might help you enjoy this flick more.Silent Hill the movie has a distinctly cold, brooding vibe similar to the classic supernatural mindbenders like The Others, The Sixth Sense, or even going way back to The Shining. That is, it immediately puts us in a surreal state of mind, cut off from reality (in this case an abandoned ghost town) where anything can & usually does happen.Where it gets crazy and possibly disorienting to newbies is when it incorporates some of the videogame elements which are never really explained. The terrifying monster Pyramid Head just sort of appears without any context, and similarly the famous Nurses From Hell scene happens almost randomly. These are excellent scenes, but still a bit disorienting if you're trying to relate everything to the narrative that's unfolding.The story itself is about a woman searching for a child in the creepy ghost town of Silent Hill, and it becomes a sort of dysfunctional Alice in Wonderland type tale with random gruesome episodes and good scares, but underneath it is a consistent plot which slowly reveals itself. One unique angle worth mentioning is that this movie is almost entirely a female cast. I thought that was a really interesting diversion from the standard horror flick where men dominate the story as both heroes and villians. Here our protagonist is a strong female lead--not quite Sarah Connor Terminator 2 strong, but definitely not a squeaking damsel in distress. The antagonist is a female as well, a very creepy matriarchal character whom you totally wouldn't want to meet at Sunday brunch.Just be prepared that not everything ties neatly into the story (due to the videogame elements), and that's my only real criticism. However, if I watch it a 2nd time I'll be better prepared, as I hope you are after reading this! Silent Hill is a great flick with some terrifying moments, nice creative gore (ever see someone get their entire skin ripped off? tune in) and a satisfying story with a really interesting twist. Definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great ideas, creepy atmosphere and eerie mood  but the rest is badly executed","I remember I sat down to play Silent Hill a couple of years ago because the mystery genre intrigued me and the game had an interesting look to it, so I started running through the abandoned town of 'Silent Hill' as the main player. I stopped playing very soon because, in truth, not a whole lot was happening. It was mostly an uncomfortable experience, eerily lit and hauntingly scored. I could feel an intense build-up in that foggy place but I never reached the culmination, so I gave up. OK, fine - I was scared.Years later this film adaptation is bravely made by Christophe Gans and, even though I'd played less than ten minutes of the game, I immediately recognised the haunting visuals of the abandoned city. So 'well done' here is an understatement. It is superbly breathed new life into.The plot has been glossed over slightly in a Hollywood fashion, but captures the essence of its characters and storyline - which is: as a last resort, a mother takes her ill daughter to a place she often mentions in her sleep - a place near where she was adopted from. But the hope the mother has for her daughter's recovery quickly shatters and turns into despair when the little girl vanishes in the misty mysterious old town.I truly cannot credit the atmosphere of this film enough. Christophe Gans has successfully captured the eerie mood of Silent Hill and it is a nightmarish place - a fog-enshrouded hell that shifts between two modes: barren ashen daylight and a gruesome decaying state with fiery ember, demons and enhanced by chilling (and very sudden) sound effects. It's strangely fascinating, surreal and above all frightening.The problems of Silent Hill (2006) are that there are not nearly enough build-ups. They should have been used not only to stay faithful to the video game upon which it was based but to wield tension in the right way and shock us when the build-up finally culminates. But here we are introduced to horrid creatures early on and often without much foreshadowing devices. Because they are presented to us so generously and clear-viewed, they are not that scary. At all. Some even manage a raised eyebrow, like the crawly CGI cripples.In the end, I think this is quality horror entertainment and probably one of the better game-to-film adaptations, abut it is much too chaotic - too many monsters and too often and too clearly to be frightening. The mood and atmosphere are what is frightening and so it should have been used even more in Silent Hill, but instead the director feels pressured to introduce creatures to satisfy mainstream audiences' need for bloody gorefest and kinetic action.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy AF but...,"First of all, Carol Spiers deserved an Oscar for her production design. I'm not joking at all. It was so creepy and unsettling. It's worth watching for that alone. Unfortunately the storytelling aspect of it was pretty meh. Not a great script with some pretty lazy dialogue. In spite of that, I really liked this movie... surprisingly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good and eerie adaptation about  famous video game and well realized by Christophe Gans,"This creepy and fantastic film gets a riveting script by Roger Avary. It's a spectacular piece and quite scary, so many levels, so many complexities and so many wonderful themes that are permeating throughout. It's like ¨Alice in Wonderland¨ meet ¨Dante's Inferno¨. It's based on known game and completely unique, absolutely frightening and, basically, one of the few games that actually could become a movie. Samuel Hadida , producer of the last three movie of Christophe Gans tells the game was conceptualized on the difficult way, because we had to go convince the Japanese people from Konami Corporation, they produced the game, to give us the right to make the film . The game has such a cult following, the fan base is very protecting. Christophe Gans is careful to maintain the suspense and all the areas , like the means of illumination in the darkness by a splendid cinematography by Dan Laustein and certain key of characters and antagonists, furthermore an appropriate music score by Jeff Danna. Gans has a very surrealist sort of vision of the game and the film itself sort of explores the boundaries of reality. The Silent Hill movie is a great experience, is something disturbing , it's not only about fear, it's also about emotion.The cast is really exciting. There's a series of fresh faces, actors that you may be familiar with but you haven't seen then a thousand times before, they're going to bring life to the characters. The producers very deliberately went toward actors from independent film because they bring with them something different, a different quality. Actress like Radha Mitchell, Debora Kara Unger, Tanya Allen, Laurie Holden and Alice Krige, it's much more exciting to see somebody who doesn't used to do this kind of movie, but the audience of this type of film love that. For the role of Rose, Radha Mitchell, needed somebody with that blend of vulnerability but strength and determination as well. We have to feel her fear but also appreciate when she stands up to all these terrifying moments.In fact, the producers spent lots of time finding the perfect Rose. In terms of the sensibility that Christophe Gang was having in this character, Rose is sophisticated and very vulnerable and Radha Mitchell has both quality, she has a freshness and energy and excitement and life, there's this original look to her, all of which are precisely what the producers needed for the central character to lead us through this horrific environment. The director is focused on female character with just females leading the story in a way, with exception of two male characters: Sean Bean and Kim Coates. Christophe Gans is almost exorcised the idea of femininity by polarising it with the male characters, and all the women are in this kind of fantasy nightmare.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Accurate adaptation,"I don't think that a video game has been adapted in such a manner before. It's as if you're watching the video game in front of your eyes. And although I only have played one Silent Hill, I know that they achieved to transport the game on your screen (theatre) literally!!But that is also the downfall of the movie (imo). It is very compelling in the beginning, but when it reaches a certain point (let's say the middle of the movie), the scares don't work anymore. The effects still remain great, but I'm just not feeling it. As a game that would work, because you're actively involved, but as a passive viewer, you get bored. So the best adaptation yet, shows us that there is more to the adaptation process, than filming a game ...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Finally, a good, accurate game/film crossover.","First off, the downsides: Some parts of the movie seemed a little drawn out, the film was two hours, and at certain times, you could feel that. It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying ""that was a stupid movie"". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the 'upsides': This movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were almost identical. If you've played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Game Movie Adaptation Yet!,"I'm not sure what the original comment leaver saw last night, but it certainly wasn't Silent Hill.I saw a critic screening last night, and must say I was highly impressed. As a fan of the games, and anything related to them, my faith has been firmly established in Gans and Avery, and I can only wish for sequels.The atmosphere was perfect, the acting was on point, the creatures were amazing, well, everything was amazing.The town itself looks just like the town we love, and it's almost like coming home again. You'll see what I mean when you finally get to see the film.Just be prepared for a disturbing, bloody (oh man, the blood), and genuinely creepy ride.I'd say more, but giving spoilers would be like slapping you in the face.Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Big, loud & dumb CGI horror fest","I didn't expect much in the way of storytelling or suspense in a film based on a video game, but this was an embarrassment. All the lurid horror clichés are on offer; ravens flying round the church, witch burning. I don't even know what I just saw. There's no story, just one mindless action sequence after another. Sure, the beginning is promising and the first half hour it still got my attention, but soon it becomes clear that no effort was made to draw characters who have any resemblance to human beings and pretty soon it all becomes an alarmingly senseless excuse for and endless string of computer generated gory effects.This is also a film that takes itself way too seriously, some in-joke reference could have made this slightly more bearable. We have undefinable creatures that are lurking in some underground tunnel complex, where for the last thirty years a coal fire is raging under the ground. At first I was intrigued - a little - but since it is absolutely impossible to grasp what these ""things"" are and no explanation is given, it becomes nothing more than a video-game side-show. The final scene in the church, where the whole cast suffers from some incredible over-acting, has some spectacular effects, I'll admit that, but eventually goes WAY over the top and takes so long, it soon becomes downright ridiculous. Going over the top can be fun, but not without humor.Former Tarantino video clerk-buddy Roger Avary penned this thing down and assembled some bad Canadian actors. He should be so lucky he got co-story credit for RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION, since he clears things for us here. He can't write, he's got no idea whatsoever that a motion picture has very little in common with a video game. You need to have actual human beings in a motion picture, or present some interesting visual ideas. We get neither.And the dialog...? I can't remember all the mumbo jumbo I've heard. The second half of the film is full of hysterical lines like;""The Truth is clear for those who see.""""We drew a line in the sand and said: Demon, do not cross!""And I thought THE VILLAGE was a new low in pseudo satanic reli-crab.Sean Bean was top-billed but he only has five minutes screen time with - again - mind-bogglingly awful dialog.Skip this big-budget overblown piece of junk.Camera Obscura --- 2/10",,Anonymous,Horror
5/10 for design and score,"So the positives:-they used Akira yamaoka's incredible score from the games
-designs are mostly scary and accurate to the gamesThe cons:-acting 😅-plot. Yes I know the game is convoluted but it could have been simplified without falling into cliche horror tropes. Silent hill isn't about the Salem witch trials. However, that seemed to be the biggest inspiration for this film's plot.-unnecessary changes from the game. When adapting a game into a film (a hard task it's own right), changes are bound to happen. However when those changes don't seem to improve the story in any meaningful way then we wonder why they exist at all. In the original game, Harry mason is looking for his adopted daughter. A father trying to find his daughter is compelling. Why did it have to be the mother instead? Why change the fathers name from Harry mason to Christopher Dasilva? Especially when the sequel establishes that he is in fact Harry mason? Also, of course pyramid head is legendary but he doesn't make sense being here or in the sequel. Pyramid head is a construct of james Sunderland's mind in SH2 and has nothing to do with Harry or Heather.Let's hope Gans understands these flaws and goes harder on SH 2.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure enjoyment for SIlent Hill fans and viewers with brains,"I have just read some bad reviews about this movie and marked them as ""not useful"", because ALL of them have one thing in common - all the reviewers which gave bad ratings didn’t have any idea of what are they dealing with - they haven’t understand the movie and story IN GENERAL. And how can a misunderstood opinion be useful?I'm a big fan of Silent Hill universe due to the rich depth and symbolism and music as well + due to mysterious-industrial-artistic look and scariness in general. I have played all the video games from this franchise and I must say, that the first part is my favourite. And this movie is based upon 1st and 3rd part of the game series.In movie we have absolutely brilliantly done visuals and cinematography, which are held so closely to the original. Looking at this makes me to confirm that the Cristophe is a true fan of the Silent Hill game and a very talented director! This is a combination that serves as a good salmiakki for me - I cannot imagine greater pleasure.I do find this movie to be a brilliant adaptation of amazingly brilliant video-game series under the same name, of course. In this movie all the key elements are kept true and alive. We do have multiple mirrored realities, we do have a brilliant story, which is like a puzzle itself, we do have some meaningful creatures (monsters) and we do have all the aesthetic values of the game franchise. Everything is done right. But it is not some kind of rip-off. We do have here some experimentation and interpretation from the movie crew. And even these off-roads are kept true to the aura and sense of Silent Hill. AND WE DO HAVE CREEPS AND SCARES AND THE TRUE SPIRIT OF SILENT HILL.But if all the key elements are kept here, why do some people gave (and will give) extremely bad ratings and reviews? I think that it’s because that they did not see the depth of the story, didn't see the symbolism of creatures and actions (in story) in the movie. But, if they did see some of these elements - they didn’t understand them.And you just cannot appreciate and enjoy the things, which you haven’t noticed or understand (with exceptions). So, if you do have negative opinion of this movie, I suggest you to open your mind, to be symbolism-tolerant, to run away from your stereotypes (it's OK that the main protagonist is a female - it doesn't affect the storyline) and to be open and able to think and accept the interpretations done by the Cristophe and writer, especially, if you are a fan of the Silent Hill games.Be open-minded and try to accept those few well-done innovations and turns, and explanations.Silent Hill is a form of art, which can be enjoyed at its best, when completely understood. And YOU MUST use your brain to achieve the complete understanding. Believe me - there are no holes or gaps in the story, there are plenty of hidden clues instead, given to you to create your own interpretation. This isn't a cheap Teen Slash where you get the story from 5 minutes. This is a puzzle, which may take multiple view-times to combine all the hidden clues and hints. And this is the spirit, transformed directly from game to movie. Excellent job!!!Masterpiece, which will make you to use your brain – if you have any!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror? No. Psychological triller? Yes. Oh yes.,"Horror? Try psychological triller and you might be closer to understanding why is it that I found Silent Hill such an amazing piece of work.With that in mind, the reason why Silent Hill worked for me was because it had a story to tell. Granted some of us are already familiar with the storyline and are frustrated with the pace of the film. Others may gripe at how much of a disappointment the movie was because of the lack of certain monsters, the lack of development in the characters they liked best, the lack of answers to puzzling questions, the fact that the storyline was too convoluted and confusing et cetera et cetera.Yet, the heart of the film lies mainly on one simple idea - Silent Hill is first and foremost, a physical manifestation of a child's mind that is shattered, tainted and shackled by an abuse so terrible that one is unable to articulate it into words. (Ever wondered why Silent Hill is called ""Silent"" Hill in the first place? If you think along the lines of language being an ineffective medium in the expression of ""truth"", *cha-ching*! You're right!)In this light, I cannot understand why so many people had a problem with the pacing of the movie because in the first place, such apparent ""meandering"" is necessary to the entire film. And why not? The inability for any one character to get to the heart of the problem is prevalent during the entire narrative framework of the film *No one* character dared to talk about it and those who sought the truth are met with an air of secrecy. The ""truth"" therefore, is oppressed by a *complete breakdown of words* and all that is left is to ""show"" and let the people ""experience"" what had happened themselves. (Such is the path that Rose must take because she ""chose"" to seek out the truth surrounding her daughter's psychological problem and since language fails in Silent Hill can the ""truth"" cannot be communicated through ""words"" it must be ""shown"".)The same rule applies to Christopher. He tried to uncover the ""truth"" but was thwarted by people who are reluctant to talk about the town. Everyone who had prior knowledge of the town was unable or unwilling to describe what happened because they 1) are suppressing their guilt 2) are afraid of opening up a can of worms that is best left forgotten. Even Rose and Cybil are faced with a group of people who were so adamant into seeing things in their point of view that they have ""blinded"" themselves to the atrocity of what has taken place in Silent Hill. (Notice how most of the monsters i.e. Nurses, Pyramid Head, Janitor, are in a state of blindness? Coincidence? I think not.)And still at the heart of all THAT, a child's horrifying story is desperately waiting to be told. The meanderings are not meant to be a flaw in the plot, in my opinion, but an attempt to show how the outside world tried to suppress and confine the deepest desire of a little girl - the desire for ""truth"" to be known. Therefore the ""truth"" cannot be ""told"" because words will ultimately fail in Silent Hill. It must be ""shown"". That was why Rose had to go through all the various stages of her journey to seek out the ""truth"". That was why it was crucial the narrative had to be mapped out thus and it reached its summit in the dramatic finale where the fanatics were reluctant to accept the ""spoken truth"" but was forced to accept it nevertheless through a physical manifestation of ""truth"" - the manifestation of their past deeds.Hence in my opinion, this film isn't about monsters, busty characters, bloodshed, storyline or whatever it is that one normally looks out for in a film of this genre. This film is about a little girl's story that is struggling to surface in a world dominated by a viciousness she could not comprehend but fall victim to nevertheless. Think about it. To be thoroughly abused in a world that you never fit in and cannot comprehend. And later to want to seek vengeance for the wrongs that had been done to you but are unable to articulate it into words because there is no one out there who understands or listens to you. The intense hatred due to the complete lack of control that one is forced into, the desire to achieve ""satisfaction"" at any cost and the obsession with ""vengence"" - now that's a scary thought for a little girl of 10 to have, wouldn't you say?So was it good? Heck yeah. And I'm going for another round of this when my next paycheque comes in.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Flawed, but atmospheric and full of great ideas","I first watched this movie when I hadn't yet heard of the terrible ratings by most critics, and when I finally did look up the ratings, I was dumbfounded for a moment. Yes, this is not a perfect movie, and if you hate logical inconsistencies or borderline incomprehensible character behavior, this one probably isn't for you.Well, what does it have going for it, then?For once, atmosphere. The visuals are amazing throughout, drawing us into the action and, in my case, making me forget to even think about whether the plot was making much sense. I first started questioning some of the movie's logic when I watched it for the third time.The second part of the atmosphere is the music. Almost all of the music was adapted from the video games, and I would argue some of the best atmosphere comes from the shots with no dialogue, where the pieces have our full attention.The second major thing it has going for it is the concept of the story and way it tackles questions like: What makes people evil?While the movie is certainly confusing (as has been argued by many reviewers), digging deeper into the movie and why certain things appear the way they do makes the movie richer and doesn't take away from it (an important feat in my opinion, especially when it comes to rewatchability) - however, this only goes for digging deeper into the concept, not so much the story we're presented, that sometimes feels too truthful to video game logic, even though the movie doesn't adapt the story of either of the.games.I recommend to give the movie a watch despite what critics have said and written about it. It's a movie I espect to polarize - if the atmosphere and the nexus of the plot manage to immerse you in a sufficient manner, you're most probably going to enjoy it and even go out of the movie with this wonderful feeling of having seen something special.If the atmosphere doesn't captivate you enough, if your thoughts get stuck in the plot more than in what's going on below the surface, you'll wonder what's going on at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A very surprising, dark and gruesome movie!","You have to approach any movie adaptation of a video game with extreme trepidation. Think of the other corkers we've all caught on TV in the past: Super Mario Bros., Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil. Stinkers, one and all. Doom was vapid, but at least got close to the source material.So what about Silent Hill? The movie opens with music lifted straight from the game itself - in fact, the entire movie contains original tracks from the game as well as some remixed score. Just as it was a fantastic and brooding background when playing the game, it works very effectively on screen.As for the film itself, the story is a composite of story elements from the first and second games, but the final act is a monstrous and highly original thirty minutes that kept me guessing (as well as being completely grossed out). Indeed, the violence is pretty gruesome.. clever mixtures of CGI and fully made-up monsters which really add to the foreboding atmosphere.At first, I felt nervous watching this.. not because of the visuals (which are absolutely SPOT ON.. I've never seen ANY movie adaptation that is this close to the source material.. all the comic book movies from the past few years still stray furiously).. but because of the weak opening. After I'd resigned myself to the fact that the movie was going to be disappointing, I was pleasantly surprised as soon as the main character Rose gets to Silent Hill itself. If you're a fan of the game, you won't be disappointed. If you're a horror hound, you'll love the creatures and the visuals. If you're expecting a deep movie about the relationship between estranged mother and daughter.. you're in the wrong theatre.Highly recommended. Best horror movie I've seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If You Do not Play the Game, Read the Excellent Explanation of ""TensersFloatingDisk"" in the Message Board","The little Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is a sleepwalker, who frequently speaks the name ""Silent Hill"" in her trances.

Excellent Mainstream Horror,"""Silent Hill"" is an excellent example of a computer game that has been adapted with great attention to detail by an obvious fan. The tone, the plot and even the musical score remain faithful to the game, which results in a visual world that instantly feels familiar. However, the same could be said for Uwe Boll's glorious computer game adaptations. The difference between ""Silent Hill"" and ""House Of The Dead"", for example, is this film's ability to stand alone without prior knowledge of the game.Christophe Gans begins his film with an ominous sequence that shows Rose frantically chase her sleepwalking daughter, Sharon, to the side of a cliff. Sharon wakes up and says ""Silent Hill"", the name of an abandoned town. Such is the simplicity of the film's premise - a mother decides to take her daughter to a town that she has mentioned in her sleep. This seemingly innocuous set-up belies the twists and turns that occur when Rose and Sharon finally arrive in Silent Hill. In fact, the film begins much like an Asian horror movie, deriving suspense from random creepy events and an ominous tone. ""Silent Hill"" works very well on this level, due to the stylish cinematography and creative art design.The first half of the film moves slowly enough for the audience to learn more about the characters and appreciate the depth of Rose's maternal instinct for Sharon. Australian actress, Radha Mitchell delivers her best performance since moving to Hollywood as Rose. There is something wonderfully ordinary about Radha, which in turn makes Rose sympathetic and credible, despite the incredible scenarios in which she finds herself. This part of the film also introduces Officer Cybil, played with flair by Laurie Holden. Cybil is initially suspicious of Rose but turns out to be her only ally in the world's least friendly town. The supporting cast is bursting with gifted character actors like Sean Bean, Alice Krige and Deborah Kara Unger but their roles are too small to make a significant impact on the film.""Silent Hill"" transforms from an eerie thriller into a fast-paced, supernatural horror movie when Rose loses Sharon to the Silent Hill locals. The second half of the film plays like a demented cross between ""Aliens"" and ""The Village"", only with more violence and gore. The segments, when the alarm sounds and the world literally turns to hell, contain some excellent special effects and editing. There are a couple of examples of poorly realised computer graphics but as a whole the visuals are stunning. The scene where Rose crawls past light sensitive drones in the basement is brilliant. The gore is surprisingly plentiful with victims being ripped apart and a mattress enacting a particularly painful revenge on one of the faithful.There is much for gore hounds and gamers to enjoy in ""Silent Hill"". The majority of the film holds up very well for casual viewers; however the ending is destined to leave some people scratching their heads in confusion. Christophe Gans has displayed enough originality and flair to announce himself as a talent to watch. Bring on the sequel!",,Anonymous,Horror
The atmosphere was great,"Dang, why aren't they making movies based on video games that I'm actually familiar with? Anyway, this really is one of the better video game movies, because it honestly does have really good atmosphere. I am at least familiar with some of the characters from the ""Silent Hill"" games, especially Pyramid Head. Oh come on, everyone's heard of Pyramid Head! So this happens to be the longest movie ever made based on a video game...until ""Ace Attorney"" came along. This film really was genuinely creepy at many times. Now, I think you did have to be a fan of the games to really enjoy it.I would recommend it to people who are. For people who aren't, it's just alright. I admit that the CGI is actually pretty bad at many times in this movie. Well, there are other shots that are just fine. I do kind of like the characters in this movie even if they're not that great. It actually gets confusing in the middle of the film. It's when all of these other people show up and the tone of the movie starts to change. Again, probably something from the games. It's hard to find a video game movie that would appear to fans outside the series. Still, a very nice try. **1/2",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Its good by game adaptation standards.,"Video games never seem to translate well to film, or most of the time anyway. Once in a blue moon you do get one that isn't a total stinker like the first Tomb Raider movie or Alien V.S predator, but even then they rarely turn out to be better than average. Silent Hill for these reasons is definitely one of the best game to film translations but that sadly, doesn't make it a great piece of cinema. Don't get me wrong its entertaining stuff, and a good Saturday or Friday night movie, but looking at the cast and crew involved along with the undeniable quality of the source material it's really a bit of a pity it isn't better. The Story follows Rose, who's daughter Sharon is sleepwalking and when she does she talks about a place called Silent Hill. Rose decides to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill in the hope that what is clearly disturbing her daughters mind can be resolved when she see's the place. The place itself is now a ghost town, abandoned for years it would seem, however when Rose and Sharon reach the outskirts of the town they have an accident that leaves both mother and daughter knocked out. When Rose wakes up Sharon is missing, and its up to her and Police officer Cybil to find the little girl, in a town where everything is far from what it seems. The high point of silent hill is undoubtedly its visual aspects. Director Christophe Gans has created a place both creepy and hauntingly beautiful, and the monsters that inhabit the town are some of the best I've seen on the silver screen in a good while. Screewriter Roger Avery can't replicate that success in his script however. Its wooden and far to long and at times the heavy script slows the film down horribly. Its admirable what Avery's tried to do, build a little more character and humanity into a genre that so often lacks it, but in the end he doesn't pull it of. The performances on the other hand are solid and believable. Rhada Mitchell makes a good fist of the leading role, and young Jodelle Ferland who has to play multiple parts as the story develops is a name to look out for in the future. Laurie Holden and Sean Bean aren't taxed by easy parts, though when it counts they get by just fine. Its also commendable that the film has gone the whole 9 yards and grasped an R rating. The source material requires the more adult and mature rating a Pg-13 certificate would have doubtless not been enough to coax up the required effects and mature tension.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent hill isn't a horror movie its a nightmare drama,"For everyone who has seen or is going to see or is thinking of seeing silent hill, do not go into it thinking ohhh its going to be a scary movie,,, because its not suppose to be. Its for intelligent drama based crowds who like good visuals, story line, acting, and mystery. This isn't doom and this isn't resident evil, this is a well written drama/mystery that happens to be very disturbing in its visual and story. People who have not played the game go see it with an open mind and not look at it as a video game movie because even without the game it could stand on its own as a great movie.

Avert your eyes children!,"Imagine if you will this situation: David Cronenberg, David Lynch, Dario Argento and Clive Barker all come together and do some bizarre sperm meld, they then fertilise with the egg of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and 9 months on a child is born. That child is brought up by a satanic cult. In then goes to film college and studies Russian expressionist cinema of the l940's and also Japanese and Italian horror. Then said child finds one of the dark lords home movies from the bowels of hell, he then brings it back to the surface and it disintegrates. Said child, now a young man had watched it while in the underworld though and decides to shoot his own version based of what he had seen. And there you have it Mr Christophe Gans born of fire and brimstone has re-created one of Satan's home movies, or at least that's what this film feels like. So critics naturally will hate this film because it's kind of warped and out there, and of course with the video game tag, they'd have made their mind up before even watching it. What many will fail to realise is that the Silent Hill games have a complex mythology, and some depth, it's not as Roger Ebert probably believes, something that the intellectually challenged will do, involving mindless hammering of buttons and blowing things up. Games have become quite intricate now, with some very filmic. Silent Hill was always a very filmic game and as such fans will appreciate this the most, while horror fans too will love the downright warped gruesomeness of this film. I'm not a big gamer and never really played SH much, but it's one I wanted to.In some ways the fact that critics will generally hate this, makes it better for the genre fans the film is aiming for, because it means it's gone all out and hasn't held back. True to Gans' word he's made the film look just like the game and this film has an incredible attention to detail. The world of Silent hill has three dimensions, the real, the ghostly quiet covered in sooty fog, and the hellish version overcome by rank and rust and inhabited by evil creatures. It's at the start of the film that leads us into this strange world. Rose Da Silva's adopted daughter Sharon is ill, and suffers episodes of sleepwalking. The film open's with parental horror 101, with Rose and husband Christopher desperately searching in the darkness of their back yard for their daughter. Eventually she is found standing on a cliff edge about to jump, but is saved just in time. The young girl was adopted from an orphanage just outside of Silent Hill, and dreams of this place regularly, feeling inexorably drawn to it. Rose against her hubby's wishes takes Sharon for a kind of therapeutic walkabout. That's when the fun starts and when Gan's summons his memory of Satan's home movie.While some critics have labelled the films plot nonsensical it's all pretty clear, in fact the few fuddys who had seen it before I went to view it myself have over-hyped the convolution and in the end I was expecting some Lynchian level of wha!? But no where close. Although there is plenty of Lynch coursing through this film, but mainly Cronenberg and Argento. If coming out the cinema feeling as if you've watched something you shouldn't have morally, and feeling like your eyes and ears have been abused by evil, then your gonna love this film. It seems some people went into this film intent not to listen, although in agreement the film is too long and some dialogue is whiffy.Gans first and foremost does a great job. The film looks stunning. It's crisply shot and there's all range of tracking, crane, dolly shots that make the film feel fluid. Some of the shots are downright superb. Following the much enjoyed Crying Freeman and Brotherhood of the Wolf, with their beautifully shot antitheses to most mindless Hollywood action films, Gans will feel the critical burn for the first time with his first two films on the most part receiving positive reviews. However I think on this occasion the fans vote will be what matters. Similarly Dan Laustsen once again combines with Gan's to make something gorgeous but similarly disturbing and creepy. While the music comes from Akira Yamoaka who did it for the games. The music works superbly in this film and doesn't feel like a generic and boring horror score.The cast are decent. Radha Mitchell is good as Rose, desperately searching for her daughter and she gives the movie a bit of heart. Elsewhere Laurie Holden is excellent as tough female cop Cybill. Also good support is added by a demented Alice Krige, and Kim Coates. Out of place somewhat is Sean Bean as Christopher. His character was certainly needed but still felt tacked in. The initial script didn't have him in and he was added at the studio's behest. Trouble is what could have been a 90 minute film is now a two hour film because of this, and while we needed that extra dimension and there were some interesting moments (such as Rose and Chris occupying the area in different dimensions and not seeing each other). Bean too gives his worst performance which is a shame cause he's always so reliable, but his American accent more than grates.Overall though this is one of those films you need a bath and a prayer after watching. It's unique, but mostly won't be appreciated for being so, and it's plain creepy. My brother wants the much touted Nightmare on Elm Street remake to be done by Gans as he has done this film, with such a big scope and so damn out there and it would be great to see, rather than doing a plain old slasher re-make not nearly as good. ***1/2",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fans of the game will enjoy this film!,"Fans of the game will enjoy this film. Critics should be impressed with the set design, effects and cinematography; but I'm afraid most of them will miss the boat entirely. As far as a game to film translation, this is one of the best ever made.There are scenes in the film that are direct recreations from the game. Sounds, music, colors and even meticulous set design that pays homage to the game series. In as far as a horror film, there were scenes in this movie that are incomparable. Really disturbing, solid moments of horror.Pyramid Head is this decade's Pinhead. A new cultural icon to be feared, and loved.Good movie. Keep an open mind, and enjoy.

Silent Hill follows in the footsteps of its source material,"This is simultaneously a good and bad thing. The atmosphere is there in full force. It is pretty amazing how well they captured it, and it is VERY, VERY creepifying. It definitely sucks you in, and dammit you want more. The acting is capably done. (Well, of course, it has its share of cheese, but what can you say) The effects are awesome. It is definitely creepy. Seriously, for the first hour and a half, you are on the edge of your seat, eyes glued to the screen, but then...The story IS different from the game, but it's just about as confusing, and will probably leave you scratching your head. The ending, while not entirely disastrous, is definitely not satisfying. It's just....weird. It'll definitely end with you wanting more. And this is probably the fault of the execs, but right before the final climax, they just forcefeed you the backstory that you SHOULD have figured out yourself by now. We are not that dumb. Please stop doing that. Compared to the rest of the movie, the last 30 minutes SUCK royally. It's like the games, they built up this world, and this story, and they have no idea what to do with the end, but unlike the games, the movie can only have one ending.

Not bad at all!,"I must admit, I did enjoy this film, it is refreshing to see a great video game being adapted so well on the big screen. The movie does have it's flaws just like any other, but it is none the less a good film. Very enjoyable. And a great addition to the horror genre (psychological horror), we were needing a good horror film for a long time. Good acting, well shot, great music (basically music from the games soundtracks, aside for a few additions) and disturbing atmosphere (which is a good thing!). All in all, I loved this film, and I think it is a movie anyone can enjoy, whether they have played the games or not, but, I think playing the games will make it far more enjoyable and easier to understand.

Fans of the Game will Be Pleased,"True disciples of the Silent Hill video game revolution will gleefully immerse themselves in the film and it's haunting visuals, and perhaps come away with better understanding of a plot which I felt was muddied by the horrific creepiness of gameplay. After reading Roger Ebert's review of Silent Hill, the film, I'm convinced that people who are not gamers may not get it.There's been a rash of movie releases taken from popular video games, like the Resident Evil series and House of the Dead. House of the Dead, the movie, is as boring as the first person shooter on your console at home. Resident Evil was much more entertaining, turning the game into a less creepy action film. Silent Hill is the perfect combination of gore and creepiness and stays true to the game, down to some of the most horrific creatures I've ever attempted to kill on PlayStation2. Problem is, some of their creepiness is lost on the movie because movie goers won't get the same rush gamers do in the midst of battling deformed nurses or giant, musclebound creatures with big machetes.Silent Hill's dialogue and the reaction and action of the actors in the film was as benign and unbelievable as the characters in the games. This is something the producers could have managed to beef up to make the film more terrifying and believable. While trying to stay true to the game, the film took the very element an interactive game usually lacks-actor believability- and did little to enhance it. Silent Hill, the movie, would have received a higher rating for me if the actors were allowed to show as much horror and disbelief as a gamer gets when they play the game.If you're a fan of horror, you have to see this movie. The effects and the insane plot are enough to keep your interest. But to truly appreciate the film, I think you should play the games first. I swear, I couldn't play them alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"WOW, I mean W O W!!!","Agree 100% with agentmatheus: This is, hands down, the best VG adaption bar none! Seriously, it truly is like you are living the game. Granted, several characters have been changed, but that's to be expected. (Having a woman as the main protagonist, ensure's the main character is more vulnerable, than if it were a man). The set-pieces with the creatures are even more disturbing than their VG counterparts - I kid you not! The production design is truly superb and you get the feeling that Silent Hill really does exist.If I had to nitpick, it would be that they didn't include any puzzle elements in the film, as per the game; it could have been cool to have Rose solving some mad brainteaser, but you can fully understand that they didn't include this sort of thing (well, apart from her memorizing the hospital floor-layout), otherwise it could have slowed down the whole pace of the film.I was so skeptical about this movie, as traditionally, Game-To-Movie adaptations are, let's face it, crap! - But they have completely pulled it off, and I await a second installment with heavily baited breath.Again, it really is the best horror movie in years! HIGHLY recommended.Check this film out as soon as you can.Craig",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The makings of something great, but a bit undercooked","I wanted to like this a lot more than I actually did. It had so much potential to be epic but ended up falling kind of short for me. Now let me preface this with the fact that I know absolutely nothing about this video game, or video games in general. With that being said, as far as movie format goes, this had some detrimental areas where it was lacking.From the very beginning it felt fast paced, a little confusing, and the passage of time/thru line was all over the place. There is the obvious ""mom looking for daughter"" but beyond that... what the heck happened? What was this about? The plot was seriously under developed and if they had beefed it up and taken their time with the intricacies and the engaging nature of it, it could have been great... because it had the foundation for it.Another thing that was under developed was that script. Good lord... it was... not great. So the acting in turn was not amazing, but what did they have to work with. There were many moments that felt silly/ took me out of the moment because of the script or the acting. There was absolutely no character development at all. I didn't know, care, or relate to any one character witch lessens the intrigue and engagement. I don't know how you can have a movie with a run time of two hours and there is little to no development throughout.There was definitely some solid creep factor and cool aspects to this. There were quite a few creative and innovative monsters, deaths and scenery. CGI was shotty but it was also 17 years ago... and despite the kind of perpetual confusion and lack of development and plot progression... I was entertained. It was not unsuccessful, I just think it had the makings of something SUPER cool but didn't quite hit the mark. I give this a reluctant 6 because there were aspects that I really did like but I honestly feel like it is more of a 5. Would still recommend, just not fervently.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Video Game/Movie crossover,"Someone said worst movie ever- dude- ever see UltraViolet or Scary movie? Please easily those are the worst movies that should NEVER have been made.However. this movie was excellent. I have a feeling the person who gave this movie one star was someone who did not play the video game, maybe even did not realize it was based on a video game. I can see how this movie could present a problem to those who are non-gamers. However Most of my friends never played the game either, and they still enjoyed the movie very much.I wasn't as disturbed by the changing of the characters as I thought I'd be. (Harry Mason to Rose for Example.) I totally understand how Harry wouldn't cross over well. while he was a cool character (From a girl perspective) he was kind of a wuss. lol.the actors they picked to portray the characters were superb. they did a very good job portraying the intensity, the scary and sometimes disturbing nature of the movie.I saw a sneak peek where most of the movie goers did a lot of gasping and clutching of their friends or dates, covering of eyes... it was a pretty creepy film, and the only horror movie that actually got my pulse to race. Normally I hate horror movies because they're more ridiculous than scary.but this movie was scary, well acting, well written, and I loved the monsters. It was much more realistic to use people rather than complete CGI characters. it made it more creepy. I liked that touch. Definitely proves that old school can be more scary than technology. Although they don't completely ignore the modern day novelties. Its a perfect combination of both.Pretty much- I miss Harry- I can understand why they did away with him (I'm glad it wasn't for a stupid reason like them wanting a tough cigar smoking buff man chick thinking that's ""P.C."") but the character changes work, the actors in their parts work, the script works, its creepy, its scary, its a great movie. Some who have not played or haven't heard of the Silent hill games may not get it... but for the most part, I think most should enjoy this movie, gamers and non-gamers alike. This has to be one of my favorite movies this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good film with some faults. Worth it.,"I must agree with the previous comment. The movie does a good job in most areas and can stand on its own. Knowing it was based on a game may help it with younger audiences but I believe older audiences who have never heard about the game will also enjoy the film. The film itself was a bit long but that seems to be alright since the movie gets better in the latter half.The acting does get a little worn by the middle of the movie and one can see very cliché and cheesy lines filled with no emotion by the main character. This was about the time I thought to myself 'oh no..it's going to be a bad movie..' I am happy to say however, that the movie did get a lot better towards the middle and end. I recommend it to anyone seeking a drama and not so much a scary movie. Although it has its scary parts it does a better job of giving great visuals and creating a sense of mystery more than anything. Do Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
pointless and poorly developed,"I don't know about what are thinking creators of game adaptations. Let's just say that the best game adaptation in my opinion is Resident Evil and this film, is only a passable, brainless entertainment. It seems that creators of films based on video games have still no clue that a movie is completely different type of medium than video game. As a result, they produce either films so closely related to video games that unbearable or insipid movies which have almost nothing in common with the game (Doom), which probably stems from ignorance of adapted game. Silent Hill belongs to the first category. I have no idea what screenwriter has provided for the film as it has practically no plot. Director Christopher Gans uses only some plot points which are so illogical even for the horror flick about supernatural phenomena. At first, why does Rose DaSilva bring her child to Silent Hill? Why does policeman chase her? ... The film doesn't give any answers and, in addition, ""the story"" is so poorly developed that even actors, who plays usually well, do badly here. In consequence, the film becomes a dull and unbearable experience. The facts that Silent Hill town is very atmospheric as well as both set design and special effects are good unfortunately don't save this pointless pic. What also makes bad impression is quite confusing ending which buries the film even more. All in all, you had better play once again the same game instead of watching this trashy movie. Don't trust promising trailer.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best video game adaptation,"Now I know that a lot of people don't like this movie, but overall when compared to other video game based films (I.E. In The Dark, Doom, Bloodrayne) this one can easily be seen as above the norm. Its original because unlike basic horror movies it presents an eerie feel that isn't based on dumb moments that attempt to make you jump. Instead it focuses on the the disturbing, like the Silent Hill games. The acting in this movie was pretty exceptional for the talent they had, although at some times the constant screaming by Rose gets annoying. Seeing a bit more of the fighting in the movie would have been good, considering that in the games you get to beat the creatures with lead pipes and shoot them with a variety of weaponry. Overall, however, I think that the movie provides a good introduction into the world of Silent Hill and should be seen by every moviegoer interested in a new type horror experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
kinky boots,"firstly lets establish that this is one hell of a chick flick, with a huge majority of the movie being played by femalesin all seriousness, at times there is some incredible sexual tension going on between the two female leads: Radha Mitchell and Laurie Holden. you'd have to feel this movie will be popular within the lesbian communityand for us fellas? what a treat... one blond in knee high leather boots with a knife tucked inside, and another dressed in a skin tight police woman's uniform and a shiny gun and utility belt!!! just who would come out on top in a mud wrestle between these two lovely ladies?? (slobber)back to the film(!).. far better than any other game to movie translation that i've seen yet. it took me awhile to actually realise it was based on the game (duh) since the movie had serious actors in it, and was creatively presented both visually and aurallylots of similarities in feel (look and sound) between this and the recent remake of 'the hills have eyes'. in the latter half of the movie some unnecessary 'gamey-fied' scenes including levels, maps and platform style jumps and swingsoverall though very eerie with some imaginative and wild explosions of gore. my wife hated it (especially as a extra 1st anniversary treat), i was pleasantly entertained though (especially by the aforementioned blondes!!...)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the best game-to-film adaptation yet,"i am a huge fan of the Silent Hill series and as such was anticipating the release of the movie; and here is my opinion.the look of the games has been captured beautifully. all credit to Gans and his crew for actually taking the time to capture the tone and feel of the games. When Rose entered the 'alternate' Silent Hill for the first time i grinned like a Cheshire cat because it was like being in one of the games. All the little details of the games are there; from the way the monsters cause static on the radios (this isn't consistent however), to the fog that continually shrouds the town (the falling ash was a particularly nice touch i thought) and the way the monsters react to torchlight - such as in a textbook scene involving the faceless nurses - all create a world fans of the games will feel right at home in.The monsters too were spot on. Not only did they look cool but they were also genuinely unnerving. Memories of the first monster you meet in Hill 2 came flooding back to me! They even have that gooey/silvery sheen to them. The scene in the hospital with the army of faceless nurses was incredible. Again, it was as though we were in the game. I couldn't help but let out a cheer when Pyramid Head first makes his appearance because he looks perfect. A much better job then the appalling Nemesis attempt in Resi 2: Apocalypse. The only let down is that he appears three times then vanishes; however take my word you won't forget him.The music is also excellent. Fans will spot the theme from the original game as well as the Hill 3 song that plays over the credits. The music creates a genuinely foreboding and, sometimes, melancholic atmosphere. This was probably helped by the inclusion of the Silent Hill music team who worked on the games; so once again well done to Gans and co. for paying attention to the source material and those who created it.There is some great camera work too. Certain camera angles are reminiscent of those used in the games while others, especially those used during the 'alternate' scenes, are quite unsettling. Silent Hill feels huge and the protagonist so much smaller.The characters and actors however are my main problem. First off there are too many of them. Every so often the action will cut away from that of Rose and Cybill to focus on the rather pointless characters of Sean Bean and Kim Coates. They are not needed and add little to the story. I say this because Silent Hill the setting is so well created that i didn't want to leave it. However there is a good section with Chris (Bean) and Rose in the school. Also the film loses it's edge a little with the introduction of the citizens. By all means Silent Hill has it's odd citizen to pass on some cryptic message or information, but by having a whole army of townspeople the sense of isolation and of being alone is somewhat lost. The citizens are a cult as per most Hill story lines and are therefore integral but maybe there could have been less of them.It was an interesting move to exchange a male lead for a female one but it works well. In a similar way to Alice in the first Resi film, Rose is a new character in a familiar setting. It allows for some carte blanche with the storyline of the game and also keeps things fresh a part of the Hill world. Radha Mitchell does a good job even if in the middle of the film she seems a bit wooden. Laurie Holden as Cybil does a superb job. She looks like Cybil and ultimately kicks arse. She plays the character in a really tough manner which again leads me to wonder why Bean's character was needed. I am a Sean Bean fan but his performance was uncomfortable because he attempts an (embarassing) American accent throughout the film. Sean Bean is one of these actors who does not need to adapt his accent in a film! (see Sean Connery or Brian Cox also).So why 7 then? The film looks great, sounds great and feels great. The only real let down is the sheer volume of characters which towards the end hamper the film's edge. Plus at times the acting can be a bit wooden. However as a game-to-film conversion it has set a new standard. Directors and studios can no longer slap a gaming name on a sub-par movie; they have to understand and appreciate the detail and character. Go see it! I know i will again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A patient, intelligent, atmospheric horror film that doesn't go for cheap scares","I have been a fan of the first game since it came out. As with most video game adaptations, I expected this to be a piece of sh#@. Instead, I got an atmospheric, haunting thriller that slowly creeps into you and doesn't let go.True, the game was scarier. Way scarier. And there was something appealing about the vagueness of the story - the fact that it was never fully explained. And some parts (especially in the third act) could have been edited down and made more intense. And I wasn't fully convinced by Radha Mitchell's acting. But seriously, folks, this goes above and beyond your standard fare horror flick.Speaking visually, the film is breath-taking. Some of the best conceptual designs I've ever seen. The creature's design and effects are top notch. Pay attention to one very creepy scene that revolves around a flash-light. It is brilliant.The score is perfect. Disturbing and melancholy at the same time, just like the themes the movie explores. It has depth and its meanings are relevant to our current existence.One thing I wanted to see used more was the radio static that signifies when a monster is approaching. That was to me one of the scariest elements of the game, since you knew the monster is close, and yet you couldn't see it. Also, with such a tightly woven, dense atmosphere, some boo moments could have been super scary, although the movie doesn't use them. That is a plus and a minus. The result is more sophisticated, refined, working more on psychological horror rather than shock value. On the other hand, on a superficial level, the film is not as scary as it could have been.To conclude, a very pleasant surprise. Hopefully this is not the last we've seen of Silent Hill.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

If Lewis Caroll ever came back as a zombie, this is what he would make! . There are some bland moments, (in some scenes I just wanted another monster to jump out and start tearing people apart), but since the movie is 2 hours long, there are more demons than dullness.

A video game adaptation worth another look,Although I have never played the actual game I am aware of its story and how this film decided to take another route. It borrows many elements & ideas from not just the first game but it's first couple sequels as well & blends in with the director's own ideas. The end result in my opinion I think works rather well both telling a solid story that doesn't hold your hand while also nailing the look and feel of its source material. I've seen many claim they couldn't understand much of the story but I personally think it explains everything pretty well. There are a couple exposition dumps & maybe at times some of the elements from the video games can feel disjointed but nothing feels out of place or forced in. Especially have to give the director and production crew props for the set design and visual effects that really brings to life the disturbing imagery of the games. There are many effective sequences especially one involving creepy nurses & there's no cheap jump scares to be found.The only issue for me with the film are the boring and slow paced scenes with the husband character. It feels like they just added these scenes with him cuz the movie didn't have enough males but you could honestly cut all these out and it wouldn't effect the movie any. Other than that Silent Hill was definitely a milestone for video game adaptations especially from around that time. Even today you don't see many get as much effort put into them as this one did.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A beautiful, deep, and thought provoking story that will remain in your mind for a long time.","Silent Hill is about a woman named Rose (Radha Mitchell) who loses her daughter in the deserted town of Silent Hill. Slowly as the movie progresses Rose learns the truth behind the town and the reason's for its nightmarish qualities.First I will focus on the negative points of the film. The acting of some was sub-par and the script was terrible. Some of it made me cringe because of the absurdity of it. However, when pitted against the rest of the film these few flaws aren't really that big of a deal.The film had quite a few redeeming qualities. The first half an hour or so blew me away. The visual imagery was stunning, the atmosphere was outstanding leaving me with an immense feeling of dread and hopelessness. The only thing that I would have preferred would be having more of this ""dark"" version of Silent Hill.Many critics criticize the story claiming that it is confusing and that they can't understand it. To me, that is one of the qualities that separates this film from many other cookie-cutter films that come out now-a-days. Rather than serving you the plot on a silver platter, Silent Hill gives you the clues and expects you to put it together. The story really isn't all that confusing if you pay attention.The ending is another part of the movie that is heavily criticized as lacking closure and confusing. I must agree that the ending was vague, but I also believe that it was left vague intentionally. The ending, like much of the film, was left for the viewer to interpret. Many people are so used to films spoon-feeding you everything that they can't even begin to imagine having to use their imagination for once. And for those who claim that you need to play the game to understand the movie, that isn't necessarily true. In fact, in comparison the games are much harder to understand than the film.The film is filled with many religions symbols and themes such as the holy trinity, light and dark, mother and child, and others that are easily overlooked by those who don't pay attention. The creatures themselves are symbolic to the feelings of Alessa.The film is more disturbing than scary, and it moves at a slower pace than most films. Do not expect this film to feed you the plot, be prepared to think for yourself and piece the clues together. You are given the pieces, now all you have to do is finish the puzzle.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overrated by moviegoers, underrated by critics","Critiques of this movie are all over the board, but most are polarized: Critics hate it, moviegoers love it. The reception probably suits it. The fact is that the movie has ups and downs, and it happens that the ups are very good and the downs are laughably bad.The bad news: The story and dialogue are insufferable. The director and writer claim to have met the challenge of translating an already vague video game plot so that non-gamers can understand it. They failed miserably. The movie's storyline is even less coherent than the game's. The biggest mistake is probably that after two hours of confusion, the movie comes to a full stop and the audience is forced to sit through a catch up scene in which the entire story is laid out all at once. The violence is entertaining, but seems over the top and out of place considering the Silent Hill games are always more subtly eerie than overtly gruesome. Overall the acting is bad; the lines are B movie material; Sean Bean's role in the movie is pointless and distracting; and although the plot centers around an evangelical Christian-like cult of holier-than-thou witch hunters, the movie wastes its opportunity to tap into Americans' current fears of religious fundamentalism or to make any meaningful social commentary.The good news: The movie looks fantastic. Few people want to sit through a movie whose only merit is its special effects, but in Silent Hill's case the effects, environments and creatures are so excellent and intriguing they become the movie and truly overshadow its weaknesses. The movie is at its best when nobody is talking, when we simply follow the lead character Rose as she wanders aimlessly through an endless nightmare, like Alice in a dark and twisted version of Wonderland. As stated above the social commentary falls flat, but if you look hard enough, there are some nice underlying themes centered on both the dangers of blind faith, and of giving in to revenge. The story feels like it would have had more promise in the hands of another writer, and perhaps could be elaborated on in a sequel. The director is up to the challenge of being faithful to the look and feel of the game in every detail, right down to the perfect recreation of scenes and camera angles from the games.Some critics have compared Silent Hill to an Uwe Boll film, and that is beyond unfair. This movie is not great, it isn't the amazingly successful video game adaption fan boys have been wishing for; but nor is it terrible by any means. In short, the director and art department deserve medals, while the writer deserves to meet his doom at the hands of a vengeful Pyramid Head. Depending on whether you can forgive a terrible script in favor of marveling at some truly amazing visuals, you may either love this movie or hate it - or join the tiny, elite, third group of moviegoers who recognize the movie has strengths and weaknesses that make it average out to, well, average.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
scary stuff!!,"I have played the game and can not recall the mum looking for her daughter- It was always James in search of his daughter, so myself and my girlfriend came to the strange conclusion that it was perhaps some sort of prequel??At the same time we found the film to be a bit of a mind bender and you really have to concentrate to keep up with the story, there will be times when you recognise scenes from the game and even the camera angles are reminiscent to the game itself, which caused some confusion and lead us to the prequel theory but all in all an enjoyable movie. The film has plenty of white knuckle moments and also that creepy feeling that something is behind you! :s Yet it still manages to keep a good script. The sound effects were amazing and will freak you out just as much as when you were playing the game.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazingly Emotional,"This movie was amazing. Beginning to end it had me drawn in. This movie  breaks the rules and thinks outside the box...and gets away with it.  Maybe not a blockbuster, but definitely a cult classic :D To other  reviewers: Please, do a little research before you cut the movie off at  the knees. 1st off they're not Christian fanatics, they're another  cult. Secondly, not everything is movies are based on real things.  Certain things can be completely fictional. The movie was made to have  that dream/nightmare feel. It was an amazing movie if you actually paid  attention to it, and I'm sorry if your feeble mind cannot comprehend  what is going on. As for the part where they tell you the back-story,  it had nothing to do with anyone not knowing what was going on. Konami  as well as Sony loved it so much they didn't cut anything. That is why  the movie is so long. Not to mention this is a European FILM!!!!  Japanese horror, European writers and actors with few Americans (yeah  some of the actors were but they don't write the film). The movie is  supposed to make you sit back and go ""what the ****??"" when things  randomly happen...that's what Silent Hill is all about. This isn't your  run-of-the-mill horror ""horny teen"" slasher film (which unfortunately  is what's most popular in America). If you can, go to a matinée where  you can watch it without all of the people who think they're in MST3k  and all of the people who feel the need to talk to the screen. The  story is deep, really deep. The ending is tragic. And if you still  don't get it, it doesn't mean the movie sucked...it just means you  don't get it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insert clever title here,"Attention all: please welcome video game adaptation number 32, Silent Hill. Here we have a lovely specimen, a film that actually stands out from the pack.Our main character is Rose, the mother of an adopted little girl named Sharon. Sadly, little Sharon has been acting weird thanks to some high-risk sleep walking. Worse, she keeps mumbling about a mysterious town called Silent Hill.Rose decides the best solution to cure her daughter is to bring her to Silent Hill and discover exactly what is going on. Of course her husband does not approve, but it doesn't matter since there isn't much time to reflect on the situation at all.Silent Hill delves right into the action.In fact, within 10 minutes Rose is already stranded at the mysterious Silent Hill.While it's nice to not have to wade through pointless exposition that exists only to give the illusion of an actual story, there is no time to bond with the characters at all.The problem is not so much that we need a half hour of superfluous back story, but that too little time is focused on the main characters as people merely trying to live their lives.Thus, they become artificial cardboard cutouts. There is never a sense of panic or fear.As strange and sinister as Silent Hill can be, it's never genuinely scary because there is never any real connection to a human figure.The acting doesn't help much, either, with Sean Bean phoning in his performance as the worried dad and Jodelle Ferland doing her best ""creepy girl from The Ring"" impression. Lead actress Radha Mitchell plays a convincing mother, though her entire performance is fairly one note.However, one thing about Silent Hill stands out in an extraordinary way.Simply put, French director Christophe Gans knows how to sculpt moving images.Much like his last film, the stylish but complex The Brotherhood of the Wolf, the assorted mix of odd environments and crazed fiends fill a dark void that is anything but empty.With a surrealist look reminiscent of earlier European horror, Silent Hill is able to stretch out from the screen and into the mind.Now, it is absolutely true that great visuals cannot make a bad movie great.To be fair, horror films are hardly heralded for brilliant character development or complex stories. Nevertheless, this does not mean that these elements are useless.And no doubt, if Silent Hill had a stronger script it could truly have been a brilliant little film.Thankfully these flaws don't sink the entire production. Even as the vague plot lurches to its halfway satisfactory climax, it is hard to turn away.This is a movie for the fans, and it includes many horror movie musts. There are especially scenes of great carnage, including a gruesome finale and the untimely demise of one character whose clothes are torn off in one fell swoop, followed by their skin.Yet, Silent Hill is more than a pointless gore fest.Although a level of realism is purposely lost, something distinctive is always waiting to echo from the darkness. A curiosity as to what could be around the next corner keeps boredom at bay.Admittedly, though, the ending is weak.First we have the wonderful ""Harry Potter"" monologue where most of the story is summarized in a short spouting of clunky dialogue. Then there is the obligatory ambiguous finale that is not so much clever as it is predictable and disappointing.In some ways, the problems with the plot are because Silent Hill is such a faithful and direct adaptation of its source material. Many videogames are very clearly influenced by films, and what might be original in one medium becomes tired and overused in another.Still, Silent Hill is an interesting journey that feels dredged up straight from a nightmare.Gans will not convert nonbelievers to the world of horror, but for those who have played the game or seek something unusual, there is quite a bit to appreciate here.Critic's Conclusion: It is probably the best video game to film adaptation so far (not that this is saying much), and despite inherent flaws with basic concepts of story and characters, Silent Hill compels attention.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The best video-game adaptation, ever!  You'll love it!","I have been a long-time fan of the Silent Hill video games and I waited for this film for more than a year. And I must say, it was worth the wait! For those who are fans of the video games, you are going to LOVE this film! I personally guarantee it. The atmosphere was dead on, the acting was great, the plot is damn-close to the video game, and the music is straight out of the video game.But, this is not just a video-game adaptation for those of you who are not familiar with the video games. It is also a great film on it's own for the general audience. In the early points of the film, the movie is in video-game mode which later on moves to film mode. The movie points out everything that was taken from the video game in the early parts of the movie, but once the movie goes further along, it's all about the plot, the performances, and the outcome of the film.Trust me! You are going to love what Chris Gans and Roger Avary have done here! It is incredible work and I wouldn't exchange it for anything else! 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I CANNOT BELIEVE people are gushing over this pile,"The Silent Hill movie is getting a lot of 9's and 10's from reviewers on this site. I'm not sure why.I am a fan of the games. A *HUGE* fan. A huge, huge, huge, huge fan. But I was VERY disappointed with the movie.Yes, there were some good things in the movie. There were some excellent ISOLATED SCENES. There were good visuals HERE AND THERE. The soundtrack was USUALLY good. SOME OF THE ACTORS did well. I'll admit all of that.But.The other 75% of the movie was lacking. I'm not sure why people are saying the movie was ""faithful to the games"" when the plot line was completely INCOMPATIBLE with the one in the games. Some characters were the different, and some characters were the same but the events surrounding them were different. But either way, it just didn't match up to the well-established story we know and love.There were also a lot of moments where the atmosphere was not at all like what the games give us! The games are about loneliness, and isolation. In the games, there are never more than three people (or monsters) in a room at once. No, that's not because of technological limitations -- it's because the designers deliberately planned it that way. The movie, on the other hand, has several crowd scenes. In case you missed it, I'll repeat that -- CROWD SCENES. IN SILENT HILL. What??? Silent Hill is not supposed to be a place where you have a room with twenty people in it. Nor it is a place where you have a hallway with twenty monsters in it. That's ridiculous. It ruins the whole effect.And speaking of ""ruining the effect,"" let's talk about how often this movie has us LEAVE Silent Hill. The games remove us from the setting SOMETIMES, and VERY SLIGHTLY. The movie, on the other hand, removes us from it FREQUENTLY, and VERY SEVERELY. Right after a creepy scene in the foggy snow, it will suddenly cut to a screen full of bright green trees and blue sky -- two things that have NO PLACE in a Silent Hill movie.Like I said, the movie did a lot of things right. But not nearly enough to carry the weight of the entire movie. I found myself shaking my head and sighing JUST AS OFTEN as I found myself impressed, if not more so. It does do a lot to make fans of the series happy, but it also does quite a lot to make them furious. The bottom line is, the Silent Hill series is something I love and feel protective over, and when people sully its good name I feel offended. Five stars out of ten.",,Anonymous,Horror
It's not the best movie but it is GOOD.,"Silent Hill (SH) is based on the Silent Hill game series (Konami) on various gaming consoles. This movie surely brings out the life out of the deadly scenarios in the Silent Hill games. The visuals and effects are really good, especially the transition from the real world into the alternate world of darkness...hell. The monsters were realistic and the most scary thing there is the pyramid guy with the cleaver. It's really similar to the game. They say it is more of Silent Hill 3, I do not know because I was only able to play SH2 and watch my brother play SH1. I also understood the story better by watching the movie. It is truly a must see for gamers. As for non-gamers, they can still indulge themselves with the thrill, suspense, and horror brought about by the realization of Silent Hill through its movie version. One word for Silent Hill: creepy...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
THIS is Silent Hill.,"It's a step up from the other video game adaptations but still missing something...It captures the essence of Silent Hill perfectly. Needless to say, this movie is a visual treat. The different dimensions are produced with amazing detail. The foggy world excels in creating a sense of isolation and building up the Silent Hill atmosphere. The hellish world is composed of harsh set pieces of grizzly imagery and decaying, rusted environments, creating a sense of chaos over order. The unimaginable creatures that haunt the world are ultimately disturbing, yet have their own charm that makes the audience NOT want to look away from them. The film gives more of a disturbing, skin-crawling sensation through imagery and sound rather than full-on heart pounding scares. It has its moments though. More frantic scares would have been welcome, however.Most of the acting is decent and, at least, believable. Being more than just a horror movie, more of a nightmarish drama, there's much emphasis on the characters. It's a mixed result; some parts are much better than others. The Sean Bean side story deepens the mystery about the town itself but takes the audience away from the atmosphere and Mitchell's main storyline. Overall, it sets up an artistic contrast and not much else. It is just such a shame that Avery's script is not really as dynamic as I thought it could have been. The characters were not as fleshed out as much or presented as realistically as I would have expected from a Silent Hill adaptation. Most remain a mysteryAs for the story, the movie asks a lot more questions than it answers, leaving much to the imagination by simple suggestion. Even with the considerable chunk of information that comes close to the end of the film, much is left unknown. Unless you have knowledge of the games or are a more active and imaginative viewer, the story is likely to confound you. A lot of people just won't ""get it"" and call it ""overly complicated"" or ""messy"". I do admit that the story could have been told in a better fashion but it's a shame its lost on a lot of people because, after much consideration, the story, with its use of abstract symbols and metaphors, much like the games, is actually quite clever. Occasionally flawed, mainly in the script, yes, but quite brilliant. I believe it shows Christophe Gans' artistic flair and in-depth study of the games themselves. However, mainly fans of the games will understand the weird story that is Silent Hill and few else.It's not without its flaws but its EXTREMELY watchable and more intelligent than the average horror film. It's quite disappointing that it was created by someone with such passion for the games and yet its flaws could and should have been corrected to produce an all-round better picture. Not quite as good as I had hoped but a real tribute to the scariest games of our time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Liked it allot,"Silent hill was one of the first games that scared the hell out of me. There is one scene in the game where you go into the school and there is a locker room and in there is a locker rattling. You open the locker, and nothing is there. After going though the clock tower in the school courtyard and the air raid sirens go off and all hell breaks loose you go back to the locker room (SIDE NOTE: As I got to this part there was a lighting storm and just as this happen there was a big flash of lightning and a big clap of thunder) I digress, now back in the locker room, the locker is rattling, I open it (BAM HUGH CRACK OF THUNDER OUTSIDE) and a body jumps out of the locker. Scared the bajesus out of me. The other part that creeped me out was during day time game play it is snowing (ash) and its foggy and you hear a mild wind blowing. I use to live down by the water, and one morning I go out side, its Snowing, its foggy and all I hear is the wind blowing. Kinda creeped me out, all I was thinking was, OK .... no static on the radio so i'm safe. SO, all in all this game left a good impression on me. After finishing the game I thought they should make a movie about this.Loved the effects, looked video game'ish in most parts. I was a bit aw struck on how well the area scenery looked like the game, some of the small details were great. The coverings on the fences outside at night, the way the walls in the buildings looked at night. They did take some liberties with the plot, but thats to be expected.The Monsters were excellent, the puppet nurses looked great, the Mumblers (Demonic Children) were creepy looking, and the best of all the monsters, always one of my fav's from the game, was the Red Pyramid. I thought this baddie was Very Well Done. He looked Killer, very true to the game.Over all really enjoyed the movie. My friend who came with me did not play any of the games and was a bit confused at the end. So playing the game is a good prerequisite to seeing the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very Scary,"Loved this movie. Never played the video game but enjoyed the movie. Some of the scariest moments in a film I have seen in quite awhile. While I thought the movie could have been a bit shorter, and while parts of the movie did not always make sense to me (like the ending), I was hesitant to leave my seat for fear that I would miss something. I absolutely agree with another reviewer who said that using people as the creatures was a lot more frightening that using CGI. Some times the old way is the best way. I would love to see a sequel made from this film. I know that they are several video games in the series so there has to be more than enough material.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Utter drivel,"This would have to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Not a single thing is believable, the acting is poor (the kid is the best actor), and the special effects are pitiful. I was prepared to be entertained and perhaps even frightened, instead I was bored almost to the point of walking out. The beginning is hard to follow, the middle defies any intelligence the viewer may have, and then ending is a poor attempt at trying to be a ""what if"" twilight zone feature. If you want to watch this I'd suggest quite a few beers or wines beforehand to try and make it entertaining. If you're after mind-numbing rubbish then go for it, if you want decent entertainment try another movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Trippy,"I don't play video games, so I went into this film with no pre-conceived notions or expectations. I came away pretty impressed and a little disturbed.Rose and Chris Da Silva are worried about their adopted daughter, Sharon. Little Sharon has been sleepwalking and speaking, while still asleep, of a place called Silent Hill. When Sharon nearly falls to her death during her latest sleepwalk, Rose decides to confront the issue head-on. She packs Sharon into the SUV and heads for Silent Hill, West Virginia. But Silent Hill is a ghost town that the locals don't like to speak of and which is contaminated by an ever burning coal fire deep in the bowels of the earth. After a freak car accident knocks Rose out, she awakens to find Sharon gone and a rain of ash falling from the sky. Silent Hill is indeed a ghost town, populated by demonic mutants and the ghosts of the damned. Rose is led by grisly clues deeper into the tragic history of the town and a terrible secret which involves her adopted daughter. Aided by police officer Cybil Bennet, Rose must face the dark demons of Hell and prevent history from repeating itself if she is to save Sharon.This is quite a freaky film, though surprisingly not as gory as I had thought it would be. After a somewhat slow first 20 minutes or so, the film descends into rotting horror as air- raid sirens warn of The Darkness, deformed creatures lurch out of the shadows and the patina of normalcy literally melts away with the approach of evil. Standout characters include the sorrowful Dahlia, played by Deborah Kara Unger, who looks like the worlds oldest and saddest Goth woman, and the hideous creature known only as Pyramid Head, who stomps into view with a horde of cockroaches at his command. Radha Mitchell does a great job as Rose, playing her as a realistically frightened woman, but also as a determined mother who will stop at nothing to save her daughter. Jodelle Ferland is great in her double role of Sharon/ Alessa, a sweet, haunted little girl one moment; a creepy, frightening little monster the next. Sean Bean as the hopelessly lost Chris Da Silva is perfect; you can feel his frustration and panic. Alice Krige too is unnervingly chilling as Christabella.The atmosphere of this movie is great - ash covered cemeteries, drippy basements, abandoned schoolrooms - all very creepy and menacing in their utter stillness. The violence, when it comes, is quite brutal. Skin is ripped off, bodies are roasted, limbs ripped away by barbed wire. Pretty gruesome, but not overly so. The demons are the real attraction here: besides Pyramid Head, there are also twisted torsos spewing black acid, deformed beings in nurse uniforms wielding scalpels and, in the scene which freaked me out the most, a man with his body bent double and his feet over his head crawling across a bathroom floor.I've never played the video game so I really can't tell you if this was a faithful adaptation or not. But I can say that it is very original, quite spooky, satisfyingly bloody and even rather disturbing in several parts...and I don't scare easily. All in all, a very good horror movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
SH = BD (big disappointment),"I had such high hopes for this movie. Whenever I saw the previews I was like, ""Wow that actually looks like it's pretty good!"" After seeing the movie though, I have a feeling people in love with the game will love the movie just because they'll be like, ""I remember that from the game,"" but for most others it'll be very lackluster.This is kind of proof to me that what makes a good video game does not necessarily make a good movie. In a video game you can really immerse yourself in the scene, you *are* the character, and you're ""living"" this horror. You get to choose where you go (sort of), what you do (sort of), and you have to figure things out for yourself.. sort of. The music in a video game just enhances your own adventure and emotions rather than guides them. You can also get away with crazy monsters because, well, it's a video game!These same rules don't apply to movies, however the makers of Silent Hill tried to make it as video-gameish as they could. When watching something from 3rd person instead of experiencing it in 1st person, you need that extra ""oomph"" to put you in the scene. That extra ""oomph"" was never added, and that's a major reason why the movie will fall flat to about 90% of viewers. (I'm pretty certain most viewers who have run out to see the film after being out for one day are fans of the game.)You're never really given the opportunity to get ""into"" the film. The music only assists in being an annoyance rather than a motivator. The shift in settings ends up making the film seem disjointed and messy, rather than dynamic and interesting. The CGI effects end up looking silly and laughable, rather than frightening. (I'm not a huge fan of CGI in movies anyways, but it really hurts this film because it shows such a huge contrast between CGI and non-CGI moments.)The acting is also quite painful in some areas. The little girl is more like a soap opera actress than a movie star. She was so unconvincing that it made me not take her seriously at all. Also, there were some extras that looked like they really needed some better direction. I felt like I was watching a made-for-TV drama at times...Anyways, there were just better ways to do things to make this film work, like hiring a new sound guy, a new director, new writers, new editors, better actors, possibly a new cinematographer... see what I'm getting at here? It's just boring, silly, and disappointing... save your money and rent it on PPV. I would have rather them made a great movie loosely based on a video game than a so-so movie greatly based on a video game.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
runs just like a game,"Rose has been having trouble with her daughter Sharon, who suffers from sleep walking. Each night this has been putting Sharon in more danger, with her constantly saying Silent Hill. In an attempt to help Sharon, Rose takes her daughter to this town Silent Hill. The town itself is a ghost town, laden with fog and never ending rain of ash. No one lives there, with good reasons, with a dark, benevolent force haunting the town.Silent Hill walks a very fine line between film and its game roots. Screenwriter Roger Avary, has faithfully followed the source material, to bring a film squarely aimed at the fans. Just like the game there is an a constant accumulation of strange and awe gaspingly weird events and creatures, but there lacks an internal logic. Silent Hill runs just like a game, with a lot of things never making ultimate sense and lacking a central coherent plot. Conheriance may not ultimately be needed in a game, but it doesn't translate well. Avary seems to have aimed low for his skills, with great work for Killing Zoe, The Rules of Attraction and work on the stories for Pulp Fiction.Even for its incoherence, there is this engaging element that just constantly keeps you fixated. Largely part of this is to the set design, art direction and special effects. The sets are so detailed; so much dirt, grit and grunge exceedingly evoke constant dread of forthcoming death. The hideous, deformed creatures are nicely freakish, ripped out of some demented nightmare. The rapid deterioration of buildings and rooms are mesmerising. The fantastic dark, ambient, electro soundtrack is perfectly used to the visuals.The disappointing part of Silent Hill, it's not scary or very thrilling. Your pulse doesn't raise nor quicken, from so many missed opportunities to get the blood pumping. The mood might be eerie and creepy, but that's not enough for a film of this genre. The scares at least don't ride on a soundtrack turned onto eleven, yet it's ear piercing from every scream leaving Sharon's mouth. A heavy handedness also comes with revealing information. The time when all is revealed, it all goes clunk, from it's bluntness of giving all answers at once instead of bits to pick up along the way.Paper thin accurately describes the acting. While the strongest link, Radha Mitchell is disappointing as Rose. Laurie Holden looks more like a dominatrix then a cop. Sean Bean is weak as chalk as Christopher. Deborah Kara Unger in unrecognizable as Dahlia, getting real dirty and one crazy hair style.When you step back, not doesn't completely hold together, but it keeps your attention from wondering away.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A step in the right direction.,"I think it is fair to say that the general consensus is that Video Game movies suck complete and utter ass, so I've skipped out on plenty. That is until I found a Youtube video crediting this film in particular for being not only faithful to the source material which is a great horror game, but also being just a decent film all around. Well I can certainly say that this film is far superior to most of it's caliber.Allow me to say that this film certainly has plenty of hit or miss qualities as well as straight up double-edged sword qualities. Allow me to explain what I mean by that. First, the story. The narrative is probably the biggest hit or miss I've seen in any film ever. Sometimes the film has great moments because of it's surprisingly great directing, cinematography, and shot composition. However the story just balances out to just ""ok"" the positives at play here are the twisted themes and mystery elements. But the negatives here are the extremely pretentious and sometimes awful writing, certain lines really miss their mark when they try to be either melodramatic or casual. There were plenty of instances when I sat there and said to myself, ""people don't talk like that."" which is very dangerous especially in a film that is based on such a character driven game. So the plot was just, meh.Visuals- Without a shadow of doubt are the most inconsistent thing in this film, even though it seemed to be the aspect praised the most around the internet. But I can still see where they're coming from. An element that I thought I wasn't going to even give a shit about but turned out to be awesome was the set design and creature design; OH MY GOD, it's too damn fantastic. The town of silent hill almost feels as if the town has it's own character, kind of in the sense that the real antagonist of the film is the town itself. From the ash that coats the streets and air like snow, to the dark noire atmosphere at night and the bleak environments by day. The set design also fares very well, a great sense of scale and realism, almost as if I was watching a completely practical production. Also let me just say how faithful to the source material the monsters look, the nurses and especially everyone's favorite huge boss spooky boi Pyramid Head are both recreated with delicate care and detail. Also watching Pyramid Head mess stuff up is just so satisfying. Now let me rip the other aspect of the visuals a new one, by talking, or in this case complaining about the CG. The CG looks somewhat decent in the final few scenes of the film, don't get me wrong, but I can never be convinced by the shift between day and night silent hill has. When the environment starts to rust I just don't buy it, maybe more detail and money needed to be put to these scenes because these transitions are crucial to how the viewer depicts the town; which as stated earlier has it's own character.Overall 6/10 is very appropriate, not great, but never throw this film in with the garbage of it's peers.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An entertaining and suspenseful dark ride into the lungs of Hell,"Based on a video game with the same title this movie is a good and suspenseful horror flick. The plot, which clearly follows the video game's story, is well built and leads you to a dark and atmospheric setting, the little village of SILENT HILLFrom the beginning it has mystery, suspense and a Gothic dark atmosphere that combined create an enjoyable ghost story. Following the game's premise the movie dwells into two parallel realities, the dark sub world that haunts Silent Hill, where the main character ROSE (played by Radha Mitchell) has fallen, and the ""real world"" from where CHRISTOPHER DA SILVA (Da Silva is a Portuguese surname by the way – played by Sean Bean), ROSE's husband, never came out In fact by plot's developments we see they are not in the same dimensionThe CGI are good but we can notice the clear inspiration in the game's computer graphics. A good example is the little creepy monsters of the dark world that appear along the movie; they are absolutely inspired the video game! The special effects are nice thoughThe other issue that is brought by this movie and which is the most important one (on a social perspective) is the religious fanaticism. The entire plot ends being around this topic and I might say I did like its final disclosure (and its message)All in all I did appreciate SILENT HILL, it's not a movie to take too seriously (it's a video game adaptation!), but if we think about it just as an entertaining and suspenseful dark ride into the lungs of Hell, I guess we have a nice horror flick here!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unscary, uninspired, and nowhere nearly as good  as the game","there is a reason why very few horror films come out of France. the french are usually not good with minimalistic, nihilistic, or disturbing imagery. quite the opposite actually. unfortunately, that is the sensitivity needed for creating a scary, modern Japanese horror film or game. gans, whose brotherhood of the wolf i love, completely failed in recreating the haunting and freakish atmosphere of the terrific silent hill franchise. his film is bland, borderline boring, completely unscary and uninspired. as for the screenplay, the plot is annoying and the characters are completely one-dimensional. there is no sense of discovery, no element of surprise or fear of the unknown. gans's monsters just show up, move at the pace of snails and are evaporated by the rising sun before they can really do any damage. as a fan of good stories, atmospheric cinema, silent hill and scary movies, i find myself disappointed on all levels. stay away from this stinker, rent the games instead and be afraid...be very afraid!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very good and atmospheric horror film...,"Based on a very successful series of horror video-games, ""Silent Hill"" is a new entry on the horror genre that has the challenge of surpassing the high expectations built due to the video-game's fame and status as one of the best series ever done. Not an easy task for a film (and one that hasn't been fulfilled by many films based on video-games), however, the highly anticipated film by french director Christophe Gans has proved to be up to the challenge and quickly has earned a cult-following even among fans without gaming experience.The movie keeps the premise of the game series (it focuses on the key plot of the first video game) but enough changes have been done to keep it original enough to fans of the game and still easy-to-follow for non-fans. The plot revolves around the Da Silva family, whose little daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is suffering from bizarre nightmares about a town named ""Silent Hill"". While her father, Christopher (Sean Bean) trusts in psychology, her mother Rose (Radha Mitchell) doesn't and takes Sharon to Silent Hill in order to discover the mystery of her daughter's nightmares. What she'll find there will be a nightmare come true.Written by Roger Avary, the movie's screenplay is what could be stated as an update to the first game's plot, with new things added and others changed. The most important one is that the lead character is now a female rather than a male, this change was a very appropriate one as it focuses on a mother-child relationship, a bond considerably stronger in the western culture than the father-child bond. The film keeps the feeling of isolation and the nightmarish atmospheres although it tones down the mystery and exploration of the town (another obvious change). It also has a small dose of drama, which came up as a good surprise as not many modern horror films seem to care for it nowadays.Christophe Gans' conception of ""Silent Hill"" is a very beautiful work of art. Like in his previous work, the visual composition is amazing and ""Silen Hill""'s mix of haunting loneliness and menacing darkness is wonderfully portrayed. Gans' care for details and love for the video game are notorious as some scenes seem to be taken shot by shot from it. While it still has its fair share of gore and other cheap thrills, for the most part the films relays on atmosphere and mood rather than in graphic violence. However, it's safe to say that it's biggest problems occur when it moves away from that style.The acting is for the most part good, with Radha Mitchell being an excellent choice for a lead character and shows her talent for drama as well as for horror. She carries the film with elegance and is very believable as a worried mother. Sean Bean is credited as co-star, but his presence is small and while he gives a fine performance, the real co-star is definitely Laurie Holden. As Cybil Bennet (a cop who follows Rose to Silent Hill), Holden is very effective and overall makes a good job. Deborah Kara Unger as Dahlia is somewhat disappointing, not only because her character is quite poorly developed, but also her performance ends up as weak.The problem with ""Silent Hill"" are not the high expectations it built (relatively, it satisfied most of them), but the potential it left unexploited. The story is a fitting adaptation but still some of the magic is missing there and some details appear as flaws. The focus on apparently unnecessary characters (Christopher) contrasts with the poor development of more important ones such as Dahlia. As written above, while the film is for the most part an atmospheric Gothic film, when it moves to a gorier graphical film the results are less impressive and the massive use of CGI at times makes an otherwise beautiful looking film appear as of lesser quality.Depsite this flaws, ""Silent Hill"" is a terrific film and a very enjoyable one for fans of slower, creepier films. It's not a gore-fest so fans expecting fast action will be sorely disappointed. It's true that its not a perfect film, but its a good attempt at making Gothic horror the way it used to be. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"So, let's see Gans' cut","Silent Hill - both the film and the games - have atmosphere, creepy locations and characters suffering hellish torment. What the film lacks is running time. The tension and horror needs buildup, and that's why I'm looking forward to The Director's Cut DVD. Read on IGN about the original cut being some 3h+ (!) Just toss the the exposition scenes thus retaining the sensation of... a perfect mind f**k. The theatrical cut is a letdown. Perhaps Sony got scared and demanded a more coherent version for those who didn't grow up with Alien, The Excorcist and The Thing. I still have the original PlayStation game lying around. Funny to think the fog was added due to the technical limitations of the console but then ending up as one of the main purveyors of fear.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is what you call a Supernatural Horror.,"Silent Hill is a supernatural horror film directed by Christophe Gans. The film stars Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Deborah Kara Unger, Kim Coates, Tanya Allen, Alice Krige, and Jodelle Ferland.Rose and her daughter, Sharon, leave their house to go to Silent Hill. On their way Rose meets with an accident knocking her unconscious and when she awakes, Sharon is missing.This is an interesting film to watch. The film almost purely defines the category of supernatural horror thriller. The blood, gore and the terrifying VFX make this film more creepier and makes a must watch for the lovers of supernatural horror thriller and should be avoided by faint hearted and kids.The plot of the film is interesting and execution is superb. The film is evenly paced. The film gets slow in some of the scenes but that increases the intensity of film and makes the film more tensed and horrifying.Acting is superb and almost every character were impressive in the film and Radha Mitchell was the most impressive of them all.The climax of the film is also good and gives a decent closure to the film. A must watch for Supernatural horror thriller lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I hated it.,"I thought this movie was terrible. The acting was just as bad as the end of the movie. I was left thinking, ""What in the world?!?!"" I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone. It had a few tense parts but the only part of the movie that really captivated my attention was the hot police officer. But they ruined that. It's not a good movie at all. If you're into movies that don't make sense, watch it. If you're into movies that you understand once you've played a game and are willing to play that game before you see the movie, watch it. I never even knew ""Silent Hill"" was a video game so I had no clue where these ideas were coming from or who the villains were. The little girl's acting threw me off from everything else with her slow, emotionless speech and her screams were all but genuine. Maybe a good introduction would have made the movie more sensible and enjoyable rather than a mother running all over town looking for her sleepwalking daughter.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average as a movie but good as a game adaptation,"Horror game franchise comes to life on the big screen, and the flavour of the games is well captured.Silent Hill, as a game, always preyed on our deepest darkest fears. It projected an innate wrongness and the monsters in it were designed to defy what we had come to expect from horror - add to that a wretched doomed atmosphere and hideous graphics which propagated a genuinely sinister and foreboding facade. This was the strength of the Silent Hill games, and any successful movie would have to go to town to create the same effect.Silent Hill, as a movie, succeeds superbly at this, certainly for the first half of the story. The locations, the events, some of the characters and *even* some of the camera shots are dead ringers for the game, and those familiar with it will find themselves totally engulfed in the Silent Hill world.The buildings, the monsters, the foggy town, even the change to Dark Silent Hill are absolutely bang on the money and make afficionados feel completely at home.The story is close to the original game; a woman, Rose (Where it used to be a man, Harry Mason) drives her daughter (Sharon) to the town of Silent Hill but has an accident. Her daughter disappears from the car (In exactly the same way as the game) and the movie is then her hunt to find her.Throughout the movie you'll notice homages to the sequels of the original game - and all of them are very convincing and clearly time has gone into producing a movie with this level of accuracy to the games.As such, Silent Hill was a serious horror game and the gore factor and hideousness of monsters and deaths is exactly what you expect. There is even a fair bit of imagination going on to give it a creative edge.The acting is staple, without being anything outstanding, but what else would you expect from Hollywood horror? Sean Bean has a rather small role as the husband/father and it seems slightly strange to see him in this kind of movie, and putting on a pseudo-American accent which never convinces. As Rose, Laurie Holden does a fair amount of screaming and looking panic stricken - exactly what she needs to do.The direction is very good indeed - it's a fast moving film and never slows down unnecessarily. The special effects are also very impressive - lots of CGI went into this to create convincing monsters and atmosphere effects, and they work very well indeed.Overall, as a story it's not bad although there are several comical leaps of logic - but you'll forgive them. It does lose its way ever so slightly in the second half where it goes for maximum confusion, but in a way it's actually the best method because the game went the same way in terms of plot. It just perhaps doesn't translate to the big screen so well. But the makers did as good a job of making it as simple as they could while remaining faithful to the game.Horror fans will get a fair kick out of it although recognising it's not the greatest horror one will ever see, and devotees of the games will certainly enjoy its accuracy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visually stunning in every way. Technically average...,"I have just been to see this film with a group of friends. It's worth noting that I'm an nineteen year-old male, I've experienced (to some extent) the 'Silent Hill' trilogy of games.Firstly, I need to say this - ""Silent Hill' is GRAPHIC. There are four or five memorable scenes that will stay with you for some time. The nature of these scenes means that the graphic violence is to some extent necessary, but man! This happens to be the most graphically violent film I have ever seen. With some extremely disturbing and hard hitting scenes.Moving on, the screenplay is average. The acting is sub-par, (except a stunning performance from Jodelle Ferland), the camera-work is nothing worth talking about. The story is extremely slow and never really gathers momentum, it's almost a struggle to piece it together.I noticed that during the first 10 minutes of footage in and around the town of 'Silent Hill' you can see how Christophe Gans aimed to film using an overhead third person view of the protagonists. It's very well executed and gives a real feel of the games. It would of been interesting to see more of the film in this way.Now for the strong points. The visuals of this film are incredible; Graphics that I never thought possible, and have never witnessed. Never in my life have I witnessed such stunning computer generated special effects. A scene I noted in a bathroom when the walls began to peel - it looked simply stunning and so, so real.This is by far one of the most intense films I have ever seen. The character design is a thing of beauty. From the enemies, down to the what we could call the ""goodies"", all costume and set design was thought about in great detail, and it pays off very well. To tie in with this the musical score and sound effects are PERFECT.I HIGHLY recommend you see this film at the cinema. It is not for playback at home. As I say I highly enjoyed watching this at my local cinema, just be prepared for an uncomfortable ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surreal horror movie,"I expected really goofy, coming from a video game and all, but it was OK. Lots of metal+unskinned flesh monsters, visceral emotions linked with females and their mother-child connections, insane cult worshipers, this film has it all.The plot is a little confusing, though, and it is all because the story would have been really simple if at all logical. The atmosphere is good, with creepy bloody networks growing all over the place after a strange siren call and a constant ashy rain. The idea of a ghost town sitting on top of perpetually burning coal mines is not bad either.All and all, I think it is a movie that was intended to both audiences, male and female. Alas, women will not watch it because they don't get married in the end and men won't get it because it's all about mothers trying to find their daughters.Besides, once you see Alice Krige having a part in the movie, you know where evil is at :) In conclusion, I think it's a fun flick for horror fans. Could have been more gory and less ""devily"" and with a little less female screams, but all and all it's OK.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"About as insipid, hackneyed, childish and inaccurate as a Resident Evil movie.","All I ever really wanted out of a video game film adaptation was one that simulated the feeling of the game to the point where it actually felt like the game it was based off of in every aspect (save for the technical ones such as menus, options, etc.); not only would it full fill the needs of the long-running fans (in other words didn't start playing the most recent game in the series before viewing), but it would also give common movie goers a better idea of what the game is really about between its presentation, cast of characters, aspects, fun-factor and strains.I realize this method is impossible, yet modern film makers, script writers and their massive checkbooks alike seem to think otherwise.Here is the movie's most accurate points:Set designs - 90% of the sets actually looked like the backgrounds to many of the Silent Hill games between the fog inundated street corners and even parts of the Other World (forgiving the fact that we only see a little bit of it now and then).Cinematography - Some of the camera angles reproduced frame by frame were accurate as well, particularly the alley overhead shot from the first game.Here is the movie's least accurate points:Characters and portrayal -In the Silent Hill games, there is a large emphasis on character empathy as even some of the two dimensional characters you end up learning to care about. There were very few characters in the movie that really begged for sympathy including the main character and her determination to uncover her daughter's mysteries whilst attempting to get arrested and possibly even get her daughter injured in a car accident in the process. There was just about one character in the movie who showed any point of development or characterization, but the character was so poorly presented it was impossible to feel anything for said character.Too much gore - It's not that I don't appreciate a gory horror film, it's just that the Silent Hill games were never entirely about massive amounts of gore, blood or even shocking deaths. The only game in the series that had any type of gore was the first game and all the gore was postmortem (some of the bodies were actually mummified) and none of it adhered to any form of reality or even the living characters in the game. In this movie, the gore is thrown out from the characters so much it feels like the film was based off a completely different game or movie.Ripped soundtrack - Rather than finding musical artists to reproduce the sound of the game's soundtrack or even ask Yamaoka (the original composer of the game's songs) to compose a soundtrack for the movie, the creators found it unique to just take existing songs from three of the past four games and insert it into the movie, remixing at least two. All of the songs however represent specific moments in the game, so it's impossible to get into the movie when you're thinking too much of a specific moment from the games.Combat - As the games allowed the players to navigate the protagonist around their settings, the games also allowed the protagonist to protect themselves against the various demented enemies. Such never happens in the movie. Rather, the heroine basically depends upon another heroine to do all the fighting for her; If Rose were trapped in an actual Silent Hill game, she would've been dead 5 minutes into the game.Puzzles - Although the movie does try to display a few puzzles in the game as well as item searching, the concept falls flat after the first few items a nd puzzles experienced due to the fact that there was only one puzzle and one item retrieval moment, the puzzle being so simple any one could figure it out. The puzzles of Silent Hill have always been complex and challenging, even if there was only one such challenging puzzle in the fourth game with the rest being of the simple 'retrieve and use here' fashion.Plot - Not only does it have little to nothing to do with the complex and unique history of the town, but it also has little uniqueness or complexity to it. What seems like a romp into another's psyche and a horrifying truth that challenges the very existence of the characters we're supposed to care about turns out to be a sad excuse to make a modern horror movie with a bunch of gore and a video game name slapped on the cover.Atmosphere - The atmosphere of the Silent Hill games are indeed visual and often ubiquitous, but it is still a slow atmosphere that lingers on the audience and builds up through exploration of settings. Such just does not happen here. Although the settings were good, we just didn't get to see them enough for them to contribute to the atmosphere, nor did the presence of the monsters.Creature designs that adhered to plot - No matter what, all creatures in the Silent Hill games had something to do with the plot. Nine out of ten times, the monsters here are just thrown in because they were inspired from previous games and only one of which actually adheres to the plot, forgiving the fact that it was made solely for show and didn't even do anything.There are some other aspects the director and script writer added particularly the director's sense of over-rationalizing and questioning puritanical occult authorities (reminds me of another film that he's famous for...) and some of which do shoot down the game's principles, but my apathy for this movie has all ready taken mammoth proportions.I refuse to call this movie accurate to its source, I refuse to call this movie good and I refuse to willingly see it again.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Despite it's Many Faults, A Good Video Game to Big Screen Adaptation!","OK, yes, ""Silent Hill"" the movie is nowhere as great as the video games, but you know what, they did a pretty damn good job of turning this supremely eeriest of video games, into a pretty good eerie film. No small part due to the fantastic CGI effects, atmospheric cinematography, & what may be the most unnerving soundtrack in horror movies, or I should say, video games, the original ""Silent Hill"" video game music.But for all this going for the films benefit, the direction was surprisingly weak, especially considering director Christophe Gans amazing effort, ""Brotherhood of the Wolf!"" Even so, a mediocre effort by this superior director is many directors ""A"" game, & the film does have it's surrealistic creepy, ""Hellraiser"" like charms. Other problems include a uninspiring execution of the plot, some weak acting, & an overwrought climax, to much of a good thing makes a mockery of the whole point of the film.

Should have been called Dullsville....,"Despite being a big fan of Resident Evil, I never got round to playing the original Silent Hill game on Playstation, and have since spent about half an hour playing the sequel, and found it really boring. But even so, I'm rating this movie based on its own merits, and unfortunately; there aren't many. As you might expect, the film focuses on the spooky ghost town, 'Silent Hill'. It has to be said that director Christophe Gans has done a good job with the atmosphere in the town, but he hasn't done a very good job with the implementation of the action, and Roger Avary's story about Silent Hill is not very interesting. We follow Rose Da Silva; a woman's whose child suffers from trauma in her sleep. When the girl begins to scream 'Silent Hill!' Rose decides to take her to the town that she sees in her sleep. However, it soon becomes apparent that all is now well in the ash covered town, as her husband (Sean Bean, delivering a typically bland performance) finds a website about the town that details its strange history, and Rose finds out about the town's abnormal inhabitants when she comes face to face with them herself...Probably due to the fact that most video game adaptations these days are rubbish, it would seem the team here were keen to make Silent Hill as 'faithful' as possible...and in doing so, have made a film that would have worked a lot better as a game. The CGI doesn't look good alongside real actors, and because a lot of the film features the characters pondering about creepy locations, it can be very boring. This wouldn't have been a problem if you were playing a game and in control of the characters, but sitting and watching them gets old very fast. The film also seems to have put things that I assume are from the game into the screenplay without a lot of point most of the time; case in point - what was that thing with a metal triangle on its head? The fact that the film runs too long ultimately harms it, as the film soon loses it's way and needs to introduce some kind of cult to further the overly complex and uninteresting story, and it all ends with one of the worst special effects showcases that I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not disappointed with this movie as I'm not a fan of the games anyway; but my lack of disappointment doesn't mean Silent Hill is anything but a bad film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Video games make bad movies, and this is one of the worst","There must be something really wrong with the world when a ""movie"" like this gets 6.6 in IMDb (at least while I'm writing this). My guess is that most of the votes are casted by fans of the game, who somehow cannot separate the game from the movie, as bad as it is. I was a fan of Wing Commander, but that didn't mean that I couldn't see that the movie was horrible, actually it angered me that the quality of the film was such bad in comparison with such a good game.It is very obvious that this is a video game made into a movie, and a bad one at that. I never played the game, but my only explanation for the director leaving such an absurd and badly glued plot is that they were faithful to the video game storyline. Now, when a novel is adapted into a movie, nobody expects it to be a carbon copy, there has to be some input from the scriptwriters. Why isn't it so with people adapting video games into movies? My guess: Lack of talent by the people trying to adapt them.The movie feels at all times like a video game (without the fun), the monsters get badder as people progress, and are completely different ones for no apparent reason. I even laughed at the part where they explain what the source of evil is, because nothing makes sense, and it only becomes more and more ridiculous. It seems that they just tried to throw in all the ""shocking"" elements they could think of, without thinking on how to put them together coherently. Not bad in a video game, where playability is the most important factor, and the storyline is just a plus which is supposed to add a little depth between the monster slashing, but terrible in a movie, where the storyline is supposed to be what entertains you.Not only that, the movie is completely predictable and the directors seem to aim quite low at their intended public, as they are making obvious in too many of the scenes something that was completely obvious from the very beginning and that is supposed to surprise you at the end.The special effects were the least bad part of the movie, but they were far from impressive, you could always tell they were computer animations (the ""nude"" in the movie is also computer effects) and some of them were too faithful to first person shooters character figures, more cartoon-like than real.The movie fails completely to create any suspense as it is completely predictable, the characters are completely dull and cartoon like. It's not either shocking (like for example SAW), as the supposedly shocking scenes are computer animated and not that gory. They're not even laughable. There is nothing that will surprise you from this movie, nothing is original, its all like a random gathering of clips from other movies, that have all been better than this one.I would continue but its unfair to continue wasting time on such a bad movie. The only excuse to see this movie is if you were a fan of the video game, and I suppose you would be disappointed by it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

As one who knows nothing about the game, they only partially succeeded. And yes, I had to view it twice to pick up some of the finer points. What will remain with me the most is the set decoration and style of the movie. It fit in with the mood. There are elements of horror, but for the most it is a story of mystery, and why her child, Sharon was so fixated on Silent Hill. Only a flashback on the police card gives a clue.

Beautiful,"First off, this is not a game clone. If you have played the original Silent Hill video game, you'll have a fresh outlook on the story to look forward to. While the changes disturbed me a bit at first, I feel they were necessary to the overall success of Silent Hill the movie. Alice Krige does a beautiful job of making sure her character, the religious zealot, Christabella, does not sound contrived in her dialog, which would have been an easy mistake. The game version of the character Dahlia Gillespie is shallow and unchallenging, but Gans has reworked her into a believable person with real emotions, and Deborah Kara Unger really brings her to life for the first time! The visuals are grotesquely beautiful. Each creature has it's own feel, it's own texture, and it's own personality. They are ripped straight from the tortured mind of an emotionally and physically abused little girl, and they have a way of reminding you what it was like to be so young; everything distorted and frightening in your nightmares. They look as though made of plastic, yet they have flesh and bone and blood...symbolic of the toys of a small child, yet they are tainted with the horrible reality of the frailty of living things.The music is taken straight from the games, with minor 'facelifts' so to speak. Added instruments only make Akira Yamaoka's haunting melodies all the more addictive and frightening. This movie is a video game adaptation, yet has few of the pitfalls typical of the game movies before it. Do not be mistaken; Silent Hill is not a horror movie. It is at it's roots a drama...the story of a child forced down the path of evil to take revenge upon those who caused her such agony.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"That Silence you Hear, is Laughter","What to make of this odd big-little film. It's clearly a Lynchian nightmare-scape, but it offers one too many clues to its unraveling in some of the most boring exposition put to film ever. Like DOOM, it makes the unappealing choice of translating the game to the big screen literally, even lifting camera angles, a startling sense of geography, a sequence of controller directions and more than 45 minutes of running and opening/trying to open drawers, doors and bathroom stalls. In that way, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. Not a good thing, because it's absolutely unnecessary as is the Husband's story, which eats up about a half hour too and reveals nothing we couldn't have assumed from Rose's story.The positive side is that it's beautiful and atmospheric in an almost masochistic way. The demons are to die for, the locales are devilishly delightful and the story is an interesting one (albeit told in a bland way).Sadly, it's just too unintentionally hilarious too often, and it really ruins the experience (unless of course you came for a good belly laugh or two). Of particular note is the frequent uttering of ""Everything will be OK"" at two of the most inopportune times ever. Now, maybe on paper, this was supposed to sound like ""denial"" but on film, the actress and director play the lines straight, which just hurts. I wish Silent Hill was a better film, because all the workings were there. But as is, it's going to be more of a curiosity than a classic. Much like ""The Brotherhood of the Wolf"" Gans has yet to make me care about his movies as anything more than abstract art.",,Anonymous,Horror
Atmospheric and disturbing despite flaws,"A slow building adaptation of Konami's 1999 survival horror video game, Silent Hill pairs the game's siganture fog, monsters, flashlights, and supernatural mystery elements with a story heavily adapted for the cinema. Although the film stumbles over plot holes and timeline discrepancies, its eerie atmosphere is bolstered by practial monster effects, thorough set design, and a surreal score by Akira Yamaoka, whose music from the first two games is wisely employed heavily throughout the film. At the movie's gruesome climax, original music by Jeff Danna evokes religious and Spaghetti Western sensibilities and enhances the visually and conceptually disturbing collision of supernatural and human horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Into the fire she swallowed their hate""","The Silent Hill film Is a true adaptation of the video game franchise. If you ever managed to play any of the games then I think you will quite enjoy the easter eggs, key themes, and hidden messages throughout the film.This is a phycological thriller with plenty of visual gore, violence, barbed wire, and thick smog which perfectly brings to life the Silent Hill image.This film is also fairly accurate to the material of the game. With modern CGI it brings to life the distinct enemies that our characters encounter. The sinister Nurse holding a deadly scalpel and is attracted to light. The Straightjacket who coughs and spits putrid acid. And last but not least the iconic Pyramid Head dragging and scraping his gigantic blade so you are aware of his ever-nearing presence.Silent Hill also has a lot of offers for people who have never had any interaction with the games whatsoever. Personally having played all the games I am quite competent with the backstory and lore, so I can assume that following the plot of the film could potentially be hard to fully comprehend.That being said, however, when transferring the story into a film they have kept it relatively simple in most parts so that way you can follow even the basic principles. It doesn't give too much in-depth information, so therefore so you just sit back and get enough enjoyment just by watching the story unfold.I think they did a pretty good job overall. I believe you could honestly make Silent Hill into a long-running series with the number of different characters you could introduce all of whom are battling with their phycological demons about problems, or addictions they are faced with in everyday life.There are only a few sequences that are drawn out and can lag in the film. But being a huge fan of Silent Hill I was quite happy with the result, and hope they look to make more films like this in the future.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Laser Floyd,"Let me explain what I mean by that.Years ago, in New York Planetarium they used to have something called ""Laser Floyd"". My friends and I would go there on the weekend, we would get a little high, and then we would sit in a dark room, watch lasers dance on the curved ceiling and listen to Pink Floyd. There was no meaningful dialog. There was no human drama. There was not story. There was just one awesome trip.That's what Silent Hill is like to me. It is a visual piece of art. It has no story. It has no deep meaning, or any kind of meaning, actually. It shuffles along like some broken thing. And yet, it somehow manages to strike it with me just the right way. Its great visuals always remind me of that time, years ago, of how it felt sitting in that dark room watching the laser show and singing along to Dark Side of the Moon.This movie is 16 years old now and as far as I am concerned, it doesn't have to be ""good"" in a traditional way. I watched it very recently and I still feel the same way about it. I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The game that came to life,"I'm a fan of the game so when I first watched Silent Hill, I was super excited and very impressed how they made a movie like I'm playing a video game! I mean, all those effects when it turns to the dark side, all the monsters, wow! My favorite was the nurses and Cybil.But tbh, as I am watching it now, I noticed how bad the editing was. Not really bad but not that good. I noticed the insects were fake and the movement of the monsters were computerized. So, every little detail were easy to notice now because of the better effects and better editing these days.Still, it's a good movie and I will always be a fan of the Silent Hill game.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

You people are ON CRACK,"First off, how does a film this bloody awful rate a 6.5 out of 10?! I suppose if you're an attention span-deprived adolescent who does nothing but play video games endlessly, and whose neural cortex has been so totally overstimulated that the only thing that will prompt you to move or register a flicker of human emotion (other than ennui or blind anger) is either a can of Red Bull or a jolt in the testicles with a taser, then have at it. This movie is for you.However, if you're actually interested in a film with recognizable human beings, something that vaguely resembles a story and any kind of connection to what is generally acknowledged as the real world, then you better fuggidabowdit. Where to begin...Okay, the opening scene pretty much sets you up for what to expect for the next 2+ hours (?! and I thought ""The Passion of the Christ"" felt long): you've got a young couple lives in a house that's RIGHT NEXT to a two-lane blacktop that's busy with truck traffic in the middle of the night, which is also poised RIGHT NEXT to a waterfall with a sheer drop of what looks to be at least a hundred feet; they've got a nine-year-old daughter WITH A HISTORY OF SLEEPWALKING - and yet...this little girl is somehow able to leave the house in the middle of the night; there are no safety features whatsoever to prevent her from wandering off their property either into traffic, or to stand poised on the verge of this precipitous cliff; and - AND (this is the big one) the girl's mother's solution to her daughter's problem is to IMMEDIATELY head off to this abandoned, haunted town the name of which her sleepwalking daughter has been repeatedly crying out during her somnabulistic states. I think we have a winner for Parent of the Year...This film takes place in a 'reality' that bears absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the one that you and I live in - and I'm not talking about the haunted town of Silent Hill here. I'm talking about a 'reality' where a young mother, alone with her young daughter at a gas station in the middle of the night, out in the middle of nowhere, as she is walking into said gas station to pay, blithely walks past a scary, dominatrix-looking bike cop WHO'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HER SUV WHERE THE DAUGHTER IS SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT WITH THE WINDOW HALFWAY DOWN and doesn't even so much as turn her head as they pass one another. WTF..? And - oh, get this - she walks into said gas station/restaurant, whose parking lot outside is conspicuously empty of any other vehicles apart from her own and that of the scary bike cop, and...the place is FULL of people! Where are their cars and trucks parked? This movie can't be bothered with such 'mundane' details.And that's a HUGE problem and here's why: look, I'm not one of these nigglers who demands that a movie adhere absolutely to some perfect resemblance to the real world. Far from it. BUT when you're making a movie with fantastical elements, like those in SILENT HILL, the more closely and rigorously you define a 'real world' to contrast with the fantastical you're going to create, the more impact that latter world will have on the audience. But if the 'real' world in which your characters live is, in and of itself, so totally disconnected from anything even vaguely resembling the waking world, then its bound to seem much, much less impressive when an armless, headless ghoul stumbles out of an auto graveyard and vomits black acid on someone.Another thing: films with fantastic elements - sci-fi, horror, fantasy, etc. - need to establish, if only obliquely, what the 'rules of the game' are. That never happens in SILENT HILL. Basically, Rhada Mitchell gets to the haunted town, lose her daughter and then spends the next two hours running and stumbling from one lurid, horrific set-piece to another with absolutely no sense of progression or logic. And the fact that the viewer has only the vaguest sense of why she's doing what she's doing is only further infuriated by the fact that instead of at least attempting to lay out some ground rules or sense of purpose, the movie spends seemingly endless amounts of time and energy to fill in a totally absurd and utterly derivative backstory that supposedly makes this all make sense (which it most assuredly does not).Oh, what a waste - of my time; of millions that could have financed 20 independent features (at least maybe 10% of which might have turned out good, giving viewers a 200% return on investment, so to speak); of the talents of a lot of good actors (Sean Bean, Rahda Mitchell, Kim Coates, etc.) and crew (Carol Spier's production design is, as always, top notch). Notice how I DON'T mention the director, Christophe Gans (go back to France, game-boy!) or credited writer Roger Avary (give back your Oscar now, Roger!). Yes, an utter waste.I hated this film and if you liked it, chances are I hate you too.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but something's missing...","I adore SH games, and I enjoyed the film. Especially in this foggy night of north London, which coincides with the atmosphere in the game.But there is something missing in this film adaptation. SH horror is fundamentally based on psychological aspects toward heaven and hell inspired from film Jacob's Ladder, blended with Demonology and dark American folklore flavours. The filmmakers paid a lot attentions on the look and camera work to re-create game-play stimulation, but missed out the suspenseful sound effects and the true essence of the game - the ambiguity relations between characters and monsters, the hidden puzzles of mysterious Silent Hill nature, and the dark humour towards the whole insanity, those made the game appealing. Besides a cinema experience would never be the same as a single player gaming experience, therefore the film seemed less shocking nor scary for me.Nevertheless I think the film is still pretty enjoyable. I also respect it as a filmmaker's contribution to the original SH story, appears to be intriguing and entertaining. Although I felt that Yamaoka should have composed a new set of soundtracks instead of using all the songs from the game series.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad at all!,"As both a horror and video game fan I was at first quite sceptical about this title. But unlike the, to me, quite close to disastrous, Resident Evil remakes (although I haven't seen RE: Afterlife yet) I was pretty much surprised about Silent Hill. The atmosphere in the games is amazing. Maybe even the best part of the franchise. Which they converted into the movie pretty well. The acting isn't bad at all either. Jodelle Ferland who seems really talented to me (based on her roles in Kingdom Hospital & Tideland) again is pretty steady in this movie although her role is quite small this time. Same as Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean act pretty decent. You can easily imagine the fear Mitchell (Playing the main person) is experiencing during her forced visit to lovely Silent Hill. Like most nowaday horror movies this one isn't outstanding either but it definitely will not waste your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
ONE OF THE BETTER VIDEO GAME ADAPTATIONS.,"First of all, the Silent Hill games are terrifying. You might just scream or give up altogether while playing them. However, if you're expecting 'fear' out of this movie, you might not necessarily get it. There are moments which induce tension. That's it. However, if atmosphere is your thing, don't miss this movie 'or' the game.The first thing you might notice is that this movie has a negative critical reception. Well- this one just came out in the wrong year. Now, people love it for what it is.There are flaws scattered around. The dialogues, writing. They all feel bland. This movie is also two hours long! A bit too long in my opinion.Finally, the visuals are breathtaking at times albeit being a bit dated. This one came back nearly sixteen years ago, though.Nevertheless, despite a few flaws, Silent Hill is still good to watch. If you want more scares, play the game. But if you just wanna a woman trapped in an alternate dimension full of creepy people and monsters- the movie is there on Hulu.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not enough invested in the characters,"Carrie, The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Eraserhead, Salvador Dali, Tetsuo, Ring, Christian Iconography and Witchfinder General are just a few of the sources that you can see either influencing this film or being directly quoted. As in his previous film, The Brotherhood of the Wolf, Christophe Gans has tried to make a film that isn't quite like anything else you've ever seen whilst using the conventions of many different genres. In this case he has also based the entire thing on the the video game Silent Hill and tried to absorb the characteristics, or clichés, of the game genre. The result is unlikely to completely satisfy fans either of his previous film or of the games, although some of the fawning on IMDb suggests that the gamers are mostly happy with the results.I have to say that I found the film quite hard to like simply because the gore quotient was set to maximum and then some. In terms of blood, violence and general trauma to bodies human and demon this raises the bar in an already competitive field. Usually I have no objection to high gore levels although they are often used to hide underlying deficiencies in a film. In fact I don't object to the level of gore displayed here – I just find that somehow Gans (or the CGI specialists) have somehow managed to take to the fun out of it! That might sound like an odd thing to say but in the best splatter movies there is an almost unholy joy to be had in watching the slicing and dicing. Just think of those moments when you simultaneously think ""Oh no this is just too gross!"" but burst out laughing because what you have seen is audacious and, yes, downright laugh out loud because you don't know what else to do with your emotions. Here the scenes are just gross and I think, on reflection, that I have this reaction because I had nothing invested in the characters. If only a little more effort had been made in the setup to make me care more about the heroine and her daughter and later some of the characters encountered in Silent Hill then I would have felt much emotional attachment and the gross-out feelings would have transferred to worrying about the characters and made them seem more acceptable. Weird or what?However, much as the experience of watching this film was unpleasant, I also have a terrific admiration for the way in which the nastiness and the kinetic energy of the game experience was conveyed so effectively. I still think that Gans has the capability of making films like no other western director – his sensibilities and eclecticism put me much more in mind of Asian martial arts or anime films than they do of anything coming out of Hollywood. It's also worth saying that some of the sequences and images really stay with you after the film. This is a rare experience in a time when the next film off the conveyor belt gives you a rush the day you see you but is forgotten the very next day when you try to remember what was so good about it. As a failure then this film is considerably better than the average movie and I look forward to Gans next film.Other things you may learn by seeing this film are a) Sean Bean cannot do a convincing American accent and b) not all little girls are capable of looking frightening by being bug-eyed and failing to comb their hair properly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beats All My Favorite Movies!,"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. The look of the movie is great. Everything about it is especially the camera angles. Because I am a SH fan I could follow the movie just fine, but people new to Silent Hill may find this movie hard to follow;unless they had some explaining from a fan. The movie was scary in a way of being disturbing, but it isn't really a movie that makes you jump. By the way, the movie was very disturbing. Radha's acting ways top par in this movie too, and Laurie was the best actress for Cybil. I recommend this movie to everyone.It's definitely a movie you want to see in theater's to get the full experience. Thanks Christophe and Avary.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"Not since The Grudge have I seen so many people in a theater laughing at a horror movie.The dialog in this movie was terrible, the movie is drawn out too long, there's sequences which completely break the flow of the movie, Sean Bean's character is a waste of time, the actors accents pop out constantly, the two cop characters are over-the-top ridiculous, as well as the main characters doing very unnecessary things which don't make sense (Tarzan scene?), loaded with horror movie clichés, and just plain bad.I can't be the only person who doesn't find the ""creepy little girl"" device creepy anymore... can I? This felt a lot like a big-budget B movie... there's no way they should've used a lot of the shots of dialog that they did use... I'm pretty sure they only shot every scene once and moved on.This movie is a waste of time, movie, braincells, etc. Its not even fun to watch like other dumb thriller movies because its so broken up.

Key elements were never explained, several characters served no purpose other than to confuse the story line, and at times there was bizarre sexual tension between Rose and Cybil which I just wanted to laugh at.

I wanted to like this movie, but it went on for about thirty minutes too long and for the rest of the day I was trying to figure out how the hell the writers, director, and actors decided it was a good idea to attach themselves to this movie.

Silent Hill proves that adapting games to the movie screen is not impossible. A great atmosphere and respect to the original material are the secrets to this adaptation,"As in Hollywood, everything that is successful ends up becoming one or more movies, with Silent Hill it couldn't be different. What's more, the Resident Evil game, when it was adapted for the movies, ended up turning into a successful (read economically profitable) movie series. Why not do the same with Silent Hill? The idea of transposing the game to the big screen came in 2000, however, there was a refusal by the Konami company, which was against the project. It was through the insistence of the then future director, Christophe Gans (Necronomicon, 1993), that the film could be made. To do so, he recorded a video, which was sent to Konami, in which he presented reasons and practically begged for the project to be released. Gans also produced, on his own, some scenes that would serve to show the format that Silent Hill would have and for that, he used the soundtrack of the games. Only in 2005, after much negotiation, the film was finally released by Konami.The script that would give rise to the film was written by Roger Avary, who used the first two games in the franchise to serve as the basis for the film version. In the movie plot we meet Rose da Silva (Radha Mitchell), a woman tormented by the constant hallucinations of her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), who, during crises, always screams the name of Silent Hill, a ghost town and who was a victim from a big fire years ago. Antagonizing her husband, Rose decides to go with the girl to that city, in an attempt to find answers to the girl's hallucinations. When they are close to the place, her mother loses control of the car, ends up colliding on the road and passes out. Upon waking up, she doesn't find Sharon and desperate, she leaves for Silent Hill where she starts following a girl who looks like her daughter. That's when Rose finds out that getting out of there isn't going to be easy.The adaptation of Silent Hill must have worried many fans, since the first news that the main character of the game (Henry) would be replaced by a female character, a mother in search of her daughter (and who, by the way, does feeling much more for dealing with much stronger dramatic points, apart from the symbolic connection of the woman as the weaker sex). Silent Hill games have history, and this history, at least part of it, is demystified in the film. Partly, because unfortunately the adaptation of the game to the screen, as was to be expected, has undergone some changes. In fact, it has undergone major changes, but even with this gigantic misrepresentation (those who know the story and watch the movie will understand), the movie still does not become unpleasant in any way for fans of the games. (For those who still haven't understood the presence of Sean Bean's character in the film, and are ignorant enough to say they could be cut out of the film because his character doesn't add anything, here's an explanation, even if it's a silly one: his role it was only created in the plot because the original script, containing only women in the film, was not approved precisely because there were no men in the story, and Sean's character could be the protagonist of a future Silent Hill sequel, if that happens).The choice of Frenchman Christophe Gans (""Brotherhood of the Wolf"") was one of the right ones, as he is known for his spectacular direction and creation of images together with the cinematographers. Gans seems to have studied every inch of the Silent Hill game sets to build every detail and perspective of the place. From the streets that end in abysses to the details of the hospital, everything painstakingly recreated to the delight of game fanatics. And that's not all, some moments in the movie you'll be able to recognize scenes and angles, as well as camera movements identical to the game.And after all, would the bizarreness and violence of the game be present? That was precisely one of the concerns in the game's production, which ended up lightening the violence a little bit, but don't think that will prevent you from seeing those bloody characters nailed to the walls, or the bizarre monsters, such as Pyramid Head. However, all violence in the game has its explanation of being, and it is even measured, but still with a justification, something that certain recent films have not been able to contain.The plot seen on the screens may seem a little complex (or even confusing) for those who are used to direct movies and obvious mysteries, however, it follows exactly the line shown by games avoiding a silly story only with good special effects. In the case of this adaptation, of course the visual aspect is fundamental for a good result, but the film manages to have life beyond that, having a safe and well-developed plot, in addition to several questions that are collected to be answered at the end, which it increases interest in the plot. The production starts with a quick introduction to the story and without wasting much time, it takes the girl (and the audience) to that city. The first point that deserves to be highlighted is precisely showing the plot through the eyes of the heroine and not offering any further explanation, which makes the cinema audience feel almost like a third element in the plot, being afraid and getting confused in this disturbing world and being discovered, at that very moment, by Rose.Deserted, abandoned, dead. This is how Silent Hill is first seen in the film. An atmosphere of restlessness takes over the place at the same time that a constant soot falls from the sky like snow. But it won't be long before a sudden darkness seizes the place to give life to a hell on earth inhabited by terrifying creatures as if coming from a nightmare. It is at this moment that the film shows all its power to impress and terrify (on the same level) by bringing the visual universe of the game to the screen. From then on, the plot begins to present a series of deformed and faceless monsters, claustrophobic, dirty and dark scenarios, bars and chains, creating a terrifying narrative.Even the way in which some takes were recorded can create moments of tension, like the first time Rose encounters the strange beings of the place. Showing the girl's escape through a superior angle that moves away from the ground, the scene is simple, but extremely well conducted for presenting the vastness of the place and the solitude of Rose inside it. The ""inhabitants"" of Silent Hill are also an attraction in their own right and, like cenobites from the Hellraiser universe, they are grotesque but extremely well-conceived, almost like elegant monsters.The film also doesn't stop at strange events and a quick reading, very characteristic of blockbusters, but Gans also presents strong concepts linked to religious symbologies within the film, with churches as a refuge center, or even the mention of the image of Christ preached on the cross, on the girl in bed at the end of the film, which makes us lessen the weight and realize the true location of the identities of the dichotomy presented in the film. These images are also very clear in the stereotype of the beautiful and the ugly, as well as the definition of God.The soundtrack will also be of fundamental importance in this appalling universe, as it seems more like a junction of strange sounds and noises that, interspersed with the scenes, recreate the exact tone of the games. This characteristic does not happen by chance, as director Gans used works signed by composer Akira Yamaoka, responsible for the soundtrack and sound design in Silent Hill games, to incorporate it into the film. The direction was also very happy not to waste time on the item ""scared made by frantic editing and digital sound"". Although there are some, the director bet more on horror itself and without abandoning the game's visual proposal. And in this regard it was the simplest ideas that offered the best results, like when Silent Hill is taken by darkness. Such moments are to make the spine freeze, as it is clear that something bad and dark will happen next. In fact, this dusk is very well used in the film, as it creates scenes in which the audience struggles to see something, realizes it is something dangerous, but it is only possible to see some details that the flashlight can reach.The cast also contributed to the film's final product, starting with Radha Mitchell (In Search of Neverland, 2004), who is very much like a mother driven by fear and love to find her daughter. Pairing up with Mitchell, it fell to Laurie Holden (The Alibi, 1997) to play the macho and angry cop Cybil. It is worth mentioning the child actress Jodelle Ferland who reverses herself in two (or would it be three??) roles and manages to quickly go from a scared little girl to the very representative of evil. Deborah Kara Unger (Highlander 3, 1994) and Alice Krige (Queen Borg, from Star Trek - First Contact, 1996) are two supporting characters who mark the plot as a mad Silent Hill resident and a religious leader, respectively.Silent Hill arrives to prove that adapting games to the movie screen is not impossible. Even with CGI effects that haven't aged well over time and a plot a bit dragged towards the last act, when the action is stopped so that the script provides (lots of) information about the complex plot, the film is a good adaptation of a game for the cinema. Stumbles are nothing to get in the way of the fun too much. In the midst of so many bad game adaptations that hit theaters, Horror in Silent Hill achieves the feat of being an interesting film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent Hill: hard to believe it is from a video game,"It was a surprise to me to find out that ""Silent Hill"" was based upon a video game. It surprised me for two reasons: 1.) This movie was well done unlike most movies based upon video games. And 2.) What kind of video games are being made these days? The story in ""Silent Hill"" was good. A woman's adopted daughter keeps having night-terrors and she was frequently mentioning Silent Hill. The mother, Rose (played by Radha Mitchell), desperate to put an end to these night-terrors decides to take her daughter, Sharon (played by Jodelle Ferland), to the town known as Silent Hill in order to find out what connection her daughter has to that town. Once they arrived the eeriness began.There were several startling and cringing moments. This movie was a borderline between suspense and horror. The creator of this movie was very inventive with the types of creatures that occupied Silent Hill. Even though a lot was discovered about Sharon and her connection to Silent Hill, there were still some unanswered questions at the movie's end. In fact, after Rose and Sharon's visit to Silent Hill just as many questions arose as were answered.Overall the movie was decent. The scenery and aura created was very fitting. The acting was above average as was the story. As I said before, some things were left up in the air so I gave it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably the best of the game adaptations.,"People are very cynical about videogame movies and admittedly there isn't much presidence for a really good one to really show them how it's done.Videogame horror has that advantage of interactivity so it has less need to keep its menace unseen for so long. I'm not sure I'd call this a horror movie but a paranormal adventure but it's really none the worst for that.The atmosphere with mysterious beings emerging from the perpetual mist is quite terrifying and doesn't lose power for being able to see these bodily nightmares up close.I saw this at 12 and I haven't rewatched but even then I was thinking ""this is more macabre than scary"".But it's fun, it's great to look at and is really actiony.I hate rooting for cops and I do wish they had kept closer to the original story now I know it (I miss Harry!) but it's overall a perfectly respectable ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great casting & look but gets everything else wrong,"The story in the games is far better than this story. The film flat-out isn't scary. It's not creepy.

Where was all the subtlety and downright horror of the games? It's been replaced with just gore and unnecessary CGI, such as the unnecessary bugs. Plus, apart from Cybil shooting one monster, no one fights back in the entire movie.

"Surrealist and creepy ""haunted town"" tale","You might learn that this supernatural thriller comes from a video game but don't let it stop you from watching it. It's an adaptation that's actually decent and that works very well as a serious horror film. How did they manage that rare feat? It might be because they hired a talented french director (he did Brotherhood of the Wolf which you should see) who loved the original material and actually found it frightening (which it is). He even had to woo the notoriously protective Japanese producers (Konami) for years to be accepted. The guy was dedicated and he shoots some hellishly beautiful scenes. It might be because the story is engrossing and mysterious. It might be because the mostly unknown actresses (mostly a female cast in the major roles) play it very well and seriously.It might be because the creatures are genuinely creepy and disturbing. I would say they're original and never seen before but actually most of them are concepts from the games brought to life. They were so good I thought they were computer-made but actually it's mostly actors, actually professional dancers, in suits and makeup. And let me tell you having dancers makes a huge difference in terms of having great creature movements that push them a notch above. It might be because it relies more on unnerving atmosphere, nightmarish visuals, dreamlike quality than jump surprises and gore for its scares. Mostly it might be so good because Silent Hill changed stuff but kept the spirit of the games (yes, that's a good thing). Silent Hill is no Resident Evil for those unfamiliar so don't expect zombies or something similar.Some might have issues with the actions of the main character at the start before going into the town. I did too but then I thought about it (the day after) and realized she was doing this against her husband's will as a last ditch attempt to help her daughter. Still... it's a bit reckless and irrational. The other thing that might bug and confuse viewers is that Silent Hill leaves you with questions unanswered. Personally, I like that type of story where they do explain a lot but don't neatly tie up everything. The ending will certainly make you think and second guess. The film itself might even warrant a second viewing for better understanding. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of everything here. It should please horror fans whether or not they're fans of the games provided they watch it with an open mind not expecting their standard American slasher fest.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Captures the mood of the game,"The movie captures the mood of the game beautifully. In the interview on the excellent Shout Factory collector's edition, director Christophe Gans explains that his view (to which I fully subscribe) of the game is that it isn't straight up horror, a genre which is too often reliant on gimmicks like jump scares. He likens the game - and his subsequent movie adaptation - to being stuck in a nightmare from which there is no escape. It's more about setting and mood. One movie which in my mind comes close is the original Candyman (1992) - one of my all time favorite horror movies, where mood is *everything*.Using practical effects instead of CGI to a large extent was a clever move, because most of the movie still looks good to this day. I always thought that the footage of especially Radha Mitchell in the ""Otherworld"" looked slightly weird, but I never really could put my finger on why. It's as if she was filmed in front of a greenscreen and composited onto another background, but with flawless rotoscoping for some reason. Listening to the audio commentary with cinematographer Dan Laustsen it turns out that the ""Otherworld"" sequences were shot on a real set but using a digital camera, leading to a very different image quality and feel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
another abysmal adaptation,"I think Silent Hill the movie was even more disappointing than the Resident Evil movies, which seemed impossible before I viewed this piece of garbage. All they had to do was make a movie with the storyline of the first or second Silent Hill game, not combine elements from the two so it made no sense whatsoever. Either game would have made a great movie by itself, but instead, they felt obligated to carry on the tradition of making the worst possible adaptation when making a movie based on a book or video game. I don't understand how they always come up with the worst script possible for adaptations such as. I wish I could puke on them.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"thoroughly entertaining, but doesn't quite feel like the games","This is an interesting movie, because the games have a very Japanese quality to them, full of creeping dread and weirdness, but the movie has more of an American feel, with straightforward action and scares. I think it probably would have been a more interesting film if it were done more along the line of The Ring, but taken on its own terms it's quite entertaining.I've played all the Silent Hill games except the first one, which is probably what this was based on, so it makes it difficult to know how closely the story was followed. I did read a synopsis of the first game and I think it was something like what was here. I suspect, based on the other games, that the movie took more pains to explain what was going on, although it apparently didn't help since I see a lot of complaints about not understanding the story. I followed it pretty well myself though, and was surprised people were having so much difficulty with it.All in all I liked this movie. While it doesn't quite have the tone of the games, it does have a lot of the look, keeps things moving and has a few nifty scares in it. I'd say it ties with Resident Evil for best game-based movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A faithful translation of the video game that doesn't quite satisfy,"""Silent Hill"" captures the atmosphere of the best-selling video game series but doesn't quite hit the mark. Lumbering the project with too much of a back-story, Christophe Gans' film is good but not great.The visuals are awesome and the movie contains a series of bizarre and blood-chilling spectacles.The soundtrack is also faithful to the games, with Jeff Danna and Akira (The ""Silent Hill"" series) Yamaoka collaborating to great effect.The delightful Radha Mitchell plays the intrepid heroine, Rose Da Silva, who is plunged into the bizarre hell-world. She's accompanied on her nightmare trip by the stunning Deborah Kara Unger. Together they face impossible sights and terrors.7 out of 10. The story felt contrived and shoe-horned into the format but it's an enjoyable excursion and fans of the ""Hill"" will probably enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"EXTREMELY DARK, DISTURBING & ATMOSPHERIC, A HORROR CULT CLASSIC","I have never played the ""Silent Hill"" games so i just make my opinion purely on the movie & oh my, this is a fantastic Nightmare world covered in falling ash.
Silent Hill is a Classic of the Horror genre in my opinion!!! It's full of suspense & has a thick,dark,gloomy Atmosphere that i haven't seen done that well since John Carpenter's CLASSIC ""The Fog"" (1980)!!! With ""The Fog"" it was obviously a thick creeping Fog bank rolling through that small coastal town & here it's also thick fog that's engulfed the town as well as thick white/grey falling ash from it's eternal burning from the under ground & it's done visually stunning!!! The town look is really eerie with it's Smokey-misty-fog, like the early morning look in the winter when that cold mist has engulfed everything, superb cinematography.
The ""Dark"" that comes is seriously scary as a black nightmare takes over the old abandoned town & twisted nightmare creatures stumble out of the darkness!!! It's as affective as it sounds on screen & it's here this movie moves into pure Horror territory with it's twisted-gothic set design, it looks scarily Awesome & the creature fx are Amazing!!!
The back story of the little girl is so sad & disturbing & extremely dark, it's a scary well told slow-burner Horror that really lets the Horror unfold & doesn't rush into easy jump scares.
""Silent Hill"" gets under your skin with it's raw bleakness,
I personally think ""Silent Hill"" is a modern Horror masterpiece, it atleast deserves Cult Classic status but personally i think it's more powerful than that & with it's stunningly detailed sets it's TRULY a work of ART within the Horror genre.We also have an excellent lead in ""Radha Mitchell"" as Rose & she's a great fearless character to follow into this nightmare world of Silent Hill. Radha gives an excellent performance & is completely different from other screaming final girl type women in the Horror genre, here Rose is strong,tough,smart & has bigger balls than most men lol as she searches this evil place full of tortured, demonic creatures whilst looking for her daughter, she's a tough mother.
""Laurie Holden"" is equally excellent in her role as tough & smart no nonsense Cop ""Cybil Bennett"", a great strong performance.The music score/soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself, full of tension & mood & very atmospheric.Silent Hill is stunning visually & creepy as hell with some awesome nightmarish monsters roaming around, this makes a great Horror film setting & a unique new Horror world to explore!!!
The sequel ""Silent Hill:Revelation"" is also very good & does expand & explore more into this nightmare world but it doesn't beat this first cult classic.
Forget the other's comparing it to the video game as i haven't ever played a ""Silent Hill"" game & i loved it purely as a Horror movie!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Entertaining, but...","Let me first say that I extremely enjoyed this movie. I really liked the atmosphere that was created, the CGI was very good, and the monsters were really awesome and frightening. I've played video games but never the Silent Hill series, and I was extremely impressed by how the producers managed to capture much of the spirit of the game in this movie. Silent Hill definitely ranks as one of the best video game movies yet made. That being said the ending left me really confused, and some of the acting was drab. Overall, Silent Hill was a great Friday night movie, especially if you want to be held on the edge of your seat for the entire ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably the best videogame adaptation ever.,"In the cinema, there is this close curse of creating works based on videogames in the worst possible way; adaptations that end up falling into a pit of mediocrity and oblivion both by fans without knowledge about the videogame itself and by fans from Cerrino who were looking for a faithful adaptation. It's something that's been going on for years in Hollywood and it doesn't seem to stop. However, sometimes we are blessed with a gift totally different from the formula that finally works. Silent Hill is a horror movie based on the popular and unique video game, creating what is one of the best adaptations in the world of cinema.Silent Hill can be a bit confusing for those who haven't played video games; it can be enigmatic, different and disturbing, but this is one of the characteristics I can respect. You can see that the director had a great passion for the creation of this film, getting to put a multitude of succulent references within the film and following a perfect archetype to successfully create the feeling that Silent Hill causes, even going so far as to use much of the original OST of the video game. It is an entertaining film that manages to satisfy in the art of the pertubacion, with excellent overwhelming scenes that can traumatize to young spectators. This is a horror movie that builds itself through the visual experience and the disturbing environment, achieving a unique and fantastic scenography like no other. The actors deliver an unexpected quality in this type of film, presenting themselves as excellent protagonists with sympathetic motivations. The film is not perfect, may have overexposed and boring scenes, may even feel slightly long at times, but even so it is a solid horror film that manages to create a unique atmosphere not found in other films of the same genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
a strange experience for non gamers,"Silent Hill is based on a game and we all know that gamers love this flick because it stick close to the creatures in the game and the story. But for people not knowing the back ground of Silent Hill the game this could be a weird flick to watch.The story itself is rather simple but still then for non gamers it could be difficult to follow. Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) the daughter of Rosa (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) has a sleepwalking problem. Not only that, she always mention the name Silent Hill. Rosa is fed up with the problem because Sharon being adopted she wants to go back with Sharon to her birth place to find out what Silent Hill means. But the drive towards Silent Hill isn't without problems, being chased by Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden)a police officer they both crashes down the road. After waking up they find themselves in a deserted place full of mist and falling ashes. Not only that, Sharon is gone. Clear to rescue her daughter together with Cybil they slowly get terrorized by the abandoned city and getting more and more entwined into the disturbing history of Silent Hill.Freaks and strange creatures do move around some done with CGI some in the flesh. Some parts are indeed a bit scary because they used the effects of shadow and light. But again, some of the creatures aren't explained (like the one with the pyramid head) and will be weird to watch with a surreal grandeur. For a game being transformed into a flick it is even sometimes rather gory. Even the score from the game is used now and then. The incoherent story can irritate some viewers. And that's the main problem with this flick. It's a beauty for the gamers but for the unknown it's a complex story even as it is simple as it can get. I had a feeling of a bad flick looking good. It's hard to explain and review. Still, horror buffs will love it because we do see bodies burn and being teared apart. And some creatures do have a Clive Barker overtone.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Waste of Money,"The previews make this movie look as if it is going to be a great scary movie. Unfortunately it is slow. The dialog is awful. Whoever wrote this should not be aloud to write a movie ever again. I understand that it was based off of a video game but surely the game was more interesting than the movie. Some video games should stay video games. I like Crash Bandicoot but I don't want them to make a movie out of it. There is absolutely no jump to it. I'm normally someone who scares easily! I had to watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with the lights on in the middle of the day, this didn't even make me jump once. There are a few redeeming qualities but they come so rarely that it's still not worth it. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent Hill Review,"I've read numerous other reviews talking about how the dialog was bad and they didn't understand the storyline. I decided enough was enough and just decided to see the movie. Now, keep in mind, I have never played any of the Silent Hill games and probably never will; but this is the first good horror movie I've seen in years. Now if you want bad dialog and a milked storyline by all means watch every lame and tiresome installment of the saw, then do the same with hostel. But if you want to be truly scared watch Silent Hill. I've never been scared by any horror movie - ever, until I saw Silent Hill.Let's face it, gore isn't scary - and Silent Hill doesn't rely on gore to scare. It relies on pure suspense, with a perfect balance of pure weirdness and insanity to complement and increase the scary-level of this movie. It doesn't drag out at all, it gives you enough to gain some knowledge and back story, and to also set up the storyline for this film, and even though the film has no super-famous actors or actresses in it - the acting is phenomenal, and as a whole this movie is fantastic, it gets a 10/10 from me, five stars and all that.Seriously, just watch it",,Anonymous,Horror

If I can fully engage into this movie, then horror fans will too!Thrillers that are horrors are the best; that combination, in my opinion make fun and intriguing films. This has both.Plus you care for the main character and you want her to get her daughter back. However the normal everyday person or parent might not do all the things she has to do / deal with, to get her daughter back. And that's part of the scary fun in this movie. Because she goes all out, the way most real-life humans, in a similar unsafe & dangerous situation wouldn't. I'm a proud parent, and I can honestly say that, I probably wouldn't go to the lengths in which she did. Which is why the viewer roots for her. I did.I didn't play the video game that this movie is based off of, and I will never play it. I can imagine that that video game is addictive and a time sucker.

Watchable but loses something as it goes on,"I have never played the game or seen it being played.

No real scares, very little explained. My friend who has played the game helpfully explained what happened at the end as I didn't fully get it, that may just be me though.

When Imagery Defeats Substance,"This movie is a perfect example of a film without a message or story, but still has something to give. From the eerie fog-filled town, to the cuts between the real world with the husband and the world of Silent Hill that the wife/mother is stuck in, to the scene of Pyramid Head tearing the skin off some unlucky individual. The imagery feels as if it comes straight from gothic-styled oil paintings and portrays a town ravaged by sickness of the mind, which we find out is actually the case, as a cult was in control of it, burning supposed witches.The ending makes no sense, some of the acting from the child is hokey, and the atmosphere of the town is not built up enough, despite its 2 hour run time. The movie does well to give you enough visual treats to entice you but doesn't do much of anything to make the characters, story, or setting really feel alive, and what you are left with is a gauntlet of twisted visuals.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overall, for a 2006 movie, very well played out, intriguing, creepy, and very, very fun.","The storyline, although not completely true to the game franchise, is steady throughout the entire movie. There are no pop-out scenes however, (which I have grown to love), but the creatures portrayed in the movie are very creepy and could possibly give nightmares for the faint hearted. The gore is well portrayed and doesn't look fake as, unfortunately it usually does in most horror movies nowadays. It's one of those classics that everyone who sees it has a good review about, unless they just didn't understand it. I love this movie personally, and although it's not a movie to scream in terror at, it does deliver a truly haunting, disturbing effect on the viewer.

Am I alone?,"Well, I may be a dissenting vote, but I thought Silent Hill was pretty bad. Yes, some of the visuals were very good (hence a score of 5 and not less)...but the story line, how silly! In trying to put in all the elements of the game (which I have played often), they crammed way too much to make this a good story. Rather, it's one shock scene after another. While that works in the beginning, it gets old pretty soon. And that ending...please, couldn't you think of a more creative (and logical) way to finish the story. Sorry but even ""doom"" was more interesting...and that wasn't very good either! I hope the next Resident Evil movie makes up for this fiasco!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Must Have an Extended Version!,"It's hard to write about this movie, because the reaction to it depends somewhat on having or not played the games. This movie is based on Konami's ""Silent Hill"" series of games, mainly on the first, with elements of the second. Some people that have played the games seem to have failed to realize that, expecting to see a ""film version"" of the first game, what this movie is not! SH is based on the games, not converted from them, fortunately. The only complaint I have about this movie is that it is too short, the plot is too complex for a two-hours movie, some scenes could be expanded and some speeches slowed down (with longer background sequences).The characters are mostly from the first game, the others are originals. Their development is much better than in the game, mostly because the characters wander alone in the first game. In the movie, the characters stay together most of the time (it's not ""Scooby-doo"", they do not separate when things get rough...) The actors also play very well their roles, mainly the little girl. Pay attention to her eyes, they tell more about the story than is actually said.One thing that is preserved from the games (and even enhanced) is the background, the ""something-scary-is-coming"" atmosphere. If the movie was longer, some elements of the games that appear in the movie could have been better used, but that doesn't make the movie less enjoyable.And after watching the movie, I realized something that is not so obvious in the games: humans are the real monsters (and I don't mean only in the games/movies!) The demons stalking in Silent Hill don't compare in evilness to the humans hiding there! If you can't cope with violence in movies, especially in this one, then don't read the morning newspapers, lock the doors and stay in bed... And once you are at it, play ""Silent Hill"", the game, it has not one, but TWO different ""happy endings""! Real life is not so merciful...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Somewhat deceptive,"I haven't written a review in a long time. But I feel I have some semi-insightful ideas to contribute to the reviewing of Silent Hill. So.....I originally bought this film as soon as it came out on DVD. I watched it right away, put it on the shelf, and pretty much forgot about it. Today, something drew my girlfriend and I to Silent Hill, and we decided we would watch it again.I had a decent recollection of the film, but decided I would open IMDb and read a little bit to refresh my memory some more. Upon logging on, I noticed I originally gave it a score of 6/10. I also noticed that it's overall rating was 6.5. That intrigued me a bit as I assumed it was much lower. Plus, my favorite horror film of all time happens to have that same rating. So, I had semi-high hopes as my opinion of many films has changed over the years.Right from the start, it is very appealing. They waste no time whatsoever getting to the relevant stuff. The film has literally no empty, needless minutes, like many 100+ minute films have (The best example of this would be many of Stephen King movie adaptations). And I must say, 45 minutes to an hour in, I was beginning to wonder why I rated it as low as I did. Everything was moving along quite nicely. Very creepy, very interesting.Then, the second half of the film started to take it's course, and everything started going downhill. The eerie atmosphere and suspense created by the creatures themselves started to dissipate as we begin to see less and less of that aspect of the film. The focus began to shift completely to the actual history and story itself, which is not necessarily a bad thing, by any means. But, I feel they did a poor job of incorporating the terror and fear of the present situation, and the urgency of the task at hand. And as a result, the whole second half of the film became quite dull.Then you have the crazy religious freak, which gradually goes from a significant but simple part of the story, to a shameless attempt to portray religious people in as negative a light as possible. We've seen enough of that in films these days. If the opportunity presents itself, even in the slightest fashion, it is capitalized on nearly every time. But that, in itself, does not ruin a film for me.The real problem comes as we get closer and closer to the conclusion of the film. And it's a problem I see repeatedly, mainly in the horror genre. The relentless desire and attempt to create dramatic effect and shock value ends up creating aspects of the film that are just completely over the top. It's as if the director reaches a plateau of fright and apprehension, and then just cannot resist trying to take it one level higher. Typically, this ends up taking away from the film, overall. This is a real problem with MANY films. In fact, I watched another horror film last night that had me thinking the exact same thing.There are also some confusing elements and loose ends that are ultimately not tied up. I wont get into detail on those. I suppose there is something to be said for leaving certain things to the imagination. But everything has to be just right for that to work. That really didn't appear to be the case with this film. Still, it is NOT BY ANY MEANS, Mulholland Dr.-type confusion and uncertainty. But then again, no film has confusion and uncertainty to rival that mess.Overall, it's decent. It's user rating is fairly close to accurate. Definitely not a waste of time, but certainly nothing that will rock your world in any way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Decent video games to movie adaptation but just not a good movie,"This is a video game to movie adaptation from the video game franchise called ""Silent Hill"". And this is a mix of ""Silent Hill 1"" and ""Silent Hill 2"" when it comes to the video games that is integrated into this movie. The story sorta follows the plot of ""Silent Hill 1"" but the premise and atmosphere is more similar to ""Silent Hill 2"". Anyways both games is about trying to find someone and that is basically the plot to this movie as well. A girl constantly calls out Silent Hill sleep walks a lot so instead of psychiatric the mother Rose(Radha Mitchell) decides to take her to Silent Hill although the husband played by Sean Bean is against it. And as farther it she goes into the town of Silent Hill things start to become nightmarish as more secrets unravel. Especially when the siren starts to ring. Unlike the ""Resident Evil"" movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson that has nothing to do with the video games. This one at least tries to be faithful to the video games this is based off of. Christophe Gans probably did his research and tried to please the fans of this video game franchise or something. Because the atmosphere and direction is similar to the game, even how items are found and etc. But the thing is some actions and scenarios that might work for a video game doesn't always come off as something positive when put into a movie. Rose just seemed to be off her rockers most of the time and her actions sometimes doesn't make much sense. Especially in the beginning where she tries to outrun the cop. Who is actually a character from the first Silent Hill video game play by Laurie Holden. That actually pulls of the character Cybil pretty well. The thing is watching characters go in the direction like video game character doesn't make it a good movie, especially since sometimes it feels like your watching someone play a video game but without the emotional tug and engaging story. And it isn't all that scary like the video games this is based off of especially since your not the one controlling the characters. I give it props for trying to follow the direction of the video games this is based off of but there is little to not tension in this. They got the atmosphere right but it just didn't have the psychedelic and ominous and yet dreamlike feel from the Silent Hill video games that it is known for. And those are the main elements that makes the games stand out. And some parts in this movie just seemed irrelevant and out of nowhere but that works in the context of the video games but not really as a movie. For a video game adaptation this movie is decent but it's not a good movie either.6.3/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overrated, but still watchable","Taking a trip together, a woman and her daughter trying to see if they can help cure her illness are involved in an accident outside the town of Silent Hill, and once she finds a small group of survivors inside the town helps fight off the creatures lurking in the shadows to save her daughter.This here does have some great parts to it. One of the better features here is that the film is filled with some completely outlandish and quite unearthly creatures. One character is attacked by a horde of gray-skinned mutant children with glowing orange wounds on the skin. Two more are approached by a bizarre, gray character with no face or arms and moves as though its bones are misshapen and spew acidic ash when wounded, while another creation crawls on its stomach with its feet bound up in an arch over its back alongside the giant metal-gate headed being and the mutated nurses to make for a genuinely creepy assortment of creatures living in the town. Also rather enjoyable here is the highly-energetic action scenes throughout here. There are plenty of quite jolting scenes in here, the highlight is a marvelously creepy scene where one character must try and squeeze their way through a corridor full of mutant nurses. When she realizes they're drawn to and seemingly activated by her flashlight, she turns it off and they mostly go motionless. She then slowly and cautiously must walk through them in the hallway, with most frozen and holding scalpels, but some slightly leaning in as if trying to sniff her. After one becomes agitated and twitches, it then lashes out, missing her but slicing the throat of another and This causes all of them to be lash out and strike each other, with her barely avoiding being cut. Another scene with a creature trapping two in a small room with a super-long blade, followed by a large swarm of flesh-eating beetles. There's plenty of big attack scenes in here to provide some thrills and plenty of really quite nasty and sadistic gore scenes which are all quite impressively rendered and look great. This here did have some good points although there were many problems with the film. One of the problems is that this might be confusing to people who aren't familiar with the game. Most things are left unexplained and there were times that any sort of explanation would've been better than what was offered. Not saying anything about what is going on with practically anything in the town at all, which is a complete mystery and there's no back-story given for anything or anyone. The incredibly confusing ending is one of it's biggest flaws, as it's so completely confusing and hard-to-understand that its inclusion leads no answers. Also quite damaging is the film's over-extended running time. This is mostly conveyed with the husband's useless, bloated scenes that add nothing to the movie but information which is given to us in the journey anyway. This is a movie that could benefit greatly by having about twenty or thirty minutes cut out of it, and it wouldn't be too surprising if that would've made the film any different. They have no effect on the outcome of the happening at all, and it's inclusion, along with the different plot-holes and confusion, really lower this one highly.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and children in danger.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Meant for fans of SH and horror films,"I would only recommend this movie if you are a fan of Silent Hill or horror films. The visuals are outstanding, the acting was good, but allot of things could have been better. My main complaint about the movie is that as cool and original as all the different creatures are, they hardly ever explain anything about them. They just pop up, look scary, and then disappear so the next monster can do the same thing. Who are they? What are they? What do they want? Why are they there? Things like that never get answered...with one exception. Other then that and the movie being a little drawn out at times, I would recommend watching it. Even with its flaws, it is still better then most horror films and far better then any movie based on a video game. But like I said I would only recommend this movie if you are a fan of Silent Hill or horror films. There are some very graphic images in this movie so if you have a weak tolerance for gore steer the other way.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Almost had it....!,"Video game to movie adaptation. Are those alarm bells I hear?Silent Hill introduces us to a rather disturbed little girl, Sharon, and her protective parents. Sharon has been sleepwalking and the final straw for her mother, Rose, comes after an encounter with a very high cliff top. So Rose does what any sensible, intelligent mother does and takes Sharon off to the town of Silent Hill - the name Sharon has been muttering in her nocturnal adventures. Being a horror movie, and with a name as creepy as Silent Hill, we're about to find out this is the place of nightmares.To get it over with, as a video game adaptation, Silent Hill somewhat bucks the trend and provides us with an entertaining couple of hours. Stunning visuals and production values make it very easy to watch and coupled with the score, it is easy to get lost in Silent Hill. But like a lot of video games (and lets face it, movies too), the storyline has enough holes to rival a sieve. Rose makes countless, illogical decisions and not enough is revealed to the audience as the film dawdles along. Finally about two thirds of the way in and approaching the climax, the film kicks into overdrive and a barrage of revelations are made - which is all well and good but with so much information to take in it all gets rather convoluted and confusing...I liked the film a lot but it's really a classic case of style over substance. If only they had paid half as much attention to fine tuning the story as they had with the imagery and attention to detail, Silent Hill would really be cream of the video game-to-movie crop.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good movie. Brilliant adaptation.,"Personally I loved this movie, mainly because I am a big fan of the games and felt that the movie stuck very close to the game in many ways. The cinematography was excellent and I was gripped right until the end. I can understand the negative feedback that this movie has had, I think is mainly due to these 'critics' not actually having any experience of the Silent Hill world prior to viewing the movie. The only negative thing to me was the ending, I found it rather disappointing and not as scary as the rest of the film. All in all I would highly recommend this movie, but only if you research the story a little before going to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
very disappointing,"Just watched this last night.I had mixed expectations as it had received very good reviews and comments on here but on the other hand it is a film of a video game which in my opinion a half decent film has never come out of that equation.I found the film quite boring,special effects were nothing special,acting was wooden and the plot quite hard to follow.I have not played the games so maybe you need to be a fan of the games to enjoy this film.Sean Bean sleepwalks his way through the script,Radha Mitchells performance was adequate I suppose.I would like too see more of her work before passing judgement on her abilities. I think the younger viewers and video game players would like this sort of movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gans' Gob Of Grandoise Gamey Genius Undone By Avary's Asinine Articulations,"What a disappointment. Or not. What the hell is Silent Hill, anyway?Silent Hill is the best video game adaptation made so far. If anyone makes a list of the ten greatest images in the history of horror films, if this doesn't have at least one spot on there, then there is no such thing as justice. This movie looks fantastic. The set design by Cronenberg Woman is astounding and evocative, the cinematography is pretty much perfect, the creature effects are magnificent, the direction is amazingly confident.Having said that, it just doesn't connect.The script, by Roger Avary, seems to be attempting to sound like a video game. In other words, the dialogue is mostly not so good at all. Almost all of the dialogue feels off, both in delivery and in the actual writing. While the movie is going for a surreal, dream-like feeling, the middle section has a few major groaners, once it turns into downright flat exposition it gets next to impossible to stay in the movie. Of course Christophe Gans, a fellow whose visual skill is impeccable in my opinion, thought the script was great, but that's because he speaks English as a second, or maybe even third language.Anyway, the exposition part is done in this cool-looking flashback, but it's totally unnecessary. As is Boromir of Gondor even being in the movie. The movie's central problem is that its story, while initially intriguing (that's because there really isn't much of any for the first hour, just wandering), just doesn't work. It doesn't work because it doesn't connect emotionally with the audience. Even when it has the potential to, it segues into its middle hour, which is by far the worst part of the movie.But the problem with calling the movie bad is that it's way too damn cool. I think someone else said that it's good in all the right places and bad in all the wrong ones. It's the very definition of an uneven movie. There is so much right in this movie. The soundtrack, from the games, is brilliant. And as I said, the way everything is visualized is fantastic, although the parts where the monsters melt into ash is a bit excessive and unnecessary.A lot of people, mainly the ones who haven't played the games, will have no idea what is going on. This is only partially the fault of the filmmakers, because the studio's handling of the movie attracted the wrong crowd. It got teenage guys taking their girlfriends to a scary movie on Friday nights, and by not screening it for critics in the US it got the grouchy, fairly unintellectual Saturday critics, who totally missed the point, or at least the good parts.The studio's handling of it is worse than any element of the movie, except maybe the part where Radha Mitchell (who is pretty terrific, if slightly awkward due to accent change) and Laurie Holden (who plays the cop who wears sunglasses 24 hours a day and who every critic thinks is a lesbian because she wears tight pants and has short hair) are walking down the street: Laurie Holden:They used to say this town was haunted. Radha Mitchell:It looks like they were right.Except for that part, the studio's handling of it is much, much worse than the worst parts of this movie.I dearly hope that Silent Hill is successful enough for a sequel to be produced, because although it's definitely a love-it-or-hate-it affair (sometimes both at the same time), if Gans and company realized the mistakes they made the first time, the Silent Hill universe still holds bountiful possibilities.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Like watching somebody else playing the game...,"By definition, any film version of a PC game that sticks as close to the plot of the game as this film appears to do is going to lose the vicarious thrill a player enjoys when playing the game. Watching this film has to be pretty much like sitting next to somebody you don't know while they play the game. The impressive visuals of the ghost town wrapped in a haze of white ash from the fires that have burned beneath it for thirty years can only keep you interested for so long and, once the action goes underground, the interminable succession of shots of plucky mum Radha Mitchell running down dark corridors away from vaguely defined phantoms as she searches for her daughter quickly grows boring. Character development is non-existent  which, again, is OK with a game because you are the hero, but is a death knell to any film  and, as he did in The Dark, Sean Bean once again plays the most pointless of characters. Completely passive, adding nothing to the plot, and serving only to offer an occasional change of scene from the dim alleyways of Silent Hill, he is totally redundant. The guy must really be desperate to crack the US market to accept a role like this. I don't remember Bean and Mitchell, who play husband and wife, sharing a single scene, so you can imagine the chemistry there: Bean could probably pass Mitchell in the street without knowing who she is.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Very unfairly silent.""","Many years before anyone expected Silent Hill to become a video game film, many people before that time excluded the idea of it being 'the worst', but also in most cases 'the best', for any attempt into being portrayed as the perfect adaptation based on a popular franchise that quickly - and subjectively - went downhill after the second sequel (Silent Hill 3). With this film being loosely based on the first installment, there's a lot of shoes to fill and plenty of time to adjust viewers to the story.Unfortunately, many important things was changed from the original story and that alone shows that yet again a video game film adaptation has failed to simply stay closer to the source material rather than create an entirely new story that will contradict the chronological order the actual games set into place. But that's not to say some of the changes are all bad, because it was an interesting change to see the original male protagonist, Harry Mason, changed to a new female character, Rose, that still follows the main story without being too damaging.The original plot followed a man that attempts to find his lost daughter, Cheryl, in an abandoned ghost town named Silent Hill for most of the similar reasons Rose does. But Rose is there for an even bigger excuse as her daughter has nightmares about the area. For most of the film, the cast and crew attempts their hardest to capture the essence of the original series, in ways, and only manages...in milder ways. Though it's a very tough adaptation to dislike, it's also a very tough adaptation to care for as some fans may feel just as disappointed with the changes and overall execution of everything.Yes, it's nostalgic and fun to see familiar faces and areas revisited on film, but Silent Hill doesn't completely live to the name - it's very unfairly silent.",,Anonymous,Horror
The best movie-to-game adaptation ever,"Silent Hill is easily the best video game adaptation ever made. Sadly, that isn't saying too much. Director Christophe Gans absolutely nails all of the cryptic mythology of the video game series, and from the art direction it's obvious that Akira Yamaoka, the creative genius behind the video game series, had a heavy hand in the movie's creation. It also fits nicely into the time line of the game series as a prequel to the first game. The movie irrefutably falters in the one area I had hoped it wouldn't, however. Silent Hill just isn't scary. It seems as though the writers and the director were so preoccupied with getting the twisted, byzantine back story right that no one ever stopped to ask, ""This is a horror film, right? Shouldn't we at least try to make it a little scary?"" It actually reminds me a little of why I disliked the first Silent Hill game so much. There's potential for a good story there, but it gets lost among the copious bizarro, metaphysical, go-nowhere exposition. That's why most fans of the series agree that the second game has the best story. Silent Hill 2 is a much more personal tale as it pays little attention to the series' confusing mythology. Gans actually said in an interview (in EGM, I think) that he thinks the material from the second game would have made for a better movie than the first one. I agree. So here's hoping for a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"good special effects,flawed story","When I first heard that they were going to make Silent Hill into a movie, I thought that it would be another video game movie disappointment. While I thought it was very creepy and shot well,I thought it was unevenly paced,some of the dialog was week and the overall plot of the story could have been better. I have not player the game,so I'll assume that it can explain one major question,that for some reason,the filmmakers decided they didn't need to answer. If you have not seen this movie,let's just say you'll be scratching your head at the end. Ultimately, if you are a fanboy,you will probably love this movie. If not, then you should probably wait for it on video. If you absolutely have to see this movie,go in with great reservation and maybe you won't be disappointed.

Pour out ""Silent Hill"", the new movie that will puzzle many but delight the S.H. video game fans. Oh how I wish this production crew had done Resident Evil. It looks great and creeps along to jumpy climaxes (much like the game) in a set I found to be very reminiscent of that seen in the game.I found it interesting that all the major characters that are actually in the soup are women. Rose, Sharon, Cybil, Dahlia, Anna and ChristaBella(?), an over-the-top religious cult-leader zealot.

All it takes is a couple brain cells,"To understand the plot. It is seriously simple. I'm honestly questioning the whole of humanity here right now. Like existential crisis type stuff. I have read so so many reviews saying the plot is complicated. I just. I. uh. Cannot comprehend. I'd like to think you just weren't paying attention.. and maybe that was the case. I hope so.Now on to the movie. Atmosphere/spooky vibe is bar none one of the best. Put yourself in her shoes. How scary would being in a place like Silent Hill be? The acting is not the best but sufficient (as many have already pointed out Sean Beans skills are totally wasted in this and his character really doesn't serve a satisfactory, complimentary presence to the main action in the film. Most of his screen time was him taking jabs at Kim Coates character, and not really doing much until near the end. He should have served to offer more plot). The pacing of the story is unique and enjoyable. You slowly learn bit by bit more about the story until the imminent ""darkness"" comes and horrors come flooding from beyond rusted iron fences and dark dangerous corridors and then it's about mere survival. I see a lot of horror fans complaining about this movie not delivering ""enough gore"" or ""enough"" well.. ""horror"". I have seen many horror/thrillers and I very much lean towards the ones with more substance and meaning and atmosphere over scares. Gore holds no appeal to me, and I very much do not understand the appeal. There is gore in this movie and it is plenty for me. The focus is the scary atmosphere and the interaction with this decrepit and horrific ghost town via the main character as the plot unfolds sort of in the background. I think they do this so extremely well. Either you get it or you don't, nothing wrong with having different tastes but if you're looking for scares and nail biting gore, you may have been one of the ones who did not enjoy this. But if you're like me and it's about the atmosphere for you and about the plot and the vibe, it is by far one of the absolute best. The musical score really adds to the creepy atmosphere too and ties in with the amazing visual spectacle that this movie offers.One of my all time favorite horror movies and will continue to be I'm sure. I've gone back to it multiple times and always enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great Visuals, Lacking Movie","First off, i have been a huge fan of the silent hill games and have played all of them. The movie really does a great job conveying the visuals from the game. The fog is awesome, the creatures look perfect, pyramid head is the best looking one in the film. The soundtrack is great too. The music from the game i thought always sound good and gave a real eerie feeling but here is sounds so much better. But all these great visuals cant make up for the rest of the movies pit falls. The first thing i noticed was that the acting was pretty bad. Every ""it's going to be OK"" line made me laugh. The story line didn't make much sense. It didn't seem very thought out. Bottom line: Worth a view just for the visuals and fans of the game should see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not so Silent Hill,"I played Silent Hill 2, a few years ago, although I never adhered to the big fans of the series. I'm more a Resident Evil kind of guy - staying in the characters and in the storyline, not so much in the psychological realms of 'what the heck does this mean?'. So, in a way, I'm envious, because the movie looks a lot like the games (although there seem to have been a lot of compromises in constructing it - characters from one game, storyline from another, etc; or so my big SH fan - informer tells me).However, Silent Hill suffers from a totally different disease than the Resident Evil franchise: the games are very engrossing, mind-boggling, they take you to the edge of perception and logic. A really hard thing to do in a film, without making it feel shallow and cold. Such an attempt would call for a great script. A script which, sadly, turns out to be so uninspired and poorly written, that it ruins all the fun.The story about a mother looking for her child - mysteriously drawn to the town of Silent Hill - is nothing but a long and tedious pretext for atmosphere. I hate to say it, but to make Silent Hill so 'worldly' as a story about witchcraft and silly monsters just isn't creepy enough. You do feel at times that the director tries to transfer ideas from the world of the games to the world of film, in the sense of Silent Hill being not only a typical 'ghost town' story, but also a metaphorical place of demise and sin, the most horrid depths of ones mind - a big, entrenching nightmare. But this barely works. In the end you're left with silly lines of dialog, mediocre acting at its best (not that one could have done much more with such lines) and - what I felt it to be - mundane lighting (in the idea of what scares you most is what you don't see; just that it doesn't quite work).I may have enjoyed the musical theme at certain moments, as it had a very dreamy ring to it - as it should've. But then again, it just wasn't enough. For a film which is two hours long, Silent Hill has very little contents to offer. It's not even the nightmare I always dreamt it to be.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Faithful to the Core,"This got to be the most realistic adaptation of a video game to movie today, and yet it works as a stand-alone movie. The problem with movies that are based on game and book is that if you have played the game or read the book already you will feel as if you were watching a re-run. For those that have not played the game, it will be a lot of information one needs to sort through to understand it. For most part, this movie copies the looks and feels of the game spot-on. The first half of the movie WILL send goose-bumps up and down your back as the town of Silent Hill and the atmospheres that surrounds it seems to rip it right off the game itself. I will tip my hat to the production designer for this film as he or she did an outstanding job. Nothing beats the creepiness of a lone woman walking down an empty street in an abandon town with a bad dose of ju-ju.The monsters in this film are few when comparing to other movies that are based on video game, and their appearances are brief. Also, due to the nature of Silent Hill's game play, the protagonist doesn't engages the monsters but rather, avoiding them. The computer special effects are what drives this movie, and they will shock-and-awe you.The pace of this film is also slower than most of movies of video game, but this is needed to provide the necessary creepy atmosphere that's the mainstay of the game, but 2/3 into the movie the pace of the storyline becomes bogged down with dialogs trying to explain everything. Which makes this film that is not heavy on the actions seems even slower to those who was bred on MTV.All in all, I like this movie for its truthfulness to the game it is portraying and the craftsmanship of the production value, and at two hours long it doesn't seems to be long enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely a different horror experience....,"Well, for one thing I work in a movie theatre and some of the other people who work with me got to see a ""preview"" the night before (basically the managers and supervisors) and I had gotten a really good review of the film. I went at the 9:40 showing the night it opened with a couple of my buddies and we had high expectations.Now, to say that it was a bad horror movie would be bad. Horror-wise this movie was great: scary, suspenseful, gory. The movie's only downfall is that it is hard to understand at its fast pace...we were left with a lot of questions at the end. Other than a non-understanding factor, I really enjoyed the movie.

I want my time back.,"Oh, please, viewer... Won't you please see me as a deep and creative filmmaker?No. I won't. I watched the whole thing from beginning to end, and after the first 15 minutes, I found myself thinking, ""self, there's a difference between a complex, interesting film, and a vague and desperate one."" This movie is nothing more than an attempt to capitalize on a popular video game, and in the end, leaves so many threads hanging that even the director can't explain them. As a whole, it was nothing but a mashup of creepy images, monsters, vague myths, and incomplete backstory that's told in a short ""film"" presentation - a technique not even the most amateur writer would use. The viewer is never offered the chance to figure anything out.

Creepy...,"I had the sense while viewing Silent Hill that the makers of this film were aiming for box office business that the Ring and the Grudge conjured up.Silent Hill reminded me a lot of the Ring: both are heavy on psychic elements; contain young, malignant evildoers; and rely heavily on creepy atmosphere, instead of outright gore.Although Silent Hill is a bit more creepier and intense than the Ring, the storyline is not as immersive: the characters are given short shrift, while the creepy backdrop is given substantial more detail. The film felt more like an interactive video game, like the one which it was based, than a narrative film with solid story construction.I did like many parts of the film, though. There are imageries in the film that clearly stand out: the creatures are imaginatively rendered and are truly grotesque. Also the mood and the atmosphere of the film were dreadful and gloomy throughout, clearly appropriate for the film of this kind.I give Silent Hill a solid 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""This town is the grain, and I am the reaper.""","Well it took many tries, and sub sequentially, many failures, but it has finally been done; a good movie-going experience based off of a video game. French filmmaker Christophe Gans and Pulp Fiction screenwriter Roger Avery have brought to the big screen a completely faithful film experience that lives up to the game's bizarre imagery and twisted reality, and surprisingly it doesn't rely heavily on fast editing and loads of CGI effects. The film is an experience; much like the Silent Hill games, you journey into the darkness and spiral down into a hellish nightmare that has you coming face to face with your worst fears, and no one can hear your screams in the town of Silent Hill.The film isn't perfect it does have a few issues that have to be overlooked in order to enjoy this movie. One of the problems is the films running time, two hours may not sound like a very long movie, but Silent Hill is a dreary, very slow-moving journey into the unknown, and much like the games, when you're not being chased or attacked by a bunch of creatures the experience is rather dull. Thankfully Gans, working along side creature make-up effects creator Patrick Tatopolos, whose previous films include Independence Day and Underworld, have really created some truly ferocious monsters that inhabit the ghostly town, adding just the right amount of freakishly scary and psychologically ""that's screwed up!"" edginess to the film. Gans' never pulls any of his punches with the blood or gore either, which only made some of the scenes seem to stick in your mind a little longer after having left the theater.However when these amazing looking creatures aren't on screen is when the film seems to falter. The Silent Hill games were really about getting a spine-tingling delight out of creeping through dark, rotten and rusty corridors in near total darkness, just waiting for something evil to reach out and grab you. The movie does seem to have a problem of moving really, really slowly, but then again this is very similar to the games. Like last year's big screen adaptation of Sin City, Silent Hill also stays very close to the look, feel, style, pace and sound of the games, heck, they even went ahead and decided to use the entire soundtrack from the game throughout the film, which worked wonderfully, and the film also puts Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" to amusing use. Silent Hill isn't another Tomb Raider or Resident Evil clone, it's a monster all its own. What is also strangely unique is that the majority of the cast is female (there's really only two male leads in the entire film), and the main character doesn't run around fully armed to the teeth with semi-automatics blasting away baddies and using stylish kung fu and is heavily experienced and trained in combat; she's just an average mother and for the most of the time is completely defenseless; this is a totally different ballgame all together.The plot of the film revolves around a sick little girl named Sharon DaSilva, who sleepwalks at night and constantly talks about a place called Silent Hill, which she's never been to before. Her mother, Rose is played by Radha Mitchell (you might remember her from Pitch Black or Man on Fire), and she decides to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, hopefully looking for answers for what's wrong with her daughter. As it turns out Silent Hill is a ghost town that has been restricted and locked away from the public, supposedly because the fires which destroyed the town and pretty much everyone in it a long time ago are still a hazard and still burn deep underneath the town. This doesn't stop Rose from trying to get Sharon to Silent Hill, but once they arrive in town strange and unexplainable things start to happen. The town is covered in a constant thick fog that showers down ashes like falling snow. Rose looses her daughter in the mysterious town and sets out on foot to find her, and along the way she meets several strange people and shes constantly attacked by various demonic creatures that are waiting around every corner. What happened to this town? Why does her daughter keep mentioning it? And what evil lurks deep within this Hell-on-Earth?This is a very different kind of video game movie; it's slow paced, confusing and visually fascinating. This horror-thriller doesn't use fast edits and quick ""jump scares"" to shock audiences, instead it uses brutally dark and haunting imagery and bizarre and insane looking monsters to scary the living hell out of you. The story is just as foggy as the town itself, but much like when I was only ten-years-old and used to watch episodes of ER, even though I didn't fully understand exactly what was going on at any given moment, I did however, get the jest of it, and to one degree or another did understand it, just not completely. The film's ending might leave some people scratching their heads but if you've played the games you'll know that this is really just a set up for a possible sequel. Silent Hill is an interesting, but certainly flawed film, and it's a uniquely disturbing trip into a maddening darkness that I can't quite remember the last time I experienced something quite like it in the theaters, and that's why I'm recommending you check out the film, especially if you're not only a fan of the games, but also a fan of real horror movies that aren't filled with stupid teenagers and slapped with a weak PG-13 rating that seem to be a dime a dozen these days; Silent Hill is a rarity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"On par with Resident Evil, if not slightly better","Saw this last night - my hopes were reasonably moderate given that I'd been looking forward to it since discovering Roger Avary and Christophe Gans were involved, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. That's not to say I thought it was fantastic - there was a fair bit of bad stuff in it, such as Radha Mitchell's unconvincing acting and some of the lines she was given, and the whole Sean Bean part which was tacked on at the studio's ""request"".That said, it was very enjoyable, freaky and disturbing enough with a cracking climax, although the end was slightly annoying. A lot of people said they were confused - it's not really that confusing as long as you take a moment to think about who's who and whats happening. Just think of parallel dimensions and manifestations of spirits etc. I have to say the climax (as opposed to the end) was definitely memorable.

"Time passer has visual appeal, but little substance","When I picked this movie from the bargain bin the title ""Silent Hill"" meant nothing, and it looked like an interesting horror movie. However, once I began watching it quickly became apparent it was based upon a video game. Something in the sweeping camerawork, meticulously conceived sets, and character POV, further reinforced by its endless pursuits and diversions. You can almost hear the Ching-Ching reward every time the protagonist chooses the correct path or finds a way to outdo an enemy.
The plot, such as it is, is about a sleepwalking girl, Sharon (Joelle Ferland), dreaming of going to a place called Silent Hill, so her mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell) takes her on a road trip in search of the mysterious dreamscape.
En route the car crashes and when Rose regains consciousness she finds that Sharon has disappeared, and it becomes a quest to find the child among the deserted buildings of Silent Hill. It looked, to me, a cold, misty place, of gently falling snow.
Rose spots a small figure and follows it into dark cavernous depths where she is confronted by deformed, faceless creatures, wailing and writhing before bursting into flames. From what I could gather, the story is that the town is built atop a mine that caught alight burning to death all the residents both below and above ground. It is then evident the mist is, in fact, smoke, and the snow is ash.
So far, so good...
Regrettably, the movie then lurches into countless muddled directions, involving all manner of creature and creed, and finishes in a final act of brutal revenge. The violence ls graphic and its a cockeyed journey.
Granted, there is some great body horror and special fx.
Nonetheless, the story is so convoluted, the characters so empty, that it is difficult to engage with.
Actor Sean Beans only discernible purpose is to play the anguished father at the end of the movie to distinguish between two different planes of existence.
The structure of this movie does make sense as a game designed to maximise player time by putting them in a maze-like framework -up and down, round and round,in and out-with a view to immersing them in a myriad of complicated scenarios with minimum pay offs.

One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen,"My girlfriend and I watched this movie in the theaters and we both agreed it was a complete waste of time and money.

This movie was just plain awful.Admittedly I have never played the video game and am not a gamer. I am over 30 years old and everyone else in the audience was in high school. I think if you are over 25 years old you cannot possibly enjoy this film unless you still have the aptitude of a teenager, or excuse me for saying this, are mentally retarded or a complete moron.The story made absolutely no sense. The characters were not in the least bit interesting and the acting was really bad. I am not only surprised, but am utterly appalled and that this movie has a 6.5 rating.

I believe it was no small task to make something like the Silent Hill franchise with its impactful visuals come to life, but I truly believe they've done it. Having this in mind, it's crazy that this movie came out in 2006!I hated the second movie after watching it on TV late at night, but for some reason I hadn't watched the first. This one is much better and I really can't put into words how good a watch it is, much more so than the crap that was the second movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally a conversion to talk about!,"I haven't read many of the other comments for this film so it's quite possible I am repeating others.I cannot express how impressed I was with this film. After the Tomb Raider and Residnet Evil films I was quite fearful about even the thought of making this film. Hollywoods insistence in making films that will be a commercial success and not necessarily a good film is a real grind but gladly this did not happen here.I will concede that playing and enjoying the games will help with the enjoyment and maybe understanding of this film but not essential. I took my girlfriend who had barely heard of a play station let alone the game Silent Hill and she got along with the film fine. The end needed a little explanation but that was all.There are only two small complaints I have about this film.First, a little on the long side. I am a firm believer that horror films should be short and blunt, the classic 90 minutes of fear.Second, Sean Bean's accent really made me cringe. Granted I was never a fan of his back when he was working on British TV, but his forced Americanisms just made me want to put my boot in his mouth every time he opened it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad, could have been better.","This was not a bad crossover from a video game to a movie in respect to some other movies that were made from similar genre such as Alone in the Dark, which was terrible, and Resident Evil. In addition I played every one of those video games. I understood there was going to be some compromise from fitting in a 9-hour video game story into a 2 hour movie, but for any of you who played the game would realize that the characters a bit different (No Harry Mason) so is the story, which kind of lost me for a bit.The one thing that kind of stuck out to me was the overwhelming CG through out the movie I heard some villain monsters were actually costume get up, and I think I could tell which those were, but undoubtedly there was a lot of CG here which in some sense didn't make it as realistic enough for me and that where some of my voting points where gone to. The other aspect that lost out some points from me was the Acting, I am no movie critic and I usually don't point out acting, but for this one I have to point it out because it was sticking out like a sore thumb. There were a couple of scenes where the main character plus some others seem like they were acting in a school play.Overall the creepiness of the movie I think kept the movie interesting, however I think I was more creep-ed out when I played the game. So if there is absolutely no other movie you want to watch and you like the creepy ones this one was not bad, but I would hold out for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
First time in years has a crossover been good...,"First off, Silent Hill is without a doubt, the best video-game adaptation in history. The others before have shattered what critics think about these type of movies but this time, someone's got it right. The only drawback is the ending, which made no sense. The effects and atmosphere were so amazingly creepy to when the darkness transforms what the town is to a nightmarishly-sadistic world. Creatures are scary enough to make someone lurch (Especially Red Pyramids little stint in front of the church). Acting was decent, Radha is a leading lady. But, if you go in see this, keep up, because you may get lost if you haven't played the games.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Almost 20 years later and it still holds up,"The first time I watched this movie, I was a 13 year old boy. I'm now 31 and I just watched it again tonight. While I am a more seasoned horror veteran now, this one still gets me every time I watch it. I remember cowering behind a pillow the first time I watched it, and it's still the only horror movie to this day to make me do that. I've also played the video games and think this is a very good adaption. The creatures are terrifying, the main characters are captivating, and the overall feel of the film is intense. My only complaint would be that there aren't more scenes involving Pyramid Head. 100% with a watch (and several rewatches) if you're into this series!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst flick ever made!!,"Dear God, I can't believe the positive reviews for this pile of crap!! Movie was a complete joke with horrible acting. This pathetic movie drug on for ever and the plot was absolutely deplorable! I have never been so angry with a movie. The creators of THE FOG think this movie was a major disappointment. Anyone that enjoyed this movie was either very high or is starved for entertainment. Save your money and skip this wretched waste of time! There was a monster that had a triangle for a head, what is that! We walked out of movie after they tried to tie all the loose ends up with a brain dead 10 minute flashback. The enlightening flashback only persuaded us more to run away screaming in disgust.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great movie for those who like horror movies,"Before Silent Hill, I can't remember seeing a horror movie in theaters and walking away satisfied. I love a good horror film, and this was just that. The atmosphere, characters, acting, and storyline make for a very creepy and entertaining experience. I have never played the video game, so I am certain that this movie has potential to be enjoyed by gamers and movie-watchers alike.The story was not predictable at all. As soon as I started formulating the possible outcome of the movie in my mind and thinking about how bored I was going to be (like watching most horror flicks) the story took a turn and the movie had my full attention again. Surprisingly, the film did not use cheap scare tactics. It wasn't a chaser film, or a roam through a scary mansion film either. The horror never got too cheesy either.If you like movies that creep you out and depict dark, Gothic, horrid surrealism, then I highly recommend Silent Hill. I give it 7/10, because many people will not like this film if they do not respect fantasy/horror films. It is definitely above average and highly enjoyable, but it will not be a great among the majority of movie-goers. More people will see it as another entertaining movie than a memorable horror film. Personally, I am already excited and awaiting the DVD release.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie,but expected something better *spoiler**","Lets be honest, its not easy to create a movie based on a video game? in fact i think this movie is good, but it need a bit of more work. first of all lets look at the story.; its a good story, not the same as the video game but almost close.but the people who haven't played the video game they are gonna think ""who are the bad guys..the crazy religious people or the zombies..or what, know what i mean?Here are the things that sucked big time: The nurses they all looked like the zombies and moved like the zombies from ""Mickeal Jackson's thriller"". And whats up with Alessa talking like a full grown up..i mean she's 9 or 8,Also the story needed more time, there are some things that are left in concluded like the big guy with the giant metal square on his head..and why is Rosa Silva having this ""Alucinations"" or traveling to another dimension.The sound is great and the effects are good..not to innovating (computarized demons,and monsters). at least the story is not as crappy as resident evil or alone in the dark.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror movie fan's wet dream,"First of all I have to say that I've only played the SH1 game, so I'm not as knowledgeable about the whole SH mythos as others.I tried going into the movie with the most objective attitude possible, which was very difficult since I loved SH1 and played it all the way to the end.No doubt about it, Silent HIll is a dark movie with a layered plot. However, I don't see why so many people have said that they couldn't understand it. IF you were paying attention throughout the entire movie, there's nothing in it that's not understandable by the end. It's obvious why Rose is looking for her daughter, it's obvious that the daughter has a mysterious past the parents don't know about because she's adopted, it's obvious what's going on with Rose's husband Christopher and why their paths don't cross much, and the ending is self-explanatory, even if you haven't played the game. Of course, it's not Halloween or Friday the 13th, which in my opinion have very linear plots and spell everything out for you. Like I said, it's layered. You have to read between the lines and think a little bit about what's going on.Silent Hill, the movie, is mostly a visual experience. It could almost be understood without any dialogue, but I don't mean that in a bad way. It's a stunning film that had my eyes glued to the screen the whole time (I almost didn't want to sip my drink so as to not block the screen.) The acting is top-notch. Pyramid Head (one of the SH gamers' favorite creatures) only appears twice, but both appearances are worth their weight in gold (or should I say, blood). It almost fully recreates the atmosphere of the game (and I say almost because there's really no replacing that first-person, interactive experience you get in a video game); however some gore and violence could keep people who are not hardcore horror movie lovers or averse to blood and disturbing images from liking it.Only one possible drawback, and I hope I'm wrong on this, but the lack of a major male character in the movie could hurt it at the box office. Sean Bean's role can hardly be called a leading one, as he appears more sporadically and for less time than many of the women in supporting roles.That aside, Jodelle owns the role of Sharon Da Silva. I also like Alice Krige as Christabella. She portrays the role of insane religious fanatic very well and the ending of her character is as good as it gets in an R-rated horror movie.Atmosphere, good acting, good direction, intelligent plot with a message, gore and violence, emotional situations and frightening revelations, this movie is the complete package for the discerning horror movie fan.All in all a very satisfying movie. I'd give it a 10 in the genre, and an 8 overall, so I'm splitting the difference to a 9.P.S. Support the ""WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES"" campaign! Go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing opportunity sabotaged by poor storytelling and a disastrous misuse of the source material.,"An example of an amazing opportunity completely marred and sabotaged by poor storytelling, choppy editing, arrogant re-writing of the story, inconsistent patchy pacing, and awful acting from the supporting actors. As a huge fan of the Silent Hill games, this film, though peppered with small glimpses of what could've been, is a complete cinema sin to the source material. A quite strong first half of the film sets you up rather decently, with a small glimmer of hope that it will succeed, though straying from the source material in noticeable ways and remixing it in others. What IS taken directly from the games works quite well even though they are noticeably changed, however, the bits that weren't taken from the games but instead was diluted and made up were the worst parts. With more work on the screenplay, tighter writing, Better pacing narrative, and a stronger obedience to the source material this really could have been a true miracle. But instead rather quickly it takes a HARSH nose-dive when the ""Christabella"" nonsense comes in to the plot, which completely butchers not only the source material entirely but also the plot of the film itself in irreparable ways. This is a case of style over substance in the end which is tragic for this film and the source material not being fully understood or utilized is a huge loss. The ""monster"" effects were handled a bit well but did not receive at all enough screen time for all of the work or even hype that went in to it and ultimately went underused. Had this film been written entirely different and locked-in closer to the source material and done to take advantage of the special effects more, and closer to the 'dread and chase' of the games, it could've been a complete and true masterpiece like a Silent Hill film deserved to be. Instead this film is ultimately a huge disappointment peppered with small glimpses of the miracle that could've been. Feels like a cash-grab too, just to showcase a few great scenes that would pull interest from fans only to turn around and stitch it together with much weaker rubbish scenes, It's all cobbled together with awful scenes patched around them. And don't even get me started on the ending with the Christabella nonsense. Honestly the parts that work best are what they took from the games and the parts that are a complete fail is where they felt entitled and arrogant enough to try and re-write it and that is what is so insulting about this film. They butchered the story by thinking they could improve on it with their own ideas. No. You couldn't. The flash-backs scenes are cringe awful! Editing takes a complete and obvious nose-dive when they start narrating and showing flashbacks trying to patch together the story. Whole thing looks so cheap by the end. It's really a real tragedy what they did to this film because they really did have a few things that worked and an amazing opportunity. Sucks that they did not spend the time or resources like they should have. Seems rushed honestly besides the few scenes that you can tell got some real focus. Really a catastrophe. But those moments that work, like the first half of the film prior to Christabella nonsense were pretty workable. Such a shame they butchered this with poor storytelling, a lackluster utilization of the source material, choppy editing, and poor acting that could've used another take or so. Really with all the great things here, the shortcomings are sadly unforgivable. But nothing is as disastrous as part 2, Silent Hill: Revelation. Now that was a turkey and a half that actually makes this first one look like a half way decent straight to Netflix movie or something. Overall, I gotta let this one go on how bad it sucked, and just hold closer to the first three games and say, hey maybe another day they will actually make a decent Silent Hill movie. or even a new game. 6 Health Drinks out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't go see this movie...,"All the reviews I have read on here so far talk about how this was a wonderful movie despite all of it's downfalls (not making sense, too long, etc.) But not one of them conveys the pure evil and demonic nature of this film.I won't lie...I had no idea this movie was based on any video game, and so I guess most of the audience probably had more of an idea about what was coming and was more prepared to see what the movie contained. However, I didn't know that much about this movie, and only went to see it because I love horror films and couldn't wait to see the story about the girl who gets lost in an abandoned town.However, after sitting through the two hours of torture, violence,and gore, I left the movie feeling sick at my stomach and weirdly guilty about having watched it. My boyfriend expressed the same feelings as I before I even had a chance to open my mouth.I am sure there are plenty of sick, twisted people who will love this movie and recommend it to everyone they know, but I am saying don't go see this film. It is dirty, foul and BAD. The movie is filled with demonic happenings and human sacrifices. What makes it worse is that I am sure there are places where things like what happened in this movie actually exist...I cannot name one particular thing that made me so against this movie...all I know is that I got a terrible feeling after watching it that I could not explain. I felt like the evil in the film followed me even after I got home and even this next morning after sleeping. I have never felt this way after seeing any movie, and I have seen some of the best when it comes to the horror genre. This movie did not make sense in any way, and will give you a horrible, dirty, evil feeling if you sit through it...Do yourself a favor and go see Scary Movie 4 instead...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfect transition to screen,"Without exception this is the best video game movie I've seen. It really is fantastic. Scary, atmospheric, surreal, exactly like the game. Rose fills the role of Harry perfectly, although leaving it as a man would have been fine too.I think its poor reviews from critics are because you really need to have played the first and maybe second games to understand why things happen. That may make it a bad movie but game conversions are primarily for game fans.I hope there is a sequel. I'd like to know what happens next, I'd also like to meet more nightmarish creatures, find out why they exist, and see other people react to them.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very Good, but far from perfect","Alright, so I haven't played any of these games all the way through, but am familiar with the environment and idea. I must say that the film overall delivered. The environment and camera angles in the first hour and a half were just like the game. They nailed it in this aspect.HOWEVER...I must agree with some of you that some of the acting was horrendous. There were some lines in this movie where I thought ""did they really just say that?"" (eg ""i think there was a fire here"" as said by another reviewer) But this can't be blamed entirely by the actress/actor (the screenwriter really) The acting by Rhada Mitchell and Laurie Holden wasn't overall bad, it was mostly some of the minor characters.The monsters rocked my face off. I think that all of you who find this movie to be awful must have missed this. I thought that the visual effects were true to the game and should be appreciated by those even not familiar. The environment as well was for the most part accurate I feel.For all of you who have played the games and are still disappointed, you will never be happy with the way a video game adaptation will turn out. Its just like reading a book and finding the film inadequate. It is extremely rare to find a film that is superior to its predecessor, regardless of the media (exceptions include The Godfather). I really like what was done to the movie and found it enjoyable. The last half hour, maybe not as much as the first hour 1/2, but still decent. Go see it, especially if a fan. Horror fans should appreciate the Hellraiser-esq type slow suspense gore film as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I guarantee you if you see this movie you will be asking yourself so many questions at the end. Almost all the people in the theatre at the end I could hear asking their friends what just happened.

Another violent vid game movie with Lovecraftian imagery that ends up crap.,"Not having seen the VG, I was completely ignorant of the story or plot of this horror entry. Now that I have seen it, I am no longer ignorant of the plot, and I realize that the plot is what is ignorant, what little there is of it. This starts out promising enough, very similar to a 1970s European horror film, with a somewhat haunted little child. Not an unusual theme for that earlier time. It's far-fetched that the mother would get the bug to visit Silent Hill on what's pretty much a whim, but the film must progress, and that's not unheard of in horror films. The imagery we see once we get fully engulfed in the town's depths is quite startling and nightmarish. But then the whole story of the good people who are really bad because they are intolerant religious fanatics, and the bad ""demon"" who is really good because she was wronged by these fanatics is really the turning point, turning what could have been something quite eerie into yet another unsubtle revenge melodrama with violent imagery. This then becomes yet another one in the long, long list of VG based horror films, and really most modern horror films, that are long on style and very, very short on having an engaging story. It's getting tiring to see the constant juxtaposition of religious fanatics as the really bad people, do any of these filmmakers really think nobody gets their less than subtle commentary for what it really is, a slander on religion and the faithful in general? With people getting thrills out of violent tripe like this (and rating it a 10 no less), there is no wonder that many think of this society as decedent and immoral.",,Anonymous,Horror
Everything a fan or horror fanatic could wish for!,"The guy who directed it, hasn't lied about his devotion to the games. Everything he put in the movie, will be recognisable for silent Hill-fans in one way or another. Of course changes have been made, of course it still shows its video game roots now and then, in the negative sense of the word. But when it all comes down to it, this movie will be at the very least enjoyable for Silent Hill-fans and horror fans who are unfamiliar with the source material.In my opinion, Silent Hill is the very first game-movie done right. There have been quite a few game-movies over the years, but they never ascended beyond the level of ""fairly amusing"", and I think that none of them stayed to true enough to the source material, while they should have. Christophe Gans, the director of this movie, stayed true to the source material in almost every way, and yet he also knew how to alter it just enough to make it interesting for a good horror movie.The atmosphere of the Silnet Hill-games has always been the most important thing to me, you really felt alone most of the time and creeped out by what this ghost town had to offer. The movie provides the same experience, because the town has been recreated for the movie, based on the looks of the games. That's marvelous. The same fog is there, the darkness, the nightmare world. It's all there, even the sirens. I loved it.And then there are the monsters. thankfully, it wasn't all CGI, puppetry was also used and humans in suits. It worked incredibly well, but the CGI too looks amazing. I didn't know whether I should cheer or scream when a familiar Silent Hill-creature showed up. It was great to see them without having to worry about them coming after me, but on the other hand they were every bit as scary as they were in the game. Except Pyramid Head, he was every bit as AWESOME as he was in Silent Hill 2. You see? You CAN have an iconic game villain in a movie without having him looks stupid(looks at Nemesis in RE: Apocalypse). I was very satisfied with the appearance of the SH-creatures in this film. They didn't always act like they were ""supposed"" to act, but it was all for the good of the movie.I read a lot of criticism about the acting in this movie. Well, I've seen much worse in other horror movies, I can tell you that. the main character was good in her desperate search for her daughter, she really reminded me of poor Harry Mason in the original SH-game. And then there was Cybil, also from the original game. The woman who played her was pretty good, she was as tough as I had expected Sybil to be. the girl who played a demon and the daughter of the main character, wasn't too bad at all. She received the most criticism, but I think she's quite good. There was one line that made me cringe at the beginning, but that was it. Especially as a demon kid I liked her acting. Sean Bean was a pretty worthless addition to the story, but at the very end of the movie, you'll see why he had to be in the movie. I won't spoil the ending. You may like it or you may hate it, but I loved it as heck. It was a perfect Silent Hill-ending.Now for the worst part of the movie, and that is sadly the story and the dialogue. I have to agree with others I've seen making comments on this movie, that the movie clearly shows its gaming roots. Sometimes a character would say something so damn obvious, that it felt like some B-movie. As a whole, this movie is definitely no B-movie. Also the times that characters seemed to know exactly where they had to look for clues, was very much like the game. Coincidences happen more than once in this movie, it all look very linear like the games. The character are 'driven' by an unknown force towards the ending, that is very clear. Gans did exaggerate the coincidental nature of the games in this movie. Changing the purpose the mysterious clan from the original Silent Hill-game wasn't really a good change for me. Until the finale came up, and I realized it was perfect after all.Finally, I want to make comments on the sounds and the music. From the very beginning I was creeped out by the terrible sounds that the monsters make, and the terrible sounds of the nightmare world. There is a good use of the source material's music in this movie, not ever out of place like so many people say. I didn't think that Gans went too far in this case. Sure, the games were silent a lot of times, but that's no reason to make it like that in the movie. Gans put a lot of music from the games in the movie, and it doesn't feel like fan-service only. the music fits, and it's awesome music at that.Final Judgement: Gans did a wonderful job on creating the typical Silent Hill atmosphere in a two-hour movie. The images, the creatures, the sounds and the town in both of its versions are in there, and they couldn't have been better. the acting is very decent, unlike what some would want you to believe. The dialogue isn't too good, but the same goes for the games very often. That's no excuse for the movie of course. The story and its changes to the original game's story bothered me at first, but it all fit in at the end. This movie is the perfect fan service, a wonderful movie for the true horror fan and the best game-movie ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Starts off well, but goes downhill","Sleepwalking daughter (Jodelle Ferland) wanders off from her mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell) in an abandoned ghost town known as Silent Hill. While Rose's husband (Sean Bean) searches fruitlessly for her, she must put up with a police officer (Laurie Holden), who suspects her of kidnapping, the crazed mother (Deborah Kara Unger) of a ""witch"", and the variety of repugnant mutants that inhabit the town.I had absolutely now idea what to expect when I went in to this movie. I didn't know what the video game was about and I didn't know the plot of the movie. All I wanted was two hours of shocks and scares. To my disappointment, Silent Hill is one of the forgettable films of 2006, and definitely not scary to anyone over 13. Director Christophe Gans tries his best to create a sense of foreboding and to some extent, the atmosphere he builds up works - but the payoff just isn't there. While some scenes in ""Hill"" are truly disgusting and gruesome, the film is far from scary.The good points of the film are the sweet score, some smooth, stylized camera-work, absolutely brilliant settings and an unpredictable and very confusing plot. The bad points include the pretty weak acting overall, a brutally corny script, and the lack of any really frightening scenes. The CGI mutants are hideous enough to look at, but too cartoonish in their digital appearance to feel like they're really there. They look like just that: CGI mutants, straight out of a video game.Sean Bean, by far the best actor out of the cast, has nothing to do, and he wanders around as aimlessly as his character in the film. The rest of the cast is just passable although their dialogue sometimes becomes eye-rollingly cheesy.Maybe I'm just too jaded. I bet there are many 13-15-year olds who will sneak into the theatre and have a scary good time, but any true horror fan will most likely leave unaffected by Hill's violent CGI mayhem. I can only recommend this movie to people around 12-14. That's not to say Silent Hill is a waste of time. It's just a huge disappointment.(r#47)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Huh? What was that?,"Having played the Silent Hill video games I figured, ""Hey, why not see the darn movie."" I have got to say the middle of the movie was pretty good, but the downside to this was the weak beginning and end. At the beginning of the movie you see random things happening for no reason, and the director seemed to like fading out scenes to put in something totally different that would have never made sense otherwise. But like any other video game movie, it is always nice to see the things we do in games acted out on the big screen as best as possible. In my opinion the downside to this movie was the random events that sometimes happened. All in all it was a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A stunning, haunting, nightmarish vision of horror","I've never played any of the videogames, but I'm definitely well aware of them; some of the imagery and game mechanics that I've seen or read about secondhand are altogether inspired. Heretofore I've never seen either of the movies; while I'm aware generally that they weren't necessarily received well, I've been curious all this time. In sitting for 2006's 'Silent Hill,' I'd be lying if I said I weren't immediately impressed. There's so much going on here right from the start, and all of it is delicious. The curt exposition and plot development, and the unswerving forward movement of the chief characters, proceed with the de facto, Just So sensibilities of a videogame that drops you into a strange world, and no small amount of the camerawork (including fixed angles or limited movement) also reflect the techniques of electronic gaming of the time. Wild shifts in visuals between scenes are likewise jarring at first blush - but by all means, part and parcel to the story in which reality is uncertain, and broken. The unnatural barriers of the world of the movie further that mangled blurring between what is or isn't real (as well as reminding of the invisible borders videogames create for players in a setting of predetermined size and character level). And, oh, we're just getting started: I wouldn't say that it's perfect, but this first 'Silent Hill' movie comes across right away as a brilliant, careful extension of the harrowing spirit of the source material, and I love it.Gnarly, genuinely horrifying static imagery and creatures greet us alongside jolting, disturbing sound effects and the unnerving, pensive atmospheric music composed by Akira Yamaoka and Jeff Danna. Nevermind blood and gore; even the most basic audio or visual effects are exquisitely monstrous and unsettling - footsteps, pervasive smoke and fog, air raid sirens, the pounding of a door. To these add grisly, acutely disturbing production design and art direction, and unnatural movement from the assembled cast (dancers!) portraying monsters that's readily unnerving. Whether achieved through fabrications, prosthetics, makeup, and costume design, or more uncommonly with digital animation, the fundamental appearance of active effects, and other beings, look outstanding in the first place, and emphatically terrifying as they greet us in each scene. Impeccable use of lighting, haunting performances from all on hand but especially Radha Mitchell and Laurie Holden, the profound and gripping vision of filmmaker Christophe Gans and screenwriter Roger Avary: every last scrap of 'Silent Hill' is rich with tremendous detail; every last scrap is bent toward manifesting, accentuating, or amplifying the wholesale feeling of intense, gruesome, creepy, oppressive fear, repulsion, and terror. Even the most artistically mindful and fetching instances of shot composition are pointedly eerie as they present.Every sparing reduction in abject horror only allows for more lore and plot, offered up with the same oblique approach to storytelling that inherently keeps viewers on edge as the very nature of the environment and the course of events are twisted and tangled. Every unapologetic, forthright facet of the writing, faithful to the tenor of gaming more than of cinema, only heightens the discrete, sinister sensation of being untethered from the logic and reason of reality. Even the truckload of exposition that we get to kick off the last act, bringing clarity to all that is transpiring, feels unexpectedly organic in its presentation, and feeds into the dominant air of startling malevolence and deep distress that is the viewing experience. 'Silent Hill' is two hours long, relatively abnormal for horror movies, but it never truly feels like it, as the parade of the grim and macabre keeps us fully and unflinchingly engaged.My congratulations to all who helped to bring this astonishing, ghastly nightmare to life: writer, director, composers, editor, cinematographer cast, crew, dancers, effects artists, and everyone else from top to bottom. If I'm being honest I didn't have high expectations when I first sat to watch; needless to say, I'm totally blown away by what Gans and the others have created. Entertaining as the genre often is, relatively few are those horror features that can actually inspire fright, revulsion, and visceral, gnawing dread. To my great pleasure and surprise, 'Silent Hill' is extraordinary, compelling and rewarding, as it joins the splendid company among the best of what cinematic horror can offer. I can only offer my heartiest and most enthusiastic recommendation - this is exceptional, and all but a must-see!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I love the games, but this movie SUCKS","I've seen more entertaining things whirling around in my toilet bowl.Wow. This movie was the biggest stinker I think I have ever seen. And I actually LOVE the games. Save your time, save your money. This movie was bad enough to be Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fodder. The plot was awful, the dialog was awful, the acting wooden...Don't bother. Seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and the only movie I have ever rated a ""1"". Everyone walking out of the theater at the end were shaking their heads in disbelief at how awful it was. And that was all the people who didn't walk out halfway through.""They used to say this place was haunted""""I'd say they were right""No sh*t? Don't waste your time or money on this turd.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most impressive and original horror productions in years,"While based on the video game (which I have played) this movie does enough to stand on its own in terms of presentation alone. There are some holes in the plot, but to be fair the game didn't make a lot of sense either. Players had to wait for Silent Hill 2 to have them answered. That's not to say that it leaves the viewer stranded. It gives more than enough information for the audience to draw their own conclusions, as is sometimes the case with supernatural-type movies.The acting was done well; actually better than I expected, with only a couple of lines made cheesy with a tongue in cheek attempt at humor. I actually remember only one line that was delivered fairly badly (and many would probably know it when they hear it) but considering the character it's pretty trivial. Some may say it was too speech-y towards the end but considering the content, most of it was necessary and done so in a way that it merely gives you a little breather before the ""final confrontation"", so to speak. Radha Mitchell (Rose) delivers one of the most blood curdling screams I've ever heard in a movie. You'll know it when you hear it; it's that effective.The impressive use of filming and sound to set the scenes are what really immerse you in the disturbing and unsettling world of Silent Hill. There is one shot in particular, in which an ambient but subtle use of bass as the camera slowly does an overhead pan of a drugstore sign, that makes you feel as though something could seriously be wrong with this town. This is definitely a movie to see on a big screen with Dobly 5.1 sound, as it pleases (and often disturbs) the senses, which both directly and indirectly adds to the suspense. The limited use of CGI blends well with real on-screen action and all the characters look incredible.All in all the movie definitely succeeds in delivering a unique horror experience, which gives the audience enough closure to the main story while leaving room for a little imagination. I actually understood the video game better after watching the movie, so in that case alone, no you do not need to know about the game to understand the movie, as some critics might have falsely led you to believe.One more thing, it's pretty violent in some parts, featuring some of the most innovative and detailed death scenes on film. However, it's done in such a way that it seems more stylish than grotesque (although there's bits of that too!). A truly beautiful albeit disturbing movie.Individual ratings (10 pt scale):Plot: 7 Acting: 7 Visuals: 10 Sound/music: 10 Entertainment factor: 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the intensity of horror films over the years,"I never knew this was a video game until i was told by my neighbor whom i saw the movie with. I was completely shocked that this was an offspring of the game.over the past decades I have seen the horror films of George Romero,john carpenter, Stephen king and Clive barker.after seeing Clive's films hell raiser and night breed i have often wondered to myself, where was his mind at when he made the story and conjured up this creatures. all the above film makers are legends in their own right but after seeing Chris Gan's film making, he makes them all look like mild mannered.Iwould like to see him in future films. this could be the next generation in horror filming.",,Anonymous,Horror
Tasteful scenery,"First, I should point out that I can't really identify myself with the group of people that adore the Silent Hill video games. I've just tried out one of them and I was quite impressed, but I'm not really much of a gamer these days. So I thought I was in a quite good mood for a movie like Silent Hill tonight, and I can't say I got too spellbound by judging the plot... Although I think the scenery was amazing! I'm a bit interested in art and this flick just had what I'm into, that sort of morbid and doomsday kind of feeling to it. For the action and the acting, I didn't get too involved... I mean, it was just another American flick, considering the acting and the Hollywood style. But hey, it was two hours of good effects, so the time watching it wasn't completely wasted. I give this 6/10, where at least 4 points are earned just by the scenery.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Looks very cool, makes little sense (in a bad way)","I play a fair amount of video games, but never played Silent Hill, so I really had no idea what to expect going into the movie.It's creepy, it's incredibly gory and incredibly violent, and it looks very good the whole time.After that, however, there isn't much. It is like a video game was directly adapted to the screen. In this case though, that's a bad thing. Faithful adaption of the video game it may be, but good film it's not. 90% of the time, I got the feeling that this would make a *lot* more sense had I played the game.In many cases, things happened for no obvious reason (falling somewhere, ending up somewhere) that didn't do well for it as a film. It wasn't the good kind of 'that made no sense' but rather the bad kind - just a character falling from one situation into the next, very much akin to going through different levels in a video game.That doesn't make a good movie though. Characters run around doing things you would do in a video game that don't come across as believable on screen - 'run around the town gathering clues' - 'solve this brain teaser' - fine for someone *playing* a *game* but for *viewing* a *movie*, it just wastes time and you're like ""Ah. That's nice. Plot please?""We don't expect Joe Dirt to be Shakespeare, so we don't hold it to those standards. Silent Hill, on the other hand, set the bar high in many ways, only to fail miserably in others. Joe Dirt can never be Shakespeare material. Silent Hill could have.More or less, you get a very creepy and gory video game translated directly to the screen. As a video game translation, it seems to succeed extremely well. As a movie, you end up just not caring about it, and that is perhaps the worst thing that can ever be said about a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A little creepy, a little corny, but a good crossover.","I saw this movie last night after I read some reviews, and my expectations were high. Well, the movie starts out kind of corny. The dialog seems a little clumsy, and I don't know why everyone is hyping the actors because most of them delivered their lines a little cheesily.To give the movie credit, the special effects were pretty incredible, but sometimes the CG blood looked pretty fake. Characters from the game popped up now and then (i.e. pyramid head) and were pretty scary, and they definitely got the zombie/freaks exactly right, and they were pretty scary as well.Overall, the plot was a little lacking, especially toward the end. It was a great concept, just not as well executed as it could have been. I didn't really feel that I cared about the characters, with the only exception being Sean Bean.This isn't really the type of movie that would make me pee my pants, but it was better than anything else ""scary"" out there right now. It brought the feel of the game put together with a good new story, and I would recommend it to anyone who's played the Silent Hill games, or anyone who's got an open mind about odd/far fetched films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very respectful of the series,"I've never been a huge fan of the Silent Hill series. I've played and beaten the first three games in the last four months. They are all good, but not my favorite game series. Initially it was seeing some of the stuff from the movie that got me into the games.Going into the movie I had an open mind. While The film is loosely based on the first game. I pretty much knew it wasn't going to be a ""direct port"" of the first game. It was an adaptation of the games. There were elements taken from the first three games.Usually when adapting something There is usually always going to be something changed. It just has to be done is a respectful way. There is usually always something changed in the Stephen King movies that have been adapted from books. This movie lived up the Silent Hill series in my opinion.It had the look, feel, and authentic monsters of Silent Hill. There's even a new monster in the movie that looks like it would fit perfectly in the Silent Hill series. As an individual movie. This is one of the more ""brutal"" movies I've seen in quite some time. It doesn't let up with the violence. It's a breath of fresh air this day in age amongst all of the PG-13 horrors with all the off screen kills.Yeah it didn't live up the first game completely, but it was respectful of the Silent Hill series. I feel that Gans and Avary respected the source material. That being the games. Hopefully they'll come back if there is another one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The best horror game adaption""","If you go into this movie with the mindset that its another Doom or Resident Evil, better think again.As a fan of every Silent Hill in the series, i went into this movie with some skepticism. The plots of the games are so in depth and complicated, i had doubts whether Gans could pull this off(i had doubts about anyone pulling this off as a move). But after watching this movie, i left the theater in Aww...The atmosphere, camera angles, music all depict the game right down to the teeth. The story has been changed a little, but i think fans of the game will not mind. This is a beautiful movie, with a great story, compassion, and you get the one of the best things about the game...The violence and gore. Its the full package dealNow the people i went to see the move with came out of the movie saying ""that was a great movie, but i had a hard time keeping up with it and what just happened."" If you have not played the series, you may come out a little confused, but you can not deny that this is the best horror/game adaptation that was ever been made",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Movie is Creepy,"I have to say, I was surprised by this movie. It was a much more intelligent piece of work than I expected from a horror movie. It is full of literary allusions and interesting and terrifying imagery. The cinematography was some of the best I've seen in a horror film from the 21st Century, if fact, probably the best.Most horror films tend to descend very easily into the well of violence and gore without much meaning. In this film, the scenes of violence and gore, which are quite extreme, hold some symbolic value. I think this is the key that separates this film from much more boring fare.I mentioned literary allusions earlier, and, as an English major, this really made me happy. Just one scene has references to The Crucible (or just the Salem Witch Trials), The Arthurian Myth, and several other famous stories. However, these references will not make an average moviegoer uncomfortable with it, because they remain unobtrusive. They introduced with a great amount of finesse.The greatest thing about this film is the mood. There is a central emotion that is conveyed in this film, and everything in Silent Hill moves toward this emotion. I think this is the first time that I have ever seen a horror film that exemplifies T.S. Eliot's idea of Objective Corellative before. The mood in this film is wonderful, and the emotion is held right down to the final moments.As to the apparent confusion over this film, I am more confused by Roger Ebert's comments than by the film. Yes, the ending is somewhat confusing, but I've never played the game, and I understood it after a little thought. I think Mr. Ebert has spent too much time believing that horror films cannot make one think. Well, this one can. Maybe if he had put a little thought into it, he would have been able to understand it.So, I gave this film a 7 out of Ten, because I think it was a very good film, but it definitely had some major flaws. It will not come to be known as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a great horror film. It transcends the genre, while still maintaining its conventions.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"First off, I'd like to thank director Christophe Gans for officially ruining Silent Hill, and the chance of there ever being a sequel. I grew up addicted to the video games and their in-depth story lines, lovable characters and frightening atmospheres. This movie presented none of the above. The script was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever heard. The consistency of ""Mommy, mommy, Silent Hill,"" and ""Don't worry sweety, everything's going to be OK,"" was enough to make a billy goat puke! The storyline is completely rearranged from the game, and made into this ridiculously hard plot to follow. There was no character development, and by far the worst character is the police officer, Cybil Bennett, played by Laurie Holden. Hey Laurie, it's called acting and it would have been nice if you attempted it. With the exception of ""Pyramid Head,"" and the nurses, all the other monsters looked ridiculous. Think of the kids from The Children of the Corn, slap on some fake blood, strip the name of Malachai and bam! - You've got the gayest creatures ever to be produced. For Christ Sakes, people were laughing in the theater! What makes the Silent Hill game so scary and interesting is the fact that you don't always see what you're fighting, or what's about to attack you. In the movie, there was no element of surprise. Nothing popped out, nothing was shown briefly, and nothing stayed on screen for an extended period of time. Instead, the audience finds itself subjected to the silent hill ""survivors,"" huddled in a church, talking about heresy. Overall, the film was a very inaccurate representation of the game. My advice... stop ruining the possibility of making a video into a good movie until my generation becomes the future directors. It just seems like every director plays the games for 10 minutes and believes he or she now knows what's to come. Once again Christophe Gans, thank you.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Christophe Gans Strikes Again!,"If you enjoy cinematography in movies, or at least can appreciate what M. Night does with his flicks, then definitely go see Silent Hill. It is full of eye candy; eye candy of a darker, rustier manner, but eye candy, nonetheless.I've talked to a few people about the movie, and it would appear that if you have no experience with the games, you will enjoy the movie a little more. Makes sense. Most movies based on books are enjoyed less by those that have read the novels simply because they know what to expect.Of course, there is another group of people that will not enjoy the film; those that tend to over analyze movies. This is really not a movie for those people. If you have a problem with Mulder's extraordinary leaps of logic in The X-Files, then you will probably have an aneurysm when watching this. It's one thing to try to escape a cop when you're pulled over, if there's traffic, or an off-ramp, or something to blend in to. If you're in the middle of West Virginia, on a deserted road, you may want to rethink your options.Leaving the logic behind, one is left with a tragic tale of a mother who loses her child. In her best efforts to be a loving, caring mother; she sets off on a journey that she thinks will help her child confront her inner daemons. On this path of good intentions, Rose (the mother) hits a bump in the road, and in the process loses Sharon (the daughter). So she must enter the town of Silent Hill to find her.While there are not many truly scary moments to the movie (one or two 'jumps' just because of a loud sound), there is definitely a fair amount of creepiness to it. The gore factor isn't really that major in the film, but in the few times that gore is present, there is a lot of it.I can't say much about the acting, let's face it, I love the Star Wars movies, so acting is not a big issue with me. Everyone does a passable job. The side plots though are not fully formed, and again require a large leap in logic.The majority of the music comes from selections from all four of the Silent Hill games. Those soundtracks are all incredible in their richness. While it's no John Williams, or Howard Shore, Akira Yamamoto (both creator of the games, composer of all music in the games, as well as executive producer for the movie) provides all the tension and eeriness one could hope for.Overall, it was a good, enjoyable movie. I loved the way the film looked, and that was one reason for me to see it on the big screen. Christophe Gans has a very rich visual style (check out The Brotherhood of the Wolf if you're in doubt), that is, as mentioned before, very nice eye candy. Seeing some of the scenes from the first game enacted on the silver screen was a treat. And to be sure, Pyramid Head is one of the most disturbing creatures I've seen in a movie in a long while (imagine being chased by two of them, and then trying to fight them off!!).In a nutshell, if you can see this movie in the theater, do so. It's worth it.._._.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poor,"I'm a fan of horror and also a video games player, but watching Silent Hill was a slow and tedious experience. The characters are completely detached from reality. You feel no connection with them, and don't actually care what happens to them. You'll see them doing all kinds of things that defy common human logic. The best acting is by Sean Bean, despite this being the worst role I've seen him in. And some idiot decided it would be a good idea for him to use an (American?) accent. Why, oh why? He just sounds odd. There are a few creepy monster designs but I found the CGI often interrupted the experience and dispelled any belief. I wanted to turn this movie off, but I persevered and sat through it. If you REALLY love the video games (as I'm guessing many of the other reviewers here do), you might find something to like. Otherwise, I strongly recommend avoiding this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Really Worth the High Price of Movie Tickets,"Look, for what it's worth, this movie does perform as a run-of-the-mill horror movie.

However, just as other run-of-the-mill horror movies, Silent Hill is lacking a number of things that would make it ""good."" Dialogue, a strong plot, characters that one cares about, all are missing in this rather long, dragging horror flick.This movie is nothing more than average. If you're out to spend a Friday night with a couple friends or a date going to a cookie-cutter horror movie, go for it. This is right up that alley. Otherwise, wait until it's on video, there's no real reason to spend extra money to see it in the theater.",,Anonymous,Horror
definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the games...,"As an avid fan of the games, I was half impressed and half disappointed.The atmosphere was set up perfectly.

The actors do a great job; very convincing in their roles - and the actors that play the creatures are AMAZING! Hooray for live action creatures instead of CGI! It's just a shame you don't see more of them. My only other complaint is that they do try to wrap things up somewhat conveniently in the last ten minutes, and one of the things I love about the Silent Hill games is that things were always left somewhat uncertain.I see this movie as being pretty good for fans of the games, but somewhat confusing for those that don't know the background...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A genuinely scary movie, with disturbingly beautiful graphics.","I must admit when I saw the trailer for this movie, I got incredibly excited as most that have played the video games would. But still, I feel that Silent Hill could stand alone as a descent movie for those that just want to have a good time at a theater. Though the acting was not the greatest, and the story seemed to drag at some points during the movie, the graphics and goriness of the film were certainly the best I have seen in a long time, and it gave you a sincere feeling of nervousness and terror, I would dare say. I loved the use of the theme song through the movie from the first video game, as well as the unnerving, chaotic soundtrack that the Silent Hill series is known for. For those that go to a theater to nitpick a movie for all its worth instead of to enjoy it, stick to your Brokeback Mountains, and leave the fun of seeing a movie to the people who really want it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Starts out very well...but it does run a bit long and it also explains to much.,"This one has music seemingly directly from the game it also has a lot of the atmosphere from the game as well, especially when you first enter Silent Hill. I was thinking, ""Wow, this has to be one of the best video game adaptations ever"". I mean they had the clues that characters would find in the game on display here, the monsters were exactly what you see in the game only more disturbing as here they are in the flesh. I was waiting for the heroine to open a random cabinet to find a shotgun or something, and maybe some ammo in a shelf, of course thankfully that did not happen. The story has a mother taking her daughter to Silent Hill in hopes that this will somehow explain her very bizarre sleepwalking behavior. Of course, for those who played the video game Silent Hill is not your ordinary little town. Upon arrival her daughter is lost, the air is full of ash, and when the siren goes off the entire town goes black and things of indescribable horror lurk in the darkness. A police officer is there as well, having followed our heroine into town and at first she is a pain, but later she is very helpful. However, the movie would have been a lot better if it did not try to explain so much. I mean in the games they didn't really explain anything about why the town itself was going crazy, usually it just explained to some extent the scenario that brought the people into town. I didn't really care for all the explaining as it narrowed it all down right to the cause of everything. Granted this made for a rather grisly climax, I still would have liked to have scene the little religious group taken out of the picture all together. I don't know I just think we needed something more out of the game for the end and less of the here is why the town and everything in it is happening. This also could have taken the movie down a few minutes as it seems to run a bit long at the end as well. Still though the movie had depth and while it wasn't the greatest movie ever, it was still very interesting to watch. Also, the cast is rather good and the scenes with Sean Bean were particularly good...I just he would have found a more vague cause.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was confusing,"There were parts of this movie that were pretty good such as the graphics and music. The characters were good and the cop kicked ass! There were some cheesy one liners, but it made the movie slightly funny. Especially the scene with the nurses, it looked as if they were going to break out in dance. But on the other hand the rest wasn't so hot. The plot was confusing and pointless. We left the theater confused on what the hell did we just watch? As for scary it was not, but it was gory. The person behind us actually got up and left twice because it was to gross. The over all thought of the movie was that it was dumb and we will never watch it again or recommend any one else to see it. P.S.

Real Horror Movie,"If you are looking for an original and scary movie, you really should watch Silent Hill. It's a mix of creepy and dread, but at the same time makes you feel curious and excited about the way the story is told. Rose is the main character and she is always looking for her missing adopted daughter in a mysterious city called Silent Hill, where a lot of creepy facts had happened in the past. In the night, when the alarm rings you should be prepared, the dead come to life and there are always some strange creatures really close. You might find it a bit confusing when you realize there are two ""realities"" in the movie, like a parallel universe where you can see different people in the same place, but they don't see each other. At this point is possible to see distinct facts happening at the same time, but don't worry about it because it makes the story more mysterious.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

But honestly, it can't cost more money to make a 'good' film - aka, a film that would stand up to cinematic criticism and sell tickets (not to mention secure the franchise for at least 2-3 more films).Give me half the budget these guys had, and I'll walk through a film school on any given day and assemble a crew of students who could create a film that succeeds in making money, and at the very least, compelling people to see the movie a second time or recommend it to their friends.This film has guaranteed that the studio will see mediocre returns on any sequels they spit out because they didn't take any chances.

There has never been a decent film based on a computer game, and this is not the one that will change that opinion. I gave it a chance, but this film was really lacking in the essentials: plot, narrative, structure, scares, shocks.

Wasted potential.,"Not that the movie is very bad but it's just that the movie, with its atmosphere and premise, had so much more potential than the eventual end result.The movie suffers from numerous things. One is the build up and story flow. In all honesty this movie has an incredible bad build, which ruins the tension and mystery of the movie. Things happen in the movie too fast, without a proper build up. This way we never really get involved- and feel with any of the characters. It's a distant movie with distant characters and because of that neither the tension or mystery of the movie works out to the maximum. Non of the characters seems to be truly scared or surprised will all the unusual and scary things going on in the movie. It also sort of makes the movie ridicules to watch at moments.This movie had all the potential in it to become a tense atmosphere horror movie. After all, The Silent Hill games are probably the most atmospheric, tense, mysterious and scary games around at the moment. But as a die hard horror fan I can assure you; this movie is not an horror. The movie really doesn't have any scares in it and although there is some gore, there is very little else to enjoy for the horror. So perhaps it's possible that a non-horror fan will like this picture more than I in the end did. The only thing horror about this movie is its atmosphere. Yes, the movie is great looking and because of that has a great visual look and atmosphere over it but the not so great story, characters, dialog and acting make sure that this movie never becomes tense or scary despite its fantastic atmosphere.But yes, the movie is definitely still watchable, mainly because of the reason I just mentioned; the visual look. The movie uses some great camera positions (copied directly from the game I presume), good looking sets, make-up and visual effects. The movie also has some great highly imaginative sequences, that perhaps can also be described as art. You could say that this movie is a case of style over substance.The story begins simple but as the plot thickens the movie becomes more and more difficult to follow. We're introduced to a totally new world and environment but the movie doesn't give us the time to adapt and get used to this strange 'alternative' world. The story also tends to make the movie unnecessary hard and difficult to follow, especially toward the ending, that even comes over as strange and not in every way completely understandable. No wonder, since the story is written by Roger Avary. The man behind the early Quentin Tarantino movies ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". He always tends to write stories with several layers, multiple story lines and other complex writing techniques but in this case it's not for the best of it. The movie suffers from its 'over-done-written' script. A simple understandable for everyone script would had sufficed for a genre movie like this one.Sorry to say but Radha Mitchell will not grow into becoming a big movie star. This goes for about all of the actors in the movie. Sean Bean also somehow got involved in this movie but to be frank, I don't know why he ever agreed to appear in this movie. He feels out of place and on top of that he also gets very little interesting to do. The only interesting actress in this movie seems to be Alice Krige but her character is unfortunately introduced too late in to the story. Non of the characters are really handled well in the movie and the dialog also isn't always the best, or most realistic thinkable, so that also isn't exactly helping them.The movie is still good enough to consider it a watchable one but considering the potential this movie in its core had; a disappointing movie, especially from the viewpoint of an horror-genre fan.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ultra-Cool One Minute, Ultra-Cheesy the Next","This movie should have been great, but suffers from inadequate execution. This is not to say that there aren't bright spots. The monsters and beasts in the film are very well done, and there are a handful of ""classic"" horror sequences in the movie that include demonic children, faceless nurses, and the now infamous Pyramid Head. The score of the movie was also well done and the atmosphere of Silent Hill was sufficiently creepy, complete with snowing ash and fog.The problem with the movie is that all of the aforementioned coolness was mitigated by horrendously cheesy moments throughout (""cheesy"" defined as moments that are meant to be serious but instead come off as comical). One contribution to the cheesiness of this film is a slew of unnecessary dialogue. For example, our two heroines are at a hotel and find a clue in the mailbox of room 111. Instead of cutting to the next scene, showing the ladies attempting to find room 111, the following useless dialogue is given: ""What mailbox did you find this in?"" ""Room 111."" ""Well then, we should go to room 111."" Are American audiences really that stupid that they need these types of explanations in films?Another grossly cheesy contribution was the introduction of religious fanatics, a concept that is already beaten to death by Hollywood. Not surprisingly, the religious fanatics in this movie are Christians, so we have endless minutes of the antagonists hypocritically judging the protagonists, which occurs in just about every other movie that's released in the U.S. With a concept as innovative as Silent Hill, one would think that the characters would not descend into cliché-ridden diatribes  but they most certainly do. The movie would have been better served if it focused on the Occult and other New Age concepts that were so prevalent in the video games.Yet another grossly cheesy contribution is the 5-minute ""Idiot's Guide to the Plot of Silent Hill"", which was introduced near the end of the film. Again, are Americans too stupid to figure things out on their own? On a positive note, the explanation of how Silent Hill became what it is was quite good, but the failure to properly execute the communication of this explanation to the audience just added more cheesiness.It is rumored that the original script was rejected by the movie studio because it didn't have a lead male character, so he was written into the storyline on a purely ad hoc (after-the-fact) basis  and it shows. The ""real world"" scenes were almost completely useless, and should have been scrapped completely. They added nothing more than cheesy dialogue.All in all, it is my opinion that American studios are incapable of producing high-quality horror films. The decent ones that are released (i.e., The Ring, The Grudge, etc.) are ripoffs of movies already made in foreign countries, and it should come to no one's surprise that two of the most acclaimed horror movies made in the past half decade (i.e., Japan's ""Pulse"" and Korea's ""A Tale of Two Sisters"") are already scheduled to be shredded and remade for idiotic consumption in America. It's as if the concept of ""original screenplay"" is nonexistent in the Hollywood horror genre.In conclusion, Silent Hill is an average to above-average horror movie solely for its cinematography and special effects, but the cheesiness that oozes from every other scene prevents it from being a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A visually stunning, impressively faithful adaptation","Just 10 minutes into Christophe Gans' big-screen adaptation of the video game chiller Silent Hill, it becomes obvious that he and writer Roger Avary are fans of the game which is one of the best parts about the movie. Their desire to translate it faithfully, and hence pleasing the SH fans amongst us, is obvious in every shot. From the unsettlingly crooked & elevated camera angles to all the little gaming references, the translation is sublime. It really is the best game-to-film adaptation yet, not only because of the design but also because it doesn't pander to modern audiences. There are things left unexplained; you have to *shock horror* work stuff out for yourself! Props to Gans & Avary for that.It's by no means perfect though. For starters Sean Bean's accent is atrocious. I have nothing against the guy - he's a fellow Brit after all - but man... it's not good. Not good at all. In fact his entire sub-plot could be stripped away and we wouldn't be any the wiser.The ending too seems a little forced and wildly grotesque - elements of Hellraiser no less, but then if they had gone with (one of the many) game endings that would really confuse audiences, so I guess they did a good job.Thankfully the positives far outweigh the negatives. From our first creature encounter to the awesome introduction of Pyramid Head, the puss-filled, squirming denizens of Silent Hill really deliver - incredibly faithful to the game and a joy to see on a big screen.Carol Spiers' style of production design works really well here too. She previously worked with Cronenberg on eXistenZ amongst other things, and does a great job of capturing both 'normal' Silent Hill and 'possessed' Silent Hill. The transition sequences from one to the other are astounding - the digital effects work is breathtaking. Gruesome as hell but still breathtaking.The supporting cast, possibly with the exception of Sean Bean, are great particularly Laurie Holden as Cybil.If you're a fan of the game franchise, you'll get a real kick out of the film. If you're not familiar with the games, you'll still enjoy it, but prepare to be slightly baffled...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You're all wrong.,"If you played through the games you know this movie is next level. It connects the first two so beautifully. The woman who plays the cult leader looks so much like the one from the game it absolutely blows my mind. The ending alone gives this film a 7/10 alright? The ending alone. To give this film anything less than a 7 is messed up. The art alone is worthy of an 8/10 and the monsters deserve a 9/10 I rate this film a 10/10 because I know this movie was made me me, the kid who stayed up all night playing the games and trying to understand it, the haunting reality of hell dimensions. To be trapped in limbo and alone is more terrifying than anything in the film. They will never be anywhere ever again. Make more movies for kids like me.

Best horror movie I've seen in years,"When I went to see this movie I knew it was based on the computer game Silent Hill. I've never played the game, so I can't comment on whether it does it justice or not.However, as a stand-alone film this is definitely one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. It's genuinely creepy, the visuals of Alessa's dream are astonishing and horrific at the same time. The acting in general is decent, but the movie is really about the visuals and the story rather than the action. Yes, this is actually a horror film with a great story - a rare thing.I thought Sean Bean was to play the lead in the movie, but it was interesting that he wasn't. It worked out anyway. My only complaint with this movie would be the painful scene near the end of the movie when Rose returns from the hospital and confronts Chrisabella. It was much too staged which made the acting painful to watch. Fortunately it only lasts about a minute, and doesn't diminish too much from the movie overall.So bottom line - you don't have to know anything about the game to enjoy this movie - I don't, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Great story, great horror, and great visuals. Though if you're faint-hearted it's probably not for you! Reading some of the comments above, many that didn't like the movie were either fans who were disappointed their game wasn't translated purely enough, or Christians who are offended that the cultists are evil. I can't comment on the gamers' disappointment, but the ones commenting on the movie's portrayal of Christianity must not have paid much attention in the movie. They're cultists, not Christians! You see the symbol of their faith many times during the movie, and it's certainly not a cross. Not to mention that Christians in this day and age aren't evil gits that burn people for witchery.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't waste your time!,"What an awful movie.....that's two hours of my life that I'll never get back! I'm a big fan of horror movies, but, this one was not scary...and the acting was brutally bad! With the many choices of ""good"" movies out there, don't waste your time on this bore fest. I thought it was so convenient how the cop magically awoke from her accident at the exact time that Rose came back to the car.....what a coincident. The only thing that I'm happy about is that I borrowed this from a friend, and therefore didn't spend a dime to see, thank god! How did this movie get into theaters?

A Review reflecting movie to game comparison of Silent Hill.,"As a fan of the video game and others, I was kind of skeptical that this movie would be good. I was wrong! The crew did a very well job of re-making the game series into a movie. The main characters, mom and daughter, were played very well. The monsters, were even more scary and realistic in the movie than the game! Pyramid head, had a good role just as the nurses looked and acted very horrifying. The backdrop of the movie scenes, were very well done, looked very much like in the game. The movie even had a bit of a comedy element to it, as the audience members laughed at a few of the character comments. Other audience members reflected being scared, as the game series does to people as well, it can be very scary! I think the best viewer of the movie would be fans of the game or at least someone who has played it, it would help them to understand the movie better. People who are new into the whole Silent Hill ""cult"", may enjoy the movie as well. The graphics were outstanding, minus the few times they were comparable to the cliché'd ""The Ring"" movements, even if they are the latest form of horror effects. What was even better, that the monsters were not full CGI, as in the games of course. Another fun part of the movie, being a horror movie, it had a lot of Horror as some movies show very little. This one had mental horror as well. This year 2006, has a lot of horror movies coming out, Silent Hill is a must see if you are indeed looking for a Horror movie. I must say I have no complaints. This movie might even be the best horror movie out in years. Hopfully it will make a path for the future of horror movies. However, some may say it's not a horror movie or more than, more psychological, it may still change the path of such a genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is for gamers,"I am a fan of the silent hill video games and would like every one to see it. BUT, I believe this is a movie ONLY FOR THE FANS. I went to see this with 10 people and only 2 of us liked it. This is because they were fellow gamers. We all appreciate the subtle parts of the movie that makes it feel like they recreated the game for the big screen. I can understand why any regular moviegoer (as in didn't play the game) would dislike or even hate this movie. It makes no sense to them and is not scary. I have watched many people leave the theater before the movie ended and I knew they didn't have any silent hill background. WHYExactly do I like this movie? This movie was a recreation of the entire silent hill areas played in the game especially in the beginning. I felt like I was playing the game once again on an enormous screen. From the town to the school to the alley way where rose was first attacked was near perfectly reproduced. As for the story line I did see faults among it including A VERY BAD ENDING. Though if you understand the silent hill world the story makes sense. Though this takes much time reading forums and playing the video game. I appreciated the small details in the world of silent hill also such as the hopscotch game drawn on the ground during the school scene. It had the typical 1,2,3 setup in the boxes but the top was labeled heaven while the bottom was labeled hell. This is a reference to one of the darker things that children did in silent hill. Countless other things can be noted. As for the bad things in silent hill, Sound was very nostalgic but not nearly enough. They did not use the booming rusty gear sound not nearly enough. The sound that I believe is the scariest in the games. Also, the end was terribly corny. In all I would give this film an 8/10 for GAMERS while a 5/10 for NON-GAMERS.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well Made Trash,"the production on this film was great, sound design wasn't great but it done the just, the visuals were generally great and i loved the photography BUTThis is probably one of the worst films i have EVER seen.....nothing held water, the plot was confusing and pointless......and it was such a terrible waste of a great actor like Sean Bean....If people want to sit at home on their personal computers and play games with disposable plots then fine, if they gain enjoyment out of the gameplay kudos to them.....but I'm not really sure how this films would work as a game let alone a film?I'm not sure i could go as far as to say the ending was clichéd because even a cliché would serve a purpose, this didn't.I don't normally write reviews of anything but i felt compelled to sit here and type this.

People like this?  Are we all talking about the same movie here?,"I'm mystified....totally mystified that anybody could possibly get into this story. Terribly acted and written from start to finish, to the point that I actually wanted to cover my eyes and ears not out of fear but out of embarrassment for the actors. I kept thinking ""that person is the worst actor in the movie"" only to have someone else show up and be even worse - really, this is the most massive, across-the-board display of awful acting you're likely to find outside of a porn video.Yes, I've played the games, and yes, they were really scary, but the movie only recreates that feeling briefly at one or two moments. The rest of the time it's far too tedious and awkward to be remotely exciting or even interesting - I couldn't lose myself in the story enough to be scared, and I tried, I really did. The makers of the game understood what makes a situation scary, but the movie never quite grasps it. It's 2 hours that feel like at least two and a half. The scenes with Sean Bean (who looks like he really misses Middle-Earth, where his acting style made sense) feel as tacked-on as they apparently were. And don't even get me started on the whole ""Did you follow all my clues?"" exposition sequence - the worst narration I've ever heard in my life. Wow. Just...wow.This is easily one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen ""Master of Disguise."" (No, I don't remember why. Maybe someone dared me to.) Maybe the target audience is so used to the bad voice-over acting in the game (""Radio...what's going on with that radio?"") that the characters' reactions in the movie actually seem believable by comparison - except they don't, even by that standard; they're that bad. I love video games as much as the next person, but if their net effect on American culture is an increased tolerance for steaming piles like this one, maybe they are bad for you after all.p.s. What's with that random shot of the bushes outside Sean Bean's front door? Is there some ""symbolism"" I missed? Is it maybe an acknowledgment that watching plants grow is about as entertaining as everything else we've just seen? Just a theory.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Yes! No wait, No!","Synopsis:A mother who is worried about her daughter and her recent bizarre behavior which includes the mention of a town by the name of Silent Hill, desires to take her there in the hopes that once she gets there they will be able to help her. Her husband is less inclined to go and openly states that he believes it will not hold the answer to their daughter's problems. Against his wishes, she goes anyway and once they arrive, the young girl goes missing.Silent Hill is based off of one of the most scary game series of all time (My sister and friends like watching me play the second and first ones which held, in my opinion, the most cinematic quality to grace a video game. Especially the second one). And as such, it seemed only natural to create a movie adaptation of the game to really expose it to the world. However, there are a few points which need bringing up.Pros:If you are a player of the game and have enjoyed it, you will doubtlessly be entranced by the way in which the game stays faithful to the atmosphere. The streets which are clouded by a dense fog whilst ash rains down from the sky like a cruel mockery of snow is artfully brilliant and does well to replace the actual snow in the Playstation video game. Everything feels deserted and empty, making one feel very alone. You may even recognize the same eerie camera angles towards the beginning of the film when our protagonist reaches the actual town of Silent Hill. Monsters that were in the game that are also in the movie remain faithful to their original design (Subtle but noticeable changes are apparent, sometimes in design, other times in behavior). The change from a male protagonist to a female one is reasoned very well (As the male protagonist in the game was very maternal towards the care of his daughter).If you're not a player of the game (Released by Konami), you will still be able to greatly appreciate the horrifying atmosphere, terrifying monsters, and wonderfully executed sound effects (They also the very excellently composed music from the game, which is used notably). Acting is pretty good, with my largest gripes being the inartistic use of the F word a couple times (Yes, you can use the F word artistically).The first half of the film is excellent and oozes potential and possibility, even if it begins a little less subtly from an artistic point of film-making. The most gripe I had about the beginning was the rather tepid use of dialog. Not great, but not cheesy and frown inducing either. It all runs fine and well and keep you intrigued until the middle, which brings us to...Cons:I tried, VERY hard to remember that this was going to be a movie with it's flaws, and would undoubtedly deviate from the games story in a few ways. I try to look at things from both angles before and after making a judgment in any way.If you haven't played the game, it seems like they lost sight of what made the first half, and even Silent Hill in general, such a place of horrifying intrigue. Any emotion that was in the first half is lost in the second. Characters react unbelievably to their current situations more in the last half than the first, and their acting seems to have taken a large blow. Cliché's pop up more than a few times (In scenarios which characters find themselves and dialog), and gradually, the film goes downhill with a few positive moments to distract. The pacing is a bit off, with a bit of a shallow, unimaginative explanation and ending. It seems as if those who wrote and directed the movie were getting a little to comfortable with their creative license.Players of the game will note the cameos made, but will find them lacking. Where the game had little explanation of the events which transpired in the game (though had enough clues to piece everything together), the movies will explain everything in thorough detail toward the decent-at-best climax. The storyline is also changed to a point where it feels like just a huge cliché' and not something which was put a great deal of thought into. And again, some incredibly unrealistic reactions from characters, especially ones in torturous and life threatening situations (you'll know when you see it). A very special monster character is dropped halfway through the movie, and it leaves bits and pieces left unaccounted for. I felt only distantly sympathetic towards the heroine close to the end rather than the beginning.By the end of the movie, you may be going, ""Umm, okay... What the heck? Why'd they do that?"" Which is sad, given the great first half. The only reason I personally would want to see a sequel, is to tie up loose ends and rectify acting and storytelling flaws which keep this from being a simply great horror movie, while keeping the same elements such as the atmosphere and the ambiance that made it great. As both a person who watches movies and has played the game, I am built up and then let down.I still love Silent Hill, even if my faith in it's foundations is now a bit more shaken and cracked than they once were.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Felt like a static experience,"There was a story there, but it was full of inconsistencies, especially after the first 20 or so minutes.Obviously, the writer/director has some kind of axe to grind against organized religion. If they were trying to show the evil that men do, they missed it, wrapped up with too many over the top visual effects in the climax.The cinematography was outstanding, if there was an end to the world, I'd imagine it looks the way that this film was shot, especially the initial shots of Silent Hill town/village.I've never played the game. I went to this film looking for a horror film, and it was basically some time sitting watching what is essentially a stark, scary dream sequence, following a fairly linear plot, for the most part.The acting was good to great, especially with the female roles. The woman who portrayed the Motorcycle cop stole the show, from her first appearance. The male lead was written to be a bit too passive, but did a good job with what he was given. Some of the supporting cast were stereotypes, but really I think more writing / development was needed.Overall, visually beautiful, good acting, the story was weak, and didn't make a lot of sense to me. It felt like a video game walkthrough, that was turned into a film.If you are a fan of the game, I'd say go see it.

A little too gory...  but somewhat scary...,"To begin with, I haven't played the games. I went into this movie with very little idea of the plot. On the plus side, I think it was filmed pretty well. Though the story was a little ""off"" at times, it did set up the plot pretty well. It was one of those classic gory movies. In my opinion, the film makers focused too much on the gory aspect. Although there were many instances where I was somewhat scared, there were also instances where I almost burst out laughing at the misfortune of the main characters. If you've liked the games, I suppose it'd be worth seeing. If you haven't, but you like scary movies which focus on gore... well, this one's for you. And if you're anyone else... I'd tell you it's worth seeing only if you're in the mood for it...Don't read this next part, it gives away part of the movie.For those who have played the games, a question:What's up with the pyramid headed guy?

"Shocking, atmospheric, fun.","my score for the movie was 8 out of 10. In all of this movie's atmosphere (which it has plenty), the visceral gore comes without apologies or even a mere glimpse of effort shown in restraint, but done so in a way that is refreshing in the last multiple years of throw-away shlock shock. It doesn't bring anything to the table it has to pull back by shying the camera away, and it brings quite a bit forward. Once you see it, you'll probably see why the gore in this movie feels so different. I can't explain it without giving away details. As a gamer, I probably set some different standards for the film. Higher as far as pleasing me as a gamer (which it did), and giving justice to horror movies in general (which I think it did). It did have an annoying 10 minutes where story was shoved down your throat, a radical religious figurehead was a bit tedious and repetitive, the ending pretty nebulous (but honestly, how could you explain them coming BACK from that and living happily ever after?). ASIDE from that, I found I came out of the theater more than satisfied. 8 out of 10 without hesitation.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A step in the right direction, but...","Being a fan of the Silent Hill games myself and knowing that a lot of fans had nothing but praise for the movie, I had good hopes this one would be finally it - the proof that great movies can be made based on video games. Resident Evil and Silent Hill I though would be good movie material; all one had to do is to produce the uneasy and intense atmosphere they had, but after the Resident Evil-adaptation failed so hard to even grasp what the (early) RE games were about and instead went it's own trashy action route with some minor RE stuff thrown in just so they can call it ""Resident Evil"", I had some reservations for Silent Hill.Well, my concerns in that regard proved to be unnecessary. Very much unlike the Resident Evil movie, the makers took the material serious and they really stayed true to it. The town looks spot on, the music is mostly from the game, there's the thick fog, the rusty and bloody other dimension, the sirens, the nurses, some famous scenes are replicated from the game with the exact same angle-shots... you get the point. It takes some liberties, especially with the characters, but always in just the right amounts and it felt more or less justified. However, where the movie succeeded with being faithful to the game, it never managed to do something truly great with it. For once the movie explains too much and as a result demystifies a lot of things that would've been better left to the viewers imagination. It explains for example that the whole town shifts to another dimension where the ""real"" world can't reach it. It even goes so far to show how the people outside Silent Hill acknowledge and react to it. In the game that was never explained and it was never clear wherever the main character just had his own nightmare, is going insane, entered a cursed town or another dimension altogether. It also explains the sirens, which is just a minor detail, but again killed something that was far more interesting when left unexplained and used for symbolism. Another example would be Pyramid head. The movie is by far not as ambiguous as the games were and its truly a shame that they went that way.Another problem I found with this adaptation was the pacing, and this is where I've noticed that a movie would have it hard to do it justice. Silent Hill games are, just the like the name implies, most of the time quiet and have a slow pace. The game every now and then serves you a tiny bit of story, and then lets you wander around the town uncovering bit for bit of the sad and horrible truth. These moments in-between storytelling allow the player to let them sink-in, giving them more weight which is even further amplified by disturbing symbolism and clever level design. The adaptation omits this by having a rather faster, event-to-event pace. This makes things feel a little rushed and cramped, although to be fair, was still pulled off decently, however some of the mood is lost in favor to some adrenaline-fueled thrills.Speaking of the mood; the movie manages to capture the sinister and sadistic aspects of the game. Its quite astonishing how it depicts evil minds, making me feel almost angered about it. There are some truly wicked scenes which definitely are memorable, but on the other hand it never reaches the more subtle, psychological aspects the games are famous for. It's also really explicit.Is has a few corny moments and dialog, but they didn't bother me much. Acting is decent for the most time. There are a few scenes where its bad but I guess that has more to do with the writing part, because I couldn't honestly imagine someone doing a better job in these certain scenes. Not a big deal, really. I also would've liked it to rely less on CGI and more on the practical effects, but again that's just another nit-pick.So is it the best video-adaptation yet? Perhaps, but that's not saying a lot. Is it truly a great movie? No, sadly not. It's ""just"" OK. As far as staying true to the material and not sucking, it most surely has the best ratios. It is notable that effort went into this one and that they actually bothered to play and understand the game, but despite that some things were unluckily compensated and/or could've just been done better. It did not match the uneasy feeling I had while playing the games and never felt as personal to the main character. Still, what's there is far better than any of the Resident Evil life-action movies or Uwe Boll works and I really wanted to rate it higher than I did. If anything it is the best example that shows that there is potential in video-game adaptations when approached serious and without cash-grab intentions only, it just needed more polish. It gets a 6.5 out of 10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Lazy film making. The only reason I could see for the woman to be running and screaming was that she had come to see how bad the film was and was screaming because she realised her career was over and was running to try to get out of the rubbish film she was in!I could not believe that so many of us in the auditorium had forked out cash to see this tripe- there were absolutely no redeeming features.

I'm writing this as a NON-fan of the game.,"I have to begin this by saying that I don't understand the confusion. I followed the story line just fine, without benefit of ever having played the game. Other reviewers have declared this screenplay to be a convoluted mess, but I don't understand their perspective, as I had no trouble in following the storyline. Perhaps that was a ""perceived"" storyline, as I do have enough imagination to answer my own questions, filling in the blanks as the movie goes along, but either way, the time was lacking for the type of character and story development most seem to need in order to enjoy this work.Silent Hill is a darkling wonder of twists and turns.

A good attempt with bad flaws,"This movie is, as well known by everyone, based on the popular video game series, Silent Hill. I have only played the 4th one, so I did not know too much about the plot before I saw the movie. According to my friend, the movie is based on the second game of the series. And the music used in the movie is indeed from the second one; I know because I have the soundtrack.Anyway, the movie is one of the better horror movies. While it is certainly not a masterpiece, it still has some good elements to it. The special effects were great, the story line was suspending and interesting, and the music fitted the scenes. However, they really should have worked on the dialogue. A lot of times it seemed so cheesy that people bursted into laughter....a no-no for horror movie.The movie follows the game (again, I know because someone told me). But from time to time it seemed to be following the game too much. They would give clues to the main character to follow, and even give her ""items"" when she needed them.....just like in a video game.I would say this is a good attempt to crossover from game to movie, but they could have done better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a great movie,"Silent Hill was one of the best if not the best horror movies I have seen in my life. Done are the days of the psychological horror genre that audiences saw with The Ring and The Grudge. Don't get me wrong those movies were well done and did scare me at times, but Silent Hill did so much more. You see, Silent Hill does not so much scare you as scar you. When you leave the theater the movie stays with you, that is what a good horror movie should do.This movie creates an atmosphere of a true nightmare, which is what the world of Silent Hill is all about. This movie stays true to what the games are all about, without relying too much on their fan base. The story to Silent Hill is actually (and surprisingly) very good. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but if you did not want to see it because you thought it would have a crap story, think again.I found myself truly enjoying this sick demented world of Silent Hill and I believe a lot of people will too. It is a must see for any horror film junkie, and a refreshing film to all those ""PG-13"" horror movies that have been coming out lately.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great adaptation of the game with a HORRIBLE ending,"I absolutely loved Silent Hill 1, it was an amazing game; it was very well done and quite frankly it made Resident Evil look like crap.I heard from a lot of people that Silent Hill was a horrible movie and I should waste my time, and I simply agreed and never bothered to see it, since I was greatly disappointed with Resident Evil and Doom's film adaptations.But one night I was really bored so I headed to Blockbuster and rented this film with one of my free coupons, figuring what the heck? So I get home, pop it in and I am amazed for the first hour and a half, everything was well done and was almost better than the game. Then they started blithering about burning witches and went really in depth on the cult that was in Silent Hill, but even that didn't bother me(even though it was stupid and done really poorly). What ticked me off the most was the ending though.The movie was built up for 2 HOURS and then you get to end and the scene in the church is cut way too short, plus the film isn't even resolved! They're still stuck in the fog of Silent Hill! They're out of the town and they're back home, but they're still haunted by the fog and no one can see them; NOTHING WAS RESOLVED, POSSIBLY THE BEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE WAS CUT SHORT, AND AN ENTIRE MOVIE WAS RUINED. It was a huge waste of time, I felt like I had just been offered a birthday gift but the giver decided he wanted it and took it away before I could open it; The first hour and a half of this film were done really well, and stayed really true to the game; Fans of the game will LOVE this movie(until the ending), while those that haven't played it probably won't know what the heck is going on ^_^ All in all, this film had great action scenes, the first hour was riveting, and the special effects were all done really well; I would not place it in a priority viewing category, but if you've got nothing better to do then you should definitely check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mediocre.,"Before I get into this review, let me state I'm a huge fan of the game series. I've played them all several times, and have always thought of them as some of the most artistic games ever made.However, the film adaption of Silent Hill was overall a letdown for me, despite the fact that there was a lot to admire. Gans stayed true to many of the signature elements, and did a wonderful job with the visuals. The fog, the rusty fans, the bleeding walls, the sirens, all of that was presented beautifully. The designs on the creatures was done very well, and Pyramid Head especially looked fantastic. The sound was also top notch. Even though all of the music was taken directly from the games, I won't complain because Akira Yamoka's work is always pleasing to listen to.The film had some major weak points though. The storyline, or more importantly, way of presenting it, was what really damaged it. On the whole, the movie stayed somewhat true to the plot of the first game, but it was told in a much different manner. One of the things I loved about the game was how the plot was not spoon fed to the viewer, which really made you think to understand what's really going on. The movie told every detail the game kept subliminal, but it also told it in an inconsistent way that I found confusing and just, well, not ""Silent Hill"". The segment toward the movies climax in particular just didn't work for me, and the dialog too could have been improved.One of the things that makes the games such a unique experience is the feeling of isolation, and knowing you're alone. There's rarely encounters with other characters, the storyline you have to think about to understand, and it has such a powerful atmosphere you can only get by taking control of the character. That's a beauty that a movie simply cannot capture. Because of that, I feel that this film could have never truly worked out the way the games do.All in all, I thought Silent Hill was a mediocre film, but wasn't the memorable experience that the games were.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very gory, confusing and very good","Rose DaSilva (Radha Mitchell) has trouble with her adopted child Sharon (Jodelle Ferland). She keeps sleepwalking and yelling ""Silent Hill!"" Silent Hill was a town that was destroyed when a huge fire swept over it. Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill but loses consciousness in an accident. When she comes to Sharon is gone and Rose goes to Silent Hill to find her...I never played the video game so I can only review this as a movie. Visually it's very impressive with eerie locations and purposely washed out color. There's almost never a dull moment with monsters attacking (for some reason) left and right. Most of these things are never explained but certainly grab your attention. I assume they make sense in the video game. I do have to state it's a pretty sad state of affairs when you have to play a video game to fully understand a movie. Still I was never bored--I was trying to figure out the movie most of the time! There's also PLENTY of gore with people being ripped apart or torn open--this is not for the squeamish.The acting is as good as it can be. Mitchell is good but a lot of her actions make no sense (again, they probably do in the game). Laurie Holden is very good as a police officer helping her. Sean Bean has a few good moments as Roses' husband. Alice Krige is exceptional as Christabelle--downright chilling. Ferland is wonderful as Sharon--this young girl has a bright career in front of her.Basically I did like it but the plot was more than confusing and it got VERY upsetting towards the end. Also the ending was sort of ambiguous--I THINK it's meant to be that way. There's also a cute joke in the movie--the school in Silent Hill is called ""Midwich"". This is probably a direct pun on the book ""Midwich Cuckoos"" which became ""Village of the Damned"" about the evil kids--and that relates to this movie.I give it a 9 because of the confusing bits and pieces and the ending. I do recommend it with some reservations. This is a must-see for gore fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent Hill,"This movie disappointed me greatly. The movie was all creatures and no psychological horror. This movie was awful and it left out so much at the end. The action was great but anyone can tell you that the script makes a movie great. This movie was so predictable and preachy that anyone could have seen what was coming. I think that the writers could have tried to write a better script instead of wasting everyones time. The acting in this movie was awful. Everyone at the movie theater the time i saw this was saying this movie was terrible and stupid including me. Hell, Hulk (2003) was better than this movie. I believe this movie deserves a 2.6 only for the action.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A must-see for horror movie fans,"I haven't played the game, but I think this is definitely one of the best horror movies made in recent years. I have been longing for a movie like this, since I have seen The Ring. The atmosphere is really creepy and the monsters and effects are the best I have ever seen. I hate CG effects and funny monsters that have ruined many movies that could have been much better had the monsters been designed as good as in Silent Hill. Sound effects are great too, and there's no sudden ""boo"" to startle you as in cheap horror movies. Script is well thought and everything makes sense in the end. So, it doesn't leave you puzzled nor prepare some basis for a sequel. It is overall a very satisfying horror movie, and absolutely worth the two hours you spend watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Typical Hollywood Crap,"Strangely, the sequel did a better job of capturing the actual feel of the classic Silent Hill games from which this series ostensibly drew its name. This film, however, is a terrible disaster. It drags on for over two hours, in which time it never justifies its length. It's a pathetic attempt to alter the original game's story, but it manages to do absolutely nothing right, instead needlessly shifting characters' genders and creating extraneous characters that it never makes anything but annoying and awful.The direction is terrible, the photography is atrocious, and the acting is barely serviceable, which says something considering that this film includes some generally good actors. Sean Bean is utterly wasted on the disposable role he's given, and Kim Coates is literally *painful* as Thomas Gucci. There's so much in this movie that is worth of contempt, and not just because it flagrantly disregards the beloved series of games, but because as a film it's crap.Whatever message it attempts to present is lost in a morass of misogyny and incompetence. It's not even entertaining, which is probably is greatest fault; it certainly does not engage an audience, nor does it justify its ridiculously long running time.Skip this one and watch the sequel instead; it actually tells a decent story that feels true to the source material, unlike this pathetic garbage. And thankfully, it's also shorter.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Odds are if you played the game, you will be entertained","It's hard to look at this movie and judge it. Do you look at it as an actual movie? A horror movie? An adaptation of a video game? Or a combination of those choices? I went to this with the anticipation that it would be phenomenal, amazing, etc. It fell well short of my expectation. There were a myriad of things wrong with this, mainly, Sean Bean's role...if his role was cut out, I feel the movie would have lost 20-30 minutes of time that made the movie seem just a little too long.One of the parts where I was letdown, though this is probably my own fault, it was not scary. There were barely even any tense moments. I believe this is where the director failed. While some monsters creep-ed around the corner, I believe the tone was ""I am so scared, I do NOT want to see what comes around the corner!"" Although, I was just hoping it came around quicker. I had watched the trailer like a little fan boy over a dozen times, just hoping that this movie somehow freaked me out to where I wouldn't want to turn off the lights when I went to sleep. It failed in that area completely. Do not get me wrong, the whole movie was creepy, and during some of the very gory death scenes it was very eerie. Although it was nothing that honestly ""scared"" me. Once again, this could be my own fault for having such great expectations.The monsters in the movie, while INCREDIBLY well done, were not in the movie NEAR enough. Each monster got a scene, and then onto the next one, just when you hope there would be more of your ""favorite"" one...too bad, you lost it; except for Red Pyramid. His on-screen time is still somewhere around...4 minutes...maximum.It sounds as if I didn't like the movie, this is false. I did enjoy the movie, but mainly due to the fact, I played the games, I got their plot. So, I know what the director was going for. In a game, you, the character, run around and just try to find stuff, you get random clues and go there with little to no explanation. The problem is, this doesn't work in movies that well. Especially if you've never played the games, you will be wondering ""Ok, now why did that picture just appear next to the Jeep? How did they really know to go to the school? Isn't that just a BIT to coincidental? Although if you have played the games (mainly the first) you will probably be thinking ""Oh man! They are following the game almost perfectly!"" The sets, the soundtrack, the ambiance, and once again the monsters were incredible. I'm not a fan of computer graphics permeating a movie. Although this is where you really needed it, mainly when the town is transformed by the darkness. It is amazing how it is done.I believe that is the main difference between people who do and don't like it. If you haven't played the games, and don't know what the director was going for, don't see this movie. Odds are you won't like it.The way I looked at this is from a horror/video game adaptation point. The plot was changed to something that reminded me of The Grudge a bit, and don't worry, I wouldn't call that a spoiler. It felt a little long, but during the movie, through most of this review has been pointing out its flaws...I WAS entertained by it. I might even see it again. I give it a 6 because a 5 is average, and this was a bit better than the average horror movie. If a sequel is to be made, hopefully they will throw in more recurring monsters, and take out needless side plots.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Vivid, different, and interesting","If you would like to hear from a non-gamer/non-biased perspective:Silent Hill overall is an unpleasantly enjoyable cinema scape. You will spend at least half of the movie with an uneasy feeling in your stomach and they manage to do this without any shock factor. Most of this comes from the cleverly crafted ambiance in the film. The pace, mood, cinematography, and unusual music all align perfectly so that little is needed of dialog. A major problem arises with one specific character which with any logic does not justify their actions/sacrifices let alone their existence, so not much thought was put into character development. Another flaw might be that the dialog is pretty dry. However, I do not believe the film's importance lies in the dialog but is heavily conveyed through its visuals. If you enjoy films that are very imaginative and unique I would recommend Silent Hill.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Search of everything...,"""Silent Hill"" is the first movie of the Silent Hill collection and in this movie we watch a woman who goes in search for her daughter in a desolate town called Silent Hill. This city is also very strange because some dangerous and strange things happen.I liked this movie because it is based on the video game which is also great. About the direction of this movie I have to say that Christophe Gans made a really great job. Radha Mitchell who played as Rose Da Silva made a really nice interpretation and Jodelle Ferland who played as Sharon / Alessa made for one more time a beautiful interpretation.Finally I have to say that ""Silent Hill"" combines really well mystery with horror and also represents perfectly the video game.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Freakin Cool,"Now being a fan of the video game I was a bit worried another great game would have a lackluster movie, but I was surprised. I knew I was in good hands when the opening music from the first game started playing over the logo.Its got a great cast, some of whom play characters from the game but slightly different.The story is a tight and moves fast and is enough of a change from the game so fans will have something new to watch.The special; effect are also better than average with really creepy monsters and victims. As an added treat the music is taken from the game to give it the complete silent hill feel.My only dislikes were the actress who played Cybil,she did not seem very likable and my other complaint is not enough Sean Bean who is great in everything, he was underused.

Visually interesting but incomprehensible and too long,"Christophe Gans directs Silent Hill, a stylish and visually impressive but overlong and totally confusing film. Starring Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean as a couple whose daughter disappears. The entire movie consists of two different plots: Mitchell in the ghost town of Silent Hill looking for her daughter and Sean Bean in the real world looking for his wife and daughter. Confused? Good, because you will be when you watch this film. That's because the film does not make any sense at all.I was intrigued by the visuals for the first half hour of the film. The film runs 2 hours which is way too long and the film becomes repetitive and drags, not to mention increasingly confusing.The film cuts between the fog world of Silent Hill and the clear real world and when it does it derails the film.Supposedly, the film is based on a video game. Unfortunately, those of us who haven't played the game don't know what the heck is going on.Director Christophe GansCastRadha Mitchell ... Rose Da SilvaSean Bean ...

"Despite it's flaws, it captures the tone and spirit of the game perfectly","'Silent Hill' is a stylish, atmospheric and intense supernatural horror flick that features an interesting plot, elaborate set designs and stunning visuals. Directed by Christophe Gans and based upon the video game series of the same name, this film captures the tone and spirit of the game perfectly and while it does have a few flaws, there's enough entertainment here for not only fans of the game, but for fans of horror flicks in general and works as a satisfying horror genre effort.The Plot = Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) takes her adopted daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the town of Silent Hill, for which Sharon cries while sleepwalking. Rose is involved in a car accident near the town and awakens to find her daughter missing and so begins Rose's horrific and nightmarish journey to her back.This movie is an underrated gem that often gets overlooked especially when it comes to naming solid (of even good) video game adaptations where this definitely ranks as one the very best from that sub-genre. The direction by Christophe Gans is fantastic as he gives the movie strong visuals and plenty of creepy imagery, and the productions values are superb here with each set designs well detailed and the ghost town of Silent Hill itself looks fantastic shrouded in fog and bleakness which gives everything a cool and eerie look to it and perfectly captures that atmospheric dread. However, the film is far from perfect due it's muddled plot that drags in quite a few places and the film could have benefitted from a tighter script which could have really elevated this to a whole other level, but as it stands it's a fun ride from start to finish.The performances here are decent. Radha Mitchell gives a strong and compelling performance as the female lead and she's someone you can really root for. Laurie Holden gives a solid performance in her supporting role as the cop Cybill Bennett who gets caught up in this nightmarish world. Sean Bean gives a decent performance despite not having much to do. Alice Krige gives a fine and memorable performance as the crazy cult leader and finally Jodelle Ferland gives a good performance as the daughter Sharon.Overall 'Silent Hill' is by no means a masterpiece, but its far better than about 95% of video game adaptations and while its lack of focus towards the story is a bit disappointing, overall its positives outweigh the negatives.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hmmm . . . not a good adaption, much less a good movie . . .","Regardless of what others have said, anyone seeing this film should be forewarned: if you never played the game, you probably won't like it, and if you have played the game you will most likely hate it. As a movie it fails completely: has many characters that are unnecessary and should have been entirely deleted (I'm looking at you Sean Bean's character), not to mention weak acting on a whole from most characters. The story is pretty ridiculous and illogical (not in the sense of ""could this literally happen"" but in the idea that the concepts that are being portrayed are never clearly or consistently made evident.) and even worse dialogue. Cybil Bennett's character is completely out of context and is not an accurate representation of her character from the movie. This stands for the entire movie: none of the characters or even the plot represent and are an accurate adaptation of the game. In the game Dahlia Gillespie was at best a delusional psychotic, and at worst pure evil. In the movie she is portrayed as one of the most sympathetic characters in the film. The nature of evil in Silent Hill is clearly expressed in the game, whereas in the movie it is totally shifted and is never really explained. All I'm saying is be warned: great evil is approaching us, in the form of incompetent filmmakers who take good stories, throw them in the stupid-meets-total-bullshit blender, and creates total waste that continues to feed the minds of the moronic and dimwitted.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"There are some flaws, but in the end it is a good movie with a cool message!","Last night I went to a preview screening of ""Silent Hill"" in San Diego. I was anticipating this movie for a couple of months now. Even though I never played the video games I am very familiar with their story lines. I definitely wanted to see how Christophe Gans interpreted all of the material from the games into a cohesive movie that would be scary, disturbing, and thoughtful.After seeing it I have to say that the movie is no masterpiece. Some of the CGI looks a little weird, some of the ideas in the movie feel stolen from other movies (the game takes a lot from other horror movies), the plot line with Sean Bean's character is a little thin and feels thrown in (which it was because the studio did not like a script with only females), some of the acting and dialogue are mediocre (not bad, just not great), and the plot has some issues.However, the movie is creepy, and at times disturbing. Not in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" way that leaves you disgusted, but more in the way of haunting images and setting. The biggest strength of the movie lies in its art design; the town, the creatures, and the costumes pull you into a very unnerving world.If you are familiar with the games the plot will keep you guessing. I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but the ending is not like the games. That is the film's other big strength. The third-act really shows an interesting social and political message that some might overlook. As much as the horror elements carry this film, it is really the message that elevates the film from gory atmospherics into something that is more thoughtful than your average fright-fest.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best of a very poor bunch,"(56%) Unlike Super Mario bros, Street fighter, Doom, most of the Resident evil series, well pretty much every video game movie, this at least has some real connection with its source materiel. And although I'm no fan of the game, the tone, visuals, monsters, concepts all have the spooky feel that made the game a hit. The movie though is a bit forgettable and over-long, and the overuse of CGI monsters and general effects is a little excessive which takes away from the quite intense and really quite scary scenes. As a horror this is a decent spook show, and as a video game movie it's really quite good, maybe even the best of the lot, although with that said the competition overall is less than impressive.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It wasn't good but it didn't suck.,"OK i expected the movie to bomb to be honest. I've played all four Silent hills and I am an fan of the series, include the comic books. Although it does help to understand the movie, it is not necessary to beat the game to understand what was going on.One of the aspects I didn't like of the movie was that the acting was horrible. Many times I found my self laughing at how the characters portrayed themselves. The main character, like most girls in horror movies, suffered severely from dumb-chick-in-a-horror-movie syndrome, and a lot of her decisions left me yelling/laughing at the movie screen. Two other aspects that I was disappointed at were the atmosphere of the movie and the soundtrack. The soundtrack featured songs from the Silent Hill video games. I never liked many of the songs from the video games because they tried to be emotional, but never really quite made it. The atmosphere of the movie wasn't as scary as the game, and didn't give the same edge-of-your seat type thrill. The game still freaks me out, but the movie just didn't go as far for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I little slow, uncertain end, but overall entertaining","Just got this in from Netflix and got to watch it with my wife. We are both horror/supernatural fans and this was right up our alley.I don't get into retelling the plot of the story as you can read that anywhere. To me it's more important to get across what I got out of the movie.Overall, Silent Hill was an intriguing and entertaining movie. As many reviewers have stated, the visuals are astounding. The atmosphere of the movie really lends to a somber, creepy and eerie feel when following the characters of Rose and the cop- Cybil.In all honesty I wasn't too interested in the scenes involving the character of the father (Sean Bean). They helped add the back story but it almost seemed they could have been avoided.The main things I enjoyed in Silent Hill were the atmosphere and the creatures. The director did an excellent job of creating that eerie atmosphere needed for a movie of this style. Also the creatures were very unique and came across as something out of a nightmare. Another thing is there were no cheap scares. It wasn't like a creature popped out from around a corner after two minutes of suspense music. When a creature was coming you saw it coming. It was the way it moved and the way it looked that made it creepy and unnerving, not a cheap shock to make you jump.I've read some reviews where people knocked this movie for reasons that seemed very personal. I'm not going to attack those people but I've learned you really have to go into a movie with a completely (and I really mean completely) open mind. Yes this movie is based on a video game (which I've never played) but that doesn't mean it is the video game. Also it is in the horror/supernatural genre so if that's not your thing, then obviously this movie won't be either. In any case you have to let your mind go and let the movie tell the story, not your memories of the game or preconceptions of anything else. Being a horror fan, I love Stephen King books. I've seen enough movies based on Stephen King books to realize that the movie is not the book. The movies are either a screenwriter's interpretation or retelling of the story in the book. In some cases the screenwriter even goes on a tangent and loosely bases the script on the story. That's what I get from this movie. It is not Silent Hill the game, it is Silent Hill the movie. (I guess it should have had a disclaimer of ""Based on the video game of the same name."")OK, enough analyzing the reviewers that didn't like this movie. I myself did find flaws but nothing to the degree most people hate this movie for. There is some bad acting but nothing that bad that you can't over look. (Being a horror movie fan I've seen some very badly acted movies and this isn't one of them.) Another sore spot is the movie does have some slow spots where you are waiting for things to pick up. I hate pointing this out as all movies need to slow down so the viewer is given some explanation for what is going on but sometimes this happens in an awkward spot or when the viewer would like some more action/suspense/whatever to happen. I felt some slow spots in Silent Hill occurred in this manner. Also, the ending was a little bit uncertain. I don't want to go into details but my wife and I had two conclusions about the ending and weren't really sure which one was the correct one or if there is actually a different conclusion. This is probably the most troubling of all the problems with the movie as when a movie ends badly, that's the last thing you remember and so even if the rest of the movie is good you feel like you just saw a bad movie.In all I give Silent Hill a rating of 7 out of 10. I'd probably go with 6.5 if IMDb did halves but I liked it too much to give it a 6.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best yet,"After a small screening in our town I fell in love with Silent Hill all over again.Me and a couple friends got tickets for a midnight screening last night and from what I saw in the trailers this was going to be a good movie and it was! Right from the start you notice how emotions and character are a big part of the film especially the stellar storyline, I love how they changed Harry Mason from Silent Hill one into a woman (not in a literal sense) the main actress has a lot of great scenes and plays them out well especially during the scene with the Janitor creature and most of every scene where shes shocked or frightened. I have to say though most of Sean Bean's (sp?) scenes weren't that great with the acting, the whole side dish from the atmosphere of Silent Hill and Rose's search to Christopher was a little relief mainly because it gives the audience who haven't played the game a little more storyline. The ending was pretty sad though it's one of those climaxes that make you wonder. Other than that I really loved the whole Cybill scene (fans of the game and people who have watched the movie know what i'm talking about.) Let's hope the critics accept this film and it makes a huge success I accepted it along with my friends. The nurse scene was scary lol first time I screamed in awhile. So yes Gans did one HELLUVA fine job with Silent Hill! Thank god Konami didn't give this movie to Uwe Boll or i'd just simply die and give up on video game film adaptations.Great sense of the original video game atmosphere, chilling and edge of your seat sound and some of the best use of CG fog and GREAT acting.Watch this movie and don't listen to critics or that one reviewer who said this movie was boring.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Adherance to setting a tone and mood redeems a clumsy script.,"The argument over which is the best video game adaptation is a brief one to this point, as until now there are precious few even reasonable efforts available, let me put it this way:90% of films based upon games SUCK!The 10% of exceptions are understandably rare, I can only think of Resident Evil off the top of my head (hardly awesome by the way). Hit-man, Max Payne, Street Fighter, Mario Bros, Mortal Kombat - all lousy. (I would definitely check out a Left 4 Dead film though, that seems purpose built for adaptation.)Back to Silent Hill, the game seemed to cry out for someone to take a crack at it, and while they didn't take short cuts it still feels just a little off - though not much mind you.The game was all pacing, atmosphere, eerie noises, deliberately poor lighting and of course freaky creatures designed more to disturb than scare, and the main themes are all faithfully executed here.The film starts with a sleepwalking kid being tracked by her parents and ultimately saved from peril at the last minute, when secured the girl, named Sharon starts babbling ""Silent Hill, SILENT HILLLL""! As this apparently has happened many times before Mum (Rahda Mitchell) is understandably concerned, and does a bit of homework before setting off on a road trip to the titular locale, without telling Hubby Christopher though. This perturbs Christopher somewhat, and he googles Silent Hill to find it has a less than normal history, so he reports a kidnapping and cancels wife Rose's credit cards - I've wanted to do the same thing to my wife many times - but for different reasons.Thereafter Rose stops to get fuel and finds she has no credit, when a traffic cop checks out her number plates and discovers the kidnapping report, rather than explain herself Rose for some reason drives off from the cop and a dangerous chase in thick fog ensues. For someone gung-ho on helping her kid it seemed like a bit of a stretch that she would so soon put her and her child in danger but movie's need conflict so there we go.Of course both Rose and the motorcycle cop crash, and Rose wakes up alone on the outskirts of Silent Hill, with no sign of her daughter. Abandoning the car she walks into the town to find Sharon only to find the town seemingly deserted.Now the video game stuff starts. Periodically sirens ring out in the town, which is a warning to the townsfolk to get inside, shortly after the town goes from light to dark almost instantly, and after that you don't wanna be outside.It's hard to explain this movie even with spoilers, but as I am determined to remain spoiler-free I'll just say that the remainder of the film involves Rose and the cop teaming up to find Sharon, and coming across both the local inhabitants who spout vaguely religious babble, and other locals who, to be honest, are all quite unique and freaky, and at times offputting.The film has no major on screen violence, but there are some graphic and intense visuals. The sets, locations and special effects are all pretty top notch and add to building tone and the sense of disquiet. There is a little too much ""look at how clever we are"" camera-work, which is so obvious that it at times distracted me and momentarily took me out of the movie.As with all such films the movie sets out to wrap all loose ends up, in this case in one long baffling sequence of events. I rewatched the closing scenes again to see what exactly I missed and am sure that I saw what I was supposed to, but I still can't explain why a lot of stuff happened and exactly what happened in the very last frames.If this was what the filmmakers set out to achieve then I guess that's mission accomplished, if not then I must have missed something. I guess with a film that is all about ambiguity and misdirection it would make some sense to remain vague as to why and how things actually happened, but it left me feeling a little dissatisfied.One thing that always gets me in these films, at one point the two leads are getting understandably frazzled and one grabs the other and says ""It's going to be OK! WE'RE going to be OK!"" As I recall this was shortly after being confronted by both a huge being wearing an enormous triangle shaped helmet and carrying an equally large hammer, and not too long after being attacked in a small room by a guy with an eight foot sword that can plunge through a metal door! This struck me as more glass half-full than I would be feeling in this situation! Aside from the notably cool closing credits, what impressed me most wasn't so much the film even, but the effort that went in to making an honest to goodness movie. This is no el-cheapo knockoff spat out to make a few bucks from people who don't blink before shelling out $90 on a game, it was a realistic attempt to make something faithful to the source material yet entertaining in its own right. The acting was solid, the production values far beyond most similar flicks and the plot while flawed, at least strived to remain plausible.Points for effort. One knock though, 125 minutes of largely running around in the mist is just too long! Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. A great example of mood and tone over actual plot and action. This is worth a look and at the very least tries to remain interesting.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid movie all around,"I had the opportunity to see this at a prescreening and I have to say, this may be one of the best if not the best video game adaptations ever made. The movie follows the general plot of the first game, with elements of the second and third games as well. Of course, being a movie it has to take some liberties, including plot elements that were not present in the games. However, I think anyone who is a fan of the game will not be disappointed by what they have done here. It's a very fun movie to watch, managing to capture the disturbing psychological elements as well as the straight out horror moments that those of us who have played the game really enjoy. People who have not played the game will still enjoy the movie, although it will probably be a different experience from that of the gamers. Even if you do not like it as much as you might have hoped, I think you will at least consider your money well spent.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A waste of time and money,"Having never played the 'Silent Hill' games I am unable to comment on the accuracy of the adaptation skills regarding this movie. So to look at it from a pure film point of view I am sorry to say it was terrible. The premise although ridiculous did hold promise for some scares at least. Sadly this was not the case, the film lacks, visual style, scares or even shocking gore. Over long and complicated, the only saving grace are the two lead characters, who at least manage to create a strong female presence often lacking in this type of genre film. The plot meanders along, losing momentum at crucial points and skipping over more interesting scenes. This is a pure exercise in money making, please don't waste your time on such drivel. If you hold a small interest at all, wait until it arrives on DVD, and even then, don't say I didn't warn you.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has its moments,"Silly at times and overall pretty nonsensical, this nevertheless has plenty of spooky atmosphere, quite a bit of tension here and there, some fascinating visual effects and a lot of creepy scenes. It also has Radha Mitchell, an actress I've always liked, but despite a long and successful career, after her initial critical acclaim in High Art she has never really hit the so-called big time, but she's been in a number of films that I have liked. As usual, she does well here. The only brief setup for this story is a little girl who keeps waking up at night screaming Silent Hill, which is a shut down ghost town. Within no time at all, she decides the way to cure her daughter of this problem is to take her there in the middle of the night alone. Doesn't seem the sharpest way to treat this problem. She then needs to crash through a gate to keep people out of Silent Hill since she is being relentlessly pursued by a very over reactive cop. They all crash in one way or another and they spend their time in this very creepy place the entire night. And they have to as the roads that got them there are suddenly gone. The whole thing is nonsense, but again, it's creepy. It's also too long for something so slight. Laurie Holden plays the cop and she's pretty good, but Jodelle Ferland as the daughter is not. The first hour is the best part.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nothing Special , Mildly Good","Silent Hill is a very entertaining and boring film at the same time. In the movie, a mom makes it her responsibility to check out a town called Silent Hill, due to the constant sleep-walking made by her daughter in which she screams out ""Silent Hill""!!! When the mom arrives to the city, everything is not what it seems.This movie is very entertaining to say the least. It had my attention through most of the film. The lead actress was stunning as the mom in peril. The dad was a horrible actor mainly because his scenes were not necessary. The bad part about this film that it does not stand alone as a good movie. You have to basically tell someone that doesn't know the video game that it is a movie based on a video game. If Silent Hill wasn't a video game, people would be going like, ""what the f*#k does that mean?"". There are also MANY dragged out conversations which are so boring beyond belief.All in all, this movie is a thriller that will bore you from time to time unless your an avid gamer that enjoyed the Silent Hill series.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"When its being creepy, its fantastic....","I'm gonna sound like an short attention spanned teen by saying this , but silent hill is only really enjoyable when it cuts to the action-stuff like weird mutant babies gallvanting around, a monster with a pyramid for a face freakishly stalking our shreeking heroes and when hordes of satanic bugs swarm the place: When things get creepy in silent hill- thats when things are interesting.When characters are talking however, things become dull. Christopher gans has succeeded in delivering an incredibly disrturbing looking film with an unnerving atomstphere and beautifully nightmarish set pieces but when it comes to making the characters interesting and the acting decent he falls short-the frights and the creepy creatures is where you'll get your enjoyment with this game adaptation.Great when its trying to scare you, but dull in other departments, silent hill is worth a watch .",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A trip into the disturbing,"In my opinion most of the ""professional"" critics are old, without taste, and avid haters of video games and anything spawned from it. I loved this film. I will admit the climax got kinda jumbled and didn't fit what I thought would be a normal Silent Hill experience, but the rest of the film and the ending fit perfectly. The visuals are not intended to bring about a sense of horror, but are intended to deeply disturb you. If you have played the Silent Hill experience, you will understand more, as this film was tailored to the MILLIONS of SH fans, but if you're not, maybe this will intrigue you enough to pick up the series and give it a go. This is not intended to be classed as a Horror film, and the confusion the critics are causing really deters from what should be a good ""Jacob's Ladder"" type film. This film will merit a sequel, and by listening to the fans, the series will expand on what was strong about this film, and build on what a final confrontation should have been.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Welcome to Silent Hill,"This is an amazingly done adaptation of the original game. Very enjoyable to watch from beginning to end, with lots of moments that encourage you to throw a rock at your screen.Do I think it's a horror movie in the sense of giving you jump scares every two seconds? No. But it's definitely dark, psychologically eerie, and infuses you with thrill once the protagonist enters Silent Hill. The atmosphere of the place perfectly illustrates its name. In that regard, I also believe that they portrayed the fact that there's no single and/or a group of antagonists in the film. Instead the place, Silent Hill, becomes a unified identity forming the antagonist of the story.It is definitely grotesque and horrifying, but it is done in an amazing way. By no means I intend to claim that it wasn't unsettling to watch some of the scenes, it very much is, but only for the purpose of serving the plot and showcasing the terrors behind Silent Hill perfectly.The CGI, I think, isn't the worst for the time the film was made in. But I also think this merely adds more to the film's overall experience rather than taking from it.I love the acting of both Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean, there portrayals of their characters was executed at a complementary level for the film. Another complementary aspect in the film is the soundtracks! They are iconic and unforgettable, specially ""Otherworld"" and ""Maternal"" they are beautiful, and put this film a level higher than it should be. The soundtracks perfectly fit this collective and unified antagonist, and they make some scenes overwhelmingly intense, and I am here for it!Will watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Crap,"Sorry, but this movie was just plain BAD.I guess these days ""horror"" is just another word for ""gore"", and no movie seems to epitomize this more than Silent Hill.I won't go into spoiler details, but suffice it to say, if you're looking for a psychological thriller, you won't find it here. Most likely you'll leave the movie shaking your head, wondering why you just wasted your money. You were better off buying the game.Things are just so terribly unrealistic in this movie, it will be hard to be genuinely scared by any of it, instead thinking to yourself, ""Um, that doesn't work that way."" We're used to Hollywood thinking its viewers are morons... Silent Hill doesn't shy away from that perception.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent Hill makes me happy!!!!,"OK, first off to the people who gave it bad reviews: do you have any idea what the real Silent Hill is about? the games themselves leave us players asking questions even until the ending. there are still parts in the four games I am still trying to figure out. Second, the games are scary in the psychological point of view. third, the film itself isn't just about the gore or the freaky ""pop out"" scares, what made it scary was the fact of Rose's reason to be there. Silent Hill the movie did exactly what the video games did, it scared me to a point where i realized i was also living it (when I play the games i feel like I am the one isolated there). The movie did the same for me and i am happy for that. the music was awesome and the monsters were believable. the story itself is explained in a form where the audience must ask themselves the questions in order to find the secrets beneath. the games made me do the same and so does the movie. The thing about the movie is that if you do not pay close attention to the film you won't get it, not even the ending. the gore and blood is a lot but hey it is Silent Hill. the ""other"" world is so believable again I felt like i was there. The only thing I had a problem with in the movie was that it kind of jumped to the town without going into much explanation with who they were. But then again that's Silent hill for you, you do not know the characters until you uncover their backgrounds through 'clues"". Awesome and terrifying story 10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
If only this was the new standard for video game-based cinema...,"Most movies based on games just suck. In a lot of cases they suck even harder than imaginable ( Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Alone in the dark, etc).We already had some pretty decent movies based on Tombraider and Resident Evil ( forget the sequels...) And now they turned Silent Hill into a pretty steady psychological horror-flick that stays true to its virtual counterparts. The movie itself is a treat for the fan of the franchise - you'll recognize some sets and creatures from the games - and does have a solid storyline and visually stunning imagery. Some of the acting of the side-characters is a bit dull, but the main character Rose DaSilva ( Radha Mitchell ) and her wicked daughter ( Deborah Kara Unger ) do have enough charisma to keep you emotionally involved with the story. One thing: it all felt a bit artificial and over-the-top. They could've tuned down on the monsters and action sequences. They make the movie feel like a train ride in a ghost house instead of an atmospheric mystery story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't waste your money,"From it's vague and unbelievable beginning to it's tired drawn out climax, this movie left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. I'm not writing a synopsis as I refuse to waste any more time on this movie than I already have, but I will try and point out the pro's and con's in deciding to sit through this travesty. First off, on the positive side, this movie does seem to stay true to the game and should please fans of PS series by staying true to the morbid and creepy apocalyptic atmosphere that has been associated with the game. While the violence and monster effects were pretty interesting, it was not enough to save this train wreck of a movie from a variety of pitfalls. Unbelievable dialogue runs RAMPANT in this movie and in turn made me unsympathetic to the poorly portrayed characters and sabotaging what should of been the shining point of this movie: the story. The pace created by the director is both rushed where more of the story should be fleshed out, and stretched out to a boring length at times that are just plain boring. In short, aside from the spooky atmosphere and nods to the video game, Silent Hill has very little to offer in terms of a engrossing story, solid characters, and a plot that seems cohesive with the pace of the movie. It's a shame that they took the potentially rich story and delivered in such a ridiculously unbelievable and unsatisfying way. My advice is to see another movie or bash your head off of a wall until you lose consciousness, you're guaranteed to see just as much blood and suffer the proportional amount of brain damage as sitting through the movie itself. You've been warned.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
See this movie,"Silent Hill is an excellent modern horror movie that completely avoids the trappings of its contemporaries by giving tone and character first priority and eschewing the cheap scare tactics and gotcha! surprise jolts that have become so cliché and indicative of a lack of true vision in the genre. I was almost completely unaware of the game before seeing this movie, and I was not affected either way, I think; this film stands solidly as a nightmarish world that completely engulfs the viewer and has its own perfectly realized set of rules and logic. I do not understand Roger Ebert's lack of ""understanding"" of the film - everything that needs to be understood is explained in an artful, seamless manner. The strengths of this film are many, but what stands out (as Ebert did actually mention) is the incredible attention to set detail and the horrific and painterly style in which the denizens of Silent Hill are brought to life. We, as a modern audience, are now so accustomed to seeing CG elements in fantasy films that our brains acknowledge them, but still quickly accept the just barely perceptible non-reality of it all; surprisingly, Silent Hill achieves most of its thrills the old-fashioned way, sans computer, and the effect is breathtaking. You can really FEEL the difference - the buildings, the creatures, the danger is all present on screen, in such a human-scaled way. This movie is one of the most visceral I have ever seen, and is the most engrossing horror film since the first Hellraiser; I would even put it alongside such psychological horror classics as Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. And like The Shining, the location itself is a character, and a hauntingly fascinating one at that. Yes, it is that good. The acting is first-rate, the screenplay by Roger Avary is tight, propulsive, and downright creepy, and the ending is so anti-Hollywood-easy, that by the time you leave the theater, not only will the outlandish visions stay with you, but the more mundane and human concerns of the everyday type characters will haunt you, too. See this movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not a happy ending,"The movie is very scary, be prepared to light a cigarette every 10 minutes (the better if you don't smoke). I never even knew there was a game that this movie is made after until I read it on IMDb. What I didn't like at all was the end, which to me is very important. Usually with movies, you would want a happy ending or some sort other sort of closing. Something that lets you easily imagine how the movie would continue if it did. Through out the movie, I would naturally think it was a bad idea to go to Silent Hill, but the way things work out makes you think it was a good idea. Kind of like ""The Ring"". I was hoping for their lifes to go back to normal without the girl having nightmares. I can't say too much more, but be prepared to be disappointed when the screen turns black and the credits start showing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"good on it's own, but strays from game","just got back from seeing it and i definitely don't regret going, but the plot was kind of all over the place, for starters. dahlia was turned from a villain to a victim, and the entire reason for existence and motivation behind the cult is different. there was also a duality sequence while Chris searched for his wife and daughter, that compared the real silent hill and the one Rose was experiencing, that just felt like filler. this also means that you were taken out of silent hill a lot, which should never happen because it takes destroys the atmosphere around the hellish town. on its own, it felt a lot like a haunted ride at an amusement park, in that it was a fun ride that tries to creep you out, but just doesn't. it wasn't a horrible flick, it just had little in common with silent hill. the use of Yamaoka's music was a good idea, for the most part, and the setting was recreated really well. i just wish the plot was more like the game, or they could have called it something else and left it only reminiscent of a game called silent hill. bottom line, cinematography good, roger avary bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Such a Long, Looooonng film....","I've got to admit that I've been really looking forward to seeing this film for some time. I'm a big fan of the video game series and it's one of the few video game to movie conversions that realistically stood a chance of being good, no mention of Uwe Boll amongst these credits ;) After watching the film, and trust me, it's a long film. Both literally and mentally, I was left feeling indifferent. Which is probably a good way to sum up the film. For fans of the video game they can rest easy at least because it is a faithful adaption and very respectful of the game and its cult status.What made the game such a hit was the feeling of claustrophobia and the creepy story. When you're playing a game in the first person, that tension and dark setting keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you want to keep following the story. When that converts to film and you're watching in the third person. You need to empathize with the characters, they need to be 'rich' and have a good back story. There were several points in this movie where I simply didn't care what happened to the characters.The best analogy I can give is that it was a beautiful artistic creation of the game with all the story and excitement sucked out of it. If you were ever a fan of the game it's still worth a look, just to go 'oooh I remember that bit', or 'wow! That's exactly like the game'. For someone who's a neutral, I'll think there will be chunks of this film where you're left confused and disenchanted.

Sit down and enjoy yourself...,"Game to movie adaptations, how we dread and look forward to them...If you are a fan of the games, then relax, you will like this movie. If you are a fan of solid horror movies and have never heard of Silent Hill, you can relax too, because you'll like this movie. Silent Hill games are all about the atmosphere. No other game has creeped me out as as much except for System Shock 2 maybe. The movie delivers the creepy atmosphere from the games in droves, while infusing just the right amount of action to keep the plot going. After all, this is a two hour movie, not something you are going to finish in 15 hours at your own leisure. Is it an excellent movie? No, by no means. There is room for improvement in several departments, especially the dialog delivery. In all, Christophe Gans and his crew have done well with Silent hill, and as a comparison, if you liked the Resident Evil game to movie translation, then you'll like what they have done here. I'm actually tempted to give this movie an ""8"" just for delivering a good, solid horror film in a time when we, the fans, are only getting really bad scary movies to watch. Hellraiser Hellworld and Deader anyone? Gasp*...Movies based on games have a really bad reputation right now, largely thanks to that nitwit Uwe Boll. Although he's not the only one to have made a bad movie based on a game license, his movies are just that more ""half-arsed"" than others. Actually, a half-arsed attempt to make a movie from a license Boll used so far would result in a better movie than his movies.Silent Hill is just one of those movies that you have to see for yourself, regardless of what you heard or read about it.

A very good thriller.,"Don't think you have to have played Silent Hill in order to ""get"" or even appreciate Silent Hill the movie. I haven't, and I think the movie stands very well on it's own.The imagery is without a doubt the strongest part of the movie. The camera-work is superb and varied and always fitting, and the subdued colours are perfect and moody. The special effects are often really cool and more often than not well integrated in the rest of the scenes, something not even really huge productions manage to pull off all the time.The second strongest part was the sound. The score is haunting and hangs heavy over the scenes. The air-raid signal, the first time it's played, sends chills down the spine. The silent parts are well placed as well and you want them both to end and not to end, since they really add to the tension.The story is smart, not the usual Hell invades fare(ala Doom), but shows the dangers of fanaticism. The acting is pretty solid. Although the movie breaks the ""Creepy adult-ish child""-quota(No more than zero per movie), it's done with style and not just for it's own sake.Overall, the tension was great. Some scenes were disturbing, some scary, some just plain cool in their blood-curling way.

One Of The Better Game-To-Film Adaptations,"Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) is a mother who is attempting to find out why her adopted daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), is continuously having dreams about the small ghost town of Silent Hill. Rose decides to go to Silent Hill in an attempt to find answers, but unfortunately finds herself caught up in a living hell.Silent Hill is one of the much better attempts of the game-to-film adaptations. One of the best aspects of the film is the atmosphere which is nothing short of excellent, especially when ""the darkness"" starts to fall and the warning that sounds out when this is about to happen. It brings about a terrific feel of claustrophobia during these scenes which just adds to the feel of the movie.The photography is really good as well and brings a really creepy ghostly feel to the town of Silent Hill and the labyrinth of corridors below. The ""monsters"" are also impressive, especially the main one of Pyramid Head. Unfortunately he isn't in the movie for that long which is a shame because this character is so imposing and freaky that it would have been good to have had him in the film for longer periods. But what there is of him is good, though.One of the main downsides to the movie was the casting of Sean Bean as Christopher Da Silva. Not because he himself was poor but because his American accent was. This is one of those annoying things that movie makers do and is a pet peeve of mine. Instead of getting an American to play the part, they get an actor who is from Yorkshire which is one of the strongest English accents you can get. Anyway, I generally don't mind Sean Bean, but his accent was just a bit off-putting and his own accent still comes through a bit too much. He isn't in the movie for too long at any one period so fortunately it doesn't ruin the feel of the movie too much.All in all, Silent Hill is a very decent movie to watch. Sit back with the sound up and with the lights off for a much better feel. Definitely recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Although there were a few gory scenes to make up for the multiple plot holes, the acting was horrible and overall it was a disappointing waste of money. We really were looking forward to a scary movie, this just bordered on ridiculous. It was more gore than scare.

The last ones that had me cowering so were the Ringu series and Audition.(BTW, I still fear Sadako like nothing on earth.) I watched my friend play all the games before seeing the film, so that did help, but I must admit that I wanted to make that stupid woman stop yelling for her kid every 3 seconds.

It's was Alright,"I'll keep this short.I'm a fan of the video game that this film was adapted from, so that was part of the reason why the film held some interest in me. The film's cinematography, story, and style is very much a substance carried over from the games. It shouldn't allow for stale acting though and poor dialogue. The acting in the film is comparable to that of the voice acting in the games. It's is more preferable, but the acting needs more ""omph"".The effects and gore are great, very stylistic and gross.Sometimes the music gets in the way of a dramatic scene, even though the style of the music is close to that of the games. It just doesn't fit at all...

"nice, creepy atmosphere","One of the better horror films for a while. It has a nice, creepy atmosphere, an effective music score which adds character. Nice touch to keep it electronic, makes a change from the typical orchestral sound. The film holds up well for the first hour fifteen minutes, then the plot starts to get a little more convoluted for its own good, and the ending just adds layers of more confusing stuff on top of what has come before. Some things do not need to be explained, and when the explanation just makes everything more confusing, better to leave it alone. These faults aside, it is a well made and atmospheric film which brings back fond memories of the good old 80s, when one first encountered Carpenter, Phantasm, Hellraiser and From Beyond. The focus here is more on the dense atmosphere of the decaying environments than cheap shock scares, which is very welcome. I actually came to think of Orson Welles The Trial, which has a similar surrealistic journey through a nightmarish and decayed world, and can also be described as a horror film in a way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The game is scary because it has that psychological terror, this movie doesn't have that and that's why it's not scary.","It's missing that *psychological* horror. Silent Hill is a town that is dark even when there is daylight because the fog is so thick. This fog or smog is so thick that the only time you're able to see anything is when you're close to it. Imagine being lost walking around looking for your daughter in Silent Hill, a place with thick fog where you could only see as far as your hand can go. That's the psychological horror, and the movie didn't have that.In the game, unpredictable and unexplainable things happen. These things are not suppose to be scary but you might get scared anyways. In the game, for example, doors that were once locked are now mysteriously open. Classroooms that were once filled with tables become empty. After returning to an elevator, another button suddenly appears leading you to another room. It's not that scary but the more these events happen, the more that psychological confusion builds up until it becomes horrifying. And then, the ""darkeness"" comes and then your state of mind loses control. This movie didn't have that process and that feeling. It doesn't have that originality.The first 30 minutes of this movie was very good. Then after a while you'll start to yawn at the nonsense they give you afterwards. In my opinion, there's too many characters. The only Silent Hill game I ever played was the first Silent Hill and to me, back then, it was the scariest game I ever played. That game had just a few characters, but it was enough to set that mood of loneliness and fear. When a movie like this has a lot of people in it, it makes you feel like you're in crowded area away from fear.Also, I wanna point out the camera angles. In the game, you feel alone because it feels like there is only one camera following your character. That's what makes the game so interesting, the game doesn't always switch scenes or switch camera. And in the game, you don't ALWAYS here music. That's what makes it scary, the second you hear something you're going to panic. I think the only strong thing in this movie is the computer graphics. Amazing graphics and description of how the ""other world"" should be.And finally, the plot, the plot really had it's weak points. The beginning was easy for everyone to understand and follow. But towards the middle and last part you become more lost than the characters in the movie. Trust me, you'll get confused. But I was expecting this already so I'm not surprised by the people complaining about the plot. The games plot is supposed to be confusing anyway, but when it comes to movies, I don't think anybody likes being confused.If you wanna make a movie based on a game, it should feel like the game. That way, everyone watching will understand why so many Silent Hill fans enjoy the game. They did a pretty good job making the film, but they could have done better. They should have given it some originality, something the audience never seen or felt before in a movie. That's how I felt when I played the game for the first time, it was so original and interesting. And yes, the game will always be better than the movie.Scary? No. Funny? hmm it depends, even though there was no comedy at all but I'm not complaining. Entertaining? Sometimes. Confusing? Yeah, the last half hour of the movie. Worth Watching? If you played the game, if not, good luck.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Dear God, where will it end?","With a wealth of technology at their disposal, with the backing of major studios, with a sea of class 'A' horror/fantasy material written, ready and waiting to be developed for the screen, it challenges belief that filmmakers seem singularly unable to make decent horror/fantasy movies anymore. What really bugs me (just as a brief example) is that no one has yet produced a satisfactory movie of Richard Mathesons' seminal ""I Am Legend"" or even attempted William Hope Hodgesons' ""The House on the Borderland"" or Clive Barker's ""Weaveworld"" or Ramsey Campbell's ""Ancient Images"" (well, in Campbell's case, anything he's ever written). Written works of tremendous quality and potential exist out there, just begging to be developed.The earlier, stark and visceral approaches of directors such as John Carpenter, George A. Romero, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven and others seems to have been diluted these days (even by themselves). They either produce nothing at all, or crank out sanitised re-imagined versions of past glories.Compare ""Land of the Dead"" with ""Day of the Dead,"" or ""Ghosts of Mars"" with ""The Thing"" or ""Red Eye"" with ""The Hills Have Eyes."" What's going on? As Hitchcock aged he matured as a director, as a creator and purveyor of suspense on a visual-emotional level. Granted, his last movie ""Family Plot"" was tripe, but the penultimate ""Frenzy"" was a classic serial killer thriller with some wonderfully manipulative set pieces. He lost none of his creative powers right up until the near end of his life. So, what is going on?Film makers (due to market forces, or youth culture, or whatever) appear bent on feeding us bloodless, disinfected remakes (""The Fog,"" ""When a Stranger Calls"") or glossy throwaway fodder based on video games. Seemingly, as the video game has evolved into a media ""art form"" of its own with a significant and growing penetration into the youth market, it has become, along with the comic book or graphic novel, the preferred source material over the written word. And so we are served up flashy, nonsensical garbage that eschews narrative drive and the creative development of suspense and shocks in favour of tenuously related CGI set-pieces strung together by inane dialogue telegraphed through wooden cipher-performances from actors who really should know better. Still, a buck's a buck.The preceding paragraph sums up for me the movie version of ""Silent Hill."" To truly enjoy this film you'll need to be about ten years old, play video games in a darkened room, have never read a book in your life (apart from the one about Spot the dog), never seen a truly great horror/fantasy movie (or if you did, dismiss it because of a lack of CGI), get easily confused by an episode of ""The Simpsons"" to the point where following a plot line for anything becomes superfluous to your enjoyment and you must have no idea of what good film making is about.This movie is just soso cynical. Sean Bean, for instance, autopilots through his role in such an uninvolved and uncaring fashion that you know he's just doing it for the money. The same as everyone else involved. The writers have made no attempt to structure the plot in any meaningful way  it's disjointed, fragmented and has no focus whatsoever. I agree that a film needs a beginning and a middle and an end, and not necessarily in that order, but there should be some attempt to instill a degree of depth and quality, some emotion into the process that engages with the audience. Nope, 'fraid not. It's loud, sterile, about as scare inducing as a buttercup with as much life in it as a quick-dissolving aspirin. You don't care about the characters  unless you have a particular emotional attachment for cardboard cut-outs  and ultimately watching is a tedious process that is much like chewing celery sandwiched between balsa wood, only using your eyes and ears instead of your mouth and tongue.Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" Romero's original ""Dead"" trilogy, Hooper's ""Chainsaw,"" Dario Argento's ""Suspiria,"" - ""Carrie,"" ""Pet Semetary,"" ""Halloween,"" ""Psycho,""  anything that uses the language of cinema to communicate something of relevance and meaning and entertain by so doing. Watch anything but ""Silent Hill."" Dear God, where will it end?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
what were they thinking???,"First of all, movies made from video games are terrible to begin with (e.g. Resident Evil, Doom, Silent Hill...). I have to admit when I saw the previews for Silent Hill I thought it looked unbelievably scary, but when I saw it last night with my friends we thought it was so horrible that we even walked out on it. The acting was some of the worst acting I have ever seen since Pearl Harbor. And the story. God Almighty. It was going absolutely nowhere. I mean, did anyone actually pay attention to the freaking story, because if you did then you would see how awful the film really is. I mean, it was as if they were writing the script as they were making the film. Or even playing the video game as they were making the film. The only thing I enjoyed about it was that it's cinematography was identical to the video game, but everything else... Pathetic. Huge thumbs down. P.S.: What the f**** is Hollywood coming to? I wouldn't be surprised if 10 years from now we'll all be watching Bollywood films.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Poorly translated from the game, good as a standalone movie","Someone said in a review I read a second ago that ""Silent Hill"" is something that he called a ""nightmare drama."" To clarify, there is no such genre as ""nightmare drama."" That doesn't exist. What he clearly meant to say is that Silent Hill is ""a drama with horrific elements that follows the journey of a central protagonist through a Lovecraftian nightmare world that ultimately leads her to confront deeper aspects of herself and humanity in general.""That, children, is what ""horror"" is.""Silent Hill"" isn't what has become accepted as ""horror."" Horror can be all blood, guts and cheap scares, but that's shallow horror. True horror uses subtlety, slow-burn, suspense, and its horrific elements are made up of things that, given another context, would be normal, or almost normal. Horror is, essentially, when everything in the room is horribly, disturbingly WRONG, but the room doesn't seem to agree. The tone (the feeling of the author or scene) is normal, smooth, almost blasé, while the mood (the reactionary feeling of the audience to the things on screen) is utterly disturbed.Good horror = a man wakes up in his bed, sees his young daughter, who has been dead for years, walking across the ceiling.Bad horror = A masked grotesquery wielding a chainsaw, in full, plain view, cuts a young woman's head off. The camera focuses on what was once her neck, spraying blood all over the room.You're probably asking by this point, ""which is the Silent Hill movie, good or bad horror?"" To tell you the truth, a bit of both.I saw this movie before I played any of the games. That way, I didn't find myself comparing it to every aspect of the games that it got wrong, and I was able to enjoy it to a far greater degree than I would have otherwise. The monsters (especially the Grey Children) were superbly recreated. They were extremely disturbing and the fact that why they look the way they are is never explained makes it even more unsettling; it helps you feel that the protagonist has stumbled into a world that really is completely different from what we have come to know as ""ordinary."" The creepy little girl is the best part, I think. Although creepy little girls with long, black hair are always scary, this movie uses the element cleverly, in a way that doesn't feel as though she's scaring us for the sake of scaring us- there's a reason for everything she does, however unsettling or seemingly random it may appear. This, in turn, adds to the creepiness.That's all the good I have to say about this movie. It was scary at times, but the interjections with Chris Da Silva were pointless and broke the flow of the movie. The climax of the movie on is the best part by far. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but trust me, one of the final scenes in the movie almost makes the whole damn thing on its own. Pyramid Head is pretty cool, but he's just another monster here. He's not playing the role he played in SH2, he's just some guy with a giant, pointy hat and a sword that he probably should have considered scaling down a bit for the sake of practical use (there's a reason it's so huge in the game, but in this movie it's just a part of his costume). The acting is sub-B grade, the story is hammy, Sean Bean's character is more or less pointless, the subtlety was sliced in half by Pyramid Head's great knife, and many of the scarier monsters are put in simply because of their iconic status within the games. The result is that all of them are taken out of context seemingly without the writer of the movie having understood what they were meant to represent in the games. Pyramid Head's role is definitely the most painful case of a beloved Silent Hill ghoul's significance being nullified by his out of context placement in this movie, but the most pointless appearance came from the nurses. Really, why did they have to be in this movie? Was Rose battling with her own sexuality underneath everything else that was going on, trying in vain to repress a furious lust for women? If that's the case, it was never mentioned in the movie, and if it isn't, then the nurses are completely present as a fan service.It's not a bad movie if you judge it by its own merits. I still think someone more capable, that is, someone who actually understood the game, should have another go at the series some ways down the road. As a game to movie translation, this film is a swing and a miss. As a HORROR movie, though, it's well worth at the very least renting for a weekend.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well worth seeing,"The video game which the movie is based on is supposed to be quite good but that does not mean that the movie has to be any good, as a lot of previous video game to movie conversions have proved before (I'm looking at you, Uwe Boll!).Despite the heritage of Mr (or is that Dr?) Boll the movie scores high grades from me (as you might have seen already). It's quite atmospheric and the town of Silent Hill makes a great backdrop for a horror movie.There are certain aspects of the plot that is a bit cliché, and it would have been better to have the movie tell it than having a character explain it all to you three quarters into the movie, but on the whole it's no worse than any other movie of this kind.The actors delivers a very convincing performance and there were times when I shouted at Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) to get a move on instead of screwing around.Silent Hill clocks in at roughly 2 hours but I never felt that the movie lost neither its pace nor its grip.I'm not sure that the ending is the right one for this kind of movie but it didn't spoil the rest of the movie for me -- quite the contrary perhaps as I'm still pondering over it.The movie has it's fair share of gore and blood but it has ""just enough"" to make it scary and there are very few scenes where it's explicit. Most of the time it's psychological terror and uncertainty that keeps you on your toes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I missed the SH-atmosphere...,"I am a fan of the Silent Hill game series (maybe except the 4th part^^), and I was looking forward to see that movie for a long time. The first thing I noticed was that Akira Yamaoka made the music for that movie. And music is one of the most important thing of Silent Hill and its atmosphere. Yeah, this little word: ""atmosphere"". I think the crew around SH ignored that word a little bit. Or they didn't really understand what the typical SH-atmosphere really is. Walking through empty, lost and timeless rooms, hearing the creepy noises coming from everywhere around you. To see the horrifying transitions from the fogged world into the dark world, where the town shows its skeleton and its bloody history. And the awareness, that you have to go THROUGH that hell to get out of that nightmare. In my opinion, they just reached 40 percent of the Silent Hill atmosphere in the movie - maybe less. And in SH there are not the creatures or the special effects the main part, even not the characters (they just give us a chance to see and understand that world) - no, I think it's rather that, what we can't see. Every step you make, that town seems to grow more and more. And the more you see, the more you don't wanna think about what there else could be. THIS is Silent Hill, and I don't know if you ever could put all this into a movie, especially in a Hollywood-movie. For a self-contained movie it has its qualities, but for a Silent Hill movie it is all in all a little bit disappointing. But anyway I liked that movie...For everyone, that don't know the game series: Don't be discouraged to buy any of the games - in that (I recommend starting with part 2, part 3 is visual the best) you going to understand what I've meant in this comment... ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I didn't realize that game movies can be this bad,"Nothing in this movie works. Characters are shallow and do not develop during movie. There is no sense of horror at any point of the movie. Mere splatter is not enough to create horror atmosphere in fact it does the opposite. Shallowness of characters gives no reason to be afraid for them. Cinematopgraphy is so poor that it makes me wonder if director has attended any film school lessons. Games of this genre suffer from bad camera angles and now same feature (or bug) is transferred to movie screen, that is the only achievement of this movie. It resembles the game every way other than atmosphere and suspense. There is even the NPC that tells ""player"" what to do next...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great film that does justice to the game,"This movie was great. It totally lived up to the game's name and most likely let the game's fans happy and satisfied. Those laughable critics are biased against video-game oriented movies - i can't blame them, since Uwe Boll has put his own ""touch"" on the genre - and do not realize that video-game is a form of art! When they heard that it was a film adaptation of a game, they immediately thought that the storyline was poor (which was not!) or that the film bases its strength on raw violence and gory effects (the film has its gory climaxes, but surely does not rely upon them to make fans!). Maybe people should play the game before seeing the film, to see that it's not about monsters and blood, but it's about a beautiful and intriguing nightmare drama, based upon emotions. However, many friends of mine that have never played the games, found it enjoyable and were interested and curious as to what had actually happened in the film. A horror-drama masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm going to tell you why I am surprised...,"It's because this is the first VG based movie ever to be transferred to celluloid successfully. But they say that Thomas Edison made about a thousand errors before perfecting his idea ""the light bulb"" (i think?)-so go figure.At first the movie drags on a bit but things get pretty meaty towards the end of the middle and then excellent in the end. I didn't like Sharon's mom the DaSilva lady because she was just too ballsy for my tastes, just taking it upon herself to go this mystery ghost town named ""Silent Hill"" because Sharon always mentions it in her sleepwalking spells. Obviously, it shows that she has some anger for her husband but why, I don't know, they seem to not care to put the reasons why in the film.If you look at all the demons, and burning babies specters in the Hellish dimension, you could see why it all adds up near the end. I love the big dude with the triangle on his head, dragging that big blade across the ground. The scene when the girls mother and the cop was locked in the closet/fan vent room, and you hear this guy walking (stomping actually) dragging that blade, was great.Of course, it has CGI (which I'm not a fan of) because there are just some scene sequences that computers just can't do professionally as in actually blood, animatronics and related old school SFX; case in point: the scene where the big guy (I guess they call him the ""fiend"") grabs the girl on the steps of the church. I'm not give away what happens but you can tell that parts in that scene was CGI which is lackluster POOR. But on the other hand, the CGI effects were good in showing the process of being burned alive, which I had noticed in the remake of The Hills have eyes.A key thing that grabs me is the scene of the elders meeting in the hotel during the flash back scene kind of reminds me of a certain religious group/org. but I will leave out their name. Not that I am assuming the makers of this movie was intending anything in subtle relation but I did notice the similarities.Now, there are some questions for this movie that I must ask:1. Who was with adult Alyssa (being all burned up) to have a baby and who would want to?2. How did the church know when the darkness was coming in order to sound the alarm?3. It's obvious to (and yet, I could be wrong) that Sharon's mom and the lady cop were dead in order to be in limbo, but where are their bodies?4. Why was the lady cop still alive? I thought when that high priestess lady gave her minions that nod, it was for them to strike the final blow.5. Last but not least, If Alyssa's mother was in limbo, obviously she was dead but she was alive after her daughter was burned up, so did she commit suicide out of guilt or just died later but out of guilt she was in that realm?Other than that, there were great scenes in the movie and I do commend the filmmakers for making it very true to the first game and having a good dialogue for the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I know it's a game cross over but it really does feel like a game not a film,"I was hugely disappointed with Silent Hill. I know it's a game/film cross over, but to be honest it feels like it when sitting in the cinema (my local cinema showed a repeat showing last night). In fact I couldn't shake off the fact this originated from a game and it was almost like there wasn't a projector man in the cinema but someone who was sitting with his feet up with a control pad playing a game for our amusement. The characters to me, lacked any depth and I felt sorry for none of them despite the horrendous things that happen. I am also surprised that Sean Bean signed up for this film that lacked any character depth or a story that grabbed the audience. In it's defence the sets and effects are good and are very convincing. Sometimes too convincing! Overall this film didn't appeal to me, but I can understand why people who did like it, did. But the best thing you can do is judge for yourself. What is one man's meat is another mans poison. Enjoy the film and make your own mind up. I, for one, won't be watching it again!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Ring"" meets ""Hellraiser""","There will be no plot-rehashing here; if you want that, go read someone else's comments (besides, I believe my summary says all that needs to be said, anyway, plot-wise). Here, just, are some thoughts:What's with the evil little girls in horror-movies these days? And do they all have to have long, dark hair?And please, please, please...proofread your dialogue, writers! There is no excuse for dialogue like that...It's so bad at times that my brain is incapable of remembering even any of it, which is especially amazing considering I just got back from the theater about an hour ago. Really. ""You have despoiled an Innocent!"" Or something like that. Bleeeargh! I could write better dialogue than that with an axe in my face. And I'm not saying that out of spite; I'm genuinely concerned that such dialogue didn't ring false to anyone involved in the making of the film. Moreover, there's only so much actors can do to rise above such abysmal lines, so too often, unfortunately, actors get blamed for what is more directly the fault of the writer (as witnessed by the small-scale argument I had with my friend in the car on the way home).OK, enough of that. Still and all, the ideas were imaginative (I know nothing of the game on which it is purportedly based, so I speak with no special knowledge or preconceived notions about it from that point of view); the sets were believable and appropriately decrepit; and the general visuals did what they were supposed to do, I suppose. Plus, Alice Krige plays a great crazy person, in her quietly intense way. Her eyes say more than the dialogue dares utter. But I don't want to get started on that again...All this is to say, if you like metaphysical horror which includes demons and weird religious cults  and possess a tin ear  you'll probably not mind this movie so much, unless you actually start thinking about the plot for more than two minutes.(Seriously, the husband? Totally pointless. It does, indeed, seem as if they simply added his character just for the sake of adding a male character, which I read somewhere here on the IMDb. The one I wanted to know more about - and the only character who came even close to being iconic in any way - was the demon with the really big knife, who didn't even really need it, anyway, since apparently he could just rip your whole skin right off with his bare hands. He made me think of a really cranky Pterodactyl.)These film-makers have definitely seen/read a lot of Clive Barker, and he should be half-peeved. End of rant. And if a cop ever tries to come between you and your daughter just because she (the cop) spent some time trapped in a mineshaft, slap the crap out of her and tell her to get some therapy.",,Anonymous,Horror

Not on par with the Ring scary, but it had its moments which made you hold your breath and jump. I walked out thinking ""Now that wasinteresting."" The monsters were interesting and the set even more so. Visually there is a lot to look at. The 2nd female lead is unnecessary to the over all plot, and seems out of place some how.

All I can say after seeing this movie, is maybe I will pay attention to the critics a little more closely from now on. This movie did not just steal my money, more importantly it stole my time. What a waste of a Saturday afternoon. The movie was confusing, poorly acted, and, overall, just plain god awful. The few good gory scenes did not justify sitting there for two hours. I have never heard so much laughing at a movie. Too bad it wasn't a comedy. There is nothing sadder than an unintentionally funny movie. I left the theater feeling as though I had the very life sucked out of me. This movie is not worth seeing in the theater, buying on DVD, or even watching for free when it comes out on HBO. Run.

"Director swallows game, drops turd","Stupidly violent; and apart from that, stupidly senseless; and then, as it wears on, stupidly pretentious in a garblemouthed, muddleheaded way. Or, in other words, like a video game. It's presumably made for gamers who get off on watching a child tortured and burned black, and then still living and still suffering: gamers who in watching her feel no pity or sorrow but think only: Wow, how cool. No wonder parents are down on these things.This movieization of one of them has a single virtue: an eerie setting, or sequence of settings. But it's used by the director to show off how slick he is rather than to involve us, so that we never get a sense of being with the character, or of feeling with her, as she does what she does--which is to perform childishly repetitive actions such as running through street after street and building after building, meeting horror after horror and discovering the occasional clue or object that allows her to go on, all without rhyme or reason. Or, in other words, like a video game.The actors are all pretty stiff, except for Alice Krige (who's certainly come down in the world since Chariots of Fire). But then the script was impossible to begin with, a product of the kind of mindless, heartless inexperience that is normally available only to children and the incurably childish. After this movie I'm prone to concur with Krige's character: a great big purge of the vicious may be just what this culture could do with, right about now.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Welcome to Silent Hill,"Named by many as ""one of the best adaptations of video games to cinema"", ""Silent Hill"" (2006) stands out with excellent results, surprising for being one of the rare productions based on games that really delivers a quality work.The plot follows a similar structure to the game, although with some changes to avoid predictability and repetition. The decision to keep the original soundtrack was the right one, as the songs fit perfectly into the film's atmosphere. The setting and scenarios, faithfully reproduced from the game, are central elements to the success of the film. Several aspects and references from the original work were incorporated, pleasing fans of the franchise. The creatures, especially those created with practical effects, impress with their fidelity and contribute to an even more striking experience. In contrast, the CGI moments aren't as satisfying, looking dated by today's standards. The addition of several citizens to Silent Hill also undermines the aura of solitude and mystery that characterized the city in the game.Despite some differences in relation to the original plot, ""Silent Hill"" still remains, in 2024, among the best game adaptations for cinema, pleasing both the fan base and audiences who are not familiar with the game.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting Version,"As a big fan, of the Silent Hill Playstation games, I was eagerly awaiting the release of the Silent Hill movie. I was enthusiastic about the release of this movie, but was a bit skeptical since the last great horror PS game (Resident Evil) spawned two horrible made films. My hopes were that someone embraced the Silent Hill experience and would not over bastardize the story and destroy it as Resident Evil had been destroyed. While the movie is highly influenced by the game, it does not completely hold to the storyline behind the Silent Hill games. While some fans may not enjoy this aspect, it had to experience some changes in the plot to make a feature film out of the Silent Hill story. The game was mostly an action/horror that took you to different places to fight different creatures. The plot, of the game, was a simplistic plot to advance you onward in your adventures. The screenwriters embellished the plot line and added some elements to make more of a feature film story. Overall, the film was a nice suspense/horror story. I would have liked to experience more of the evil dimension and had seen more of the creatures from the game introduced into the story. The overdoing of the religious zealots I understand were key to the story, but in a world were religious zealots have caused most of the horrors and trouble of a civilized world, I could have used a touch less of the zealot movements. For a very interesting and suspenseful movie, the ending was a bit weak and anti-climatic. I would still recommend Silent Hill and rate it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Silent Hill: A Retrospect,"While generally bashed by reviewers and by disappoint teenagers with nothing better to do on a Friday night, Silent Hill is an excellent adaptation as well as horror film.Many people complain about two things: 1) 'I don't get it!' 2) 'It wasn't scary!'Well I'm going to address both: 1) You probably don't get it because you never actually sat down and played the games. When viewing a film with such a complex back story as Silent Hill, one really needs to review the source material before viewing the adaptation. There is only so much info they can squeeze into 2 hours and 5 minutes. Another reason you probably didn't get it is because not everything is spelled out in black and white from the get go. But honestly, in all of the games (1 and 2 especially, which the film draws heavily from), nothing is really spelled out. Even after you beat the games, it leaves you wondering ""What the f--k was that?"". But that's not necessarily a bad thing, because it lets your mind and imagination fill in the blanks, and that can be a lot better than some lousy tie in.2)If you had played the games, you'd realize that Silent Hill was never meant to be scary. Silent Hill above all else placed a lot of emphasis on setting and mood, rather than the zombie-jumping-from-the-closet shock moments. It was meant to creep you out and let your imagination do the scaring, which this movies has in spades.Great cinematography, music, story, and characters; Silent Hill is the thinking man's Resident Evil. If you aren't smart enough to either: A) Play the Games or B) Spell 'cat' correctly then stay away from this movie. Okay?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The special effects are awesome, and make the movie stand out from the usual list of horror films.Although it has the 'normal' outline of a Japanese horror movie i.e. little girl gets lost, scar monsters and evil little girl, some parts of the movie come as a shock. it's not all nail biting stuff, though, and for some parts of the movie I actually laughed out loud, as did the rest of the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Biggest Waste of $8 in my Life! Not to mention the waste of 2 hours of my time...,"This move runs just like a bad video game - lots of violence, minimal plot revelation, minimal dialogue, repeat - the only difference is that you don't even get to help fight the bad guys. Many of the camera angles even resemble video game screens that play while the game is loading (ie. oddball shots from a rooftop, or from the ground). This movie was disgusting, and really had no redeeming qualities, other than its half-witted attempt to say that ""hate is bad, and it creates evil"" - it does little to comment on the dangers of the cult/group think mentality, and substitutes all possibility of quality in favor of gore, gore, and more gore. It really isn't even scary. Don't waste your time with this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense!!,"Silent Hill is an adaptation of a video game and after hearing a lot good about it, I decided to give it a try.The story was simple, though intense. I haven't played video game so can't say how much accurate it was. The screenplay had some issues, mainly the pacing and the runtime. The direction was good and the performances were decent.The one thing which was done nicely was the environment building, you can feel the intensity of the world created. Also, the elements of drama and thriller were nicely embedded in the story.Overall, it was a decent horror thriller which you should try at least once.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"good, but not quite good enough","After playing all the released games and hanging around on Silent Hill, forums, I heard that a movie was being made out of (mostly) the first game, from 1999. My first thought was something along the lines of, ""dear god, don't let it be so."" But after seeing the movie, I wasn't nearly as offended as I thought I would be.I already knew form the trailer that the great music from the games (mostly from Silent Hill 2) was preserved for the movie. The monsters were mostly pulled from the second game as well, which was kind of puzzling considering that their design and actions were so closely tied to the events of Silent Hill 2, not the original that the movie was to be based off of. Once they appeared in the movie, I stopped caring that they were out of context.All the monsters in Silent Hill are played by people in costume, not CGI (with the exception of the famous cockroaches.) This was very nice, as it just isn't the same with CGI. All the monsters were amazing, all identical to how they appeared in the games (again, with one or two exceptions, this time from monsters not in the games at all).The plot was... different. I was disappointed that Harry Mason was replaced by Rose DaSilva, and couldn't fathom why they would rename Cheryl into Sharon. It just kind of irked me.Most of the plot elements came from the original Silent Hill, with a dash of Silent Hill 2 and a few added points.I was very happy with Laurie Holden as Cybil Bennett, though disappointed with her final scene (NOT how it happened in the game!).The new-for-movie ending, though an interesting twist, eliminates the possibility of ever having a movie with Silent Hill 3's plot, one of the best of the series. And having the theme from Silent Hill 3 play during the credits was a touch random...All in all, the movie captured the essence of the game, with spectacular music and visuals, but had a few points of annoyance.Note: when the IMDb credits list Claudia Wolf of SH3 and Henry Townshend of SH4 as being characters in the movie... pay no attention.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent Hill is anything but Silent,"Not a player of video games, I knew nothing about Silent Hill, but eagerly waited for the movie, as it looked amazing - not to mention the lovely Deborah Kara Unger is in it. Hopefully, because I haven't played the video game I can be rather neutral with my opinion of the film, which in summary, is rather disappointing. Maybe I missed out on enjoying the film to it's fullest extent because of not playing the game, but if an adapted film is going to be good, then one shouldn't have to have played the game (or read the book, or comic or whatever).Without going too in depth into the plot of the film, which in itself, is rather interesting, but highly confusing and there seems to be too much left unexplained. However, what is obvious is done very well. Direction and cinematography are great, special effects are hauntingly amazing and at times it looks like a video game - intentional or not, is actually quite cool. While coming across in the trailer as a horror, ""Silent Hill"" isn't really that scary. There are some terrifying moments, but overall, it's more of a thriller-mystery. However, those little creatures that Rose first encounters at Silent Hill unbelievably scary - and the noise the make is nearly as terrifying as the noise made in ""The Grudge"".The acting is mixed. Radha Mitchell is a fantastic supporting actress, but taking the lead of Rose Da Silva in ""Silent Hill"" she doesn't seem to quite pull it off, although her concern for her daughter is shown well. Sean Bean is convincing as troubled husband / father Christopher Da Silva and Laurie Holden is great as butch cop Cybil Bennett. The amazing Deborah Kara Unger (one of my favourite actresses) is barely recognisable as the outcast Dahlia Gillespie, a sad character whom one cannot but help have compassion for. It's a real shame she didn't get much screen time, but look out for Deborah in the flashback scenes where she looks more herself. The terrific acting continues in the form of Officer Thomas Gucci played by the wonderful Kim Coates and Alice Krige as the cruel Christabella. Rounding out the main cast is of course Jodelle Ferland who plays Sharon / Alessa, and does an admirable job.While falling short in some areas, ""Silent Hill"" makes up for its mistakes by having a generally terrific cast, and for mentioning (though not until towards the end of the film) how people fear what they do not understand, and in Silent Hill, they burn what they are afraid of. Much along the lines of ""The Crucible"". Dahlia and Christabella's opposites are also interesting to watch. Finally, the amazing score and soundtrack featured in ""Silent Hill"" (which is in general a very loud film) are great, and help to speed up some of the slower moments in the film. Disappointing, but not a total loss.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Little Gruesome,I first went into this not wanting to like it but in the end I didn't really find that much wrong with it. In the beginning I was a little turned off by all that blood and gore and gruesome stuff and maybe the story did move a little slow but it was at least true to most of the elements in the first Silent Hill video game series. The ending was a little sketchy and the buildup to the action wasn't all that great but I do think that for the person who is a fan of the series and like a bloody flick that this is definitely suitable to that particular taste. All in all Silent Hill delivers what it promises and tends to get a little extreme with the nasty stuff but its all in the name of entertainment. Nice acting with the exception of the child actress who played Sharon. 6/10,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sorry, but I've never played the game.","Stating outright that I have never played the video game ""Silent Hill"" before seeing the movie might be an odd way to start this review, but I feel that it must be said. I just know that every negative comment I make from now on will probably be countered by a hardcore gamer who insists that I have no right to my own opinion of the movie version of ""Silent Hill"" because I am unfamiliar with the source material. Yes, I am unfamiliar with the source material, and that was one reason why I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I came into it as someone who just wanted to see a good horror movie. That being said, while I don't think ""Silent Hill"" is a complete disaster, I can honestly say that I've seen much better.The plot of the movie (which I understand is pretty true to the game) involves a woman named Rose who travels to the abandoned town of Silent Hill believing it to have some connection to her adopted daughter's strange behavior (not only does she sleepwalk, but she constantly mentions the town by name while she does it). When Rose gets to the town, her daughter disappears, and Rose is left to deal with the strange and nightmarish things that plague Silent Hill.The best part of this movie by far is the fact that it manages to maintain a very creepy atmosphere almost from beginning to end. As I said before, I have never played a ""Silent Hill"" game, but I've played games like it, and I can honestly say that the most effective parts of this movie are the ones that inspire the feeling of dread and isolation that persists throughout most good survival horror-style games. Everything seems to be shot from camera angles that seem to suggest that something scary could be just around the corner waiting to tear apart our heroine (who is as alone and practically defenseless as any hero of a typical ""Resident Evil"" game). The soundtrack is also very effective, with the kind of minimalist atonal music that sounds more like ambient noise than what most people would call real music. It adds a certain intensity that I'm sure would be lacking if the movie had a different soundtrack.Unfortunately, a creepy atmosphere seems to be just about all that this movie has going for it. There is some really weird and creepy things happening throughout this movie, but most of what we see is left mostly unexplained (yes, I know that I should probably play the games for a good explanation). The things that attack the heroine seem appropriately unnatural and creepy, but we are left with little explanation as to what they are (the guy with the pyramid on his head is probably the coolest and scariest monster in the movie, but he/it disappears way too quickly and never really serves a purpose). Things start to improve a little bit past the halfway point when we are introduced to what can best be described as the true evil of Silent Hill, but when that happens the other threats to the protagonist seem to be all but forgotten. I don't want to go into spoiler territory, so I'll just say that what we are left with is a film that cannot decide what kind of horror movie it wants to be.I can honestly say that I found this film to be rather disappointing. It has a great look and a suitably creepy atmosphere, but there are too many things left unexplained and too many missed opportunities for me to really recommend this movie to anyone.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was Pretty Good...,"Well I never really got into playing the actual Silent Hill games, but I happen to be an avid fan of horror flicks and I can honestly say that its been a long time since I've wanted to hold somebody's hand while watching one. Not that I jumped out of my seat or anything. I'd say that this movie is more of a creepy-crawly, ""OHMYGODRUN!"" type of film, with just enough scary ummm, we'll call them characters, to have you gripping the edge of your seat. Though it may start slow, I promise you an awesome follow-up. Plus this kind of plot always keeps you guessing. Does it go with the plots in the games? I say who cares! They did a good job and who knows? Maybe there will be a sequel in a few years. To all you fellow scary movie freaks out there... do yourself a favor and get this one under your belt!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A remake of Jacobs' Ladder?,"Silent Hill. Just saw it. Not great but not Bad either. I thought it was much better than The Grudge but not as good as The Ring. I enjoyed the visual style of the first half of the movie very much. Reminded me of Jacob's Ladder. I liked the acting, Mitchell was good as the brave mother, although she possessed unbelievable bravery. Lori Holden was excellent as was Alice Krieg. The initial pace of the story was good, it kept the viewer involved, however I thought the second half of the movie lost some steam, and I am still not sure what Gans was trying to accomplish at the very end. Although I have never played the game Silent Hill, it seems that the creative team was trying to stay true to the game. Not great, but not bad. Certainly worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You can't make a film out of a video game,"Silent Hill attempts to overcome a simple, but almost insurmountable challenge: films and computer games are incompatible. They may draw on some of the same reference material and use similar techniques, but the single fundamental element of a game that makes the player persist to the point of addiction is that the player is personally involved: in films, it isn't. My own direct experience of games, and my observation of my sons' ""growth"" from Sonic to Zelda to Silent Hill confirms this. It's me as Sonic/Link/Rose Da Silva; I must collect the rings/masks/clues; I am threatened by Robotnik/witches/the undead. My pulse rate rises, my palms sweat and I feel my chest tightening as my health meter runs down and I am failing to defeat the enemy.For this to be achieved in a movie, the writer/director must transfer your allegiance to someone else and since this instantly puts you out of danger, that transference is critical. When Ripley says ""Get away from her you bitch!"" in ""Aliens"", you want to cheer because you have been drawn not just into her world, but into her mind - her emotions, her fears, her maternal need to protect Newt. James Cameron and the writers fulfilled the first law of mainstream storytelling - make your audience identify with the protagonists. For Silent Hill to succeed, the writer and director have to solve this dilemma and also to resolve the other incompatibility which is that story is of secondary importance to a computer game. In a movie, story (and I don't just mean plot) is everything. Other gamers may disagree, but I don't believe that it is plot and character imperatives that drive you from level to level: it is the need to solve the next puzzle or meet the next ""boss"" that is the prime motivator. Provided that you are happy with the overall playability, and the genre appeals, you'll keep playing. In fact, the cut scenes used to tell more story are a distraction and irritation, rather than a compulsion. Some of the best movies are very simple in plot terms (Jaws is a supreme example) but whether simple or complex, all succeed when storyline and characters are coherent and involving.In Silent Hill, the plot outline is simple enough. Rose must find out why her sleep-walking daughter cries out ""Silent Hill,"" and, in going to the deserted town, puts both herself and Sharon in peril from an assortment of evil creatures, some infernal, some merely human: will she find Sharon and escape to safety? Had this been the single plot line, Silent Hill may well have worked. But in the opening scenes it fails in almost every respect to engage us with Rose or Sharon or Christopher. or to enlist our sympathy with the family's predicament. That leaves us with the secondary pleasure of enjoying the photography, sound and visual effects; checking the obvious connections with the game origins (running from room to room picking up useful objects and clues and meeting the occasional horror) or spotting the odd film reference - the Midwich School (for Cuckoos, presumably) and The Omega Man showing at the local multiplex.Horror fans will not be disappointed by the quantity of gore, and the appearances of Pyramid Head and the overtaking of the town by Darkness are very effective, but the plot-turn (you couldn't call it a twist) away from the infernal creatures towards the tediously conventional witch-hunting scenario is clumsy and all those who thought that Christophe Gans' promise that this would be something different might actually be realised are likely to be disappointed. Only the downbeat ending, which confirmed what some viewers failed to grasp earlier as the typical fantasy plot device of people searching in vain for each other in separate but parallel worlds, appeared to offer something out-of-the-ordinary. The trouble is that by then, I actually wanted the satisfyingly conventional: a reunion. Instead, I got a set-up for a sequel, one that, if it is to be any more successful, must either abandon the PC game roots or embrace them whole-heartedly and find a way to emulate the first-person visceral thrills. Might Peter Jackson et al achieve this with Halo? I can wait to find out!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Atmospheric, but  too long","(Forgive me if you find another review here by yours truly of this film. I wrote one but now cannot locate it.) SILENT HILL is a very faithful adaptation of a popular video game, according to my 19-year-old daughter. As a movie, it is certainly atmospheric and spooky, although it lacks any real scares, the gore is subdued, and the plot is all over the place. And it comes to an incredibly ludicrous climax. Radha Mitchell searches for her missing daughter in the abandoned W. Va. coal mining town of Silent Hill, only to cross over into an alternate dimension where she encounters a veritable army of creepy crawlies and assorted and sundry monsters. She finds allies in the form of a motorcycle cop (Laurie Holden) and a bag lady (Deb Unger) who also has lost her kid years before. All is made plain by film's end, perhaps too much so. Too much explanation tends to spoil the broth, Mr. Gans. Sean Bean plays the distraught husband searching for his wife and daughter. Mitchell and Bean are competent, nothing more. B movie queen Alice Krige as the head of a satanic cult plays it way over the top. A lot of the dialog is simply laughable, especially toward the end, and the film is too long by half. This is not the second coming of THE RING or THE OTHERS, but if nothing else SILENT HILL looks terrific. The set design alone should be an Oscar contender.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Visually stunning, dark but without much of a point...","As a huge fan of the Konami teams work on the silent hill franchise i knew i was in for a real treat on the way to see the screen adaptations of one of the darkest and most moving video games ever.The film is ultimately a mash up of the second and third game (with a few references to the first). For example the protagonist is visually similar to the girl from the 3rd game, but is playing the story of the first game, with the nemesis of the second game (pyramid head) who i have to add, played absolutely no purpose in this film whatsoever. On that note nearly nothing in the film played any significant role other than to look cool and to be purposefully ambiguous (something which has fooled a lot of naive teens into thinking it's a well thought out story with deep twists etc- just watch the summary of the film by the little girl and you'll see what i mean).But really i don't think anyone would be watching the film for it's story, it's all about the hellish, Francis bacon come Jacobs Ladder world your thrown into. It is absolutely terrifying and beautiful.All i all what i mean to say is, if you know anything about cinema you probably will not be impressed by this film. But if you are a fan of visual effects and especially dark, disturbing themes you will adore this movie. And one last thing, if you have played the games before don't get too annoyed when you realise that it has absolutely nothing to do with the previous stories.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense and disturbing.,"I went into Silent Hill with high hopes. I was not disappointed.From the outset, the movie has a dark, twisted atmosphere. There is a pervading sense that something is just not right. When the world transforms, things really get interesting. You can almost feel the sanity of the town (and your own) slipping away as the darkness falls. During these times, you almost cling to any light on the screen, struggling to avoid looking at the surrounding darkness.There are some truly gory scenes in this movie. I can almost guarantee that you will not be able to forget some of these images. Some of these scenes are anticipated, but end up being worse than you imagined. Others are by total surprise, leaving you in a state of shock as the horror of what you witnessed slowly dawns. Even those scenes that are not exactly gory are still disturbing.The talent in this movie is great, and I don't just mean the main characters. The actors who play the monsters are amazing, moving in strange, inhuman ways that make you want to back away. It is hard to believe that these monsters are real people and not CGI.The plot itself intriguing. There is little in the way of dramatic irony, the audience being just as clueless as the protagonist throughout the movie. The story shocks, confuses, and captivates, leading the audience on a twisted journey through the soul of the damned town. From the almost normal surface to the bowels of madness, this movie seeks to, and succeeds in, upsetting the sanity of the audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't go too see this movie if you are a fan,"Don't GO TO WASTE ANY MANY IN THIS MOVIE IF YOU'RE A FAN!!!!This is the worst adaptation of a game ever made by the industry. i'd played all the games (i was the first boy in my city who played the game in 1999 because i work at that time in a video game store) In first place the games are a complete movie itself so: why they rewrite the storyline again and bad? Examples:In the original story of silent hill (the game) the mother of Sheril WAS DEATH! (this is the most basic error of all ever!)The father of Sheril, Harry Mason, was the one who looks over Sheril.This is the most important roll and its madness change it!The first game (the game that contains the story of Sheril). Its very different. Harry don't go thru buildings jumping (this features appeared in SILENT HILL 2 and the character in this game it's not Harry).The other ugly and very bad thing it's the casting of the characters and the characters itself.For example:The mother: (this it's the ghost of the movie so...i don't going to say anything)The policewoman: She is so Hollywood. her costume are the deja bu of T1000. And its out of place. The personality and the first encounter at the gas station is hilarious (she don't meet any mason or speak whit it before reaching town).Dalhia Gillespi: This is a poor characterization of Dhalia. The old woman was scary no for the looks of her body, she was scary for the look of his could eyes. BAD BAD BAD!In the other hand, they don't put attention at the most important characters of the original plot. Example:Kauffman: This was a good character. A doctor in the hospital of town and drug dealer.The nurse: It was the most important character. This was a nurse under the supervision of Kauffman Dr. She was working in the hospital in the most dark time in the life of SILENT HILL. The time of Alessa and her rare sickness.Cut this characters its....BAD BAD BAD!The monsters....JE JE JE JE JE JE...this is the most hilarious part of all (if that its possible at this point of my comment). They put every monster of the saga in one movie...this is...BAD AND INNESESARY PEOPLE!After this observations i have one more:Please, to all film makers in the industry of Hollywood and (now i must include lamentably) UK: DON'T DO MOVIES ABOUT GAMES! Because YOU PEOPLE ARE BAD TO REACH A GOOD LEVEL IN THAT FIELD! For the love of god. The game industry of japan is the non pop thing of the market. They are the independent part of the industry. They don't do things whit bad storyline...they are wood at it. Don't re-write a story, it was perfectly written. I now that you people (hollywood/UK people) needs to feed the bad writers of USA but, PLEASE...don't do this! it's bad! it's ugly! And the last, and most important thing of all: DON'T EVER CHANGE A MALE CHARACTER FOR A FEMALE Character! This is like put a piece of peach in a hamburger. I now that the Feminists of USA/UK push you to do this kind of things, and the marketing groups looks to take over that beautiful 60% of womens that buy every stupid magazine, dildo, and t-shirt of the country. But for the love of Buda... Don't DO THIS KIND OF SILLY AND BEGGINERS THING!!!PD: In the visual hand, its a good movie. The director don't need to think this part (like all the others) because the game solve all the aspects of this job. The original director of the first game was perfect for this job position. But like i said before: The people of the USA/UK industry must eat and therefore must take this kind of jobs to make that possible.PD: Sorry for my bad English...i'm a Argentine boy whit no education in the English field :P",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visually stunning. Lackluster storytelling,"I haven't played the video game Silent Hill franchise very much in depth, however i've always been a fan of its visuals. The tone, composition and lighting are breathtaking in all the games. The transition to film doesn't necessarily lose any shine but the stunted storytelling becomes more obvious.The acting is fairly passable. It doesn't distract the viewer any more than the mediocre writing does. Radha Mitchell is head and shoulders above all other performers in the film. She conveys the fear and determination of a mother, searching for her lost and only daughter with poise and realism. Sean Bean is wasted with few lines and a pointless character that only serves to slow down the progression of the movie. Perhaps for the best, his character is poorly written and Sean Bean is directed for the role very well.The sounds and music didn't quite pull me in. They fill their role but don't immerse the viewer into the films universe as well as they could have. The sounds are equally as important as the visuals, so in a film like this with strong visuals, the sound should amplify the experience. Sadly it didn't amplify at all.Now as for those visuals, they were pretty astounding. The CG affects blended extremely well, i couldn't tell at times what was CG and what was a practical effect. The shot composition showed off the effects well and heightened the creepy factor. The monster design didn't meet par with the games but still impressed with deranged forms and creatures.Silent Hill's story telling was weak in the film. All the interesting visuals in the world can't save a movie that gets as convoluted as this does. The climax doesn't make sense and cops out in the most unsatisfying way. Loose ends are not tied up and things just peter out in the end.I would recommend Silent Hill only as an art gallery. Find clips of the movie to admire the visuals but don't sit down and watch the whole movie expecting it to form or complete any kind of story arc.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too many unresolved plot-lines,"This movie started out alright and the abundance of scenes that feel like they were pulled straight from the game were a nice touch, but somewhere along the line the filmmakers seem to have lost track of which plot elements they had and hadn't resolved. The ending of the movie created more questions than it even attempted to answer.In the end, this movie feels like it was made by two different groups of people: One group who made a list of things they wanted to port directly from the games, and another group who had to try and tie everything together with a poorly realized and barely connected storyline.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A balanced review - some good, some bad elements.","PLUS POINTS: 1) The film looked excellent - art direction was top notch. 2) An unusually atmospheric & stylish film considering the Hollywood input. 3) The ""monsters"" were great - some of the best gore and a welcome minimal use of CGI (the physical effects looked ace) all created a real sense of dread, disgust and horror. 4) Laurie Holden was excellent as Cybil. 5) Without a doubt the most exciting and faithful translation of a video game to date - no question whatsoever there - If you've ever played one of these games, you WILL get some deja vu. 6) A definitely above average horror film, with some real chills.DOWNSIDES: 1)Radha Mitchell ran around ""by the numbers"" and fumbled with her torch in all the right places. Certainly no original stand-out heroine. 2)The ending - a bit too formulaic, and certainly way too much narration to explain what just happened in the last 2 hours. (Although having said that, certainly not an ""all loose ends tied up"" finish). 3) Could've been a tad MORE use of the monsters - esp ""pyramid head"". They definitely left you wanting more there, (and no, less is NOT more where these were concerned) 3) It DID drag a little in places. My lasting memory is a little TOO much running around in the fog and ash, and not enough ""otherworldly"" post-siren action. 4) Sean Bean was incredibly average (when ISN'T he!!?), but I suppose a necessary dour and balancing element to all the freakiness. 5) Spooky kids are SO last year, and therefore not spooky.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, Leaves you wondering @ the end!","I expected a bit more (in terms of 'scary') from this movie. There isn't a scene where I would say it made me jump up or freak the f*** out. I never played this game; although heard it was great. I thought that the actors could've done a better job at acting a bit and the visual affects of the movie could've been better. I am not one to judge the author/director of this movie because of -limitations- that they had to face.Living in the U.S. I am use to movies that have a complete storyline & usually happy ending. Most of the movies I watch that were from Europe/Asia gives you an incomplete ending, leaving you to wonder/make up your own ending. This is much better & I like (lack of a better word) the way that this movie ended and I wish that there was an alternate ending that fulfilled my curiosity as well.Overall, I enjoyed watching it with my fiancé & we both agree that it was worth watching & could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fan of the game or not, this is good horror","The simple description of a woman trying to find her daughter, & being faced with a deserted town that turns into a hell, is just that. A simple description. The story within the movie and the game is far more complex.Silent Hill (SH), being based on the highly successful video game, could have easily gone the route of so many other cheesy video game movies. Resident Evil, Doom, and any crap from Uwe Boll.But director Christophe Gans went another way with the much more complicated story of SH. He decided to implement a bit more perfection to the script, editing the movie to the very end, removing cheesy lines like the girl saying ""I am the Reaper"" in a deep male voice.It is obvious that Gans played the game. The surreal look and feel of the game comes through in the movie. Even some of the camera angles are similar, as it swoops over the character in an ominous way. And I can write a page on the attention to detail for the set design.Using less CGI and more make up and costumes, they got the monsters right too. The evil incarnations from the game come right through on the screen, some ultimately more vicious looking! So will you like the movie? It depends on what you're looking for in a horror. Though fans of gore will love the multitude of the slice, dice and rips that happen in SH, that's not the movie's focus. It's a culmination of a claustrophobia, loneliness, paranoia, inability to determine reality from hallucination, being hunted, and no control over disastrous conditions. It's a formula that works well, and it is leaps and bounds over some similar genre movies.But it's a more complex story that some may not like, & the ending is ambiguous, though relevant. I invite those that are left scratching their heads by the ending to look into it further.I also invite you to watch other movies that helped shape the story for the game and movie. Rent Jacob's Ladder, David Lynch's Twin Peaks, perhaps the 1960's Village of the Damned, or read Stephen King's The Mist.But if you really want to be creeped out, before or after seeing the movie, how about a dose of reality? Research the very real Centralia, PA. Take a look at some images. They will look like they came from the movie. Screen writer for SH Roger Avary researched this American town and implemented some of the occurrences that happened in this town in to the movie. It got so bad that the US postal service revoked it's zip code. Spooky. Sometimes reality is stranger then fiction.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The dialog is exactly how the dialog in the games is, questions from a apparent rational character such as, ""are you alright?"" with irrational responses, that never really get to answering the question being asked, leaving the questioner in the dark. This movie was done very well, and wasn't made to be a typical ""horror film"". It conveys several messages of religion, and good and evil, taken from each one of the current four Silent Hill video games. All respect to the Horror movie buffs, but this movie wasn't made for you, it was made for the fans of the game. Value does exist in watching this movie, when you never played any of the games, however, only the ones who have played it will get the full understanding of how good the movie really is. This movie is very well directed, very well written by Roger Avery, and is a must see/own, when it arrives on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If this is a video game, why is it so easy to win?","I've never seen the video game but it makes sense that it was based on one. You have a simplistic, ridiculous prologue, which then leads into the bulk of the nonsense (um, film) before you can even finish saying to your date, ""wow, this is some good parenting. haven't they heard of psychiatry?"" People act in a completely nonsensical, 2 dimensional way; you can't explain their actions to yourself without saying, ""um, I guess there's a cop character the game who is programmed to behave like this."" But then you wonder, if this is a video game, why is it so easy to win? The monsters all drop dead right as they're about to get you. Scary! Half of the film is so dark you can't even see the CGI freakshow. Honestly, there is nothing about this movie that works. Everyone in the theater was laughing at it and catcalling the entire time and nobody really wanted to stop them. It was the kind of film that was only enjoyable in making fun of how bad it was. I really hope someone gets fired for producing this crap.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Mood,"A mysterious mood permeates every beautiful frame and I've been told this is remarkably close to the vibe and production design of the video games its based on. The story could use some work, because it ends up feeling like a series of well-done horror set pieces barely connected by anything and the final twist is insultingly silly.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Silent Hill,"Never cheese a mother off by taking away or threatening her child. We've seen plenty of tough mamas in contemporary movies, and Jodie Foster comes to mind in having personified the tough-as-nails mum in Panic Room and Flight Plan. NO, she doesn't have a part to play in Silent Hill, but the premise, about a mother on a journey to recover her daughter from the clutches of harm, couldn't be more familiar.And before you dismiss this movie as just another run off the mill video game adaptation, this movie is surprisingly good, in setting up its atmospheric moments. We've had plenty of misses with this genre, and only a few hits. Staying faithful to the setting of the source using CGI enhanced sets and SFX, it took its time to introduce the mystery surrounding Silent Hill, teasing you with long sequences which seem to journey nowhere. Which by then, some of you would have already given up, as you ache to see more of the beasts which go bump in the darkness, only to have an all too quick daylight interrupt the flow of carnage, and having to endure through long moments of silence and basically beating around the bushes.Then again, it's precisely this hide-and-seek that the movie stays an arm's length away from the usual expectation of action, action and more mindless action. Silent Hill is a very adult adaptation, staying true to the spirit of gaming, with its endless round after round of puzzles and encounters before everything starts to make some sense. Those expecting a splatterfest will be disappointed, as there aren't many. While the monsters and creatures are a sight to behold (they're disgustingly beautiful), most times they get introduced and addressed too easily. Just as you get into the swing of things with a particular beast, it gets hauled away from view, whatever the reason. I dig the spasm-induced dancing faceless nurses, but they're given too little screen time.It's more mystery than downright horror, basing its theme on superstition and misguided faith on different planes. There're little ""boo"" moments, as everything builds up gradually, adding to the suspense. Eventually, you'll get to the closure, with the big mystery and back story unveiled, adding some gravitas to the movie, and could serve as a springboard to any sequels if planned.Radha Mitchell plays Rose Da Silva, the mom who partners cop Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden) who assists her in the paranormal realm of Silent Hill to track down Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), yet another creepy kid (the other kid's the Anti-Christ in the remake of Omen. These days creepy kids are in!) who holds the key to the entire whodunnit. Sean Bean was wasted as Rose's husband, in a role that is created only because everyone else substantial in the movie is female. His role is actually to accentuate that Silent Hill exists on different realms, with him being in the ""real world"" while the others are trapped in another plane of existence. And of course in movies like these, the acting's nothing really to shout about, since expressions are limited to looking scared and looking bewildered.It'll take a while before you can scratch past to get to the storyline, as your eyes and attention will be peeling away the layers of beautifully crafted production sets and awesome graphics, and your ears appreciating the music adapted from the games. And with a satisfactory story as justification, this could perhaps see a new beginning to games wanting to make it to the silver screen, if done correctly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fascinating,"On the one hand, I could almost dismiss Silent Hill as another confused bundle of horror convention masquerading as a story, i.e. ""The Grudge"". However, as sloppy as the plot can get at times, I came away from the viewing tossing this movie around and around in my head. Not having played the video game upon which it is based, it's hard to tell how many of the story elements generated elsewhere, but for what it was I think Roger Avary has created an ambitious storyline that digs a little deeper than its B-rate subject matter. The look of the film is a beautiful mix of looks and colors, shifting smoothly between 'reality' and nightmares. Gans does an expected pro job with this, even lending his CG bogeymen a certain texture and presence many others have failed to do. At no point is the movie ever exactly terrifying, and I doubt Avary and Gans took this as their mission. It's an unsettling tale of darkness and the places it lives. The film never exactly ties together in a satisfying enough way to rate it higher than a seven, however I enjoyed the film and the effort enough to leave it with a healthy 6 1/2. If you like your 'horror' films thoughtful, this is certainly worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You might need to play the game first,"It might be a good idea to play the game before watching this movie, I personally haven't played all of the game myself, thus making the movie quite confusing at parts and I think that it needed to be a bit longer in order to fully get the audience into the story. The acting in the movie is somewhat believable. I gave this movie a six because it was fun to watch but all together not a terrific film. If I do go see it again it won't be without playing the game first. If your in to the whole supernatural thing with a couple hot girls and the villain from Golden Eye then you might like this one.

extremely bad movie,"Not to appear demeaning towards other people, but it really is beyond me how anyone can say this is a good movie. The script's weak, hurrying to get the characters into the blood and gore without giving us any time to know them or comprehend their actions. There was a point when I wanted everyone to be killed so that the movie would be over. The only actor who's halfway competent is the one playing the cop. The main character in the story is so badly played you wonder how she ever got a role in a big movie. And what's Sean Bean doing here, after acting with Nicolas Cage and Jodie Foster in recent films? This movie is slow at times and downright dumb at others.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The best horror movie of the year, and best video-game based movie ever.","The ending credits of the movie finally rolled. Everyone is standing from their seats. The theater is relatively silent. Only the usual sounds are heard, but from behind me, the first clearly audible sentence is heard, and is as follows:""I don't get it.""She clearly didn't understand the movie. Me and my friends, however, did. And we also felt a feeling of relief, that finally, a good game-based movie has been released. I felt pain in the beginning. Not because it was boring, no, I thought not one second of the movie was boring, but because I wanted to see the town of Silent Hill. Everything about the movie was perfect, except for some unintentionally funny dialogue. The camera work was nothing short of amazing, the monsters straight from your worst nightmare, and the performances, straight from the heart. I cant make this review much longer without putting spoilers, but I can tell you, this movie will make you feel the pain the main characters feel, and it will only suck you into the movie more. All the negative reviews its been getting from critics is unfair, and they treat this movie not as a horror movie, but as a game movie, and refuse to give it a fair trial because of that fact. But trust me, this movie is great, and to dare say its nothing but a game-movie shows how unwilling some people are to open their arms to changes.I'm pleased to announce that this movie is the best video-game based movie ever. But thats not surprising. I however, do feel sympathy towards all other game to movie adaptations to come out in the future, because Silent Hill raised the bar to new heights. Not just for video game based movies, though, but for horror movies in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where's the Pyramid Head filling?,"OK, before I go anywhere with this, I'm going to explain why I give it a 7. If you manage to throw everything that you've learned from the video games out the window it's a great movie. It's what horror movies these days should be. However, if you prefer it to follow the games a bit more, then you might want to consider watching something else. So 7 is kind of the happy middle, I guess you could say.Here's why I say this.The movie's got its inaccuracies, that's a given. But there were several things that I just would've liked to have seen worked with a bit more. Like Pyramid Head. He kicks ass when he's on the screen, but I just don't think they took advantage of him enough. For a character that was as vital to the plot in the game, they just kinda let him slip in the movie. Though he's not nearly as big of a let down as Nemesis from Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Not by a long shot. I'd also liked to have seen the purpose behind Silent Hill (the whole gather and punish sinners aspect) worked with a bit more. They use it, but just not enough.Like I said, it's a great movie if you can forget about the meaning behind various things, like why almost every character in Silent Hill 2 was a woman or what Pyramid Head was actually there for or Dalia's actual purpose. I dunno. I liked it, but there was definitely room for improvement. I want to give it a higher rating because they did a good job on it, but I still can't help but feel short changed out of the deal.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hokey,"This is quite possible the hokiest horror film I have ever seen. I mean the nurse zombies gyrating looked like something out of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."" I was excited to see this film because of the trailers and the awesome movie poster. It was however a really big disappointment for me. I think fans of the video game or just video games in general will probably really like the film. The locations used are the same used in all games, the hotel, hospital, church, and school. Also, the abysses that dominate the film, also have a very animated video game quality to them. Ultimately for me, fear is about realism. If I can't believe it, I just can't fear it. And, unfortunately, they didn't sell it to me.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Style VS Story,"Silent Hill is an above-average horror drama, which benefits from a magnificent visual style and shocking cgi effects and suffers from a mediocre story with sometimes ridiculously bad dialogue. what does roger avery intend to say if he is having the policewoman say ""looks like there's been a fire here"" when it's crystal clear that the whole damn town has been burnt and ashes is still flying through the air? the side story, which fails to deliver the plot, is so unbelievably unnecessary that you almost feel sorry for sean bean. and radha mitchells character is a joke, doing strange things at the wrong moments, changing moods every 5 minutes and delivering crappy one-liners (plus she's absolutely burning her hand with her zippo!). the story itself has it's up and downs, basically it's good enough to keep the audience entertained, although the ending again is a major yawn. if you have played the game (like I did) you'll be pleased with the music which is almost the same as in the games and with the visualization of the monsters and the town itself. the effects are a mixture between creepy and gory and the final battle scene is pretty hard to swallow. all in all this is a watchable horror movie, compared to most of the junk that flooded the market in the last 3 years. switch off your brain and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

By the time they reach Silent Hill they get into a near car wreck, however the daughter goes missing and the mother sets out to find her.This film does stay true to the roots of the game with minor differences. Silent Hill itself shows a disturbing empty void that has nightmares lurking in its darkness. The creatures are top notch on look and movement very much of the video game like the Nurse, Pyramid Head, No Arms and even including a familiar character from the game that the mother encounters.The story gives the right tone and blend.

The questions that appears while you'll be watching movie will guide you to finding answers. This is the main achievement of the cinema - to make people think.

One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time,"I had to write a comment upon seeing all the praise for this train wreck. This movie was about as scary as the Flintstones cartoon, but even the Flintstones could be entertaining unlike this crap movie. I'm a long time fan of horror, and this is yet another awful movie in the genre by Hollywood.Dull, plodding, and way too long, this movie actually made me sleepy. The story is incoherent, and most of the time is taken up by the female main character running around empty movie sets, looking fearful. The rip off of the Hellraiser villain Pinhead with the chains ripping people apart in the climax was especially laughable. But at least Pinhead had some witty things to say, the creature in this one just sits there with a stupid look on its face, struck dumb and mute apparently. I can't blame them, being in this movie must have been torture.TRULY AWFUL",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"There's Value Here, but It Might be Worth it to Wait a Little Longer","The idea is that a child, Sharon, is terminally ill and sleepwalks, often talking of a town in West Virginia called Silent Hill. Her mother, Rose, played by Radha Mitchell, takes her to Silent Hill against the will of Sharon's father, played by Sean Bean. Along the way, police officer Cybil Bennet stops Rose. However, Rose speeds off as Cybil approaches the vehicle. She pursues Rose, and they both crash on the outskirts of Silent Hill. When they wake, a dense fog has fallen on the town, and Sharon has disappeared.Gans does a superb job of translating the disturbing atmosphere of the games. I was pleased to see he doesn't resort to the ""tap you on the shoulder"" technique of quick frights as a monster suddenly leaps from the darkness or a loud crash sounds in the silent darkness. Contempory horror filmmakers seem to resort to such tactics, sometimes hurdling at you in every scene. Also, the film isn't that gory, which I was pleased to see. At some points, it reminds me of Hellraiser, but the tortured cenobites seem to be played down. Instead, the film is riddled with a disturbing atmosphere, especially when the siren sounds and Gans takes you to dark Silent Hill.This one really is a unique horror film; however, the film's strong points seem to be the product of video game design, not great film production.It's true. I am a fan of the video games, and I'm writing to tell you all that if you also are a fan of the games, you may be disappointed. Then again, apparently some fans are pleased.Gans seems to have been afraid to change much superficially. Several of the scenes from the games are directly translated into the film. The film's score is song for song from the series, most notably from the award winning soundtrack of Silent Hill 3. While it was cool to see the scenes translated in such a way, I hoped for something new because as far as I'm concerned, in the Silent Hill universe, those things already happened, and the film is undermining that. The music, while it is great music, is completely recycled. A whole new score might not have been the way to go. I would rather have liked to hear variations on the original Silent Hill scores. Catching hints of familiar tunes would have been enough to take me back to those same feelings I had, playing the games in the dark.Gans, however, had no problem with changing major plot points. I wouldn't have minded a whole new story that captured the feel and narrative truth of Silent Hill, but Gans seems to have used a conglomeration of the four games. The problem is the same as recycling scenes from the games that I mentioned above. These things already took place in the Silent Hill universe. In addition, Gans changed a major plot point of the Silent Hill mythology, which the average movie-goer may find sufficient at best. I found the history that the games offered much more effective.Speaking of story, the script was not very well written. Often the characters' lines seemed ridiculous. For example, as can be seen in the trailer, Rose wipes a piece of ash off her cheek, and then, as if we could not tell, she says ""ash."" Another example occurs later as Rose and Cybil walk through a burned building. It has obviously been burned. The set designer saw to that; however, Gans insisted on having one of his characters say ""looks like there's been a fire here."" While realistically speaking someone may actually say that in such a situation, we start to regard the characters as stupid and obvious because we can see that the building has been burned very badly. This kind of thing is frowned upon in film-making for obvious reasons. It crosses a line of expected interpretation. On the highest level, it suggests Gans thinks we're stupid.Speaking of set design, though, the special effects and make up are amazing. Most of the monsters are actually latex, and they look very good. Gans did not rely very heavily on CGI, which I was also happy to see.The strong points of Silent Hill exist mostly in the visuals. While the general story is, simply put, unique, it's not something Gans and Roger Avary are responsible for. The script is just not well written, and therein lies Silent Hill's biggest weak point. I would recommend Silent Hill for fans of the game. While some may be disappointed, it is enough to see that world come to life in an extraordinarily well done fashion. I would also recommend it for the optimistic student or appreciator of horror films. There is value in this one. However, I wouldn't recommend it to the average scrutinizing movie goer. The weak spots are too easily exposed. I gave it a six out of ten because I couldn't quite give it a seven. If you can wait until video, you might be a little happier and a little less disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Serious Review from a Serious Silent Hill Gamer,"Personally i didn't feel that the movie was perfect. A perfect video game/ comic book rendition has yet to be created. For us gamers/comic book readers that look at these films and think, ""How badly are they going to crucify this one...."" I think this movie wasn't THAT bad. Yes the acting was dry, the plot was weak, and the Husband's role was rather pointless. The special effects were very well done, the creatures stayed true to the game series, and the environments were 100% believable. Hollywood has a good way of putting a spin on certain franchises that will allow them to make a quick buck from die-hard fans and fans of the genre alike. With this movie as IMDb says in the trivia this was done with the husbands character. But my stance is that at least they didn't TOTALLY f&@# it up...it was decent for a Video game movie and I think it may only TRULY appeal to fans of the game. But it's really a step in the right direction for game/comic book movies. Video Game movies may only be a step behind great Comic Book translations like Spiderman and Sin City....and i'm just happy to see progression. I won't deny that I wish Silent Hill was done AFTER this progression.....but it was done decently at least...hey look on the bright side...it could have been done by Paul WS Anderson...he's a GREAT! director.....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

They used some of the game monstors, but to be honest they are scarier in the the game. the ending is also just ridiculous, and makes little sense. I was kinda expecting them to mess it up, if they had made it just like the game it would probably be extremely terrifying. If you haven't played the games you should not see this movie, because it will make even less sense. all in all they did factor in the game a fair amount, but failed in capturing what should have been the scariest movie ever, and it is very short of that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, but not for everyone","I saw this movie the first possible chance I could, and I enjoyed it. I would not suggest it to anyone, though. The acting is a little bad here and there; the story can be ambiguous (until the slightly tacky part where all is explained); and the gore is probably enough to send some people packing (I saw several people leave during the film, but they could have been surfing).I gave it a 6.5 because I was torn between the pleasure I got from seeing one of my favorite games come to the big screen as a movie, and the slight disappointment I felt with its distance from the average viewer and its patchy story telling.Overall, it was a good movie for a fan of the game or horror movies, but an OK movie from the perspective of the average Joe, a view I had a hard time dropping.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A town that possesses a mysterious power, Silent Hill","In my restless dreams, I see that town.Silent Hill...Silencetells you all you need to know. ""Madness"" is driven by the depths of below. A place where a tragic history was unsolved, a place where mysterious deaths occur, a place where people where forbidden to go. You think you have seen horror, you think you have experienced fearwell once you go there, don't think you will return alive. Silent Hill is known as the ""God of Horror"". Delivering an edge-cutting masterpiece of psychological horror. Environments that will turn your blood blue and a storyline that is more intense, more bloodcurdling and more disturbing that any other horror you have seen, with breathtaking effects and perhaps the ""summit of all horror scenarios""A lot of background information on the games is needed to understand some of the character relations and religious aspects, however do NOT let this stop you from watching perhaps one of the best horror films of the year. Most horror films or games that are made into films tend you lack that sense of identity which the original held. Not the same plot or same characters or same effect. Silent Hill, on the other hand provides a fascinating storyline, accurate character and creature design, even effects that seem to define real. Viewers may think that the story sides tracks a lot, but it is needed. Believe me I'm a huge fan. Nonetheless, Silent Hill still offers a world of fear, terror and shock.Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) delivers an outstanding performance as a mother searching for her lost child, Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland). As the audience you feel her actions are senseless, yet they convey the tension throughout the film and make you wonder what hides round the corner. Together, Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) and Cybil Bennet (Laurie Holden  Police Officer) make a stunning team to fight off the creatures, each time you see these two together you are guaranteed action, along with loud, distressing, warning signal (You'll hear what I mean). Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) may seem a little unhelpful and pointless, but in fact he is the only reason why the film holds collectively. His performance is on the ball as a worried father, you actually feel aggravated and upset for his position.Fans may argue, why are all the characters in Silent Hill 1 involved but not the two main characters, Harry and Cheryl ? Why is Pyramid Head in the Silent Hill 1 concept, despite only been in Silent Hill 2 ? Well I'll say this as simple as possible, perhaps the Silence Hill movie is during a different time period to game Silence Hill. Silent Hill is based on materializations of delusions, so thus the power the town holds has intensified greatly by including Pyramid Head. After all the reason why this creature, Pyramid Head appears is because of Alessa's hatred. But I am NOT here to tell you anything on the story, I'm here to give my opinion on the film and introduce you to a world of darknessI can honestly tell you now! If you are a fan of this game series, you will NOT be disappointed in what you see. If you are a plain simple horror fan, that I would advise you too see this film, again you will NOT be disappointed.Silent Hill is a MUST see for fans! and a watch for all horror fans!I hope this comment will at least give you some consideration in watching the film and I hoped you enjoyed reading this comment.much appreciated, take care.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

it was pretty good-better than some recent horror movies,"It is pretty gory, but the story was pretty good and it did justice to the game that it is based on.

I was very happy, because I'm an avid horror fan, and a lot of the more recent films have been very predictable, and not very scary. I don't believe a horror movie can be truly scary, if its rated PG. Now it could be a psychological thriller, but that's not the same thing, cause it's not monsters and spooky stuff, usually. I recommend this movie, and for anyone who likes horror movies-The Exorcist is my favorite-if you believe in the possibility of possession-it will scare you, and possibly keep you up at night. I also suggest reading the book-because the movie follows the book pretty closely, but it's hard to fit all the little details into a movie, without having it be extremely long.

And the CGI and special effects team really pulled off a marvelous job with this movie. And I will say that it is because of the CGI and special effects that ""Silent Hill"" is worth watching.""Silent Hill"" is, unfortunately, so predictable that it Hurts, and director Christophe Gans didn't do a particular great job at the helm of this project.

"Very poor. No suspense, no plot, no scares.","Having seen the pervasive publicity for this film, I thought it would be average at worse. However, after an hour I felt that I was watching a second-rate made-for-TV film. This did not change for the second full hour I sat through.The plot is very uninvolving. The camera mainly follows a mother wandering at random through a deserted town in search of her lost daughter where she encounters monsters. These computer-generated figures are totally out of place with the human actors, and their only horror is in being quite grotesque. There is no suspense. There is no plot. The main reaction of the audience I was with was bemused laughter at the shapes of these monsters, and the arbitrary times at which they appear.Unless you have an interest in seeing how poor a film results from taking video-game concept and then removing the games controller and any sense interaction, this is a film to be avoided.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Loss of reality and destruction through faith,"For the most part, the film has stayed with the game's basic conception of Silent Hill, and the characters who give the town its essence which fans of the game would highly appreciate. With good cinematography, especially with the Otherworld scenes, the film can boast its aesthetic quality, with all the monster/character designs and production to boot. And the industrial music that accompanies the movie almost throughout the film adds up to the disturbing atmosphere of the movie. I especially liked how Alessa killed the antagonist and the whole townspeople, and the eeriness of the Janitor, as well as the nurses.But, the critique: there was a sort of languidness with how the actors portrayed their characters, and honestly the main antagonist was the only one note worthy. How Alessa told the truth should have used other ways of telling it than in an expository scene... and the script, well some are quotable actually, the rest seems unfit for such a poetic and disturbing ""atmosphere"". Rose, to boot, seemed like an automaton who just kept on ""following those clues"" without consideration or doubting said clues. And I honestly still don't know what the Pyramid Head is doing in the movie, since majority of the monsters are given symbolisms.But to an extent, the film gives the idea of letting the audience think and/or interpret the film (especially with regards to the ending) just like in the games, as well promote critical evaluation of the characters. It is not one of the greatest films, and probably a lot would be disappointed, baffled or humored; but as the film's main point: it's about loss of reality and the destruction/power through and of ""faith"" - and actually good at that.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Might be thrilling for game fans...decent fare for the rest of us,"Hmm..where to begin. I'm not a player of this particular game, so I had no idea other than the most basic, of what the plot involved. The story tends to be a bit slow at first while the mother and daughter characters are developed a bit. Once they hit the town of Silent Hill, the pace becomes quite acceptable.For fans of the game, I'm sure they already knew the in's and out's of this town, as well as a larger understanding of what was happening. I'm usually quick to pick up plot points, and rarely have to 'think' about a movie. They just make sense. This movie actually requires a bit of thought if your not familiar with the game. I'm still not exactly sure what happened at the very end ;)The acting is not steller, yet it's not bad. The mother stands out as one of the better performers, as well as the tough as nails cop. Both are likable by the end of the movie. The others don't really shine here.The movie is two hours, and I did notice that it seemed a bit long at times. Those moments were few and far between though. It has some tense moments, and a few creepy moments, although I don't recall anything that had me clinging to the edge of my seat. That said, the visuals are very good. Think Constantine, although with a little less budget, but very original. This movie is also far more bloody, which in my opinion is a good thing. I'm an adult. I don't need the diet movie when I can see the real deal.I don't recall the soundtrack at all, which I suppose could be viewed as a good thing if your the blend in the background type. I'm wishing it could have been a bit more memorable.Acting 6 out of 10. Visual Effects 8 out of 10. Sound/Music a 5 out of 10. Plot 6 out of 10Overall a 6 out of 10. If your a horror buff, a fan of the game, or just into something that's not your usual hack and slash, this is a decent bet. Might possibly interest those into mysteries, or suspense flicks. You could certainly do worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Despite the loss of the male protagonist, it is a brilliant portrayal of one person's depiction of hell.","The general consensus of the film (clearly evident over IMDb's forums), and indeed my own, was that initially it was disappointing that Hollywood chose to change the protagonist from a father, named Harry Mason, to a mother, Rose Da Silva. But other than that, all the other aspects of the game were pulled off satisfyingly, if not almost perfectly, making it possibly one of the best game-to-movie conversions ever made. Once the initial disappointment over the loss of Harry has settled, there is little else left that will do anything other than leave you with shocked sense of awe over the brilliant portrayal of one person's depiction of hell. Unlike other horror games like, say, Resident Evil, which relies heavily on the character development and an in depth storyline complete with twists, Silent Hill relies on an exquisitely grafted atmosphere throughout the game and film. This was made using breakthroughs in 3D lighting and particle effects (smoke / fog etc.) at the time it was made. This became the game's trademark, and whether on purpose or not, was without doubt the aspect of the game which propelled it to stardom. And it is specifically this aspect that they followed so totally strictly that made the film feel so like the game. That, and the fact that a number of characters, many of the creatures (who could have been lifted straight out of the game itself they were so similar) and of course the slightly confusing story which was told in a more coherent fashion in the movie which allowed many of the fans of the game to see the story in a slightly different light. Of course in a film you don't have to rely on finding scraps of paper and diary entries to piece to together the story, so as they are laid out more linearly as you watch the character's journey unravel you can concentrate on the visuals more than having to get your head around the strange and awesome world that is Silent Hill.If you just want a quick review of this film, I can tell you that it is your stereotypical good horror in the sense that it has a good story, a start a middle and an end, plenty of soft core gore throughout to remind you what it is that you are watching, and the occasional hardcore scene which will knock you off your seat and keep you on your toes. What it is, however, I can assure you is entirely unique.The story is coherent, but pretty out there as far as fantasy goes, because it leans further towards fear-of-the-dark type of horror rather than conventional sci-fi horror. By this I mean don't expect an actual explanation of how the horrors that are seen came to be, but rather why.The acting is all top notch, only slightly spoiled by Sean Bean's awful American accent which slips non-stop. But he doesn't have too much screen time, so don't let that ruin the film for you.The audio is probably Oscar winning - I don't know and I needn't look it up as I am telling you how I saw it as an audience member, not a critic. But it without doubt plays it's part very well in the atmosphere which will chill you throughout.Visually it is well filmed, consisting of some actually very nice camera angles and perspectives, but these were hard to catch due to utterly being captured by the film when I watched it. But when I broke my concentration to give the cinematography some of my time, I realised that what I was looking at was actually very visually pleasing.The effects are perfect. I mean literally at no point do you look and think ""hey, that doesn't look realistic"". I mean, if it's so good that it can't be told apart from the real thing, then in my opinion if that's not perfection then I don't know what is.Overall, one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I am a fan of the game, so whether that would have swayed my biased opinions in any particular direction I'm not sure, but if you are able to handle shocking visuals then it would be hard not to enjoy this film, at the very least on a leave-the-cinema-in-silence-with-a-heavy-feeling-in-your-stomach level like I, and everybody around me at the showing I saw did. It is a very deep and shocking film with a powerful finale and it will leave you thinking.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
At the top of the video game adaptation genre.,"""Congratulations, Rose. You're here. You did it. Your reward is the truth.""It's not often that video game movies succeed in being entertaining while also keeping in the spirit of what made that particular game successful in the first place, but Silent Hill pulls it off as well as any other attempt that I've seen. It works not only as a game adaptation, but as a horror movie, as well.I remember seeing it in the theater with a rather large group of friends, and we all (and most of the audience) were pretty freaked out by it. It's not nearly as frightening after repeated viewings, but the spooky atmosphere and perverse creatures remain effective. It certainly helps to know about the mythology of the town and the characters, but not exactly necessary. You'll still get most of what the movie is about.The pacing is deliberately slow at times, because like the games, the focus is on building almost unbearable atmospheric tension (aided by fantastic music lifted directly from the games). This goes hand in hand with the surreal, terrifying sets and the oppressive darkness that falls upon the town when the nightmare creatures appear. You may find yourself cringing every time you hear the sirens (like I did), wary of what kind of horror Rose (played by the gorgeous Radha Mitchell) is about to have to face next.On the negative side, the script is incredibly clunky, at times. Stilted and obvious dialogue occasionally draws the viewer out of the movie, and a bit more subtlety would also have been welcome. The villains really are almost comically evil. It's hard to imagine that even they believe that what they're doing isn't horrible.Silent Hill is a gory, intense, nightmare of a movie. Just as a film adaptation of this property should be. It's proof that good results can occur when a video game is treated as more than just an easy cash-grab and is adapted competently.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Good's and Bad's of Silent Hill.,"The Silent Hill Movie isn't exactly a good piece of media (In a movie sense), although it was a decent attempt at a Video Game Move. The original Silent Hill Game (PS1) was an amazingly successful game which focused on a more psychosocial approach, rather than a straight out violent approach which games like Resident Evil were doing at the time. This was a risky move as the developers didn't think general audiences would appreciate the settings which the game was trying to envelop. The thing that made the Silent Hill Game rememberable and revolutionary for Horror was that it was more of a feeling, an emotional state. It provided players with something different & unique. It Showed things, rather than explained things (This is one thing the movie does wrong).First of all, the setting and the general location of 'Silent Hill' is spot on. It resembles the Video Game incredibly well. The music is also commendably. It uses some of the music from the remarkable soundtrack which made the game even more amazing. All the music suits every location, action, etc that is taking place. The characters are decent, they don't really resemble the characters from the game, but are crafted in such a way that makes you actually occasionally care and fear for them. The script is sometimes laughably bad, it just feels rushed together. The 'Monsters' truly mirror the actual monsters from the Game. Most of the time they look scary, and they actually feel like they belong where they are. They don't feel like they're randomly placed there. They look and feel like they have evolved through out time with Silent Hill (The Location) its self. The Plot/Story is where this movie goes wrong... One of the whole reasons the game was so successful was because it didn't explain much, it just did it. So the movie try's to explain everything. We never needed to know the back story, it was incredible enough. Like I said it wasn't good in the sense of a movie. The only reason I rate it a '6' is because throughout it stays true the the actual setting (Including monsters, music, etc) of the game. It just try's too hard to explain it. The story explanation was unnecessary, it doesn't feel like the true Silent Hill.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Silent Hill"" a hit for gamers and movie-goers alike","One of the important things to remember about ""SILENT HILL"" is that this film is based on a video game put out by Konami, on the Play Station. Seeing as though I am a huge fan of this game series (Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill 3, and Silent Hill 4: The Room) I was one of those people that had to see it on the first day, first show.The majority of the audience did not know that this was a game before it was a movie. We all remember the attempt at video game cross-over years ago with Mario hit the screen in Super Mario Brothers. We were reminded again at the poor job of game crossovers when Final Fantasy came out, keeping very little for the original concept of the game. Recently, we were reminded of this event when both Resident Evils came to the silver screen.BUT LET ME SAY THIS: SILENT HILL WAS DONE PERFECTLY, and that's why people don't like it! I've read countless reviews saying the music was done poorly, mixed poorly, and have even read that it ""Sounds like video game music."" It makes me wonder if anyone did any research into this film at all. The film makers used all original music from the game, even the first one that dates 7 years ago.Much the same way Sin City was criticized for using strange cinematography; Silent Hill has been criticized for its abstract camera movement, and placement. Again, those that have played the games would tell you that several of the scenes are exact images from the game, including camera movement and style. Tthe monsters were all done with real people inside, something rarely done anymore. This brings a much more tangible aspect to the film. Pyramid Head wasn't just a CGI man walking around.I don't really want to give much away from the movie, but I can say that the film is a rendition of the first three games: the story is a basic outline of the first and third games, and there are several characters (mostly monsters) from all three. The biggest to note, is the Pyramid Head monster, one of the main characters from the second game. He is somewhat of an undertaker, and is a constant threat in the film.Silent Hill opens with the exact theme music from the game, and quickly develops into the story: a woman and her search for her daughter in the mysterious city of Silent Hill. Once there, she begins to have nightmarish visions of the world crumbling around her, and turning into a living-hell. She must find her daughter, and more importantly, she must discover the truth about her adopted daughter, and why she resembles the child demon Alyssa.The point I want to make is that this film is going to get bad reviews. Judge for yourself. I personally, have to say that it's one of the best video game to silver screen adaptations ever done. It's got the violence in it, it's got the screen shots, and it kept pretty true to the actual storyline of the games. I would highly recommend you go see this if you're into horror, and video games. Keep in mind that it's based off of a 7 year old game, and that the film makers were so dedicated to it, that they refused to change even the music.Though I enjoyed this film on such a high level, I do feel that I should comment on several things that I did not like. Though the film did stay true to the story as much as it could, there were several modifications that stuck out in the form of poor acting and exposition. There were several instances where the characters would start talking about things that happened years ago. Not that that's a bad thing: it just seems to happen a little more often than would be desired. The acting was pretty solid for this type of film, and mirrored the insanity demonstrated in the game.Overall, I would say 7/10. It's a good film. As an adaptation from a video game, I've known no other film maker to do as good a job of bringing the game world to the screen. 10 of 10 in that department.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"faulty plot, and a bad script are overlooked by the most scary scenes I have ever laid eyes on...","Although the acting is sub par, and the dialog is laughable, i was scared sh**less during the first horror scene. There is something about the grain filter, and off center shots, mixed with the creatures that walk in a demented fashion that make this movie, a horror film to remember. When Rose Da Silva finds that her adopted daughter, Cybil Bennet, talks about a place named Silent Hill in her sleep, she attempts to cure her daughter of the disorder she suffers from, Rose takes Cybil to that place to help her daughter remember of what she has been dreaming of for all this time.This Movie was well made, although as I said, you will be laughing at parts from the awful acting and horrible dialog. The amazing visuals and horrifying effects will have you looking behind you days after you leave the theater. I enjoyed my experience while watching Silent Hill, but i wish that they would have put more time in the plot, because with the right tweaks, this movie could easily be in the top 10 horror films of all time. So, if you enjoy movies that leave you crying for mommy, then I highly recommend a visit to ""Silent Hill"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent Hill,"This movie was beautifully done. Enough said. I would tell you exactly why I loved it so much, but I feel that you can just read every other rating and find out for yourself. It is definitely worth your time and money whether you're a fan of the game or not. But one reason why I loved it so much was because of the attention it requires. You can't just go in and sit down, watch stuff get killed, watch people scream and yell, and then leave. If you do that you won't understand anything, which would lead you to believe that it is a bad movie. Just pay attention, watch it, and enjoy it.

Worst Movie So Far This Year...,"Please please please do not pay to see this movie. In fact, don't even watch it for free. I did and I still feel grief over the lost 2 hours of my life.There is no sense to be made of this plot. The dialogue is beyond reproachable, and the acting horrible. The only thing remotely good about it is the graphics and set design, but that makes it pretty much like the video game from whence it was spawned. And you know what? I'd rather just PLAY THE VIDEO GAME!!I am shocked that Silent Hill received 7.4 stars. Although such ratings are relative, I am shocked to see this piece of refuse being graded near the same level as GREAT movies like Sideways or Batman Begins. This seems to cement the lack of meaning behind the ratings system on this site as well as the lack of life for video game fan boys who are trying to promote this piece of excrement as watchable.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent for a movie based on a game, good for a horror","It is definitely the best movie of those based upon a game up to date. And it is a good horror even if you ignore its roots. In my honest opinion, it is as close to the Mulholand Drive fame as Christophe Gans can get, and probably the closest any living director can, nowadays, so it is worth your time. The design is totally awesome (though most of it is borrowed from the original game), Silent Hill is worth a look just for the mere sight of those barren, picturesque ash-covered landscapes of a dead town. The story is better than average, somewhat lacking compared to the second and third of the games, but sill a solid one, exceeding those of most modern horror movies and the last of the parent game series. Recommended for those of you who have a good taste for tense, depressive and extraordinarily stylish horror movies. What else can be said (without spoiling)? Watch Silent Hill and have a great (or maybe horrible in the good meaning of the word, you know...) time",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A solid movie which could have used some more work,"Now let me first state: I know a few things about the Silent Hill series, but I've never actually played the game. In fact, my status as a gamer is disputable. Let's call me a non-gamer just for the purposes of this discussion, as that's what I essentially was going into the movie.There are several things the movie certainly did extremely well. The atmosphere was set perfectly starting right from minute one. The art and graphical direction were supremely amazing, and the entire style of the film leaves you feeling exactly the proper type of suspense. There are multiple segments which use a remarkable film grain technique, remarkable in the way it is combined with focusing effects and general cinematography to create a very stylistically different and yet natural feel. In fact, in general the cinematography is rather well done, though there are just one or two instances where I was left feeling like a shot was off balance during action sequences. The sound was also very well made and atmospheric, though there was one point during which the action suddenly loosened off and the music changed instantaneously, as often happens in video games. This was the one point during which I thought I was watching a video game movie.The plot is fairly solid in its premise - there are always inescapable potential problems with a plot like this, so it's not a big deal. However, the presentation of the plot left something to be desired at times. The beginning of the movie especially left a great deal to be desired - the movie opens with a rather tense scene which slackens off; this is normally the point in which some character development occurs in a natural environment so that you feel like you know the people - however, this movie instead moves the plot along like a bulldozer, and the forward-moving but none-too-suspenseful section to follow could have used a great deal more life; it's as if normal life is something to be lived in silence and apathy, and that the characters don't express any warmth or real life. The plot also suffers from the presentation of the child character, which is never distinctly defined as well as it should have been. I felt like I didn't know the girl at the beginning, and knew her less by the end. Another phenomenon which occurs over a span from beginning to end is that the creepiness/scariness factor seems to decrease as the movie progresses - after the first few action scenes, the plot seemed pretty secure in where it was going through multiple delayed climaxes.The acting was solid, but left something to be desired at times. Perhaps part of the reason the opening to the movie was so bland and lifeless was due to the acting, but this could only be in part. Emotion in general was a little on the weak side from these actors.Thus, I believe this movie was rather solid. It's an interesting experience, and worth a trial. It was just missing a few human factors which made the already cold material lifeless at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So close...,"One day a video game adaptation will quietly roll onto our cinema screens with an engaging story and strong characters, with enough franchise references to keep the fans happy, and enough depth to satisfy the discerning movie-goer. This will, of course, be the day winged pigs descend from the heavens.So until fiction-past-never o'clock, we have Silent Hill. Make no mistake, this IS the best mainstream video game adaptation so far... but that's like comparing X Factor winners at The Magic Flute.Imagine, if you will, someone grabbing and shaking the Silent Hill franchise until the violence fell out. Throw in the Unseen Bean, an obtuse young girl and a narrative structured on the tedious ""go to point A, collect object Y"" busywork of the game itself and you have the makings of a film that looks nice but is fundamentally broken.That's not to say there're no enjoyable moments - Pyramid head flaying some useless rambling bint is always good for a chuckle - but let down by a plot that is almost entirely nonsense (incidentally told via a ten-minute flashback sequence at the end) and the utterly inexplicable attempts to justify the aesthetics with incomprehensible backstory.People make this mistake of comparing video game adaptations with other video game adaptations.Quit it.Because when you compare anything to Super Mario Bros it's bound to come up smelling of roses.Watch Jacobs Ladder instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice surprise. Solid fantasy thriller  movie.,"I knew Silent Hill is originally a video game although I 've never played so I decided to watch it with a very open minded and no prejudices at all.

And the storyline is pretty good too.I felt trapped in it right from the beginning. All casting give solid performances. The mist in Silent Hill is more creepy and add more atmosphere than the ""The Mist"" itself by far.The atmosphere in general is great. It doesn't try to give you cheap frights like most of American horror movies. I'm not a big fun of violence in horror/thriller movies but watched this a fantasy thriller tale I didn't mind that much. Plus, I don't know the video game so I can't judge.Weakneses.. yeah, there are. Dialogues could have been better.

A beautiful film if you have Clive Barker's sense of aesthetics,"The problem with ""Silent Hill"" is that it lacks balance. Some parts of the film are over-explained while others leave you in a constant ""What the f***"". Some parts are just too creepy and shocking, while others get a little boring. Some parts are taken right out of the film, while others seemed added for no good reason. Some acting is very good, while other is very questionable.This lack of balance is enough to make many people disinterested in the film. Either they think it's too confusing, too gory, too different from the game, too slow, etc.Although IMO his ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" was most definitely a better film, Gans definitely managed to provide something the Silver Screen hasn't seen in a long time : a dark and genuinely creepy Gothic environment with a Clive Barker sense of aesthetics. Too bad the ""darkness"" had only so little presence in this film, although I guess they had to make it fairly short to make it even remotely possible to survive in there.In spite of its many flaws, however, I can say I really loved seeing ""Silent Hill"". It's definitely refreshing after seeing all those cliché American horror films or typical Japanese gore.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Refreshing Change,"After growing up with the typical American horror films, this movie is a refreshing change from the same old garbage pawning themselves off as 'horror movies'. No groups of teens or 20-somethings hunted by a seemingly immortal killer. No eternal struggle with the devil. No other cliché gimmicks that have grown stale after repeated use. Instead, a select few individuals are pitted against an army of monsters that defy typical depictions, and in one of the most surreal and nightmarish settings I have seen in a movie. The cast is well picked, with special mention of Kim Coates as a cops who's past in Silent Hill weighs heavily in him in the present. It has been a long time since I enjoyed watching a horror movie because of how creepy it is. If you're tired of the Jason's, Freddy's and Jigsaw's, try this movie, and see what nightmares REALLY look like.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silent Hill,"Silent Hill, another video adaptation is actually the best horror thriller I've seen since The Others. Christopher Gans direction of a cold deserted town and a woman attempting to find her daughter is the most chilling effect, with a musical score that's similar to his last film, Brotherhood of the Wolf, although this score was adapted from the actual game. Performances aren't particularly solid but is forgiven due to the scares and pretty nasty shocks within. Some of the special effects are superb, and there is that sense of another world which you are glad you aren't entering. I'm just glad that it is a stronger film than other films in this genre have been of late, as well as giving hope for other video games that could be taken into consideration.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Best video game adaptation yet, but still has its flaws...","Following a viewing of ""Silent Hill"" with some friends, many of them were quite perplexed at the film. Needless to say, the film was a tad bit confusing to those who were not familiar and had not played the video game franchise. Being a person who had played the games, I was very satisfied with the film. Not only did the film provide an interesting way to bring the game into the movie-world, but also stayed extremely close to many elements of the game and included various things from the first three video games. ""Silent Hill"" is by far the best video game adaptation yet, but it still has its share of flaws. For one thing, based on discussions with friends and reading reviews online, it seems quite clear who will surely enjoy this film: fans of the video game. Those who aren't familiar with the game will be left in the dark, confused by an incomplete cinematic explanation that will isolate them from the rest. My friends who hated the film had every reason not to like it. The story is confusing, the character development lacks, and the ending seems almost incomplete (to those not familiar with the game). To me, the film was excellent, following parts of the game's storyline. However, I don't think Christophe Gans or the screenwriters did a good job at making this film for the unfamiliar viewer. Another problem with the film is that it's really not scary at all. The film is visually stunning and gross, perfect to the atmosphere, but lacks the general creepiness that the game brought to its players. Not once did I jump or get concerned about what was going to happen, as it didn't set-up like a horror film. Regardless, I do believe that on its own, ""Silent Hill"" is a good movie that deserves multiple viewings to fully understand its complexities. In summation, ""Silent Hill"" is a good movie that will surely attract the curious and satisfy its fans. However, it didn't come to its full potential due to the fact that it seems to have been made for such a small, fan-based audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great as movie and as game adaption.,"This movie is by far one of the better game to film adaptions i have seen. While there were no defining ""scary"" parts, there were parts that made you say ""wicked"". People who tell you not to go see it due to lack of ""horror"", don't listen to them. The movie isn't supposed to be your normal horror. It is more(and was intended to be) a thriller. The acting was fairly good and did not take away from the movie. The people who are telling you not to watch it due to the ending. Don't listen to them either. The ending was done with some tact to possibly bring in some more elements from the games for later movies. And to the people who say they killed the plot, They were'nt trying to get the plot dead on. Even Konami and the writers for the games loved it and didn't cut any of it.

"Oh my god, what a waste of time","I want to keep this short. First of all, I never played the video game. But I can tell this was a video game adaption after the first 30 minutes watching the main character Rose Da Silva running through the scenery (or levels) calling her missing daughter's name all the time. Her actions seem unmotivated (why is she running the car through the fence, at this point of the movie there's no reason for that), and when she gets into the town things are getting worse and worse. Her first encounter with the 'evil' is just ridiculous, as is her acting. And this goes on and on and on... I mean, this is a movie and it should work for people who are not familiar with the video game. All the characters act foolish throughout the whole movie and the dialogs are really, really poor. Even the special effects were boring, because most of them are way too dark and cut in a way that you can't really make out the action. There are some nice ones towards the end of the movie, that's the reason why I rate it with one star. Otherwise I would have rated it with no stars, if there was the chance to do so. This is the worst movie I've seen this year. And it stands in line with such 'masterworks' like 'Nang Nak' or 'Catwoman'. I hate those filmmakers for wasting two hours of my time.

Silent Hill,"I saw Silent Hill last night with high expectations. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for many weeks. Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed. The movie is rather good with minor acting problems throughout, but the ending makes you wish you hadn't spent the $9.35 to get in. If you like a horror. This may disappoint you too. The movie consists of only a few shocking scenes, but the rest the director simply tries to scare you with gore and blood. The kid actor pulls off the role quite well, although her behavior doesn't match her appearance. Though 10 years old in real life, and 9 in the movie, she behaves like a 4 year old.

This movie rocked!!!,"I have been waiting forever since I heard that they were making a movie out of one of my favorite game series, and the movie did not let me down! It was simply amazing, well crafted, and startlingly just like the games. They used the enemies, they used the plots, and they even used the music from the series. All in all, this was absolutely one of my favorite movies, and probably the best movie based on a game. I will admit I was thrown off when they chose a female lead, but in the end, I think it worked out well. They did such a good job incorporating the theme from each of the games. The cultists were probably my least favorite, just because it seemed that the actors were not doing their best performances. I think that the two BEST enemies in the movie were Pyramid Head, and the Nurses. Those were so amazing! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has played the games, but if you haven't, then don't bother, because you're just wasting your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wow, and I mean wow, this movie is terrible","I just got back from watching this ummm drivel. I am a huge fan of the original game, but this movie is one of the lesser things I have seen lately. Not sure why no one can figure out how to make a good video game adaptation.This film has great art direction and the sets are spectacular. The special effects were up to par. However, the script is atrocious and the acting is pretty bad too. The little girl playing Alessa makes Jake Lloyd from Star Wars look like a master thespian. Sean Bean apparently needed a paycheck. Radha Mitchell was OK I guess, but who couldn't run down the street and shout, ""Sharon!"" for the 114th time. Of course you can't really expect anybody to do that well with such ridiculous dialogue.I had high hopes too, after learning Gans was directing, that this would be good. I like the Brotherhood of the Wolf. I was all for Gans disparaging remarks about Uwe Boll, since we all know he hasn't come close to making a good movie yet, but good ole Uwe couldn't have done much worse with this piece of junk.Oh well, here is to hoping that maybe Halo will have a shot of being good when it comes around.Oh and honestly, this movie is not that gory either. Were it not for some specific curse words, a little creative editing could easily get this ""thing"" in PG-13 range.Ultimately just another failed attempt that will make most people continue to assume video games are as bad as this piece of trash.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure win.,"As for some of the reviewers, I don't know what they're on or what they watched. The gore content is not high, having about two scenes that are truly to be considered gore. The acting is believable, not being overacted or monotonous. The monsters are very creepy and gave me chills. The atmosphere of the movie is very dark and quite spooky. Any video game fanatics are to be pleased as well, because the storyline is almost identical with a few tweaks here and there. The characters are different, but that's to be expected. I don't want to spoil anything so that people can watch it, but overall I have no complaints and am a huge fan of the film. I wouldn't recommend you to watch it with young children though, it's a bit disturbing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror/Suspense Video Game Made as an Action Movie,"As far as films adapted from video games go, Silent Hill is probably the best there is. And while that doesn't say much for movies of this type, Silent Hill the film does a good job of hiding it's video game origins and staying true to them at the same time. It's apparently a more difficult process in game-to-film adaptations than it seems, and Silent Hill gets it mostly right.That being said, if you are a fan of the game, you will almost certainly enjoy this movie. The look, the sounds, and the themes are all here, are done an immense justice. In fact, the visual elements of the film are absolutely superb, and all credit is due to the people responsible for getting the look just right. Not only was this movie beautifully shot, but the designs, locations, costumes, and special effects all look great, and blend together perfectly. Unfortunately, the other elements of the film didn't quite match up.The primary fault of the film is that it fails to build tension. While the game was great at creating a sense of paranoia and general unease, the film doesn't quite give you the same feeling. It may be perhaps the main characters appear too strong-willed, and that the director does not allow them to feel the same fear as we should. It may also be that because of the director's very love of the source material, his desire to show us everything he threw in the film takes away the viewer's fear of the unknown. It's that fear of the unknown that the Silent Hill video game perfected, and what the movie Silent Hill seems to get wrong. As much as fans love to see the monsters, they're in your face way too often on screen, and all the scares become more gore in nature than suspense. In fact, the towards the end of the film, the gore becomes excessive, another thing that detracts from the suspense, and leads us into more action/horror territory.Overall, for fans of the game who want to see it brought to life as a film, it comes recommended. But those who are unfamiliar and are expecting a decent horror film will be minimally satisfied by a movie that, ironically, tries to be too much like a game.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most faithful video game adaptations made,"While it lacks storytelling nuance and leaves a lot to be desired in a refinement sense, there's no doubt in my mind that Silent Hill is one of, if not the most faithful video game adaptations ever made.Perfectly capturing the vibe and setting of the famous Japanese made series, a series that haunted the lives of many a player in the late 90's and early 2000's, Christophe Gans film which is based off a Roger ""Pulp Fiction"" Avary script, is a film made by fans for the fans, as it sees Radha Mitchell's determined mother explore the abandoned mining town of Silent Hill in search of her missing adopted daughter.Gans, who was and still is a huge admirer of the game series, ensures that every part of his horror outing is lathered in game lore and homage, as his film doesn't supply jump scares or layered metaphors but rather a collection of grisly images, characters and set-ups that literally transports viewers into the world that was established well before this film arrived.Utilising such memorable gaming components as ""Pyramid Head"", some ghastly creepy crawlies, unnerving nurses and gas mask clad religious zealots (plus use of the games famed music score), if nothing else Gans film is a visual feast that feels entirely unique, in an often carbon copy environment of the genre, with the setting of Silent Hill itself creating an added bonus as one of the most memorable horror locales of the modern era.Most video game adaptations struggle greatly in transporting their game locations and characters into a movie setting but Gans and Avary managed to do the impossible, with Silent Hill feeling like a game as much as a movie, no doubt part of the reason why many film critic upon release dismissed the film without ever understanding where it was born from.It's a shame then that Gans film wasn't able to be delivered with a polish and sheen that would've really ramped it up to another level, while the films oddly structured narrative that includes the bizarre tacked on Sean Bean scenes that were added at the behest of the studio really do slow things down, moments that are at their best when Mitchell and her offsider Laurie Holden as police officer Cybil Bennett are exploring the dastardly surrounds of the Silent Hill township.The other component of the film that is cause for debate is Silent Hill's oddball and utterly insane finale, a finishing act that will be too much for some, as people's skin is being flayed off like meat off a bone or communal burnings take centre stage, there's no doubt Gans and Avary really went for it as they combined to end things off with a bang.Final Say -A flawed film that is first and foremost a film for its fans, Silent Hill is not high class cinema but it's one of the most successful examples of a faithful video game adaptation we've seen.3 oversized swords out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
My SH review,"OK, although this got a bit of bad press from a lot of my mates who had seen it, I thought Id give it a whirl anyway as I was a big fan of both the writer and director. And I made the right decision. This film rocks. Its the best horror film I've seen since the descent and I felt there's really very little to criticise. The special effects are flawless- there's not one bit where I was like 'Hmm that looks a bit sh*t'. And Although I'm not a big special effects buff, I cant actually remember the last time I said that about a film. The story was decent, and nicely faithful to the game. The acting was pretty good, but it is the films visual style that left me in awe. The cinematography is superb, with some awesome camera movements, and the lighting feels like your playing the game its so faithful. The music was f'ing brilliant, the type of sh*t you hear and you're just like 'That would make an awesome sample'. I got scared by this film but still had a huge grin for most of the films 125 minutes. Although I do agree pyramid head should have got more screen time.So yeh, although I guess its definitely not everyones cup of tea according to my friends, I found it was definitely a film for me. And they don't make enough of those these days!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best adaption of a game,"First off I'm going to mention the fact it helps to see the movie first.... but it is not imperative, you will just appreciate the film more This game takes from all of the games and adds more depth .... but doest scare away hardcore fans of the games....the set design is immense , the creatures are twisted but yet elegant....you want to look at them as opposed to looking away...Some people say that the film can seem to be a bit confusing and i can see where they are coming from....it just requires a little thought As a game adaption it scores a 10 but since i think this movie could stand alone i shall give it a seven",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deliciously Creepy,"Silent hill is 2006's best thriller hands down.It is pure good entertainment pumped up with plenty of terrifying action.Average acting for a horror flick but the effects are anything but average.They're spectacular.This movie will creep you out big time and at certain times jolt you right out of your seat.Silent hill is loaded with eye-popping effects that insures the film to be an absolutely mind blowing adventure.The video game movies have been OK as far as doom goes but silent hill is an amazing adaptation.A good plot and interesting characters isn't all that silent hill offers.This vivid thriller offers you a chance to settle your adrenaline rush and scare the hell outta you at the same time.I give this film a perfect 10,Silent Hill is a ferocious all American horror.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than average horror movie, spoiler free comments","The movie takes us through the terrifying town of Silent Hill. The story is, generally, faithful to the video game and that is a wonderful change from video game and book adaptations. While there were some changes to the plot, and additional characters placed in, the underlying theme of the game was intact and the movie excels for it.Silent Hill is a scary place and the special effects and pacing (generally) kept the tension and sense of bafflement high. My shoulders and neck are still tight from being so tense.Were we just to follow the character of Rose as she searched for her daughter in this strange and terrible town, the movie would have been better than almost every other horror movie I've ever seen. Easily 8/10 stars.However, we are ripped from our tension, horror, and wonderment repeatedly to track the events that befall Rose's husband, played by Sean Bean. Storywise, even though this part was tacked on after the fact, it works quite well. Cinematically, however, it is a total failure for the simple reason that it breaks the tension and destroys the pacing. The acting is quite fine, the story itself is quite fine, but the disruption to the main thread is unforgivable. I am extremely disappointed that this thread was added on. What it added to the story was insignificant when compared to what it took from the overall feel of the film.Excellent work by the writer, director, special effects crew, composer, and all of the actors. Easy 8/10 but for the extraneous storyline.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ignore all good reviews of this movie!!!!!!!!!!,"OK, let's begin. This movie is the worst I have seen in a long, long time. I'm a fan of the games and of the horror genre, so despite awful looking visual effects in the preview, I thought I would give this movie the benefit of the doubt and drop $10 to go and see it - I should have followed my doubts. The script is bad, the visual effects are poor and overly ambitious, and the story goes absolutely nowhere. I can't help but think this movie could have been executed so much better, if they had just simplified everything and made a raw horror movie.The fact that the studio didn't allow critic screenings before release, leads me to think that they knew they had a piece of s**t on there hands. The good reviews on IMDb stink of studio plants (not the first on the site), so ignore at all costs. Please trust me, I'm a true video game/horror fan. Check out 'Wolf Creek' or 'Hostel' if you want to see genuinely creepy movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Video Game Adaptation I've Seen,"However, that's still not saying much.It's better than the crap Uwe Boll spits out on a daily basis, but I still say that it's all but impossible to successfully adapt a video game into a workable movie.The whole point of the video game is interactive enjoyment and puzzle solving. How are you going to enjoy a movie like that? Having said that, they almost accompolish that here. There are clues that are followed as the lead character searches for her daughter and tries to uncover the mystery of what actually happened....in Silent Hill....Aside from a few changes to the original game, they did a great job capturing the horror and suspense you feel when you play the game.My final advice would be--I recommend this movie as both a decent adaptation and an above-average horror flick.BUT...if you truly want to experience the nature of Silent Hill, you have to play the game for yourself.Final verdict: 6/10 or 2 stars out of 4 And a 3/10 on the ""endurance scale"" -- a new system I set up that estimates whether or not it's a movie you'd want to see over and over. So in this case, you might watch it once, maybe twice, but it's probably not something most people would want to watch frequently.I can only hope the Metal Gear Solid movie is adapted this well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
