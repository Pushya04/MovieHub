"This movie reminds me story of me and my father, before he died on cancer","My father was a brilliant sculptor and a great visionary. When I was a kid, I never could explain what he was doing. I got it a month before his death when i was 26. This film filled my eyes with tears, because it reminded me him. he had a lot of ideas and brilliant and original ideas for improving the world, but for all his life he could not sell it to anyone, because those ideas filled his whole day. Literally. His whole apartment was filled with papers. Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. I would add a note that when we dream, we are escaping from the world of facts and truths. When my father said that if you think of anything in life, you have to write it down because what comes to your mind it never comes again it changed my life. Now I'm writing a book - a novel from environment of Mesopotamia and that just because my father was someone who believed in imagination and creative values​​.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How to create your own legacy...,"I often find that in order to be captivating, a film these days needs to be stressfully suspenseful or have a complicated story line. This film had neither, and yet I found myself hoping it wouldn't end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion. I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, ""the story of my life."" Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.Go see this movie, bring the kids, bring your date, bring your parents! It is for everyone...everyone who appreciates a visually and emotionally beautiful irregular story about a regular person's life.***** 5 stars!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Make a story of your own,"The whole story of a man's life is something large, but this movie managed to be entertaining and comical telling a story by dividing it into many stages so well told it feels like it's a little fairy tale, so many aspects and many temporal lines in 2 hours that feels like just a single hour.The story itself is touching and beautiful while the time placement (involving the wardrobe used and design of the places as well) totally transports the audience to those years, it's colorful and complements the ""adventure vibe""This is undoubtedly a great movie to watch with the family, so every single member can appreciate each other stories and how they all got intertwined.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lying as an Art Form,"What do you say about this movie?I am at a total loss to describe it.  The concept itself, a son tries to come to terms with his dying father that he knows nothing about but an enormous catalog of unbelievable stories, doesn't sound very promising.  It sounds like a tired old formula, and I expected such when the rental started playingIt's not.Werewolves, giants, witches, siamese twins, bank robbers, hidden cities, sirens, etc. are all present in the fantasy, but they seem unremarkably to be part of the life of an otherwise ordinary traveling salesman.  Whether they really are or not is never made completely clear, but that's the rub.I once read a review by Harlan Ellison in which the main point was how a well told lie illuminates the truth in far better clarity than a simple recitation of the facts ever can.  At one point in the film, the questing son remarks to his bed-ridden father that he's heard all of his stories thousands of times, and he has know idea who his father really is.  The father's reply is, `I've never been anybody but me from the day I was born. If you don't know who I am, that's your failing, not mine.'  Later investigations make the point clearer.  I'll bet Ellison loved this movie. It is an extraordinary lie.Did I like the film?  You bet.  It's Tim Burton's best work without a doubt. Is it for everybody?  Probably not.  Many will find it confusing and pointless, but good fantasy is like that.  All I can say is, relax and let it happen.  You won't regret it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton's Surprise Heartwarmer,"I approach Tim Burton films with a certain trepidation.  Will it be ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Batman II?""  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.""Big Fish"" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.Burton deals with mythic themes in ""Big Fish.""  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long ""suffering"" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It doesn't get better than this...,"When I saw the French movie Amelie I sat in the movie theater with a smile on my face throughout the whole movie. The exact same thing happened while watching Big fish. It is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. It made me feel good, it made me laugh, and it almost made me cry. What else is there to ask for?The actors did an excellent job, and the dialogue and the story was told in a very good way! The characters are also well described, every character had a meaning in the movie, everyone from the friendly giant to the twins to the witch to the big fish!The are a couple of movies that really makes me feel good, and Big fish easily enters that collection of feel-good-movies.

A Wonderful Fable About A Dreamer Who Sees the World With Beautiful Eyes,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Peixe Grande e Suas Histórias Maravilhosas"" (""Big Fish Abd His Wonderful Stories"")",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not the Best Movie Ever, but My Favorite Nonetheless","Big Fish is nowhere near a perfect movie. Sometimes the dialogue is awkward, the pacing drags at times, and Steve Buscemi is, as always, a weirdo. There are bizarre and fantastical ideas that can take you out of the movie. For all its flaws, I can't give it more than an 8. That being said, this is my favorite movie of all time.Big Fish strikes a chord with me. It examines the value of a life, our modern-day myths, and, ultimately, the nature of our humanity. I don't cry easily, and I'm not just saying that - I didn't cry at Schindler's List, or Titanic; but Big Fish makes me sob every time. The ultimate catharsis, where a man's identity, value, integrity, and family are all validated, and his life has been a life worth living.Tim Burton was definitely the man for the job on this film, and if you like his other classics like Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Batman, you'll probably enjoy this one, too. What else can I say, this is my favorite movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fisherman's story,"When watching the movie I thought this movie was a copy of the legendary Forrest Gump with the added bonus of being more fanciful. However, that's not what the film is intended for, Gump just narrates his real stories and nobody believes it, Edward, on the other hand, adds a touch of fantasy and children's stories to his deeds, that's the difference between the two, one just wants to tell the facts of his life the other tries to re-signify or enhance the facts of his life, or at least transform simple things of our daily life into adventures never seen before.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Brilliant Tall Tale Or Is It?,"Tim Burton has moved us with Edward Scissorhands, to me his most brilliant original work..being that it was a screenplay by him and Caroline Thompson... but BIG FISH is by far his MASTERPIECE. Based on a amazing book, he connected with the material beautifully. The visuals, the acting, the craftsmanship in putting all this together in a very touching... tug at your heart strings... laugh out loud... Oscar worthy production was handled to perfection. How could you not like this film? I simply wouldn't understand it. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny Devito all give A+ performances... Jessica being left out of most of the reviews I had to bring her in... not to be unnoticed are also a stellar performance by Billy Cruddup, Alison Lohman, and Helena Bohnam Carter. In fact I think every person in the film had one of their best performances. Just stellar all around. One whopper of a story that gets you pulled in and doesn't let you go till the ending credits! Big Fish will be in my movie library along with Edward Scissorhands and be a favorite in my heart, my 15 year old Daughters, my Wifes, and everyone I talk to about it.

There Are Lots of Big Fish in the Sea,"I had the advantage of having read the novel before the movie. The book works a little better. Others have talked about the specifics of the movie. I want to talk about the premise of the lie. My father was a liar (often in the most positive sense of the word). My sister and I grew up with so much misinformation, that we have spent the last 30 years after his death trying to rake through the BS. We often heard tales like the ones in the book (not quite as dramatic but creative nevertheless). It was mostly things he had done. That he had accomplished. Why we were so darned poor after all this always confused me. If someone had met all those people and had all those experiences, why hadn't he parlayed them into something incredible. Once we got through it, we realized he wasn't a liar. He was an entertainer. And what he did was to pump life into a world that often doesn't have life. And while we would groan at him and tell him to stop, we would listen as if everything he said was gospel. The Albert Finney character was the same way. To be metaphorically taken away by his fantasies was the greatest gift he could give. The only gift he had. And every one was a harmless, benevolent yarn that would live on after him. There are still times when one of my father's stories pops into my head and I have to regroup and rethink before I realized what a fabrication it was.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cohesive and a feast for the eyes,"I've had high hopes for this movie since I first heard about it some time ago.  After all, most of the Tim Burton movies I've seen (barring Planet of the Apes) have been really wonderful.  To say the least, Big Fish did not disappoint me.  The story - by no means complex or suspenseful - was simple enough to allow the viewer to really take in the fantasy and mythology in Edward Bloom's tales.  One didn't need a surprise ending or secret identities to make this film enjoyable.  Rather, it was the simplicity and universal nature of the story that made it interesting. While some reviews have mentioned that the film can seem choppy at times, I didn't see this at all.  The transition seemed smooth and logical, and while sometimes I found myself wishing for more scenes of younger Edward Bloom, I never felt bored by any of the movie.  Nothing seemed to 'drag'. I was also quite impressed with the quality of acting in nearly the entire cast.  Billy Crudup didn't really hit his stride until the end, but he was tolerable through the first three-quarters of the movie.  Albert Finney did a great job of portraying a lion on his last legs, bigger than his body but unable to show it.  Jessica Lange was amazing and added the emotional oomph that Billy Crudup often failed to provide.  And while Ewan McGregor's role was not particularly difficult, at no point did he overplay the character, and his accent (to my ear anyway) never slipped. Though this wasn't as dark as Sleepy Hollow or as bizarre as Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice, Big Fish definitely had the Tim Burton touch in its scenery.  The colors - whether dull for Elder Bloom's time or bright for Younger Bloom - matched the mood perfectly, and everywhere you looked (especially in Bloom the Younger's timeframe) there was something else to marvel at.  Tim Burton fans will not be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The importance of Legacy. An uplifting tale for those who want to live life to the fullest.,"-- Maybe MILD, MILD SPOILERS -- for those who want to know what to expect from the movie but don't want to be spoiled of key aspects.If you knew exactly when you were going to die, would you live life differently? The answer to this question is explored here in a fantastical and uplifting tale of a man who told his life story to his son which seemed too extraordinary to be true but yet was not entirely false. It almost seems unrecognisable the fact that Tim Burton directed this movie as, visually, it's the least macabre and extravagant of his, yet the deep heartfelt storytelling he always puts in them is not only still there but takes the center stage in this one.It is impossible to provide a spoiler-free review of a movie that tries to blur the line between fantasy and fiction, but here's a review that attempts to capture the essence and feeling of the movie.The use of metaphors, symbolism and fairy tale morals provide a unique and stylised point of view of the life of a man who always dreamt big. While, to his son, all his stories seemed like pipe dreams with no other purpose than to amuse him as he was younger; he however doesn't get as mad as anybody would have gotten in his same situation. He approaches him in what could be considered his death bed to ask him to tell the truth.Throughout the movie we witness many incredible feats the father accomplished in every stage of his life, some of them good and others not so good. The story telling smartly wraps every life story with a coat of positive outlook paint at a dire or frightening situation while as the plot moves along it leaves the audience wondering if it was true and it if isn't we want to believe it is.It reminds me of another drastically genre-different movie called The Pan's Labyrinth (2006), which takes place in the 1930s and in it a little girl finds a faun who tells her she is the lost princess of a fantastical kingdom and gives her three trials she must complete in order to be able to return to it. As you watch the movie progress you get the feeling that certain themes are conflicting with one another as you try to figure out if what the girl is actually witnessing is fiction or not. I won't spoil the ending but it ties up closely to what happens in this movie although it has been stated by the director (Guillermo Del Toro) the actual ending.IN CONCLUSION, regardless of whether the ending is satisfying for everyone or not, the movie is blatantly self-aware of what it is and never tries to hide its inevitable conclusion. It's ending has a sense of finality and a deep message that sticks with you and especially makes you realise the importance of life, the people you meet and the family you have. It's uplifting, optimistic, positive and encouraging; an absolute must watch to those who want to live life to the fullest...P.S.: The title of this movie might be the best title any movie has ever had. Absolutely heartwarming when you understand what it means.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best films in the last 25 years,"Big Fish...What made me watch this film in the first place was solely based on the fact that Pearl Jam got nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. That's what got me to the theatre the first time. What made me goto the theatre two more times after and purchase the DVD the second it became available was the greatness of the movie. It's not often that a love story so deep comes along. This movie encompasses two types of love, between a father and son, and a husband and wife. But it's not a sappy romance. How Tim Burton did this, proves how genius he is. Though the movie itself seems so far-fetched, it could not be more real. If you've already seen this movie, and like it, you'll know what i mean. For those who don't know whether or not to watch it brings me to the next point. Someone who doesn't even like the story to this movie, could still love it. It's one of the few movies I can tell people has some of the greatest imagery. Sure, movies these days have cool effects and stuff, but with Big Fish, you will be captivated by the use of colour and parallelism. From the town of Spectre, to the cool carnival, everything is so magical. Now onto two very important things that give this movie the 100% rating i gave it, and why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes, Acting and Sound. Surely, everyone knows Ewan McGregor. But it's his supporting cast that make this film amazing. The chemistry between Billy Crudup (William) and Albert Finney (older Edward Bloom) is amazing. Though they have few scenes together, the ones that they do have together are very touching, and again extremely realistic. Jessica Lange (older Sandra Templeton) and up and comer Alison Lohman (Sandra Templeton) suit their respective parts perfect, and they both compliment each other by their characters. They we have the always funny Steve Buscemi (no one could have played his part better) and Danny DeVito who is also incredible in this movie. Helena Bonham Carter also provides a very unique role in this movie... her mystique and subtle beauty suited this movie perfect. Then came sound. A great original score, a fantastic soundtrack and an amazing, and I'll say it again AMAZING original song by Pearl Jam made this whole movie come together in perfection. Elvis Presly, Buddy Holly, and the Allman Brother to name a few of the old school music in this movie are an excellent choice to showcase what time periods we look at in this movie. All in all, Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and the casts best pictures in my opinion.Just a side note: Billy Crudup hasn't appeared in many films, but to mention two of his other movies (Almost Famous and Sleepers) seems appropriate. He's casted in some great movies if ya ask me. :)Thanks",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truth is Stranger than Fiction,"Who doesn't like a good story? Big Fish took the traditional grandpa story and turned it into a very colorful and entertaining picture. That is not easy to do. What looked like it was going to be a juvenile and childish movie with adult overtones actually proved to be very grown up. I was totally wrapped up in this story just like a kid hearing his favorite bedtime story.If someone were to catch this movie in the middle or just see clips of the trailers, then the movie would look like an LSD trip on film. But it really was a very sensible and touching movie which needed every bit of the exaggerated and iconic symbols used. The colorful story was equally matched by the colorful scenes. Big Fish was a big success.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The director- as well as character- as illusionist: a Tim Burton treat,"Director Tim Burton is notorious for his inventive, unique brand(s) of images he puts into his films, and a style that seems to regenerate in each film he does (though not always successfully- Planet of the Apes proved that).  Now there's Big Fish, a film loaded with visual spectacle, and it shows Burton working an adaptation to his own advantage for the first time in years.  Here he tells a story about storytelling, using both make-up, sets, and CGI at his disposal, and it's about one man's own imagination and how he carried it on to others, whether they were delighted by the tall tales or not.This man is Edward Bloom, played by both Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, and they both deliver wonderful work here as the dying Bloom still telling stories of adventures and the young Bloom playing them out, respectively. As do Billy Crudup as Edward's son William, who's grown weary of his father telling the story of his birth (involving a catch of a big fish), among many others, and all he wants now at his deathbed is the truth.  Jessica Lange is also dependable as Edward's wife Sandy, the love of each other's lives.What's so alluring about the world Burton creates (based on the novel by Daniel Pierce, which I imagine must be loaded with vivid description) is that he simply builds on the world Edward created for his and his family's amusement.  Stories like the visit to the town of Spectre, and that town's most known poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi in one of the film's highlighted supporting roles); the years spent working for nothing in the circus for Amos (Danny DeVito, another note of interest) just to know more about Sandy, whom he sees frozen in time; his stint in the war, etc.  All of the people and environments that are reveled are done so with many visual effects, but they're the kind that help build on Burton's vision instead of depleting it.  Even if a scene may have dialog or acting that could be taken as over the top, the storytelling is on par with some of Burton's best work (i.e. Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and even the somewhat recent Sleepy Hollow).The best thing that can be said about Big Fish, even to those who might not like it, is that the journeys and stories taken in the film, by real and 'elaborated' real characters, generate a film as a delight for all ages. That it also has comedy along with drama (grounded in a sense of humanity for both) is also a feat accomplished well by the actors.  To me, this is one of the better films of the year.  Grade- A",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unimpressed,"Many people have said how great they found this film, personally it didn't really do it for me.I thought it was quite sickly actually. Plus points for the special effects; Tim Burton rarely disappoints in that area, but what got me was the obvious way it tried to toy with the viewers emotions, it tried too hard to upset me, and at the end I didn't care, I knew it was manipulating the viewer and I didn't fall for it's narrative tricks. But this isn't about how clever I am, rather, how superficial I found the acting and the writing to be. There were too many clichéd characters, and I suppose that is partly the point of tall tales, but I found it boring.It's definitely not for everyone, it left me cold and wet.

Only mildly entertaining/resonating,"I guess expectations will get you more often than not. I'm a fan of much of Tim Burton's work, and the accolades declaring this to be a new ""Wizard of Oz"" were encouraging, but as it turns out, I was more entertained by that other recent film with the similar premise - Secondhand Lions.Big Fish started with promise as it sets up the metaphor and mythos of its story, but about halfway through it all becomes rather ho-hum. I like where Burton was reaching with this, which was higher than Secondhand Lions was reaching, but it really failed to resonate or captivate in the way it seems to try so hard to. Secondhand Lions knew it was a light comedy, seen from the eyes of a child coming of age, and it was successful in that sense. Big Fish didn't seem to know what it was... it wasn't really all that funny... or dramatic... or romantic... though it had slight aspects of each. And with the protagonist a jaded adult (Billy Crudup), it just wasn't as captivating to experience as compared to Haley Joel Osment's youth in Lions.Some good performances, especially Ewan McGregor as the younger Edward Bloom, but unfortunately the film is nowhere near as entertaining or resonating as other Burton fare such as Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood.

"Invitation to a meandering and ultimately fruitless discussion about themes of ambition, loyalty, and father-son relationship.","I am happy to plunge deeper into such a discussion; feel for the characters or analyze the themes, but ""Big Fish"" just knocks and runs away, giving me only an aesthetic of a narrative without the contents. The stories of the main protagonist (Edward Bloom) are desperately sad and craving (on paper), but the film's atmosphere, music, decorations; almost everything visual-wise give them a comedic light, which goes against the main father-son drama and softens the impact any interesting conflict in this film.Other explanation for the rose-tinted colors - we learn about these stories from the conversations between Edward and his son (Will Bloom). Edward softens the brutality of the real-life events for his young boy, but to the point where they apparently lose their reality roots (circus manager is a were-bear for some reason, kidnapped a Siamese twin from a theatre in north korea attended by hundreds of enemy soldiers). These stories feel poetic and have hints of symbolism about Edward's colorful perception of the world vs the boring material description, which he must've thought were less persuasive and would ruin the complexity of his past-life.Edward takes to heart Emily Dickinson's advice of telling a dazzling truth of the real-world, but doing it in a slant language and gradually, not blinding us with his life's tragedies all at once.However, Will grows up, and now is ready to learn what was really happening to dad, at least using a little bit more substantial words and less abstract symbolism. But Edward doesn't add anything new and doesn't event want to explain his reason behind the symbolism or doesn't have enough self-awareness to realize how vague his stories are. It leads to the worst trope in fiction - miscommunication. They become estranged, Will begs his father to have a sincere conversation and solve their strain, but to no avail. Father thinks he told everything absolutely and unboundly clear. The story doesn't explain the reason for this miscommunication either and focus more on the aesthetics of the sparkly tall tales, giving little time to the most promising father-son arc.Paraphrasing Roger Ebert in his review of the ""Big Fish"", Edward is someone who tells the same worn off jokes, but doesn't have enough awareness to tell them quick.The ending feels forced. Edward doesn't provide any more evidence that his stories are true or his way of telling them was justified (his son finds two small clues), but Will suddenly realized how he loves him and what a great storyteller he is. The quasi-comedy ends with a cringy tale (now told by Will) of an alternative reality, where Edward meets his every acquaintance by a lake and jumps into the waters as the titular ""Big Fish"", accompanied by a cheesy music. In an epilogue Will continues his dad's legacy telling ornate stories, which probably will sprang into a generational trauma of their own.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie Magic,"Every other year you get a movie that oozes magic and charm. Think ""Chocolat"". Think ""Amelie"". Think ""What dreams may come"". Perhaps even, ""Being John Malkovich"". And this year, it's time to think big... ""Big Fish"", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H""agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.After cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of ""Big Fish: The Animated Series"" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way, I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish - a franchise or a single movie. It definitely is more deserving of praise, awards and viewers than any other movie released during the past six months, including LOTR-RotK.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful tale about life's magic,"Subtle, delicate, touching and fascinating pledge for the life as fruit of dream. About the ambiguous taste of imagination and about existence like a spectacular trip. About desire and reality like warm bread.The director of ""Big Fish"" is Tom Burton. It is only decent definition of a film -mixture between childhood and small miracles, about a special image of ordinaries gestures and about hope in eccentric aspects. The texture is same of grandmother's tales in Christamas Eve or Sunday morning. A brave hero, strange village, temptation and huge love, success and discoveries, miracles and public,secret sense of life and courage. So, in many cases, the reality is only boring passage and the dream, the childish game, the sound of angel's voice or the strange facts are heart of magnificent act of contemplation.It is a moral story but, in same measure is source of a way to look the world. The life is not a punish or bag of routine. The faith is not only part of a relation with God but with yourself. The others are, in great measure, parts of funny miracle and ineffable expectation.The Ewan Mc Gregor acting is brilliant. Nuances, accents, inflexion of words, smile or gestures are bricks of a magnificent character, touching, warm, credible. In some moments, the film is spectacular dialog between McGregor and Albert Finney interpretation.In fact, ""Big Fish"" is a tale. A fairy tale about life's magic out of words or exterior facts.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow!!!!!,"I would like to start by saying that I have always loved watching Albert Finney ever since I saw him in A Christmas Carol as a child.  After seeing him in Big Fish alongside Jessica (I in no way look 80) Lange, I love his acting even more.  I thought the entire tale was wonderful from beginning to end, and I did not want to see the story end, which, I would say, should be considered a defining characteristic of a feel good movie such as this. I felt all of the acting was superb as was the writing, directing, etcetera. I have only one thing about this movie that really baffles me... are you listening Academy?  Why wasn't this movie the winner for Best Picture? Ohh, yeah... LOTR... my bad... on any other year, it should have been.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A son tries to separate fantasy from truth in order to find out who his father is,"Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), a larger-than-life kind of guy, has always told miraculous stories about his life where fantasy and reality are seemingly interwoven. This has lead to years of alienation from his son Will (Billy Crudup) who feels he never heard the real stories and who doesn't appreciate his father's fantastic tales. When Ed Bloom is on his deathbed, his son returns. Feeling like he never knew his father, he hopes to separate the lies and fantasy in his stories from the truth, hoping to find the true person underneath the tall-tales.In the movie, Edward Bloom recounts stories from his life. We see the younger Edward Bloom (mostly played by Ewan McGregor) as the main character of these fantastic tales. There are many themes in this movie as they vary with the story being told, but the main theme is the relationship between father and son as his son rediscovers and comes to terms with who his father is.It's a heart warming, adventurous, funny movie where fantasy and reality go hand in hand and the possible is as likely as the impossible.To me, this is Tim Burton at his best.

Sir Reel and the Disney Disease,"Well, this film certainly took a while to hook me in, and actually my wife, pre-occupied with real life instead of reel life left the theater after about 20 minutes.I had convinced her to see this with me after a friend had told me he thought this was a great romance. Ewan MacGregor does reprise his role from ""Moulin Rouge"" as a hopeless though far from helpless romantic. There's an ""aw-shucks"" aspect to his portrayal, did we ever see him smile and a cartoon beam of light twinkle off his teeth? Even if not, his romance doesn't have much bite to it.I think the acting (and casting, are Southerners really that foreign to us, and to Tim Burton?) was no big shakes. Crudup gets one scene (towards the end) to really show his craft, but if you haven't seen ""Jesus' Son"" you're better served by watching that. Jessica Lange is a goddess, but here she is not much more than a Hallmark card. For her may I recommend Titus...amongst many.And did someone really write here that Danny DeVito was subtle? Now, that's funny...The big story here are the big stories, and Burton's always crafty realization of them. The tall tales are fun in a circus fashion. Indeed we even do get to visit a circus, and Burton remains a fan of the freak show...there's no boy here with scissors for hands, but plenty of others...the ""Siamese"" twins above all were enchanting.There's just not enough other oddball twists from Burton to make this a ""great"" film for me, a doctor who has some prescience (Guillame/Benson lives!!), the deposed colossus skipping town, and so forth.I did like new twists on myth as presented here. It would be interesting to see what others think of the book that this is based on. Also, the notion that the best we have to offer in our lives are our stories is a beguiling one (especially for someone working in the ranks of the Hollywood dream machine I suspect). I take issue with that message in theory, and in the realization of it here...I think that this dream has been manufactured to be consumed by so many, and thus lost its most interesting flavors.So we end up with a cafeteria prepared big fish, that really is not that difficult to stomach, and is filling enough. As I think about it Burton's characters in the past were not a strong point (defined more by quixotic behavior than on dialogue, and detailed character portrayal...Batman was not the only comic book escapee among them), but I still think this film comes up a little lacking for Burton fans.Lower your expectations, and give this film time to see past the ""Forrest Gump"" nature of it for the trees surrounding Specter and other delights...6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually stunning, but is it enough?","In the words of one of the characters ""Not everything makes sense, but that's the kind of story this is."" And indeed so, not everything here makes sense...Will Bloom tells the story of his Dad, who told the most unusual and extraordinary stories, which supposedly happened to him. This is a fairytale and it is magical and fantastical - complete with a giant, a witch, and a werewolf.The film itself is a bunch of stories thrown together, and might as well have been an anthology film. 'Big Fish' is an incredibly well made and highly acclaimed film, but let me make a confession: the first time I watched it, I found it slow moving. Thinking I probably wasn't in the right frame of mind when I watched it, I decided to watch it again. Sure enough, again I found it a bit slow. Extremely well made with fantastic visuals, off course, but nevertheless a bit slow.'Big Fish' is a film about telling stories. How much of it is true (according to Ed Bloom senior) is an entirely different story altogether. Let's just assume the film is set in a world and time when these fantastical things do happen. It is still up to Will to make up his own mind.Ultimately, this is a love story, with Ed Bloom telling the story of how he met is wife, and the lengths he went through to be with her. (The things men would do for a girl, I thought rolling my eyes and shaking my head...)'Big Fish' does have a heartfelt ending, but was it interesting enough (for me) despite all the magical elements and great visuals? Well, I know for a fact I'm going to offend many fans by saying 'no'. But alas, I just didn't find it interesting enough.'Big Fish' deserves to be seen though. From great visuals to costumes and production design, this is a very good production in its entirety and I complement Tim Burton on a job well done. It's just not entirely my thing...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton's most touching movie,"After the quite disappointing Planet of the Apes remake, Tim Burton returned to form with Big Fish, a strongly underrated gem which is one of the best pictures of 2003, along with The Return of the King, Lost in Translation and Mystic River. It's the most heartbreaking, poetic and romantic movie he's made since Edward Scissorhands, and it's a shame it didn't get the recognition it deserved.At the movie's center is the relationship between the dying Edward Bloom (Albert Finney, excellent) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) who wants to find out the truth about his dad: for several years, Edward has told some amazing stories concerning his life, and Will is the only one who has stopped believing them. Now, he wants to know what really happened.That's when the film properly kicks off, as we're shown young Edward's (Ewan Mcgregor, absolutely comfortable in the role) life exactly as he has described it, alternating facts and, for most of the story, fiction. Expect giants, witches, werewolves, a hidden town (appropriately called Spectre), a Fellini-inspired circus, fish which look like naked women and lots more. This is Burton as we like him: bizarre, unpredictable, hard to summarize. You have to see the movie to truly understand why people love it.Still, behind the adventurous and romantic facades lies great human tragedy. Big Fish will make you laugh, but by the time the end credits start rolling you will most probably have tears in your face. Life can be funny for a second, and very sad right after wards. Never has a Burton film been so dramatic.As I said, this is a wonderful film, yet sadly it was heavily overlooked (it received only one Oscar nom, for Danny Elfman's gripping score). Watching it is a marvelous experience.One scene is worth the entire viewing: Edward sees his future wife for the first time. According to some people, time stops in that moment. Burton makes it happen on screen. That one sequence is pure movie magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
GREAT but not up to par with other Burton films in my opinion...,"In Big Fish, Tim Burton deals with actors more than he has in any other movie.  There is more dialogue between actors, and there is also a voiceover, placing more emphasis on human beings than Tim Burton's imaginative creations that we've seen in his other films. That being said, Burton fans will not be hugely disappointed.  Burton's imagination does indeed color this movie to make it even better than Daniel August's novel.  He makes a giant look like the size he is in the story (unlike Lord of the Rings' failure to make the hobbits look small enough at times) and employs stunning cinematography (that's more the director of photography but obviously Burton was working closely with him).  The freaky living beings and odd situations common to this film as well, giants and circuses and siamese twins and a land like eden with delicious apple pie. Where in other Burton films the dialogue seems unresolved and out of nowhere at times, this time when that happens it makes sense because the movie is just myths and the story of people trying to make sense of the myths. Danny Elfman wrote another wonderful score, the movie has a great feel, and impeccable acting (Ewan Macgregor, Helena Bonhman Carter, Jessica Lange, Steve Buscemi, and Albert Finney all did wonderful jobs) Unlike other Burton movies, this one is not gothic or pulp at all.  It's brighter, but it maintains the signature Burton darkness, and it's a good family movie.  Like some Burton movies, it's also a bit moralistic, which is not always my personal preference. But I definitely recommend this one to everyone.  Check it out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly terrible movie.,"""Big Fish"" has for reasons beyond me been hailed as a modern classic by many a viewer. The story is about an insane, self-centered chronic, liar (played by Albert Finney), who tells the story of his life to his neglected son (Billy Crudup). Of course the father lies about his life and comes up with a lot of stupid tales about himself as young (Ewan McGregor).What I don't get about this movie is how people can like a person as reprehensible as Ed Bloom. Not only is he an arrogant S.O.B. who can't talk about anything but himself, he was also a bad father and probably also a bad husband, which is somewhat implied by Jessica Lange's restrained and depressing performance. Also, Ed Bloom seems to get sad every time someone tells him that he's not funny and tries to make him act sane for at least one time in his life. Wait scratch that, first he's sad and then he tells another story. I found it impossible not to hate him. Which is strange because everyone in the movie loves him, and I have no idea why. The only scene I really enjoyed was when he got beaten up.Some things aren't awful though. The sets and Alison Lohman look great and... Well that was about it. Otherwise this is just two hours of pure horse-manure.I could ramble on about all the pointless, sugarcoated, sentimental crap that this movie is stuffed with, but honestly I just want to erase it from my mind.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Tim Burton's career equivalent of ""Forrest Gump"" is an ultimately rewarding adult fable with some beautiful cinematography and memorable ideas...","It was either ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" ""The Haunted Mansion"" or this. I didn't exactly feel like watching my favorite comedian run around with a horde of little kids cracking bad poopy jokes behind them, and I didn't want to see Eddie Murphy do this either (it was bad enough in last year's ""Daddy Day Care""), so I chose to see the more adult-oriented of these three films, and I'm glad I did, because Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a marvelous film--full of wit and imagination and eerie vibes that sometimes don't fit into Burton's films the way he wants them to--but actually have a purpose here.""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" is simply one of the best films of all time, and you can quote me on that. That was Burton's breakthrough--then came ""Batman,"" which was very good but slightly lacking in substance, and then came ""Edward Scissorhands""--one of my sister's favorite films, a beautiful love story and an eerie fable...but just missing a very small ingredient that kept it from becoming a great movie (perhaps the same with his film ""Ed Wood""--a very good film, but not exactly one of my all-time favorites).I have my doubts as to whether anyone other than Tim Burton could have pulled off ""Big Fish."" Here's a movie I expected I would dislike and come away feeling a little bit empty--but that's only partially true. The movie doesn't quite exceed on the level it tries to, but as a film, it's one of the best motion pictures of the year.It stars Albert Finney as Edward Bloom, an old man who loves to exaggerate tales of his past and pass these on to his friends and family. One night his son, William (Billy Crudup), tires of hearing the story about how he caught the town's largest fish in a lake using a gold ring--so he ignores his father for three whole years, until his mother (Jessica Lange) informs Will that his father is dying of cancer, and that he wishes to speak with his son one last time.Drawn back to his old Alabama hometown with his new wife, Will finally learns the truth about these so-called ""exaggerated"" stories--and we, as the audience, get to see them in flashback mode. It begins with a young Edward (Ewan McGregor), a ""big fish"" who was just too small for his own town and had to move away to search for brighter prospects. On his journey he comes across an assortment of odd fellows, including a ""Gentle Giant,"" a failed poet living in a heavenly town named Spectre, and a strange circus ringleader who also happens to be a werewolf.All of these stories that Edward Senior tells his family relate to their current positions, and to call the film simply beautiful would be what John Candy once said is ""the understatement of the year."" My particular favorite character was the poet living in Spectre, played by Steve Buscemi (a wonderful supporting actor), who I had no idea played any role in this film prior to viewing the opening credits and seeing ""with Steve Buscemi"" appear on screen.Buscemi's poet has been working on a particular poem for twelve years whilst living in Spectre. ""Can I see it?"" asks Edward. It says, ""Roses are red, violets are blue, I love Spectre."" ""But it's only three lines long!"" says Edward. ""That's the reason you don't show your work to people,"" Buscemi says.Danny DeVito also appears as the circus ringleader, and the most regretful scene in the film is that in which we see him naked from behind. I shudder at the thought. But, for what it's worth, DeVito's second re-teaming with Burton is magnificent--he's a supporting character, but the film certainly benefits from his performance.Like all of Burton's films, ""Big Fish"" teeters on the edge of greatness, but it never quite crosses the line. This is a marvelous film, full of warmth, kind-hearted fables and beautiful cinematography, and it's one of the best films of the year. It's certainly a unique film experience unlike any you've ever had before. Unless, of course, you've seen ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Ed Wood."" Then some of it may look a bit familiar.Still, I enjoyed it more than ""The Lord of the Rings."" And I could actually relate to this film.Trivia note: ""Edward Scissorhands"" was a Tim Burton film. The main character of this film is named Edward. Sometimes when people pronounce his name with their thick Alabama accents it comes across as ""Ed Wood."" Mere coincidence or something more? We may never find out.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Sweet, imaginative and moving","I will admit I like Tim Burton, and have enjoyed a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands, Beetle Juice, Batman and Ed Wood. Big Fish is I think one of Burton's better movies in my personal opinion, maybe not his very best, but it is a very sweet, imaginative and moving film. Here Burton delves into familiar territory, a strange place between reality and fantasy, dream and nightmare. The story is really sweet, and while slow at times, does have a poignant ending. The visuals as pretty much always in a Tim Burton film are gorgeous, not Gothic here like in Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands but evergreen and picturesque. The scenery was beautiful and so was the cinematography, and Danny Elfman's score is stunning. His score for Edward Scissorhands blew me away, but the lyrical, sensitive and hypnotic themes used here make it a score that is truly special. The screenplay is well crafted, and has a bittersweet feel to it. Sentimental yes, but also bittersweet. The acting is remarkably good, with Ewan McGregor making for a handsome yet somewhat charming young Edward Bloom, and the wonderful Albert Finney a revelation as his older self. Billy Crudup is excellent as the son who is intent on exposing his father, and sets out to learn the truth, and Danny DeVito is great as the shape-changing circus ringmaster. Jessica Lange is beautiful and alluring as Sandra and Helena Bonham Carter is almost unrecognisable as the Witch. Then there is Alison Lohman, Marion Cottilard, Robert Guillaume and Matthew McGory(as Karl the Giant) and they are very good as well. Overall, I loved this film, it is moving and very imaginative. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It just doesn't live up to the hype.,"I had heard nothing but glowing praise for this movie, but I found it to be only slightly entertaining.  After reading through some of the other IMDB comments, I'm relieved to see that I'm not the only one who thought so.The exaggerated stories and special effects did little for me.  Even the ending was somewhat predictable.  A good cast was put together to make the movie, but there wasn't any outstanding acting.  I don't think there was enough of a story line or truly memorable characters for anyone to stand out.I did like much of the soundtrack, which of course contains lots of hit songs from the 50s and 60s, like so many other movies I've seen before.There's really nothing special about this movie.

Beautiful and Unexpected,"As a lifelong Burton fan, I approached this film with high hopes, and no trepidation whatsoever. Honestly, I have never met a Tim Burton film I haven't liked for one reason or another, but Big Fish is only the second to make me cry (Edward Scissorhands being the first). I was expecting a deep storyline, wonderful cast of characters, and little confusion from time to time, but I got so much more than these things. We have all had a ""big fish"", it's the one that grows and grows until it takes on a life of it's own, before long you don't need to tell the story anymore, because that fish is just one step ahead of you. Bloom didn't lie, he told his own version of the truth, a heartwarming, romantic, and enthralling truth. The cast was nothing short of stellar (especially Billy Crudup making one of his rather rare on-screen appearances). The characters made Big Fish what it is, each and every one influencing the progression of an incredible story you can only hope holds some truth. The elements of love, friendship, and family are embedded in the symbolism and dialogue. The visuals are captivating and awe inspiring. No one does it like Tim Burton, and Burton will struggle to ever create a film to match this...I would (and do) recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Boring, and half the time, unwatchable","There are too many problems with the film.  First, Albert Finney with Jessica Lange?  Give me a break.  That's as bad as the current Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton matchup.  No it's worse.  Albert Finney has always been as unattractive as a curmudgeon, and the years haven't changed that.  I thought his character was obnoxious, whether played by him or Ewan McGregor. I could care less about him.While this movie has a few neat visuals and strong performances, (who are the Siamese Twins?) and great work by Danny Devito and Robert Guillaume. They were all wonderful.  Here's to Billy Crudup too.The story was so boring, and the main character so uninteresting, and suffering through seeing Albert Finney's mug all over Jessica's, yuck. Can't Hollywood make appropriate matches?  It's so unappealing to me.  I'm am very disappointed in this film.  I won't see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
sentimental bullhockey,"Tim Burton has made a number of films I really like (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure), but this is not one of them.  The son trying to figure out his father is a wholly unlikable character.  If I were his dad, I'd disown him.  Like everyone else in the picture, he is successful, very clean cut, and middle class.  In fact, these words can be used to describe the film in its entirety, and I don't mean that as a compliment.It's possible that the Burton films I like were carried by quirky actors like Johnny Depp and the young Winona Ryder.  As good as he was in Trainspotting, Ewan McGregor has become a dull, middle of the road, mediocre actor.  His role in the midst of these extended fantasy sequences is too bright-eyed, too naive to be at all involving or interesting.  The only reason I was able to sit through this entire picture was the presence of Steve Buscemi, in a relatively small role.How a film is able to involve a lot of carny sequences and remain pure as the driven snow is beyond me, but I think the more important question is WHY would a director do this?  Tim Burton's film has a very Disney-fied quality to it, everything is squeaky-clean sweetness and love once initial misunderstandings are overcome.  There is not nearly enough humor in this film to make it worthwhile.  Burton's wide-eyed fantasy world has become unbearably boring.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very sweet, imaginative story despite lacking a strong conclusion","Will Bloom feels like he doesn't really know his father - his habit of telling exaggerated and untrue stories instead of the truth.  They don't speak for several years until Will hears that Ed is on his deathbed and returns home.  He hopes to find out the truth behind the stories but can only get more of the same without doing some digging.Even having watched the trailer I was unsure exactly what this film was about, but I trusted that Burton's imagination would carry it.  Having seen it, the film can best be described as being about story telling in that the film is more about the wonder of the stories told than the actual narrative in terms of start/middle/end.  In terms of the traditional idea of narrative, the film is not perfect - it is not as meaningful or as satisfying as I would have hoped, and this is shown in an ending that, although sweet, is not as neat as I would have hoped.  However the telling - that's where it is at.The stories told are wonderfully whimsical and amusing, like the film states the stories have elements of truth but also be coloured by Bloom to add life to them.  For me, it was very simple to get involved in the tall tales and I was held in the spell of Ed's stories easily - even thought it never came to a `real' solution I was still captivated by just how sweet and imaginative it all was.  If it sounds like I'm having trouble putting my words together it is because I found the film quite hard to quantify - all I know is that I found the whole experience to be very sweet and enjoyable despite it not really amounting to much in the grand scheme of things.  In this regard the film is a consistently imaginative fantasy film that is gently humorous and outright funny at times.The cast are pretty good.  I was originally a little put off by McGregor's Alabama accent and it took me a minute to get past it, but other that his performance was very good and he helped create the film's mood of wonder and whimsy.  I think both McGregor and Finney needed to have that sort of accent - I don't know why but it is a storyteller's accent and it does help the material.  Finney is good and manages to keep the spirit of McGregor's character going despite not being surrounded by the images to support him. The support cast works well whether they be tall giants or well-known cameos from Buscemi, Carter and Devito.  Lange, Crudup and Cotillard are all good but it is easily McGregor and Finney's film.Overall some will find the lack of structure and real substance to be a problem - after all, this is a film about tall tales and not everyone will be able to enjoy that.  However this is a wonderfully light and fun bit of whimsy that is a lot better than I expected it to be.  While it may not amount to a great deal more than that, it can still be enjoyed for what it is - a great fun story!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Uneccessary but well-done,"I don't really think this movie was necessary, I think it was just a spur of the moment thing. It just seemed like a generally pointless storyline but in the end, it was well compiled into a story as big as life itself. It's a classic film, don't get me wrong just not one of those memorable classics. But I hope you get what I'm saying. This movie just didn't seem necessary and they could've come up with a more complicated storyline. It didn't feel urgent and it wasn't out to stress a point but that's what you need in films like these. Sure, maybe it had a main idea or two but there were more than two ideas scattered throughout the story, which made it not stick, not stand on a basis for an important movie structures. However, I did give this movie a ten because once again it reminds us of life and that's always welcome in movies. shows, or whatever because we can all relate to it. Everyone has a life and everyone has stories to share. Sure, this is a fictitious story but it really captures the intensity and mystery of life, which reigns above all in any movie. Big Fish was so very well done but it was not urgent and it didn't fit in as well as it could and I know that's the case with a lot of movies but I think Big Fish really could've used a main, thorough, substantial idea.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Burton Makes A Nice, Light Film","This ""fish tale"" is generally a nice story about a father who tells tall tales for years to everyone and has a son who has resented those stories, thinking his father was nothing but hot air.The big pluses for this film were the colorful scenes and the fact that is was simply a nice story. Since this is a Tim Burton film, it's no surprise that the visuals are so entertaining but it is a surprise that the story isn't a dark one. I guess that disappointed a lot of his fans but thought it was a Irefreshing change of pace from him, and I appreciated his effort here. It's the kind of movie many folks wish they made more of today.The fun parts of the film are not the beginning or ending but the middle in which the dad's stories are brought to life. There are some strange and fun characters. The story is a bit too much New Age/reincarnation mumbo-jumbo but the whole thing is so bizarre that you can't take anything seriously....except the father-and-son relationship, of course, which is meaningful. That may be a bit heavy but almost all the film is a lighthearted fantasy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doesn't hold up,"I remember this film fondly as a kid, it was so mystical and wonderful. I watched it recently and honestly, it's kind of a nothing movie.

Social Commentary in Big Fish,"On first viewing of Burton's Big Fish I was easily dazzled by the wonderful visionary effects and heartwarming story. I immediately loved the film not only for these reasons but also because I felt there was something deeper being touched on in the film though I didn't quite grasp it all at first viewing. Since I have watched it several times more and clearly seen the social commentary the film makes.Culture today is moving into a period called post-modernism, which has many aspects to it, but chiefly the movement from modern logical thought to something beyond. Shown mostly in the younger generations, post-modernism has turned away from science and logic. The way to reach a young person these days is not by lecturing facts, but through stories and experience. This film explores this cultural shift brilliantly, whether it really intended to or not.The film continually keeps you guessing as to what parts of Ed's stories are real and what aren't, but that's not the point. The point is that regardless of how much the stories are true (or make logical sense), they are who the man is. Indeed logic even has no place in them, shown by multiple absurdities and illogical time sequences with the witch. Edward is the character representation of post-modernism, with his son William representing the modern world and it's lack of understanding of post-modernism.I would elaborate more but the film is so rich in scenes and characters that display different aspects of this point that to do so would require a more in depth study than can be given here. So look for it in the movie yourself if you know anything about this cultural change.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big Fishappointment...,"I think this is the biggest disappointment of the year for me. So many of the pieces of this puzzle are exquisite... they just don't all fit together. Burton's weirdness always seems to be at odds with the storyteller that is necessary to pull it off. Finney and Lange (who is almost unbelievably radiant these years... see Titus, see Normal) are excellent as usual. But in the end, the pacing and narrative flaws sabotage what is one of the most beautifully art-directed movies of the year. Sad but true.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It has no idea what it wants to be,"I have to start this by saying that Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors. I like his skewed point of view, his Edward Gorey-ish surrealism, his way he will show the not merely odd in his films but also the unpleasant, the ugly, and the weirdly bizarre, and show them in a lovable, accepting manner that makes them sometimes hauntingly fascinating. Instead of that ""train wreck you can't look away from"" feeling, Burton always leaves you with a voyeuristic sense that makes you want to watch his films more than once, to see the things you missed the first time. Instead of hammering away at the viewer with the weirdness of the characters, Burton lets the personalities speak for themselves; and perhaps this works because his characters have always been inherently likeable.Not so this time with his latest effort, Big Fish.To tell this nested set of stories, Burton assembled a cast that is top notch: Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, Albert Finney as the elderly Edward Bloom, Jessica Lange as Bloom's wife Sandra, Billy Crudup as their son William Bloom; with a host of minor roles filled by such notable performers as Robert Guillaume, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, and Steve Buscemi.  He even includes folksinger Louden Wainwright III in a not-so-invisible role, for what reason I cannot imagine, and insists on spelling his name incorrectly throughout the entire film's opening AND closing credits. This puzzled me a great deal.In fact, I was puzzled many times throughout the film, but mostly after, when I should have been nodding and smiling, and not wanting to wait until it came out on DVD; instead, I was itching to leave the theater as soon as possible, and sat there with a distinct frown on my face when it finally ended.Very /few/ films have made me feel as if I wanted to leave. No matter how bad a film is, I rarely walk out on it. Maybe that was the problem with Big Fish; it really isn't BAD. It's pretty. But it's also hollow. You keep watching, and watching and watching, hoping that it will eventually turn into the film you think it should be, then it ends and you realize it never will.Basically, the story line is simple enough. Edward Bloom is a storyteller. He tells stories about his own life, and adventures, and entertains for decades with these fantastical tales--first his friends, then his wife, then his own son, William. But as William grows up, he becomes irritated with, then angry about, these ""lies"" that he was told. He wants to know the ""real"" father--the one that he can't see for all the stories that he feels act as a smokescreen. Yet, he cannot get any closer to the truth, so he falls away from his father emotionally, until his mother phones him to tell him that his father is now dying.So William packs his suitcase and pregnant wife and moves back home to help sort out the end of his father's life. Immediately, he is faced with the same stories, the same lies, the same fantastic tales of his father's adventures, and cruelly and selfishly cuts the old man off time after time. He refuses to accept either the stories, OR the magic they contain, and most of all, the fact that they are very entertaining stories. But he is forced to remember the stories, as his father relates them to William's wife, who seems to be entranced by them, and him.As the stories get told, we are 'treated' to them. ALL OF THEM. These are not SHORT stories. These stories are long, they are convoluted, they have many moments that make you want to question Edward as he tells them, and they contain many many MANY dead ends that lead---and this is the really frustrating part---nowhere at all. And they go on and ON.For example, take the story about his walk down the ""haunted road."" Edward ploughs his way through mists, and trees that grab him (literally) and strange sounds and (ick and double ick!!) a HUGE nest of large black jumping spiders (!!) and a town that shouldn't even exist, and these things get barely a mention at all (except for the town.) The entire time, the voice-over is yammering on and on about perseverance. About ANOTHER story that was told earlier. About NOTHING. After several dozen of these sorts of scenes, you are left with a feeling that you are missing the point--if you knew where to look, maybe it would pop out at you. But it never  does. Because it isn't there. You are constantly trying to reconcile what you are seeing with what you are hearing.In fact, if you removed the soundtrack and voicetrack from this film entirely, and just WATCHED it, you'd be so puzzled you wouldn't be able to make sense of the plot--but what you /would/ have was an entirely different impression of what was really happening!  This feeling of being pulled in two different directions is not only unsettling, it's highly irritating.The film has two major flaws in addition to this.  First, it is about the South--to be precise, Alabama.  There is an ingrained ""southernness"" about the movie that needs to be there, because there are several references in it that would only make sense in the Southern U.S.  Yet, Burton uses three British actors, one from New Jersey, and a New Yorker, and only ONE person has even a HINT of an Alabamian accent. He doesn't go so far as to allow his Brits to speak with their normal accents, but they don't do ""Suth'n"" either. And neither Albert Finney NOR Danny DeVito speak in consistent accents. Devito wavers from exaggerated hillbilly to his usual ""Noo Joisey"" intonation, and Finney can't decide where he's from. This smacked of really shoddy dialogue coaching, and did nothing for the continuity.Second, the film is FAR FAR TOO LONG. It needs a good edit. The pace is snaillike, the acting sometimes seems improvised and directionless. And it just has no idea what it's supposed to be ABOUT most of the time.There are many little oddities all through the film: a street shown briefly in one scene mirrors one seen in Edward Scissorhands; The 'martial arts' in the Chinese army scene is idiotically choreographed; the ""twins"" seem to change size in their various scenes, as does the giant. The ""banjo man"" on the porch in Spectre is not only playing the song from ""Deliverance,"" he IS the young man who played the banjo in ""Deliverance!"" And why Louden Wainwright? Did Burton owe him a favor? He's no actor. He sticks out like a sore thumb among those who ARE actors.There are things that make /no/ sense, visually OR plot-wise. Why does the kid steal shoes? Who, or what, is that naked ""fish woman?"" How can so many barefoot people dancing on grass make so much noise? What's up with the bits about Edward's need for water--about feeling ""dry""? (He soaks in a tub, fully clothed!) Even some of the camera angles are downright awkward--as if an amateur camera operator had been given free rein to be as ""arty"" as he wanted to be.And probably the weirdest one of all: Tim Burton has made another movie about someone named Edward.None of these little items, or the other dozens of such things, are explained or illuminated in the film, especially not at the end, when one might expect them to become clear, or at least say why they cannot be clear. They are simply /there/. And they build irritation throughout the course of this very long film, and the pacing is slow, slow, slow. Never have I felt so much like getting up and leaving a film, just to take a break from it all.This film isn't a fantasy. It's not an allegory. It's not a drama. It's not a comedy. It's not even a decent Tim Burton film! The characters aren't all that likeable or believable; if Jessica Lange had ducked and nodded and smiled ONE MORE TIME in that film, I'd have thrown a tomato at the screen. And NO ONE--I repeat NO ONE--should have to see Danny Devito NAKED, OR repeatedly watch Albert Finney slurping.I really wanted to like this film. From the previews, it looked like an entirely different film than the one I saw. It looked lighter, more magical, more surreal. Instead, it was a hodge-podge of bad writing, uncertain goals, unexplained events and senseless details. It just didn't gel.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Tim Burton's ""Forrest Gump""--And Every Bit As Endearing","I've now seen ""Big Fish"" twice in my lifetime. At the end of both viewings, it elicited tears of emotion like only a select few films can. While Robert Zemeckis set the template for the ""one man's incredible life experiences"" genre, Tim Burton matches him blow for emotional blow here.For a very basic overview ""Big Fish"" sees Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) called to the bedside of his ailing father Edward (Albert Finney). Both parties are estranged from each other, what with the more reserved son resenting the seemingly tall tales and often overbearing nature of the gregarious father. With Will looking for a morsel of truth and Ed wanting one final opportunity to spin his tales, the film largely turns back to the clock to Ed's younger days (played by Ewan McGregor), in which truth is inextricable from fiction--in the best possible ways.This being a Tim Burton movie, trying to explain it in words is a bit of a futile effort. In many ways, it might be the epitome of a ""Burton joint""--it is rife with his flare for cinematography craziness, it contains many of his usual actors (like Danny Devito & Helena Bonham Carter), and the themes/plots present are extraordinarily outlandish (some might say ridiculous).But unlike some of Burton's other works, ""Big Fish"" doesn't lose sight of the forest for the trees. In other words, it manages to tell a coherent story full of expertly crafted characters. As previously mentioned, it is also one of the most emotional movies one could ever watch (especially as it relates to father/son dynamics). As long as you can get past some of the wackier antics, ""Big Fish"" will move your very soul.Overall, ""Big Fish"" is a movie that must be seen in order to fully be understood. It melds the best of Burton's unique cinematic visions/tropes with a legendary-in-quality screenplay from John August (based on a novel by Daniel Wallace). The combination of storytelling, emotion, characters, cinematography, and even humor is almost unmatched. If you enjoyed ""Forrest Gump"", this will almost surely be another favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton crafts another masterpiece.,"An utterly fantastic journey from start to finish. Every second of it brings a complete smile to my face. There is a quote from the film that is something like ""Sometimes things can be so strange, yet seem so familiar."" That directly applies to this entire film. It is filled with events that are so strange and magically bizarre, but everything feels so close to home. It was just two hours of what I felt was the best day of my entire life. Of course, coming from Tim Burton, the visuals and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. All of the surreal happenings are just breathtakingly beautiful. The set designs are possibly the best I've ever seen. The performances are all phenomenal, as expected from such a superb cast. Helena Bonham Carter is absolutely exceptional, and Albert Finney makes me feel some of the most strong sympathy I've ever felt. Billy Crudup does the same. Alison Lohman is just gorgeous. Her beauty radiates across the screen and makes it very easy to believe why Edward Bloom would fall so madly in love with her. Ewan is as charismatic as ever, creating one of the most likable characters I've ever seen. It's a fascinating film full of greatness from a standard suburbia to a Utopian commune to a roaring circus and all the way across seas to the war.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Like Tim Burton...,"Have you seen when something's magical? But I'm not talking of the magic magicians do, I mean when something is so incredible that it completes you inside; therefore it's magical. I'm talking about the unavoidable feeling when watching ""Finding Neverland"" and about the obliged feeling when watching any Tim Burton movie. All of the magical things we live in life, one way or another, Burton has expressed them in images throughout his career...In movies.That I have seen a big part of Burton's films and that until today I have only written about ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" is beyond me; but I'll try to make it up talking a little bit about his, undoubtedly, best film. By far the most underrated movie of 2003, ""Big Fish"" is a journey of the imagination to its greatest extreme; the vision of life in the eyes of a man who couldn't seem more ordinary.This man is Edward Bloom, and I would like to see life the way he does: ill and about to die, and telling his son Will (Billy Crudup) the true story of his existence, in an attempt to reconcile their differences. The thing is that Will ha always questioned his father's 'distortion' of the truth he has had to deal with all his life; and maybe this last story of Edward has the same little amount of truth as the others...Or maybe it is the whole truth.""I tell stories"", the father simply declares to his son. It's a fact that everyone who likes listening to stories (and even the ones who don't) likes people to tell them with a little bit of seasoning; as you'll see Edward does. And that's also Tim Burton's main characteristic as a director; to give something extra to all of his films, which becomes a completely personal touch.So it is like if Daniel Wallace had written his novel knowing that John August would adapt it creating a marvelous script that Tim Burton would later turn into this excellent film. With the images of Phillipe Rousselot's photography, the filmmaker lets his imagination loose, letting us see that he has pretty much in common with the main character of the story.The movie is, of course, coherent as a whole; but it's nice to say that it is a collection of beautiful scenes that don't cease to amaze us for a minute. One scene is particularly spectacular, for any cinema lover as for a lover of love itself. Edward is narrating the day he met his wife. ""The say that when you meet the love of your life, time stops"". Burton literally freezes the whole image, allowing the movement of the main character only, who takes some 'frozen' popcorn in the air out of the way, to get to the woman he's looking for. Instantly, everything's moving again and the scene reaches its end in a funny way you must appreciate.That scene is pure cinematographic art, the magic I'm talking about: flawless. Actually there are not many flaws in ""Big Fish"", with Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney portraying the young and old Edward, respectively; both in a way so moving that it's difficult to differentiate them. Starting from Billy Crudup, the rest of the cast is perfect: inspired Danny DeVito, big presence from Matthew McGrory and Steve Buscemi playing a role that couldn't have been for another person.Burton knows which actors to choose, and which actresses. Jessica Lange shines unstoppably in her role of the faithful and loyal wife; Alison Lohnman (a promising young actress) gives interest to a part that doesn't seem to have it, and the always mystical Helena Bonham Carter doesn't do more than stealing the show. Danny Elfman's score also steals the show but it's really one more character, as in any Burton film (if you haven't seen ""Edward Scissorhands"", give yourself a chance: it's a great movie, but the music...).In conclusion, ""Big Fish"" is no more than the piece where all the things Burton has worked on come together. That fantastic atmosphere of each film is present in this film with a lot more characters: here we find, at least bits, of a Jack, an Ed Wood, a headless horseman and even the other Edward; scissorhands. Coming to think of it, I would like to see life not so much like Edward Bloom, but maybe like Tim Burton.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ranges from fantastical to dull,"Heartwarming tale that starts off rather awkwardly, but slowly picks up steam until the fantastic finale, which is executed very well and is surprisingly emotional. The frame tale of the father-son relationship is pretty weak, and slows the film down for much of it - partly due to Crudup's annoying character - but manages to evoke a sentimental reaction by the end. The fantasy elements of the tale range from innovative (the town) to dull (the romance), but all have Burton's signature touch. McGregor and Finney really carried the film, it's too bad that a large portion of it has to be focused on Crudup. Among the females, only Bonham Carter is memorable, as she is quite good in her dual role. There's some good supporting work from DeVito and Buscemi, and the visuals are frequently fantastic. A bit of a letdown, but still a good flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton's view on Burton,"Each director has his movie that would sum up as his experimental catharsis. Woody Allen and Charlie Kauffman write every single script with this allegory. With ""Big Fish"", there is nothing great and difficult to understand, because it is done with a great magical, simple sense that entangles multiple interpretations: it beholds on the viewer to know what he/she will grab of the story.Many saw the form of creating a legacy. Of how a man is nothing more than his interior world, thus being the Big Fish the Big Story. Doesn't really matter whether it's true or not. Others see how to view the world and put on the charge on the warmed-heart direction. It has a panoply on light colors and cozy art direction, of likable actors and fantasy characters.All of this views are excellent. But what I see is Burton's most personal film. Yes, of course. But he admits and perseveres that he is a conflicted artist and his salvation relies on creating lies, stories that don't exist. He is a filmmaker, he lives by creating stories. Ed Bloom is Burton's hero, his unsuppressed self. All what he created, every inch of lies and fantasy he garnishes into his story, it's just a derivation of his interior oasis (may that be good or bad) and all of this movie is an intimate approach to his mind and heart. Burton is every character in the story, waiting to be heard in his most pure and dire form.""Big Fish"" is Tim Burton view on Tim Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Fish Flounders Without The Hook,"When I heard that director Tim Burton (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow) directed this tale, I assumed that an extraordinary saga would unfold on the screen as something unnatural and weird, yet entertaining.  Weird it was, yet it often failed to convey a story.  Rather it made some attempts at reconciling Edward Bloom's (Albert Finney as the dying old Bloom and Ewan McGregor as young Bloom) tall yarns he would tell repeatedly to anyone who would listen and especially to his son Will Bloom (Billy Crudup).  Will soon learned to disbelieve all of his father's fantastic stories and ultimately became totally estranged from his father, whether as a result of shame or the lack of intimacy and connection with his father.  His mother, the ever-smiling Sandy Bloom (Jessica Lange), lends little of her stellar talents to this wooden role.The fables as they unfold are truly implausible and often border on the ridiculous.  Clearly, one is left with the same mindset as the son Will, that Edward is a huge bulls***ter who may have trouble separating fact from fantasy.  The story or stories are told in confusing flashbacks, sometimes in a true Tim Burton fantasy and sometimes in what appears to be a vaudeville style.  The characters are indeed colorful and weird such as the ringmaster of the Circus Amos (Danny DeVito) and the Colossus (George McArthur).  It borrows heavily in fantasy style from other recent fantasies like the Truman Show, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, yet does not come close to telling a story with clarity and style.The film jumps from clarity to confusion and back to rationality and clarity.  We are touched that the son ultimately appears at his dying father's bedside and attempts to find out who his father really is.  There are many seeing the picture who will be quite taken by its symbolism, fantasy, and fatherly machinations.  For myself, this film could have been written in a much more coherent manner and revealing much, much more of the possible intimacy that can exist between father and son.  The comedic routines are quite funny and Burton seems to have the timing down quite well.  However, its humorous sequences are not enough to carry the film or to carry the story from scene-to-scene.The ending is predictable early in the film and clichéd at best.  Helena Bonham Carter's talents are wasted as Jenny, the child becoming adult who had her eyes on Edward since he was a young man.  She also plays a more interesting role as a witch in this flick, but it also falls flat and gets placed on the shelf with the rest of the cast that have not been adequately developed.  This is a picture that you will either love or simple discard as too much weirdness and lacking coherence.  Obviously, you know where I stand.Opens everywhere December 25th in the Bay Area.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Unique Delight,"I haven't been this drawn to a film since I saw Edward Scissorhands in the theater. When the movie was over I was completely ready to go back to the ticket booth and buy myself another ticket for the next show. I would have if I had enough money to but $8.50/film is pretty steep. Tim Burton is nothing less than a genius. He is my favorite director ever and after viewing this film it made me realize all over again why I love his work so much. He has the ability to create such a fantastical world that you almost wish you could have been part of that magic. And Danny Elfman did an incredible job composing the music. He is a modern day musical genius. Him and Tim Burton make the best team in the history of cinema (in my opinion).I can't believe this film was nominated for only one Academy Award. Blasphemous! It should have been at LEAST be nominated for 5! At LEAST! Best picture, best cinematography, best direction, best actor, and still including Best Musical Composition. Although I do have to admit Danny Elfman should have won a long time ago for Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas, but the Oscars don't seem to actually care about talent. Anyways...aside from that...This film is truly wonderful and delightful and amazing and I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend watching it! EsPECIALLY on the big screen! I, of course, gave it a 10/10 but would much rather give it an 11 because it's off the charts. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One crazy story after another,"Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) tells the same fish story throughout his son Will (Billy Crudup)'s life of catching a fish with his wedding ring. They stop talking to each other and they only connect through Will's mother Sandra (Jessica Lange). Ed is sick and Will goes home to see him. Will retells his father's stories. As a kid, Ed encounters the witch (Helena Bonham Carter). He (Ewan McGregor) is heroic as a teen and then he confronts a giant. He convinces Karl the giant to join him to leave town. He takes a detour and ends up in the hidden town of Spectre. Later, Ed meets Sandra (Alison Lohman) at the Calloway Circus.I like the weird Tim Burton style. The movie falls into a bit of a rut as one outlandish situation takes over from another. I need the stories to be connected more with the real part of the movie.

Burton reaches a new low,"A really unfortunate waste of a film, chock full of contrived, manipulative, false-sentimentality that would almost, but not quite, make Spielberg blush. Okay, that sounds a bit harsh, but this is bland, un-affecting Hollywood tripe. Burton doesn't insult his audience's emotional intelligence to the Spielbergian degree, but nor does he inspire us the way he once did my sharing his unique vision. This film has the emotional subtlety of a jack-hammer and it contains none of the imaginative wonder of 'Beetlejuice' or 'A Nightmare Before Chritmas.' Sadly, this is what Hollywood/Middle Age can do to a former bright light. The kind of movie that guy from 'Good Morning America' would call 'loads of fun' in one of his lobotomized reviews. Skip it.

A Story that you never going to forget,"And i say it for my own experience, because i see this movie i watched this movie more than two years ago, and in spite of that i can write this commentary without problem, i never going to forget ""Big Fish""Tim Burton surprise in each movie that he makes, sometimes for good (""Bettlejuice"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Edward Scissorhands"" and i hope that he do it again with the dark Sondheim's musical adaptation ""Sweeney Todd""), sometimes for bad (""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Sleepy Hollow""). And without doubt of it and happy i can say that ""Big Fish"" is, not only the best movie that he ever made, is too one of the best movies that i have ever seen and it probably (No matters if I'm going to a topic that is so discussed) one of the best movies ever made.The story of ""Big Fish"", which was based it in the novel by Daniel Wallace, talk us about Will, who has lost affection for his father. One day, he receives a phone call from his family... his father is dying. He remembers then what was the cause of that lose of affection: Will hates when his father entertains all telling them all the stories of his youth. All of that stories are fantastic ones. Will hates it. When he was a kid he loves it. But now he hates it. When Will go to home again to take care to his father... he don't know that he is going to live the most big adventure of his life.Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a real nostalgic experience in a beautiful way (Few movies that i have ever seen, in spite that i have not seen much, makes that feeling on you, like ""Smultronstället"" by Ingmar Bergman, ""Meet me in St. Louis"" by Vincente Minelli, ""City Lights"" by Chaplin and ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" by magistral director Jean-Pierre Jeunet), makes it cares in the REAL facts that makes so important life. I talk about your father, your mother, your sister, your brother, your family, your family or the people who loves and you love too. ""Big Fish"" is too a kind of time machine that returns us to that paradise of our childhood that much times we reject as adults. And in spite of that you'll be and adult, you can enjoy all that fantasy, all that story that, anyway, makes us human beens.This movie is perfect is perfect too in the direction (I think that if is Tim, is very obvious), the performances ( My God, what cast! Ewan McGregor who was too in ""Trainspotting"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" ""Albert Finney"" ""Billy Crudup"", ""Jessica Lange"" who was in ""Crimes of the Heart"" , Helena Bonhan Carter who was too in ""Getting it Right"" by Randal Kleiser, Alison Lohman, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi who was very funny here and in ""Ghost World"" by Terry Zwigoff, Danny de Vito, Mattew McGrory who was wonderful as the giant, Ada Tai and Arlene Tai who was great as the paper of Ping and Ting, with other magnificent cast) and the scenario is real beautiful, in any detail. ""Big Fish"" is a real masterpiece, not only of the contemporaneous cinema, too of the history of cinema. Of course is just my opinion, and its maybe that movie with a touch of fantasy, surrealism and at the same time about present time, where the human been makes a world of corruption, some people can shows that we can change it a little with a tiny piece of sugar of fantasy, we can change the world and our lives in an inexplicable way.Thanks Tim.

Wonderful,"This movie is described by many people here in great detail, and I don't think there is much more I could add about the characters. The storytelling throughout the entire movie is just wonderful.It is so easy to get caught up in the stories being told about the young Edward Bloom, that we forget that we are being told the stories by the dying Bloom. And thus we are taken from the youthful tales of wonder, to the sweet old man dealing with his bitter unbending son. Slowly throughout the movie, the son learns who his father was, and who he still is, and that is the wonder of Big Fish. There is no big ""Turning Point"" from the son, just a gradual understanding of who his father is. And the ending is a joy as well - over the top, fantastic, and an absolute masterpiece.Someone before me in these reviews stated that men might like this movie more than women - that I am not sure about, but I can say, as a man who didn't always have the best relationship with my own father (and what man HAS had the perfect relationship with his father?), this movie is especially poignant to men in a lot of ways.10 / 10 (and as a note, my father received a copy of this from me as a gift last year!)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Something got lost along the way,"(59%) An over ambitious adaptation that only partly fits Tim Burton's creative eye. The cast is strong, but nobody it seems is given any chance to make any real impact as characters are dropped only to be brought back again as and when needed in a wild attempt to link everything, and everyone, together in one neat package. With that said this is still a quality piece with good direction and production values, some nice touches every so often, and quite a lot of charm, but the attempts of poignancy feel forced as it's so hard to connect with everything this wants to fit in. Overall it is worth a look as certain people will like this more than others, but it's really not my one of my favourite Burton movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
so nice,"December 28th, when i passed my psychology exam, i immediately went to our bookshop to celebrate the event , that's my odd nature - and i saw the book called Big Fish there. It was thin and thus cheap so i bought it , went outside and started reading. I was charmed by the way it was written, the style reminded me of American folklore (actually that was a Russian translation, and a book of American folklore i had was also on Russian , so, maybe ,it is only a wrong impression) , and the story was so unusual , and so unusually told , and i loved it.On the back cover of the book it was said that Tim Burton have filmed it not long ago, so the only thing to do was buy the film immediately. Often , when you read a book and image the characters and events quite well, a film based on this book becomes a disappointment for you .But this was not the case. The film is excellent. Doctors call it schizophrenia or something like that ,when your imagination becomes real and surrounds you , but what to do if it's not just an imagination? You can't tell reality and fantasy apart only because they are the same.If something you face ain't alright with you, think it up the way you like it more.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Whimsy: The Movie,"Big Fish posits a strong ideal: that a story can be full of immense truth even if it never literally happened. Burton's Forrest-Gump-esque personal epic is his sweetest film, full of whimsical silliness and fable-like hyperbole. As a whole, the film never quite sinks into me the way Finney's stories do with his audiences, but it's still a good parable about living in the shadow of a larger-than-life character.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pure Cornball! Fried Green Tomatoes meets Forrest Gump,"A movie in which the current story is merely the flimsiest excuse for the backstory. From the moment the narration started, I was never involved in this storyline. My friends and I were not on board for another southern tall-tale. Is there any other kind of movie that Hollywood allows southern characters to appear in? For a hanky movie to work you do have to care about the characters. The second time Albert Finney asks for water you'll guess what's coming.Tim Burton is getting much attention for his newfound maturity. What that means is that whatever the merits of his quirky, poorly-scripted previous movies, he's now signed on to one of the two acceptable messages for Hollywood dramas to have: 1) You gotta have heart. 2) Believe in the magic. Both of which are pure cornball. In this case it's #2. Ready-made themes excuse viewers from developing or even thinking much.If you're an adult with the mind of an eight-year-old you're in for a treat. If you're a week away from your own death, this could be the ideal movie for you. Otherwise, prepare to roll your eyes and hold your nose. Just bring whatever sentimental feelings you've developed at the Hallmark store and install them wholesale into this story.Is it any wonder that this is the last movie Spalding Grey watched before killing himself?",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best coming of age dramas,"There is enough Drama/Comedy/offbeat darkness in this film. It is director ""Tim Burton"" at his best. One minute you could be smiling in melancholy happiness and the next, eyes filling with tears. The characters in the film represent all the adolescent and adult emotional feelings one develops as they adapt within families and societal life. The dark undertones sort of represent the overall mood you ""the viewer"" experience within each progressive scene.Actor Billy Crudup (Will Bloom)plays the son of (Ed Bloom)Albert Finney with such convincing manner:everything from the facial expressions down to the speech and vocal tones conversed between the two. Ewan McGregor plays the part of (Ed Bloom) coming of age. And does it so well. The struggle of son living up to father's expectations is very real.Showing that a strong family structure is key to success in most nearly everything. And a weak family structure is somewhat a struggle. Director Tim Burton explores these issues with fine intelligent complexity.The film is very well acted and beautifully choreographed.A timeless piece of film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A touching sentimental tale about a great visionary or the Magnificent Tim Burton: Part four,"A sentimental fairy tale. The magnificent storyteller Tim Burton continues to delight us with his works, and this film adaptation of Daniel Wallace's novel ""Big Fish. The novel of mythological proportions"" was no exception. I have nothing to say for the book, because I have not read it, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. You know, this picture partly repeats the best pictures of Soviet cinema, especially in terms of sentimentality and touching, and is even capable of knocking out tears, and the love story is very reminiscent of the notorious ""Diary of Memory"". And I've seen the picture more than once. And here is my brief opinion for you - A touching sentimental tale about a great visionary. You can find fault with the picture, and I will certainly do it in a separate paragraph, but for now I will focus your attention exclusively on the advantages of this sentimental fairy tale.So, here they are:
1. The scenario - the picture tells us the amazing story of Edward Bloom, who is about to die, and his son and daughter-in-law come to him on this occasion. And the son wants to get to know his father in these remaining days, because he didn't tell anything about himself, except incredible stories that seem to be stories from the outside. For a little over two hours, we watch the most vivid memories from the life of Edward Bloom and try to figure out this amazing man for ourselves, just like his son. Is Edward an inventor or is everything that happened to him true? And a whole epoch in the history of mankind will flash before the viewer, which can be easily recognized. The local history is full of vivid images, charismatic characters (which are definitely catchy), the thoughtfulness of a fabulous assumption, central thought and message, and some dialogues make you think about many things. During the timing, we are imbued with Edward's story, we are entirely on his side (although most viewers will even consider some of his actions immoral). And the finale is the apotheosis of the whole story. A grandiose and expected ending to the story. It turned out very touching.2. Edward's stories - I have no right to list them in front of those who have not yet watched this masterpiece of Maestro Tim, but they are all good, who is more and who is less, but definitely good. After all, they have both fights and chases, and in them we see the character of our hero, the manifestation of his best qualities. Yes, they are fabulous, and the finale of these stories is obvious even at their very beginning, but this does not make them bad, because the themes that are raised in them are eternal: perseverance, the spirit of research, the path to a dream, love, and so on. There is not enough time to list everything. And how I want to believe in these stories!3. Allegories, grotesque, exaggeration - all this is here and in considerable quantity. For example, the allegory of Edward with a large fish, because if you think about it, he himself was this largest fish (hence his eternal desire to drink). A fabulous town with an equally fabulous name, a clairvoyant witch, and so on. What can I say, even Helena Bonham Carter here does not play an eternally disheveled aunt, but almost a cutie. Yes, and it was like that, in 2003, when almost everything was good cinema - eh, those were wonderful times. And old Tim does not hesitate to philosophize, and the audience can do it after watching this masterpiece.4. ""Family is the main thing"" - this is the main idea of the whole picture of Burton. Yes, Edward is an inventor, but without his stories, his son's life would not be so interesting. Edward left behind a long memory. He will live in these stories. Appreciate your loved ones, love them with all your heart, especially your parents - because you will not have others. Spend as much time with them as possible, because it is not eternal, otherwise, later, you will regret that you did not have time to tell them something important, and you will not be able to return the time. Edward's son realized this - and found happiness, and pleased his father in these last days on our Earth.Now about the quibble (well, you have to find fault, because everything can't be perfect). The story of the Korean War smacks of the ""American dream"", but even in it, old Tim tried to avoid politics and showed this story with comical effect, so he says goodbye.A little bit about the main characters:
1. Edward Bloom performed by Ewan McGregor (young) and Albert Finney (old) is an amazing man, a visionary with a rich imagination who has lived an incredible life. Brave, strong-minded and resourceful, who changed the lives of many people around him. Both Evan and Albert coped well with their roles. The viewer believes that this is one person, just in different periods of life. Well done!2. Will Bloom, played by Billy Crudup, is Edward's son, and looks like a boring and uninteresting hero against the background of his father. He does not believe in the stories of his father, on the basis of which he constantly quarrels with him. During the painting, he manages to sort out both himself and his father. And in the final, he becomes a different person who accepted his father and understood everything that he wanted to tell him.Many thanks for the participation of Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Marion Cotillard and Helena Bonham Carter. The viewer accurately appreciated their acting work.There is not that gloomy and attractive atmosphere of old Tim, but there is a fabulous atmosphere, especially it prevails in the choice of color palette.Despite all his efforts, the picture failed at home, and only the world allowed him to scrape together at least some pennies, but for Columbia Studio it was a failure, so Tim did his next work already under the patronage of the giant Urner Brazzers, and it was a puppet dark fairy tale ""The Corpse of the Bride"", but we'll talk about it in another time.My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Destiny in the witch's eye,"With Burton, it has always been a propensity for telling stories that drives his films. He surrounds this with a kind of wondrous imagination derived in a slick manner from old horror movies, a commercial imagination if you ask me, but which often dazzles attention away from the real design of the thing, which is a story at the center. He is the most successful when he can align these, visual outer layers and storytelling mechanisms, when he can devise ways to point at some kind of maker folding the elaborate origamis that we experience decorating the surface.So, Beetlejuice, with the nightmare world nested in the attic; Ed Wood even better, a subtler kind of magic, with the visionary maker marshaling movie characters into a fiction that does not matter how cheap as long as it creates real bonds that enrich lives, the real magic hiding in the shared passion for adventure. And this, perhaps the most direct of all.So again at the center we have a storyteller weaving fanciful episodes involving kind giants, dark woods, the circus, a wartime adventure. It is all shaped around a singleminded devotion to discover and hold onto the love of a lifetime, love as destiny, this is the precious knowledge he is trying to impart from his deathbed. Of course we are seeing the whole through the eyes of the son, a journalist, a cold pragmatist, himself a storyteller from facts, at first outright disbelieving but gradually coming to unfold the wondrous origamis for some truth of their maker in the pattern.The son himself is coming into a life that is mirrored from the one narrated from, newly married, awaiting his first child.The idea is that there is truth at the heart of fiction, always has. We fold the real world into a more elaborate version of the mind, the truth being this; the hard facts alone would not do, it is the adventure of discovering for ourselves that has the power to impart some essence or wisdom. It needs to be our journey in these shoes. From our end, we have to learn to not merely think, but to embody, to situate the world at the heart.It is an essay on how to engage fiction, the film itself, in order to be enriched with a love that is true, the essay nested as our effort to apprehend the tall tales. We make the discovery with the son.Eventually it was all true, or so it goes in the film, this is a major blunder on Burton's part trying to directly address our inner child, when the point is to cultivate an openness of seeing that would allow us to abstract what matters. So the giant was as we imagined him to be, the circus owner, the twin singers except no longer conjoined. Seeing truly, this part collapses. No doubt, he trusted us to have invested enough emotion by then to not pay any mind.Overall it is not a bad film to absorb, even if the way Burton has made it we'd rather spend time inside the fantasy; real life is bleak, but also badly integrated with the other segments, each segment badly integrated with the rest. As a result, it feels longer than it is. It feels syncopated, always starting again from where we'd left it.Still, if you feel you have sufficiently absorbed this, made your own, freely traveled back and forth, got to know that the person is not telling the stories but the other way round, you are ready for bigger, more challenging adventures at the hands of more eloquent makers, more talented folders of visual origamis; start with the great Raoul Ruiz who recently passed away, and move backwards to Wojiech Has where the blueprint of fiction is metaphysical, Welles as an inspiration for both.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than expected,"Watched this somewhat reluctantly with wifey. Beforehand thought it looked a bit wish-washy, plus I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. Glad i saw it.The story focuses on Ed Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney). Ed, according to his stories, has lived an amazing, basically unbelievable life. In his travels he tells stories of giants he has befriended, finding a magical town, joining the circus to met his wife and so on. His son decides one day to start searching for the truth- are all his stories tall tales, is their some truth amongst them, or are they all as told? The movie unfolds really well, McGregor and Finney both do a great job. To my surprise it held my interest, and at stages amazed with the excellent cinematography. Worth seeing.

"A real ""Big-fish' can","If the movie is an art form that deliver the personal interpretation of the world what the artist see and feel. Tim Burton's world is exaggerated in darkness and sadness of a boy who is rejected from the world, so he creates his own world in darkest colors from a crayon box he has. Thus the movie is full of those wonderful dark colors such as charcoal black, dark blue and purplish Grey. All the characters are rejected from the society or rather intentionally ejected themselves and lives in an alienated world of their own, full of mysterious characters with those tortured dreams.This movie isn't too far away from his previous creations but it shift little. The movie is full of colors, warmer and brighter. The camera moves faster. I assume that that's how the director's view is heading, almost dreaming and also forgiving.The movie is totally a 'make-believe' itself, by the end of movie, you are starting to wish, to see if the 'big-fish' is real, still swimming around in the pool. Even if you know you are deceiving, you left in charm. If the cinema is fake as same as the 'big-fish', this is real cinema that makes the cinema 'real'. Make the movie as a genuine 'Big-Fish', so you feel like criticizing nothing at all when finally the ending credits rolls.Helena-Bornham Carter's almost perfect New Jersey accent, also, Ewan Mcgregor's not-so-perfect New Jersey accent is also another 2 'Big-Fish' in the movie, we are all here to believe (so we forgive).Albert Finney was always great, as I see him as an American answer to Britain's Sir Anthony Hopkins.How wonderful to see a movie is so different from others that are full of 'Freud-sque' oppression of sexual desires,tortured dreams and weighed pressure (name the Kubrick). A one's life could be dark and also full of sinful mistakes from a viewpoint of psycho analysis's. This movie will open your hardest heart and will leave you to dream, once more. The Tim Burton's best movie yet, where the real people with a ""big-fish' in a same can.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A son of a dying father tries to differentiate between the facts and fictions of his dad's rather unbelievable life.,"There is no movie quite like this one. On so many levels it is different, unique and utterly mind-boggling. It is not just the visual pleasures, like so many movies out there, but it is mostly the story and how it literally ends where it begins. It is Tim Burton's best work, in my opinion. This movie is a charming, simple, child-like film that is easily misunderstood.The whole point of this movie is not that it's one great lie, it's point is that a great story is not just facts, facts are boring. It is telling us that a great story is always somewhat over exaggerated. In the beginning, the adult Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) tells the guests of his son's wedding about the day his son was born, the day that he caught the biggest fish in the Ashton river (which was rumored to be left over from the Cretaceous period) using is golden wedding ring. Later in the film, Dr. Bennett tells Will (Edward's son, played by Billy Crudip) the factual story of how he, Will, was born. Which version is do we remember? Edward's, of course, because it was over-exaggerated. This movie tells the story of the beginnings of a tall-tale.Before watching it, I must warn viewers, this film is not for everyone. This movie is strange and only those who can think like Tim Burton will understand it. However, there is so much depth to the story that it requires some thinking to it. It is not a movie for parties and sleep-overs. It is not a movie for action-lovers. However, it is for those deep-thinkers and those who loved to hear their parents tell them a great story while they lied in bed and lingered on every word.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Glorification!,There's no harm in glorifying everything a little.. This is stressed in the scene where the doctor relates to will bloom the events as they happen at the time of his birth and then tells him people actually like the version that his father( Edward bloom) tells everyone that involves the story surrounding a big fish that invokes in people the interest to listen to the story of the otherwise not so interesting story of the birth of will.. This is the scene where the essence of the story lies.. The whole story is about the trade off between what actually happened in the life of Edward Bloom and what he tells everyone about his life. Everything he relates is the truth but not without a little glorification. Everyone except Edward's son seem to enjoy his stories while Will refrains from talking to his father because of his habit. But finally realizes that his father wasn't lying about anything and therefore starts liking him. The very last scene is the best scene by far in the story where we get to see the actual characters and we can make out the difference between the real life personalities and the ones in Edward's stories. The giant is actually around ten feet but in Edward's stories he is portrayed as a twenty odd feet giant which makes him sound dangerous.. Also the twins are actually not conjoined but in the story he describes them as having only two legs between them. This is by far Tim Burton's best film. The films draws comparisons with Forrest Gump in more ways than one. Both the stories are the biographies of diverse personalities. But one of it is glorified and the other is true both great in their own respects. Either watch the movie for its brilliance in creativity or watch it simply for the brilliant portrayal of the role by Ewan McGregor or watch it for its brilliant background score. If that is not reason enough to watch the movie you are missing out on something in life. This is a must-see movie is all i can tell. Enjoy!,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"You can count on Tim Burton to tell you a ""tall tale.""","How many of us have met someone who always tells us ""tall tales?"" Are they true stories or are they mostly exaggerated? As you watch this film your mind may well be asking that question: Is Albert Finney's life as Ed Bloom, a mere figment of his imagination or did he actually live all those ""adventures."" Such is the theme of this fine Tim Burton film from 2003.What I like about Tim Burton's films is that I can NOT ""second guess"" the story as it progresses. That keeps to a surprise what's coming around the corner in the next five minutes as the scenes progress.The film is well served by the acting talents of Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, and Billy Crudup in the two main character roles with Ewan McGregor playing the young man Ed Bloom and Albert Finney playing the senior Ed Bloom.Another delightful surprise is how Tim Burton casts some well known actors to play small but significant supporting roles. I would say that these well known faces had no more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout the film but they were instrumental to the total performance: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter (Tim's main love in real life), Robert Guillaume, and Danny DeVito. If you have watched HBO's ""The Sopranos"" then you will also enjoy Steve Buscemi's (Tony Soprano's cousin Tony Blundetto) performance as Norther Winslow (although he has been in 89 films since 1984!). Identical twins, Ada Tai and Arlene Tai are uniquely cast in the scene as entertainers of the Chinese Army! See how Buton uses these twins in the story!Am I hearing the same ""twinkle"" music in the background like I heard in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas?""

"In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish","Big Fish is director Tim Burton's most mature film to date, taking his regular fantasy elements and vivid imagination, and planting them in an adult environment, where they can be both visually entertaining and emotional shattering. And yes, the film is that good.The story revolves around Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), a dying father who receives a surprise visit from his estranges son, Will (Billy Crudrup) while on his death bed. Ed has the tendency of telling tales of his past, most filled up with imaginative figures and mythical places. Will speaks with his father and asks him to retell the story of his life (a major part of the film is told in flashbacks, where the marvelous Ewan McGregor of Star Wars and Trainspotting fame portrays the young Ed). While listening to his father's gripping autobiography, Will tries his best to overcome his overlong cynicism and doubt towards the tales, and try his best to separate fact from fiction  a task he finds particularly hard to accomplish.In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent (unfortunately, I lost both) would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish. The film is a moral tale that teaches us the importance of family and nostalgia, and emphasizes the sad truth that sometimes we really get to appreciate and understand what we have when it's too late. When the movie ended, and the credits started to roll, I really wished I would've known my own father better (he passed away when I was 9 years old).Honestly, why this film didn't race for the big Academy Awards of 2004 (for 2003 releases) is way beyond me, since this is purely one of the more complex and layered dramas of the 2000's.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Amazing movie of love, acceptance, and the line between fantasy and reality","I am a self-professed fan of Tim Burton (even after what he did with Batman, which I enjoyed because he did it), so I can not believe I had not see this movie before. It was one of the first things I added to my NetFlix Queue when I opened my account to correct that. I am now going to have to run out and purchase this one for my own collection. It's just that good. It has not only instantly become my favorite Burton movie ever, but has move onto my list of favorite movies of all time.The way this movie was filmed, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography, and all of it, combined to create a magical feeling to all the stories it tells. It gives each one a different look and feel, while allowing them to also stay part of the same life story they tell. Throw in the very down to earth style used for the scenes of the ""real world"" as the son tries to find the truth about his dying father and you have a truly magical mix of styles that work perfectly together. Sprinkle in the fantastic music of Danny Elfman and you have what I can only call a perfect movie.The acting was top notch and the story was a great mix of reality and fantasy that keeps you wondering where the line between the two actually lies. The story is about fables and folklore, which are usually based in some truth, and those who are not willing to accept them for what they are. It is about the troubled and difficult relationships between fathers and sons trying to understand and accept each other. In then end it is about love and acceptance, in a world where fantasy and reality truly mix. It is one of the few movies that actually had me laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time.The DVD itself not only contains the movie, but includes a number of good behind the scenes featurettes, a commentary track, and a Burton trivia game that leads to one of the hidden bonuses. The commentary track, although good, is more of an interview than a real commentary on the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Typical Tim Burton's routine,"Tim Burton's tics and bestiary can arouse interest, or boredom, it depends on taste. It also depends on the films. His universe is coherent. This Big Fish is in the personal vein. It is a rather nice story that allows Tim Burton to create a tale that disturbs this deep America. There are scary places. There are supernatural and sympathetic characters, or not. And more or less scary beings, typical of Tim Burton's bestiary, mixed with the clichés of the perfect or supposedly dreamed life.Then, the story invites a measured empathy for the various characters, led by Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor. The character of Albert Finney is more problematic, and especially the reason for the plot, that is to say very functional, and does not arouse any empathy. As for Jessica Lange, she is less than functional. The film at least has the interest of inviting a rich and generally successful cast.The film is saved by its conclusion, not predictable, but obvious, and all that precedes has no reason to exist except to prepare this end which is a release of the characters and the dramatic arc.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Americans do not read books,"This movie is a very good paraphrase of Baron Munchausen by Rudolf Raspe. The main character is a great liar who sees the world differently; nobody believes him but eventually his lies prove to be true - who is that, Ed Bloom or Baron Munchausen? Both. The stories Ed Bloom tells are the same stories Baron Munchause told - with the small adjustments: the car risen up on the tree by the flies substituted for the original horse. The director, Tim Burton was making fun of his illiterate compatriots and the audience bought it. Had he made a footnote or give a credit to the book author who lived in Germany in the 18th century, that would be an honest attitude and a few professional movie critics might go to the library and read the book afterward.

"Moving life-story for everyone, albeit socially defected","Big Fish is a very moving story suitable for families. It is not really just about one father and one family, but about most of everyone with a big heart and desire to go beyond the usual... Escapist in nature yet extremely enchanting as yet another typical ""American Dream"", the myth and adventure as told by the father very precisely describes one's often untold mixed feelings about life and death, about sudden adolescent growth and the sweet sorrows of love...What weakens the film most is the over-simplification and Cold-War depiction of a demonetized war-time ""exotic China"" in which the hero suddenly becomes unnecessarily aggressive. At the same time, while the daffodil-filled scene of love and romance is detailed and touching, the over-quick solution of another layer of the story, i.e., the witch/girl/other-woman image, proves to be too shallow in terms of social awareness. There were many allusions to American history particularly in the story of bank robbery and the changing role of poet which, if more adequately explored, could have made the film a much greater one, elevating itself towards many deeper-thinking American social-critic dramatists and European philosophical buldungsroman.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton at his muddled worst,"This movie is an unsalvageable wreck.  The acting is wretched with apologies to Bonham Carter and Cotillard who do not belong within a hundred and fifty miles.  Burton seems confused as to which of the 4 or 5 different movies he wanted to make.  None of them is fully realized.  There is the sappy fun-for-the-whole-family melodrama that has infected his recent work.  There is the 'trademark' weirdness that he has failed to develop significantly since Scissorhands.  It just seems recycled and out of place here (Burton himself absolutely pillages Peewee's Big Adventure, which by the way, is a far superior film).  There is a contrived story between father and son which leaves me with the impression that Burton not only never had a father but has never seen a father and a son interact in the same room.  And there are at least three moments, horribly short, where one sees what the film could have been.  That is the most infuriating part.  The most disappointing film I've seen this year.  2/10 stars",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Just like 2001's ""Planet of the Apes"" - a complete failure.","A fantasy film where telling tall tales should play right into Burton's strengths as a filmmaker. But for an imaginative film that relies on blowing the viewer away with fantastic scenes, I found it all too pedestrian and if you will...unimaginative. The storyline was slight and forgettable, and its sweating hard attempt to act the part of the aggressive traveling salesman to make me buy a product I didn't need with such a sugary sentimental pitch, never worked. After catching all those wild stories that blur the lines between reality and fantasy, with no tension coming forth and not anything real happening, I'm left wondering what it was all about. It would be too inane to believe that the filmmaker actually wants us to go for the bald-faced lie over anything real because it is so charmingly told, which is another way of adopting Hollywood's moneymaking code of giving the paying customers whatever they want as long as they feel entertained and the investors are happy with the box-office returns. But that is exactly what this film is about. Along with the superficial metaphors disclosed about death and love and an idyllic life, which are supposed to be poignant pronouncements for the film to cover-up all its emptiness and its attempts at doling out false hopes for those who buy into its premise.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Big Fish"" is a fantasy par excellence!","""Big Fish"" is a delightful fantasy.  It is well delivered by the director, Tim Burton.  The screenplay by John August is a perfect fit to the silver screen.  Albert Finney plays senior Ed Bloom, a story teller who pores his heart into his never ending stories to his son, Will.  Billy Crudup, Will Bloom, is perfect in his underplay of the son searching for a portion of communication with his estranged father.  He has not spoken to his dad in several years, and he searches for a line of communication through the adventures that he recalls as childhood fairy tales.  Robert Guillaume plays the family's doctor taking care of the dying father with a gentle and understanding hand.  He gives a very comforting performance.  Mathew McGrory plays Karl the Giant, and the camera angles are very convincing in solidifying his character.  All moviegoers with a sense of imagination should see this movie.

Style and substance make this a worthwhile adventure,"Whimsical.Offbeat.Gripping.An epic adventure.Big Fish is one of Tim Burton's more colorful films. It moves away from his typically dark Gothic undertones and into whimsical fairytale land with giants, witches, Siamese twins, hidden cities, mermaids, sirens and werewolves, coating the film in a rich fantasy glaze, but it keeps its storyline grounded and simple throughout: it chronicles the life of Edgar Bloom (Albert Finney; Ewan McGregor) as he, on his deathbed, retells his experiences and stories for his son to mend their broken relationship.This is one of the most beautiful, elegantly-crafted visual films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Yet it is evident that Burton does not neglect other aspects of film-making by focusing too much on stylistic devices. He is, first and foremost, a storyteller and never lets visuals alone carry a tale; the visuals facilitate the story, and not the other way around. This is seen by the strong performances by the cast, and in particular, Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney who both portray the lead of Ed Bloom at different periods in his life. They help carry the story, as do the unusual humour and the magical score by Danny Elfman.Toward the end of Big Fish, I realised how smitten I had become with all the quirky characters, the central father-and-son relationship and the overdose of style that Burton presents--to the extent that I was sad when the film ended even though the conclusion was very satisfying. The film most probably has a few flaws (there were some segments that felt too long) and if you don't like strange or whimsical, then Big Fish isn't for you.Lastly, anyone who likens this offbeat gem to the studio schmaltz that is Forrest Gump should be shot in the knees.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pleasant surprise,"Big Fish is an interesting movie for me to review. For one thing, it is directed by Tim Burton, and I generally don't like Tim Burton's movies. (What he did to Charlie and the Choclolate Factory was despicable in my opinion) But Big Fish did something that I thought any Tim Burton movie would never do: make me think that this was an enjoyable movie. Big Fish stars Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episodes 1-3, The Island, Black Hawk Down) as Edward Bloom, a man who considers himself to be a big fish in a small pond, hence the title of the movie. Now, the story of Big Fish is told on two fronts: the first front being Edward Bloom as an old man in the present day dying from cancer, telling his son's wife all of these stories of his own youth, however, the son believes that the stories that his father tells are nothing but lies, and this whole part of the movie is the son, William, trying to know more about his father by getting his father to tell him the truth about his life before his eventual death, The second front is told in the late 1950s and mid 1960s with the young Edward Bloom living these stories that the older version of Edward Bloom is telling, even though the stories told are pretty exaggerated. There are also nice cameos of Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, and Steve Buscemi. I thought that Big Fish was a very good movie, and it easily earns a place on my Top 100 Movies of All Time list. Now this movie does suffer from a few weaknesses. One weakness is the fact that the movie has the same Burton-style animation, and I have never really been that big of a fan of his animation style. The second weakness is that I personally thought that there was a little bit of deadweight. However, I find these weaknesses to be pretty minimal. I'm surprised that this movie only got a very limited release when it first came out, because I think that it would have done very well in the theaters. Overall, Big Fish is a very nice movie, and it really surprised me, because I loved this movie. I give Big Fish 8.5 stars out of 10, and if you see it at your local video store, I say pick it up and give it a chance. It could very well worth your while.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A heart-warming and thoughtful delight,"This was the third time I'd seen this film and finally it hit home. A moving, funny and visually spectacular treat that has one of the most poignant and upbeat endings I can remember. As a Tim Burton film there is a certain anticipation, and I think this can be a problem...there is no Johnny Depp and it's not particularly Gothic so you have to readjust to what it actually is, an emotional and thoughtful piece dealing with the reality, and unreality, of death. That's why it took me a couple of viewings.Wonderfully wrapped in an Elfman score, the story is a meander through the tall-tales of a dying man and his son's attempt to reconcile truth from fiction when understanding his Dad. There is a tenderness and warmth here that gives this film a wonderful depth. There is also great humour, splendidly presented by the excellent acting and script. Visually stunning throughout, this is a real treat that deserves to be given time to grow on you.Bottom line....a heart-warming and thoughtful delight.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big Fish is dead in the water,"Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a robust looking old man who loves to tell stories, in fact he has been telling tall tales all his life to his children, inflating events in his own life to mythic proportions. When Bloom's journalist son Will (Billy Crudup) returns to his parent's house on hearing that his father is dying of cancer, he is determined to separate fact from fiction and get to know the father who was never around when he was growing up. Based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Daniel Wallace and adapted for the screen by John August Big Fish, the latest by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), is a beautifully looking film that has its engines going full blast but never seems to achieve liftoff. I am drawn to films that have a surreal vision of an alternate reality, but Big Fish force-feeds it to us rather than subtly evoking a sense of magic.The film is told in flashback as Will and his pregnant French wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) recall the stories his father had told him all his life. We first see young Edward (Ewan McGregor) as a sports hero and science fair winner in Ashton, Alabama then, after leaving Ashton with a gentle giant named Karl, encountering the inhabitants of a wondrous town called Spectre where everyone walks around barefoot and is full of joy. Although vowing to return one day to Spectre, Edward moves on and agrees to work for a circus manager (Danny de Vito) in return for information about Sandra (Alison Lohman), a girl he has fallen in love with. Eventually he finds her at Auburn University and, in one of the best scenes in the film, courts her with 10,000 daffodils to prove his love.After Edward is drafted to fight in the Korean War, he rescues conjoined twin entertainers, Ping and Jing and brings them home to work in the circus. At this point, it just continues from one off-the-wall sequence to another until its grand Fellini-esque final sequence. Unfortunately, despite some high expectations, I was unmoved by the ending. I did not find anything lovable about Bloom and feel that the theme of father-son reconciliation was handled much more convincingly in The Barbarian Invasions by Denis Arcand. While Big Fish has some fine performances and outstanding special effects, it did not instill in me any true sense of wonder or authentic emotion. Sadly, Big Fish is dead in the water.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's a wonderful lie,"Judging by most comments submitted to this forum, this film has become an all time favorite. Coming from Tim Burton, however, the movie doesn't measure to some of his best films at all.Edward Bloom is a dreamer, a quality he thought he would pass to his son, only to find out that it only causes embarrassment in the young man, who has to go through life listening to the same stories over and over again. Where did Edward Bloom go wrong? That point is never clearly explored by anyone connected to this fantasy. Was it all in Edward's head, or was it real? Well, let the viewer follow the clues and let him arrive at his own conclusion to see if this Walter Mitty of a man really lived the lies his son Will seems to believe he is telling, or did he actually encountered all these adventures in the process of growing up.The triumph of the film is the casting. Young Edward, played by Ewan McGregor, suddenly transforms himself into Albert Finney, the older Edward. The same can be said of Alison Lohman turning into Jessica Lange. This was a most felicitous event because in most occasions actors playing a younger character don't bear any resemblance of the actor who plays the older version. In this movie this process seems seamless, as far as how uncanny both McGregor and Lohman might look like Finney and Lange at a later stage of their lives.Since the film is basically about Edward, his wife, Sandra, has very little to do in it. Jessica Lange is totally wasted, or Alison Lohman, for that matter. One would have liked to have seen them  more on screen. Billy Crudup, as Will, is fine.

Amazingly creative and carefully portrayed,"Big Fish is a timeless film. The story of a struggling father/son relationship can be had in any family, past, present, or future. Director Tim Burton does an amazing job combining humor, wit, and emotion in this film to create characters that almost anyone can relate to. Will Bloom, played by Billy Crudup, and his father Edward Bloom, played by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, have a chemistry throughout the film that is enthralling. The relationship they build and portray is believable, realistic, and genuine.As the story begins, we learn that Edward Bloom is quite the story teller. His embellishments are the reason that his son feels he never really had the opportunity to learn who his father is. Edward's extraordinary stories are portrayed as flashbacks as he recounts the remarkable events of his life to his pregnant daughter in law, Josephine (Marion Cotillard), as he lies sick in bed. He tells tales of how he met his beloved wife, Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange), and of his adventures as a traveling salesman, that which include giants, two headed women, werewolves, and a bank-robbing poet. These tall tales build Edward Bloom into a lovable character and make us want his failing relationship with his son to work out, but for this to happen, Will must first learn to not take life so seriously and accept that sometimes, the big-fish tales can be healthier for the soul than reality and facts. A second theme in Big Fish is that of unconditional, nonjudgmental love. Will must learn that he does not need to change his father and instead, should accept him, because the stories may not be as embellished as Will believes. Comparable to the main theme in Little Miss Sunshine, this theme resonates with the idea that pure, honest love is unrestricted, unreserved, and tolerant.Beyond the basic elements of film, this movie illustrates unique techniques to depict the storyline and themes. The texture of the film is distinctive to Tim Burton. The flashbacks of Edward Bloom's life have a surreal, fairy-tale dream feel to them. While most films subtly walk the line between fiction and reality, this film visually embraces it. In the scene where young Edward first sees his future wife, a modified freeze frame allows us to focus on Edward's thoughts and emotions as he approaches the girl of his dreams, only to be snapped out of it as time races to catch back up. This scene begins Edward's reckless journey to find his true love. Another cinematic device used in this movie is voice over. The use of voice over in this film is vital to the storyline. Since a number of the scenes are stories that are being told, the voice over narration helps transition between scenes and gives essential background information. The film begins as being told by Will as the story of his father, but after the intro scene, the remainder of the narration is by Edward, until the final scene, where Will again narrates the final story. This final scene is when Will realizes that the tall tales truly are an amazing, powerful part of his life.Overall, this is a heartwarming film. The combination of real life conflict and dramatic fairy-tale stories is touching and uplifting. It also is a wonderful reminder that acceptance, approval, and abandon can enrich all of our lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narrative Threads,"Tim Burton weaves a present story with a narrated past story, which interweaves truth and fiction. The past thread is involving and entertaining. At least four narrators will have told it by the end. Burton usually succeeds with fantastical stories. His presentation often aggrandized by salient photography; so, here, the high-key lighting is nostalgia of old movies. Ewan McGregor masters the lead--threading the nostalgia, offbeat humor and aging, as he must relate somewhat to the Ed Bloom in the present thread. Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and Alison Lohman help. Alberty Finney and Billy Crudup don't, though. Yet, Burton is who completely fails to make the present story interesting in any way. Even the low-key lighting is boring. It's like a TV-movie sort of reality.

Everyone loves a dad who has a wild imagination and funny stories but here was a kid who still, in his thirties, had never been in touch with his dad at any stage.And the course of the film did nothing to enlighten him ... or me!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disturbingly BAD ... Overrated as it gets & Dumb as it gets,"Why would that idiot even tell stories that are so odd that no one in their right mind would believe them?  They're not particularly clever or eccentric enough to captivate anyone.  We, the viewer, were even treated to them visually and that just added to their deplorably foolish nature.  I was not captivated or enchanted by even one of these tall tales. This film reminded me of that classic TV moment on the `Simpsons' where homer remarked to Marge about having to pay for concessions he had pilfered after a school drama production `I had to see Krabopple's butt, believe me I paid for it!' Well, I should have looted my theatre's concessions after this flop because I had to see Danny Devito's butt.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life is short. It's up to you what you make out of it.,"I had a debate with a friend after watching this movie together.He said the movie was a sad ending.The fact that all people eventually die and how that makes life futile and somehow meaningless.He also mentioned how few people actually come to your funeral and remember your life after you're gone.However, I had a different thought.The fact that you will die sometime is what makes your life special.It's what makes the every single day that you're living now precious.Even the most boring life can be ""something"".Sometimes it's not always right to see life in a pessimistic way.Just take a step back and just give a moment to enjoy life.Don't forget to love when you can.Remember, nothing lasts forever.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big lies great truth,A poetical movie mixing reality and fancy so well and effectively that we cannot say where one ends and the other begins. Albert Finney makes a splendid role as a father telling his son stories of his life where he mixes real facts and events with fanciful narrations full of poetry and romanticism. The story begins when the already adult son is called from France to come near his dying father's bed and begins to revive all those stories that filled his childhood but had ended up by revolting him against what he later began to consider a pack of lies. But now he realizes that he doesn't know his father well and he approaches him willing to know really what and who he is indeed below the top of the iceberg to which he thinks he can compare his father's moral appearance and thus reach the true nature of his personality. It's a very beautiful story in itself and the fancy included in the father's tales are beautiful too both visually and in words. All the performers do an excellent work personifying charming characters. A landmark in the history of recent cinema indeed.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Very Unique Film,"I just really like Tim Burton. Why? He makes movies that are different. Movies that don't follow the exact same pattern as every other movie. This movie is just one of his finest examples. With this movie, you just stay pleased the whole time you are watching it. Wonderful story telling. It's heart-warming, and typically I hate that type of thing in movies, but this movie makes it enjoyable. This is no action movie, I'm an action movie guy, but i love this movie. Ewan McGregor's performance just enhances the film even more, definitely his second most memorable role to me. The colors in this movie are bright and vivid during the story telling portions of the film, and I've always found that extremely appealing to the eye. Its a very adventurous movie.

"What a Lovely, Strange Film....","Tim Burton always produces remarkable motion pictures, whether they're ultimately that good, or not. With 'Big Fish', with its fluorescent colours and lovable weirdness, some critics have dared say that it's not very good.A few of the parts on their own are a little iffy but it's the huge scale of extraordinariness that verges into Terry Gilliam's territory and the way they unfold that literally takes one's breath away. In the best Tim Burton way, the surprising turn into something even more surprising, letting our imagination run riot. He doesn't even seem to rely on CGI - just look at all those individual daffodil flowers and that bright green lawn, where you think you can see where the turf has been stitched together.Those of us used to Ewan MacGregor being in Trainspotting, might find it difficult to adjust to this naive and often seemingly rather simple fellow with his quite strong American drawl of an accent. Having Albert Finney play him in later life seems more natural somehow as he seems like an eccentric granddad, telling us all these very tall stories. Helena Bonham Carter is cast to type as a sort of modern witch and possible love interest for MacGregor and is as good as she always.The in's and out's of the story are too complex to write with any brevity and in any case are best left for the viewer to experience as they let the film unfold. The way I saw 'Big Fish' was as a fairytale for adults, with adult-ish themes plus all the wacky weirdness of Tim Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Simply a good, big tale","'Big Fish' is a magical, big tale about an ordinary guy who becomes unordinary and lives a big tale. It captures a southern US father and his relationship with his son, who fails to believe his big tales until a moving experience brings them closer together and closer to 'reality'. It is ultimately the tale of a father/son relationship as much as it is a tale about the unusual and adventurous life that his father leads and the unusual characters he befriends along the way to a successful and magical life.The film is full of symobolism, but it is often a little too simplistic, and I felt that the plot could have developed more in some areas. This could have been a much longer film, and I think that it needed to be longer in order to tell some of the story, but it does fairly well as it stands. I felt that some of the scenes were rushed and that some of the detail and additional scenes could have made this a much better film.I don't think this film is for everyone, but if you're after a good story about characters and want to watch something original, then I suggest spending an evening with this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

For me that is the best kind because usually movies are not as good as the books they were based on. The ones that are exceptions to this rule are often superb movies. This could be one of those.

This is a Tim Burton film with a different vibe...,"... than most of his more gothic fantasy oriented films. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both play the same character--Edward Bloom. Finney is the older, present day Edward Bloom and McGregor plays him as a teenager and younger man. Finney's segments are set in the present and McGregor's scenes are set as flashbacks, but they are fantasized versions of various events in his life. In the present, Finney is terminally ill and his son (Billy Crudup) is set on finding out the real versions of various stories his father had told him over the years. Crudup is frustrated with his father, as he feels that he's never been told the truth about his father's life and that the stories he tells are just too fantastic to be true.His quest for the entirety of the film is to find out the truth about the real stories. Anyway, the flashback/fantasy sequences that feature McGregor are the stories that Finney is telling his son. The story goes back and forth between past and present. The title of the film comes into p lay with the repeated motif of ""big fish in a small pond."" Edward Bloom was just too big and fantastic to be living in small town Alabama.McGregor's fantasy sequences are easily the best and most entertaining sequences of the film. We see him as the star student who can do no wrong; we see him leave his tiny hometown and try to make it elsewhere. He sees his dream girl (Alison Lohman) at a party and spends three years trying to learn about her and find her. He is determined to make her his wife. Along the way, he joins the circus and ends up being employed by Danny DeVito. He also meets a giant and a set of conjoined twins. There is a hilarious scene with Steve Buscemi.Tim Burton stock pl ayer, Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as the girl who harbors a lifelong crush on Ewan McGregor, but ultimately never got him to see her in the same way. Scottish McGregor's attempt at a thick Alabama accent is decent--at least he maintains it throughout the film.This film was so much fun and a nice change of pace from the usual Tim Burton fare. I wish there were more scenes with Ewan McGregor and less scenes with stick-in-the-mud Billy Crudup. This film could have also used more Steve Buscemi--he's hilarious. Jessica Lange also lends support as the older version of Mrs. Bloom and Marion Cotillard appears as Billy Crudup's wife. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
*Imagine Your Own Reality*,"Very interesting movie.A boy in childhood and growing up is told stories and tales by his father as factual events experienced by the father in his life.The stories involve a witch, a giant and a mermaid amongst other things.Now in adulthood the boy believes these stories are ""tall tales""(hence Big Fish) and seeks to discover from his ailing father the truth rather than the fantasy.Now, on one level this film could be said to be very silly; on another level, very profound.Often people who make up false stories as part of their own lives are irritating and obnoxious. They are frequently con artists, sales people, charlatans, lonely individuals or those leading a Walter Mitty existence. And such persons often do more harm than good.However: What if our lives and that of those around us can be improved by the dreams and imagination of others?

I Never Swam for My Father,"""Throughout his life Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) has always been a man of big appetites, enormous passions, and tall tales. In his later years, portrayed by five-time 'Best Actor Oscar' nominee Albert Finney, he remains a huge mystery to his son, William (Billy Crudup). Now, to get to know the real man, Will begins piecing together a true picture of his father from flashbacks of his amazing adventures in this marvel of a movie,"" according to the DVD sleeve description. As you might expect, the presence of Tim Burton and many of his regular crew mean your production values on ""Big Fish"" are going to be good.Now, this is supposed to be the story of a son estranged from his father due to the latter filling his son's head with nothing but lies. The father's stories, told in flashbacks, turn out to be vivid exaggerations, like the ""fish tale"" opening. Well, the ""stories"" aren't revelatory. And, it all leads to the expected heart-tugging conclusion. More is told when Mr. Crudup tells his wife something interesting but relatively unexplored, ""When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was there."" So, our storyteller was a nice guy and a loving husband, but only spent a little time with his son - or, was it a lot of time telling tales?And why?The disconnections are strange.We begin with a crystal ball-eyed witch showing our young lad and his friends how they are going to die. One of the other kids dies masturbating to ""Playboy"" on his toilet; either this story was a father's warning, or it proved sexual urges trump the will to live. We don't see our hero's death, but he does. As he's seen his own death, ""Ed"" is able to lead an exciting life, encountering a string of circus-like people. The key relationship, that of father and son, gets lost in the past. Only during the final act, do we get to the heart of the story - then, Crudup and Mr. Finney, updating his ""Billy Liar"" (1960) stage role, begin to sell it.****** Big Fish (12/10/03) Tim Burton ~ Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The story of stories,"Big Fish should be filed under 'what could have been'. Having been a big Tim Burton fan in my formative years, having loved Batman and Beetle Juice in my early teens and then growing into Ed Wood later on, my interest was dwindling with Sleepy Hollow and turned into real concern with Planet of the Apes. Out of nowhere came Big Fish - which seemed to signal a complete shift for Burton. He was finally growing up, rebelling against his own predictability and the style that he himself created and single-handedly turned into a cliché. On Big Fish he was reinventing himself and recreating himself as a legitimate filmmaker. Sadly, it remained a completely solitary incident. Burton sunk further back into his own clichés and never once created anything as fresh as Big Fish since.And so, Big Fish must be considered as a film by its own right, rather than a transitional step in Burton's filmography; and when seen as such, it's revealed as a gorgeous film, a drama/fantasy combination that's considerably more positive and whimsical than comparable films like Heavenly Creatures, The Fall and Pan's Labyrinth, all of which use the fantasy in the darkest ways possible. In Big Fish the fantasy isn't about escaping from horrible reality - it's to enhance a ""regular"" reality, to make it more interesting and more spectacular. In a way, it's about the very essence of storytelling, and by extension, of filmmaking, which may explain why it's Burton's most emotional and personal movie - since Edward Scissorhands, at least.Burton's knack for visuals is obviously on display here too, but for once it's not the main attraction. Big Fish is gorgeously shot, the lighting and coloring construct the mood, but this time the characters are the centerpiece - the characters, astonishingly, not the actors (looking at you, Johnny Depp), because not one of the actors actually delivers a shattering performance (Albert Finney is the best one, as well as the only one who makes the fake accent work) but the characters are all remarkably memorable, and the credit should go to the cast but most of all to Burton. It's shocking that he could ever make a movie as emotionally potent as Big Fish, and sad that he never tried to repeat it.You can completely ignore the fact that Burton directed this; if you hadn't been told, it's possible that you'd never notice. Just sit back and enjoy a beautiful, touching, sad, hilarious, magical story, and be glad that someone talented took the time to make it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was okay.,"I recently watched Big Fish. I can't really say if I like it or not. It wasn't the type of movie that I'm really into because it's action. I can say that Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt work so well together in this movie and their acting really had me drawn to the movie more, but as I was saying I don't normally like watching action movies and this one wasn't the best either, but it was a little bit better than the other action movies I watch. So, with that being said I would recommend this show to anyone who loves Ryan Gosling because he was really good in this movie, but I just don't like action movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big Fish...Big Disappointment.,"Big Fish was a poorly crafted, waste of good celluloid.  The effects were mediocre, at best and the story line was disjunct and uninspiring.  If this is any indication of the future of Burton's fantasy genre, you can have my seat.  I don't see how these actors, many of whom I respected before seeing them in this travesty, were willing to waste their time to contribute to such a poor film.  Reviews I have read, including this site's, gave the film 4 of 5 stars.  Ridiculous.  You garner no points on my scale by simply saying a movie has merit because its director has had some prior successes. In my opinion, you owe the viewers an apology for luring them in with the bait of a good film, only for them to find an rusty tin can on their line when they reel it in.

Flawless,"Of entire thing I got to say this - I love this movie. And it is really head to describe how good this film was.This movie is about life, love and friendship told in the most magical of way. A story of a son tries to reconcile with his dying father by trying to retrieve the stories that his father used to talk about himself and his unbelievable adventure.I must admit at first I have doubt if I'm going to see this or not since it seem pretty dreadful and also there not much of anything show or word of mouth saying much about this film. Three years later I finally got to see it, I feel like I was wasting all those times not getting to know how brilliant this film was.This film is great in everyway from the very second the film start to the very last second the film end. It will fill you with lots of emotion, dream, mythical adventure, and an art of storytelling. I must praise screenwriter John August to be able to bring all that into the screenplay making this one of those rare screenplay that surpass its novel.Another thing that really standout is the cast of the entire brilliant actor, Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney was so believable that they will make you cry. And Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange is so look-alike and they are so good. And it is great to see Helena Bonham Carter with a blonde hair. That make up is great and the costume is beautiful. And what best is the acting that is very believable and very emotional that they will make you cry and feel for each and every character.What another point that I like about the film is the fact that this is unlike anything that Tim has done before but somehow he still able to make it his own. The magnificent set, the style of the film and mood are very much his own. Maybe also it has something to do with the great score that add lots of mood to the movie.The movie consists of great number of metaphor, which is another thing that I like about this movie. There is a meaning to everything and it has been written beautifully and directed brilliantly. This is a truly a must own movie.Recommendation: Yes, Worth Every Penny To Buy DVD.Reason To Watch: Imaginative, Brilliant Writing, Great Directing and Acting.Reason Not To: You'll Left Wonder How The Hell This Didn't Get Any Oscar For It.Rating: 10/10 (Grade: A+).Please Rate After Read Y/N, Thanks.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful but too corny at times.,"""Big Fish"", as most people know, is a Tim Burton film. Tim Burton proved himself a great director with movies like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the recent ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". So when I sat down to watch ""Big Fish"", I expected magical and enchanting characters to float out of my screen and set my imagination off to a different planet. But it seriously disappointed me and here's why.The movie is about William Bloom (Billy Crudup), a married man with a baby on the way, who finds out that his father, Edward (Albert Finney), is dying. He returns home to see him as he feels very distant from his father and wants to reconnect with him before he dies. The reason he is so distant from his father is because his dad is always telling exaggerated stories of his magical past and William doesn't appreciate the fact that his dad can't be normal and serious like everyone else. (I know, what an idiot.) Most of the movie shows us Edward Bloom's wonderful tales, with Ewan McGregor acting as young Edward (with a Southern accent!). So the story is basically about William Bloom trying to decode his father's complicated past. What he's really trying to do though, subconsciously, is to prove his father wrong about his ""made-up"" past, so that he can rightfully accuse his father of being a liar since everything he ever said was just triggered by his wild imagination.So that's my first negative point. I hated the concept of getting all teary-eyed over a guy who can't connect with his dad. Alright, so it's nice to have an old man tell stories of his past but why add on tasteless, corny sequences of sons and fathers fighting and not talking for three years and then meeting in a hospital as the father is dying and etc., etc.!? WHY RUIN SUCH A (potentially) WONDERFUL MOVIE? The magical characters of Edward Bloom's stories were all amazing, though. Danny Devito played an eccentric circus owner while they got a real-life giant man to play the Giant in the movie. Also, Danny Elfman was great with the music as usual and Burton did an *ASTOUNDING* job with the visual effects. The only thing that TOTALLY ruined the movie for me was the corny Hollywood plot. But two thumbs up, to quote my fellow reviewers Siskel & Ebert, for everything else, especially the casting.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delightfully bittersweet fantasy,"This may be my favorite of Tim Burton's films. It's a clever, literary, memoir about a man who embellishes his life with fantasy and his son, and how they come together at the end of his life to reconcile the tall tales that weave the tapestry of his life. It's also a story about parental bonds, and learning to love as unconditionally as a parent may.Albert Finney is remarkably moving as the father in his old age, with Ewan McGregor playing the fantastic flashbacks with equal skill. The cast is excellent all around, the cinematography is - as with most Burton films - lush and gorgeous, and the story is endearing. Some may find the pace a little slow, but trust me, it's all very worth it in the end.Billy Crudup plays the son of Ed Bloom, an all American boy who has lead a charmed life. Bloom has created fantasies to embellish every major event in his life and does not distinguish them from reality. His son, who feels alienated by his father's penchant for tall tales, wants desperately to know his father before he passes on, but must slowly come to realize that he already does.While not entirely light-hearted, this is a very entertaining and good feeling film, which touches emotional depths that Burton's work rarely reaches. I recommend it without reservation to anybody who wants a bit more than simple entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't Believe The Trailer!,"When I watched the trailer for this film, I was made to believe that it would be a 'magical masterpiece' and uphold Tim Burton's strange fantasy theme, along with many claims it would win however many BAFTAs etc. I decided to spend my money on it and entered the cinema with medium expectations.For the next one and a half hours, I was presented with a FAR to literal, non-magical, emotionally inept, cliched interpretation of a jumped up love story. Ok, there were 'some' classic Burton pieces in the film, but it really didn't hold it together for me.I thought the casting had been done by a Big Fish, everyone was terrible and I felt as though they had been chosen for the role as there was no one else available at the time.Big Flop",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The beautiful Southern Belle in Burton's entourage of films,"Tim Burton in recent years has dwelled into a very familiar look, a familiar style, and to an extent a familiar cast of actors and actresses that continuously follow the man's career. But in the midst of this consistent approach to directing films in the past decade is a movie so magical, so majestic and so unlike Burton you can hardly believe it was him behind the camera. That's because Big Fish is the most emotionally-driven tale he's ever done, and this requires quite a different tactic. Big Fish is his Schindler's List, a movie that emotionally touches home to not only the viewer but to the director making it.Big Fish is about a wrecked father-son relationship that tries to heal before the father passes away. But the father continues to reveal himself through tall tale stories that blend tons of fiction with plenty of reality—although the son is determined to figure out the truth behind all the life stories. Based on a late 90s novel by Daniel Wallace, this movie follows the life of the father (and all his crazy moments) leading up to the present with him inches from death.Argue what you will about Burton's look, his selection of actors has always been superb and it's no different here. From the young Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor running the show to great smaller performances by Jessica Lange, Helena Bothman Carter and Albert Finney we have ourselves a great cast representing a great group of characters we can easily grow to love and associate with.While Burton has divulged into the typical dark Gothic look with dark gloomy backgrounds and dark gloomy material, Big Fish's Southern Gothic roots demanded a different look. And this is where Burton excels in more ways than one. The visual effects blended with the story quite well, the imagery was a beautiful mix of warm, dark, and downright colorful, and the cinematography made Alabama shine beautifully in ways that not even Forrest Gump could achieve.Beautiful is the best way to describe Big Fish; from the writing to the acting to the overall look and feel. It tackled the father-son dynamic extremely well, flowed peacefully without ever feeling boring, and kept your interests and emotional investments nice and high up until the very end.While overall this will never go down as his most popular or more iconic movie, I can and will safely say that this is one of his best films and easily his best directing performance he's ever going to deliver.And unless he can learn to expand his directing horizons, this will remain true.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Tall Tale That Tugs at Your Heartstrings,"Big Fish, directed by Tim Burton, is like a tall tale spun around a campfire-wildly exaggerated, sometimes fantastical, but always intriguing. The film follows the life of Edward Bloom, played by Albert Finney in his later years and Ewan McGregor in his youth, as his son Will, portrayed by Billy Crudup, tries to separate fact from fiction in his father's extraordinary life stories.The movie takes you on a journey through Edward's recollections, each one more outlandish than the last. He encounters a giant, a werewolf, and even joins a traveling circus led by a charismatic ringmaster, played by Danny DeVito. These fantastical adventures are interwoven with his love story with Sandra, portrayed by Jessica Lange, and their eventual marriage.At its core, Big Fish is a story about storytelling. It's about the power of myths, legends, and, yes, even tall tales in shaping our lives and relationships. Edward's tendency to exaggerate and his penchant for larger-than-life adventures become the focal point of his estranged relationship with his son. You'll find yourself grappling with the same question as Will: How much of these stories are real, and does it matter?Ewan McGregor is utterly charming as the young Edward Bloom. His portrayal captures the essence of a man who is perpetually embroiled in extraordinary circumstances. Albert Finney, as the elder Edward, exudes warmth and an irresistible aura of wonder, drawing you into the enchanting world of his stories. The film's supporting cast, including Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi, further adds to its quirky charm.Big Fish navigates between reality and fantasy with the grace of a tightrope walker. It's a visually stunning film, blending Burton's signature dark whimsy with a touch of Southern Gothic. The rural, fantastical town of Spectre, where trees bloom with shoes, is a highlight. While the movie's tall tales are often whimsical and humorous, it's the emotional depth that makes Big Fish stand out. It's a father-son story that delves into reconciliation and understanding, as Edward's stories are a form of love letter to his son, which Will slowly comes to realize.If you're in the mood for a film that's part fairytale, part family drama, and all heart, Big Fish is a cinematic experience that's larger than life. It will make you laugh, cry, and ultimately leave you contemplating the importance of storytelling and the eternal quest for truth within the tales we weave. It's a Burton masterpiece that adds a dose of warmth to his quirky style.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'Tis Like a Fine Irish Tale,"If you're Irish, you realize that the story is the key. If you're not Irish, we'll pray for you. 'Tis said that the Irish never allow the truth to get in the way of a good story. A very logical and pragmatic son has struggled with a great story teller of a dad and doesn't know fact from fiction about his father. He comes home as his father nears the end of his life and begins to investigate to try to separate the truth from the fiction in his father's tales. Tim Burton directs a wonderfully suited cast in telling this tale. As the story unfolds, the son discovers that his father isn't as crazy as he has thought and discovers a message about life that his father had been trying to pass to him. Fortunately for the son, he finds the message his father wants him to find and thus inherits a wonderful legacy of enlivening the dullness of routine existence with the wonder of fine story telling. Perhaps, for the more rational mind, the father had failed in his quest to share who he was and denied his son many years of closeness. I can certainly see that point of view. But, as a story teller myself, this movie will become one of the shining stars of my collection and I will share it with my grandchildren in the hope of widening their visions of life and their abilities to see beyond the obvious and the mundane. What a boring world it would be without great story tellers. The imagination is a wonderful thing that allows us to probe beneath the obvious. This is a wonderful film. I highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

very creative story,"I don't know what was true and what wasn't true, but it was very charming and sweet. The main part of the story was a son learning to trust and love his father--as eccentric as he seemed.Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both played Edward Bloom with a great deal of charm. Ewan played young Edward Bloom, and it was almost as if he were a part of some grand fairy tale--as is tradition with Tim Burton. Albert Finney played older Edward Bloom, and he showed again his limitless power and charisma.Helena Bonham Carter was both a young woman in love, and an old witch in this film. Her role, although memorable, was confusing to me. She meets Edward as a girl, meets him again as a young woman, and then becomes the witch that he had met as a boy. I don't get it. But it doesn't matter. I don't get cartoons either, but I still enjoy them.Note to Tim Burton: I could seriously have done WITHOUT Danny DeVito's naked butt. But thanks for the charming story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Surprisingly Moving Film,"I really didn't expect to like this film very much, because I don't consider Tim Burton to be the type of director who could handle a film about humanity. I also suspected the film might get sappy and sentimental, but he manages to stay clear of this.The film takes about ten minutes to establish itself, but once the tone is set it will hold your interest for the full two hours. This despite the lack of tired Hollywood action sequences.Billy Crudup hits all the right notes as a son who realizes he never really knew his father in any real sense. I've never seen one single frame of Crudup on film that did not ring true, and this is no exception.Overall a movie worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A tall tale told too tall,"Tim Burton's Big Fish, is basically a tall tale told by teller of tall tales. The segments of fiction were brilliant, but a movie which blends reality with outright fiction needs to keep the reality real. Otherwise the audience get lost.So . . . Paris to the US flights happen during the daylight hours, and despite the best intentions of Mr. Burton, Alabama in the 30's 40's and 50's was segregated. Even in the fictional story that fact needs to be either addressed or explained lest the viewer start to wonder what is wrong.The fact that Helen Bonham Carter played two characters was explained even when it wasn't purely necessary-there is no way that a listener would confuse the little girl grown up with the witch. We do of course, because we have seen both characters, but Billy Crudup's Will Bloom wouldn't realize that there was a problem he has never seen the witch.All of this is too bad, for otherwise it is good story well told and the acting is fine all around. Ms. Lange looks too young to be the elder Bloom's wife of contemporary years, but who will begrudge her that?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Touching and spellbinding... like a painting coming to life,"There was a time up until 2019 that BIG FISH was often aired on channel 6 but I always avoided it because I thought it would have been dumb considering the title. Well, I must have been so dumb myself! Last March I finally saw it and I ended up loving it to the point that I wanted to give a score higher than 10.During the wedding party of Will Bloom his father Edward (Albert Finney) tells the story of when his son was born he caught a huge catfish in the river using his nuptial ring as bait but Will, having heard these stories from very long, he doesn't believe them anymore and starts avoiding his father. Skip to three years later, and Edward has cancer, so he has no other choice that to tell his story to Will and Josephine.Edward (Ewan McGregor) had to stay reclused at home for three years because he grew faster than normal, then he went on his road and met a huge giant named Karl, and then they took separate ways: Will went to live in Spectre and becomes friends with poet and small time crook Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi) and the Mayor's daughter Jenny. After leaving Spectre Edward reunited with Karl and went to Amos Calloway's (Danny de Vito) circus unbeknownst to the fact that Calloway is some sort of mutant as he turned into a wolf only to return to his human form in the morning. After trying to win the love for a woman and serving in the Korean war helping two Japanese women escape from torture Edward returns in the US and reunites with Norther helping him to rob a bank that is on the verge of bankruptcy: Norther will become a broker and Edward will have the money for buying the house of his dreams.After the stories are over Edward has a stroke and Will has to stay with him in the hospital and inable to talk, Edward lets Will imagine how the story ends and they imagine to escape from the hospital and go in the near river where all the characters he met during his fantastic journey greet him. When Will arrives to the river he turns into the catfish and flees. Will, after understanding his father's love for stories, will tell the story to his son.The plot was incredibly touching and Edward's stories incredible as they sound. The settings were great and looked like from an old fairytale book, they were so spell-binding that it shows that Tim Burton put a lot of effort behind it. And the acting was great by all: McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, Buscemi as the poet turned broker, De Vito as the werewolf circus manager and the others were very endearing and their acting added a lot to the movie's greatness: and the soundtrack was on par with all the other qualities.Overall, one of Tim Burton's best movies he ever did for the subject, settings and acting. Even tho, and this is just a minor warning, some Kleenex are needed especially towards the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big Fish - Truly an influential!,"I usually don't fancy movies that are based on Fantasies, but this movie made me change my mind possible. I haven't read the novel too, but the movie is at its best in showing the entire fiction in the given 125 mins. The credit may go to two people, Tim Burton and Ewans, who are really behind the success of the movie. Both have done their best. The other key thing which also has contributed to the movie's success is the back ground score of Danny Elfman, who has really made the audience taste the ambiance of the whole scenes.The movie is combination of Art, Fantasy and Music.

Tim can do no wrong when it comes to films,"This is the first time though when I watched a Tim Burton film and was like ""huh?"". I know Tim does unusual movies, but I was a little confused. I did watch it twice, and I loved it a lot better the second time. It takes a little to get used too. I really enjoyed the ""tall tales"". I even reconized some fimilular faces. I thought Tim did an excellent job on making the film. He really captures Will's life. And the story is very charming. The ending is a tear breaker, but I won't spoil.

Burton is The Fisher King!,"Director Tim Burton's surreal & illusionary cinematic techniques have taken us to mystical lands such as: Gotham City, Planets of Apes, Scissor Worlds, Edywood, and Mars. However, mainstream film buffs have been appalled by Burton's outlandish direction. Along comes `Big Fish', Burton's latest flick. Without a doubt, this is Burton's most mainstream film. `Big Fish' will hook those conservative moviegoers along with Burton's cult fanatics. Ewan Mcgregor stars as Ed Bloom. Ed is definitely not a late `bloomer' because of his vivid life and the eccentric characters he befriends along the way. Albert Finney co-stars as the late `bloomer; or should I say the older Ed Bloom who tells his suspicious off-center life tales to his estranged son. The tales might sound fishy to his son Will, played by Billy Crudup, but he listens to them because of his dad's near mortal condition. Alison Lohman, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Devito round out the acting pond in this thespian school of fish. `Big Fish' possesses sentimental humanistic elements unseen in Burton's previous films. The film, which runs to 130 minutes, could have been shorter in duration but `Big Fish' is still worth the bait. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but could have been way better: 7/10,"I am a huge Tim Burton fan. I am a sucker for stories of unbounded imagination. I love warm feelings.Well, this film has a bit of all - but it could have been way better, I think. Yes there is the Burton touch, but far from at its best. Yes there is some imagination, but far from being imaginative - if I dare say. Many of the imaginary (or not) events and places are modestly surprising, when I was expecting much more (remember Terry Gilliam's Adventures of Baron Munchausen - now THAT was wild, and in the end also the doubters were in for a surprise). Even the warm feelings, while there, and the father and son story, while there, are a bit diluted, not as efficient as they might have been in the hands of a Tim Burton at his best.I guess it just goes to show that even Tim Burton cannot always get it fully right - and/or it goes to show that Tim Burton has continuously raised our expectations about his talent, which increases the risk of disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Like watching a dream,"Tim Burton is a genius, with a child like imagination that translates onto the big screen blissfully. Big Fish is an incredibly imaginative portrayal of the book version, with a refreshing style, and beautiful cinematography. Big Fish is a movie that takes you on a dream like trip through incredibly unique worlds. This is a movie that really sucks the viewer in, allowing them feel every emotion, and inspiring them to never give up their ability to imagine.The casting was incredibly well done. Helen Bonham Carter, just as she is in all Tim Burton films plays her characters wonderfully, giving us her dark side, and her light side. Billy Crudup was an excellent choice for the bitter son of Albery Finney. Ever since seeing him in Without Limits, I have really appreciated his acting. His frustration with his fathers overactive imagination and his search for answers runs smoothly with the fantastic plot of this story.We also are lucky enough to catch glimpses of Steve Buscemi, Missy Pyle, and Danny Devito who really fit in with the feel of this film.If you want to laugh, even cry, and ultimately be inspired, this is the movie for you. It will leave a mark on you and you will keep coming back to it. It begins well, and ends perfectly. I recommend this movie to everyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fishy Film,"This movie was honestly pretty confusing and felt like a brain rot. However, I did like the concept of the son trying to understand the father through his stories. Despite the complications of the stories, the overall idea of the movie was sweet in how William puts in his best efforts to fully be conscious of his actions. I really liked the general moral in the story that, ""the lies we tell ourselves to keep going and the anger we feel at being lied to"". It ties the story together as a whole and gives the audience a better understanding of the movie. I'd give this movie overall a 6/10 because honestly it just wasn't my cup of tea.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you liked this movie, and you haven't seen Magnolia, then you should definitely check it out.  An All Star cast, great acting, better writing, and all around a better film.

The bright side of Tim Burton,"Being so far from Tim Burton's usual style, it exceeds expectations. It is artistically and thematically beautiful. The way each character is portrayed and the environments that they interact with are so nuanced. It merges fantasy great with reality, containing lighting that allows the audience to easily distinguish between the two. The story revolves around love. It focuses on life, then onto love as you'd see in a romance, only to finish with an incredibly touching relationship between father and son.

"I'm not a Tim Burton fan, but...","I usually find Burton's films to be somewhat tedious, over done with effects and generally not that entertaining. Of course there are exceptions. I loved Ed Wood for one. But this film, well, is simply beyond description. And I mean this in the best way possible.Performances are stunning. Danny DeVito, Jessica Lange...a cast that is at its, their best being incredible. Billy Crudup might be the most underrated actor of his generation, and he doesn't disappoint in this role. It's a fairy tale sort of. Maybe not. It's a fantasy or many fantasies or a big lie or the hard truth about a father and his son. Their journey together or alone through their life. Lot's of tales told by a master. Lot's of questions and doubt from his son. Great tales though. Incredible stories. Unbelievable characters. Or are they? I don't know how to explain this movie. Let's just say that when it ends, you just might find yourself wanting it to start all over again. Not because it has any kind of socially redeeming message or is to difficult to understand.

The truth can be relative.,"In this film we see Will Bloom's efforts (Billy Crudup) to know the true life story of his father, Ed (Albert Finney / Ewan McGregor), who's dying and that is reputed to be a great storyteller, but never tell the truth about his own past.The family and family ties are very present in this film, which seeks to show how important its to know and understand our family. What is the barrier that separates truth from falsehood? Can a man, telling the truth, be lying? Can what seems a lie to be the truth? The truth can seem like a lie? Who Is Ed Bloom, what's his past?

Nothing but sheer BURTON Genius!,"This movie is incredible! The imagination it took to create the book and movie is astounding.

I went into this movie wondering how good it was going to be because of the cover...but I soon found out...(to use a cliché:) never to judge a movie by its cover.

To sum up the movie in one phrase: Simply one of the most interesting and beautiful stories ever told!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical!,"This is a film about a young man, Will Bloom, who grew up with his father's stories. His father, Edward Bloom, is quite the storyteller, his stories are peculiar- magical! Though they have resulted in Will feeling as though he doesn't know his father- that his father is almost like a character in a fairy tale. It is to be expected since, Edward Bloom's stories revolve around witches, giants, creatures who are man by day, and wolves by night. And all these creatures, Edward Bloom, tells stories about, he also claims to have met them and, that they exist. Cute when you tell these stories to a five year old, but to a thirty year old? Not so much.And so, Will is convinced that: 'A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal.' Edward Bloom can tell the same story over and over, and Will is getting tired of all the silly stories. For, he is now presented with quite the challenge: to tell his father's story. His father is battling with cancer, and doesn't have a lot of time left. And Will is wondering what he will describe of his father, to his future children? He finds it near 'impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth."" But still, when he makes plans to visit his gravely ill father, it is with the intention of finally being able to understand him, even if his father doesn't always make sense.This film touched a nerve with me. I'm the type of person who likes to tell children stories. The weirdest sort: from how animals speak English when people are sleeping, and the latest being that werewolves are real, as are vampires. I'm still trying to convince them of tooth-fairies. But I see little hope. How they believe in werewolves of all things, but not tiny flying people, is beyond me. Especially when they get a coin after every tooth. They have no such proof for the existence of werewolves! See why I see little hope? Anyway, I'm sure you've now concluded that I receive a great deal of satisfaction after successfully 'lying' to a child. Of course, when the child is older they'll tell the same lies-that I'm sure. But in some ways I feel like this is the sort of film that makes you guilty for all the lies you've ever told. I mean, what if my child grows up believing I'm nothing but a liar? That because all my stories were lies, that I too am a liar? Or what if I take a lie too far? Personally I don't see this happening, I am in a habit of forgetting whatever it is I lied about, but this is what Edward Bloom did with his son. Of course, this is a film based on a story. But it still raises a valid point.But then, there's the flip side. The magic, the wonder, the incredible change in perspective: you have the power to change a child's life. All, by shaping just how they see the world. That's some power, and I'll like to put it to a good use. As Roald Dahl says there's magic in everything. So why can't we give our children a small peek at what they will one day find for themselves?The film represents both sides: Will is the realist, he wants the facts. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And then there's Edward Bloom, he's the crazy storyteller who may just convince you his stories are more than stories. When their two perspectives meet, what will happen?I recommend this film for parents to watch with your young children. For those times when you're struggling to have them believe in tooth-fairies! Maybe I just care too much since my own parents weren't much for telling stories, I was that kid who would look forward to the story telling sessions at school and shushing the others when they so much as whispered something over the teacher's words.NB: I gave this film four stars only because it left me feeling a little confused at the end. So parents, be warned. But with children, I don't see how you'll have any problem! Well, in my experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excessively sentimental,"First, I've got to say Tim Burton movies are always visually great to look at, and this is no exception.

The stories where just plain boring and didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt his visual style and to appeal to the most sentimental of viewers. And this movie wears on you; the longer it goes on, the more it becomes unbearable to watch, which makes the 2 hour runtime seem like an eternity.I guess people that like their movies mawkish would like this one (which by looking at the IMDb rating it appears that there are a lot of people like that), but I'm not one of them.

An ordinary story made extraordinary by Burton's imagination,"¨There are some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they are faster or stronger than other fish, they're just touched by something extra.¨ Big Fish is a beautiful film that truly captures our hearts by its brilliant storytelling; and it couldn't have been directed by any other than the great and imaginative storyteller himself: Tim Burton. Daniel Wallace's novel, Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions, could have been a disaster in the making if not put in the right hands because the novel is all about imagination and storytelling. Many movies have destroyed stories similar to this one because the effect that imagination has when we read a book isn't translated in the same way when we see a film. Very few directors leave room for imagination in their movies, but thankfully Tim Burton is one of them. He creates a very beautiful, artistic, and imaginative scenery, and the cinematography in Big Fish is also brilliant. He can turn a simple story into an extraordinary one with his artistic sense. Big Fish is actually all about storytelling and teaching us how our lives can remain immortal through the stories we tell. People can remember us by the stories we've told and left behind in the minds of those we've touched. John August (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) did a magnificent job with the screenplay adaptation as well. The entire movie worked well as a whole thanks to the great scenery, great performances from the entire cast, and great dialogues. The movie is great from start to finish, it's truly beautiful; the scenes and characters will stick in your head even long after you've seen it.Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) has just been diagnosed with cancer and as he lays in his deathbed his son, Will (Billy Crudup), begins recollecting his past and trying to separate fiction from facts. Ed has always been a storyteller, and Will used to love to hear these fantastical stories about how his father caught an uncatchable fish, married the woman of his dreams, and set out to do big things in the world, but as he grew older he became resentful towards his father who always spent a lot of time away from home and making up stories that in his opinion weren't true. Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard), wants him to make up with his dad before he passes away. Ed however claims they shouldn't worry because he's seen the way he was going to die and it wasn't like this. That was just one of his many stories and it's exactly how Will begins recreating the story of his father. When Ed was a young boy he visited an old witch (Helena Bonham Carter) who showed him the way he was going to die through her glass eye. We later see Ed as a young adult (played by Ewan McGregor) trying to make a big name for himself in the small time he grew up in. He achieves many great things, but realizes the town is just too small for him so he decides to move on to a big city for greater things. He takes a journey that leads him into various interesting characters, such as Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), the poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), the Siamese twins Ping and Jing (Ada Tai and Arlene Tai), his future wife Sandra Bloom (Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange as the old Sandra), and a circus owner named Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). Will tries to make sense of these stories in order to figure out what is fact and what is fiction so he can finally understand his father.Several of the stories are unbelievable, but they are extremely funny and worth listening too. The performances from Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney as Ed Bloom are really heartwarming as well. Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito are hilarious in their supportive roles, and Alison Lohman is breathtaking in her role as the sweet Sandra. This was also Marion Cotillard's first American film and she has made quite a name for herself by now. Helena Bonham Carter also had a remarkable role and she is as strange as ever. Billy Crudup has the most serious role as his character is more of a fact sort of guy and is tired of listening to all the stories his father has told him for years expecting him to believe them. He is also very credible as Will Bloom. The entire cast is actually a delight on screen and Big Fish works in great part thanks to their performance. The artistic scenery also caught my attention and it played a huge part in the storytelling. No one could've done it better than Tim Burton himself. By the end of the movie I guarantee you will feel touched and moved by this great story which is also helped out by having a powerful ending. It is just one of those pictures that will be hard to get off your mind for quite some time so I really recommend this film because this is the way stories should be told.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An effective & moving adaptation of Daniel Wallace's wonderful novel.,"I've been a fan of Tim Burton since ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" in 1985, and although his choice of both narrative (""Ed Wood"" vs. ""Mars Attacks"") and presentation (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" vs. ""Nightmare Before Xmas"" or ""Corpse Bride"") vary wildly, his courage to tackle unusual and challenging projects is a large part of his appeal. There are consistent elements to a Burton project that stamp it as uniquely his vision.namely: rich and unusual characters, a dark, dry sense of humor, and vivid and imaginative use of color, all of which work beautifully in the film.Burton's sense of humor is dark, dry and very intelligent. He doesn't pander to the 'lowest denominator' when creating films - he respects his audience enough not to talk down to them. There is often a good deal of subtext to his dialogue and repeated viewings are often rewarded with humorous details that went unnoticed the first time around. He treated ""Big Fish"" with a lighter, loving hand than in certain of his other films  respecting both the importance of the ""tall tale"" and the delicate bond between father and son.Burton took a few liberties in adapting Wallace's narrative (as is to be expected, due to the limitations of the different genres.) His decision for Edward to convince Carl the Giant to run off to the big city, and take him along, provided him the opportunity to introduce a whole new colorful setting to work with: the circus. This gave him a springboard for several plot points (Edward meeting his future wife, the giant and Edward both finding visually-interesting employment), and condensed many of the novel's stories into one for the sake of time constraints. It also provided Edward with a 'sidekick,' a common convention in a quest fable (or 'roadtrip movie'.) The basic theme of the movie centers around a father & son with very different personalities attempting making peace and find a connection. On one level, Will resented his father for denying him what he felt was his right to know the 'real' man behind the myths. But the reality is, the ""fables"" Edward created to describe his life were as ""real"" as the facts themselves  contained within the 'fish stories' were the truths, the lessons, Edward wanted to impart, and conveyed the overall image of his own life as he wished to be remembered.One of the messages of the film is that it is impossible to truly know anyone completely. Our perceptions and assumptions (whether accurate or not) inevitably color our impression of who a person is. We can't ever know the truth of a person's life  all we have to work with are the parts they reveal to us, and the fictions we unconsciously generate to fill the gaps.William always resented his father for what he considered 'avoiding reality' by 'inventing tall tales' about his own life history. But Edward has his own perspective: ""You're not necessarily supposed to believe it. You're just supposed to believe in it."" The process of the father trying to communicate to his son the importance of living ""larger than life"" and not allowing himself to be constrained by the petty restrictions of mundane life makes for a very moving, and wonderfully told, tale.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There are stories and there are lies and they are different,"Big Fish is about a man who tells stories. He does not utter untruths with the deliberate intent to deceive, he merely embellishes what is already there to make it more interesting. His son (and some reviewers) does not understand this. The story about Edward Bloom is told by himself, in the form of his stories rather than as a straightforward narrative of his life. There have been lots of traveling salesmen who have mad a middling success of their lives. The world is full of their grandchildren who do not even know their full names, much less anything interesting. My grandfather was on the first trip an electric car took the length of the state of Connecticut when he was 20. Not much there. My grandfather was a charter member of the American Automobile Association, known as the AAA. Back in the early days AAA members would survey routes and contribute their notes to the AAA travel books. And thus a story begins. Beats hell out of that other one-sentence narrative, and it is not a lie, it has decorative flourishes. And that's what Edward Bloom was about and that is what his son learns about his father who was loved by many more people than he suspected.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Quirky and heartwarming, clouded in sort of a haze that's hard to untangle but I don't feel compelled to untangle it","This movie really was unlike anything I've ever seen-quirky and heartwarming, clouded in sort of a haze that's hard to untangle but as the audience, I don't feel compelled to untangle it. I think it's really the best Tim Burton output that I've seen, a work that expands beyond the aggressively weird remainder of his filmography to reach a more mainstream audience, while still retaining that signature weirdness factor that makes Tim Burton Tim Burton.Visually, I think this is where the film shines brightest. Some of the cinematography and set designs are some of the most beautifully whimsical images I've ever seen in a live-action film-that shot of Ewan McGregor standing in the field of daffodils was instantly iconic and well-worth the effort to create said field. While the overarching story felt pretty touch-and-go and the film felt a touch long on the journey to the end, the individual vignettes of stories from the old man's youth themselves were engaging and well-written, and honestly, the ending tied it all together into a much better final product than it would've been otherwise. I enjoyed this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Big Fish, small movie","Watching a movie like 'Big Fish' I realized I am sick of 'fantasy'. I am sick and tired of watching so false and artificial stories. So overwhelmingly decorated that they seem birthday cakes: look good, taste bad. The minor lies beneath this movie are nothing in comparison with the major lies. Black doctors delivering white babies? Black kids in white churches? In the '40? In Alabama? These are just little examples of 'real fantasy', if you excuse the oxymoron. The political correctness is the main lie, by no means the only one: Britons speaking like southerners? 33 years old guys acting as teenagers? Etc. This fantasy, decorated with corny FXs and clichés, does not deserve its fame as a great movie. It's just a medium entertainment if you don't have anything else to do. Certainly, Tim Burton improved his performance in comparison with the abominable 'Planet of Apes' but he is still very far from his best shape ('Ed Wood', 'Batman', 'Sleepy Hollow'). 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Between the reality and imagination,"I really like Tim Burton movies.When I see this movie first on title I undoubtedly want to watch it because I know Burton's style.He likes fairy tales,surrealism,animation and make funny movies.Big Fish also contains some stuff like this.The topic is focused on the line between reality and imagination.Secondly comes The relationship between fathers and their sons and maybe the biggest problem between them ""Not to be tolerant to personalities"". In this movie for example; The father is very imaginative, rather frequently storyteller man but the boy is realistic and unhappy because of his father is a storyteller in his all dialogs.This is basically the topic of the movie.Also Burton is very good at taking people's attention to movie with it's ability of storytelling and make it into motion picture.Secondly the visuals of the movie is very nice, there are very different and fabulous characters and places in the movie.These are adding a dream atmosphere into the movie.Finally this is a great movie.Sometimes dialogs are boring and always focusing on to the main character but stories in the movie are very nice, visuals is great so this is a movie that you shouldn't be skipped.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

never disappoints,"My favorite Tim Burton flick by far, which is a high bar indeed. Holds up over time & with repeated viewings. Unlike some of Burton's efforts, there are no wincing moments in the grand Southern Fable. Top shelf performances from all, with a distinguished cast, pulling out all the stops. Bold & stunning cinematography from Philippe Rousselot matched by the superb set/art work/special .
Daniel Wallace's Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions, proved the perfect vehicle for Tim Burton's over the top directorial magic.
This story requires concentration, but gives back great dividends for the effort expended. Almost bought me a Red Dodge Charger on account of this epic, elegiac, feel good flick. An all time great, IMHO.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quirky and lovable - Burton just about carries it off this time,"One of the quirkiest and lost lovable of films, Big Fish is about a grandfather who has perfected the art of telling bedtime stories. His stories are all made up, all feature fictionalised episodes from his own past life, and polished to a degree that make them in demand to children and adults alike (except to his own grown-up children, who have heard them once too often). The second most difficult thing about grandfather Ed Bloom is that he is constantly telling these stories. The most difficult thing is that, when it comes to his own life, he tells nothing else.Most of the film is devoted to putting these stories into pictures, just as he tells them. Fantastical, endlessly inventive and incredibly entertaining, they would be enough for a film itself if only aimed at children; but what makes Big Fish a joy for adults as well as kids is that Ed Bloom's life becomes more than that, it becomes an illustration of the fantastic within all of us and how valuable that it. He is a self-mythologizing man, a living example of the magic that can put a sparkle of wonder in a child's eye, and remind us that imagination is a wonderful thing, not just for storytelling, but to realise the greatness within each of us. It is also one of whimsical and visionary director Tim Burton's most rounded and mature films to date, and makes good use of a star studded cast that includes Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi. A film to leave you smiling all the way home.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sometimes we try too hard...,"That was a lovely surprise. Another film on my Watchlist that I eventually got round to watching on a lazy day, not expecting much, but expecting something. But not what I got.I guess I wasn't expecting the fantastical element - the flashbacks to a past life full of carefree and wondrous adventures. On the other hand, being directed by Tim Burton and with a cast including Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi, Albert Finney and Helena Bonham Carter, what else was there to expect? A straight story told my an old man to his straight son, in a straight up-an-down past? Hardly at all.A well put together story in the vein of Forrest Gump - not quite at that epic level, but still a fascinating and endearing narrative, calmly told and full of hope.There was nothing cheesy or overly exaggerated about a film which, in reality, is just a fabricated tale of events. Think about the Chinese twins at the end. Did you expect them to be joined at the hip, or not? I have no idea how much is true, exaggerated or completely fabricated. But I don't have a problem with any of that.Is there an underlying message to this story? Will I be thinking about it in starts and fits in two or three days time? Probably not, but it's still a lovely film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Big Fish"" is visually inviting and suggests different paths for its interpretation and, after all, not everything that is improbable is impossible","In the final scene of Big Fish, narrator Will Bloom says a sentence that sums up, in a few words, the meaning of his father's life (and the movie we are watching). He says: ""A man transforms himself in his own stories. They live even after his death. And that's how he becomes immortal."" Indeed, Edward Bloom is a genuine storyteller. All of his life events-from the most trivial to the most extraordinary-take on new value and new meanings when inserted into his narratives. In his trajectory, ""it is impossible to separate inventions from facts, man from myth"".It is only fitting, therefore, that John August's great screenplay (adapted from Daniel Wallace's book) begins with a typical fisherman's 'story' - a narrative involving an impossible fish and the alliance of the Edward. Unfortunately, despite being an exceptional storyteller (after all, he spent his whole life practicing), the guy ends up awakening sorrows in his son, who resents never hearing his father tell something 'real' about himself. So, when informed that Edward is dying, young Will Bloom decides to return home (accompanied by his pregnant wife) with the aim of finally trying to 'meet' his father - who, in turn, does not miss the opportunity to relate. Her 'experiences' for her daughter-in-law, who, after all, is nothing more than a new audience.And what ""experiences"": for Edward, nothing is prosaic. In describing how he saw his wife for the first time, for example, he explains how 'time stops' when we meet 'our great love' (in a beautiful shot that takes this concept literally). In addition, his stories involve figures such as giants, witches and gigantic fish, giving rise to extremely fanciful incidents that capture the viewer's imagination in a ravishing way.The audience is therefore invited to delve into Edward's adventures and reflect on the impact of these stories on the construction of the father-son relationship. For this, the protagonist's life is presented in a linear way and the film makes clear its use of exaggeration. The quality of Tim Burton's direction is evidenced here. He always manages to present fantasy as improbable; never as impossible. Thus, he suggests to the viewer that there are reliable parts in the construction of his main character. This is the link between drama and fantasy, with a dash of adventure. There are imaginary elements that are so believable that they engender the dramatic tone of the events presented. As the director's hallmark, the fantasy is also metaphorical, dark and fun. Among his allegories, it is possible to discuss the position we assume in relation to cinema; especially to Hollywood cinema. If Edward represents the proposals of mainstream cinema, Will represents the spectator. Will progresses from the naive gaze, through intense criticism, to a stage where he accepts the story factory.In fact, it is precisely the magnitude of Edward's exploits that explains the metaphor described by the film's title: like a large fish that dies by being confined in an aquarium too small for its dimensions, Edward is a man who, despite not having colossal ambitions, has immense energy and an impressive pleasure in life - and, like fish (which need to constantly swim so they can 'breathe'), immobility (read: monotony) can be fatal to him.This characteristic, by the way, is brilliantly portrayed by the two interpreters who give life to Edward: Ewan McGregor, who embodies the character in his younger phase, reveals intelligence by showing him always smiling - even in the most difficult moments - and facing problems with unshakable self-confidence. Albert Finney, on the other hand, takes on the difficult task (which he performs with his usual efficiency) of illustrating, for the public, how Edward is tortured by the limitations imposed by his poor health, which prevent him from leaving the house. To make things more interesting, the casting of McGregor, Finney and Perry Walston (who plays the character at the age of ten) was extremely happy, as the three of them really look alike, which gives greater authenticity to the story. Incidentally, the same goes for Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange, who, despite being little explored by the film, convince as the two versions (at different ages) of the same character.Making the most of the inventiveness of August's script, filmmaker Tim Burton shows himself entirely at ease in this universe - which, after all, is not too far removed from those seen in his previous works, such as Ghosts Have Fun, Edward Hands- de-Scissors and Batman (plus, of course, the wonderful Nightmare Before Christmas, which, despite being directed by Henry Selick, bears the unmistakable mark of Burton, who not only produced it but also worked on the story's conception and of the film's look). It's no wonder that one of Big Fish's main attractions lies in the production design of the talented Dennis Gassner, regular partner of the Coen brothers.In the same way, the photography by the Frenchman Philippe Rousselot stands out for giving the appropriate atmosphere to each sequence, from the scary to the romantic - and its preciousness deserves applause: observe, for example, how the face of the young Sandra Bloom always appears brighter than than the rest of the environment (and, at times, almost in soft focus), illustrating the ethereal, romanticized way Edward sees her. Danny Elfman, who was present in the soundtracks of almost all the director's films, mixed the songs of the time with instrumental themes to illustrate Ed's stories very well, and even in scenes that deserve our greatest visual attention, the soundtrack does not go unnoticed. . The soundtrack that packs the entire final act of the plot leads the viewer in a brilliant and exciting way. No wonder Elfman received a more than deserved Oscar nomination for this work.The dramatic structure of Big Fish is very simple, the narration helps to glue the different moments, between the present with Ed already old and his hyper fanciful mini-stories, thus serving as an epitaph for the evil that must soon hit him, since he is sick, to the point of even giving up the chemotherapy he was doing. The relationship of the old man with his heir continues despite the contempt of the second, who even begins to change his posture, slightly, becoming sympathetic to his father basically out of compassion via convalescence.Because it is a film divided by short stories, the story is episodic, similar to Amazing Stories, an old series that Steven Spielberg produced, which in turn tried to modernize the themes of Twilight Zone and Fifth Dimension with a more fanciful and playful guise. The circus approach that Burton produces here already brings together some of the visual elements that would wear out in his filmography, there is a lot in common of this work with the future The Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland and even The Home of Peculiar Children, in particular in the matter of varnishing bizarre figures with a hyper colorful atmosphere and full of cuteness, but here, it fits, since even that is discreet.Big Fish"" is visually inviting and suggests different paths for its interpretation. Great entertainment, works its fantasy and drama nuances well. By bringing the father-son relationship to the screen, it suggests a dramatic arc that could be better developed. In his metalanguage, he shows that the act of telling stories is always in tension with the search for the truth of the facts. As a souvenir, it leaves an example of the universe of Tim Burton and an invitation for reflection. After all, not everything that is improbable is impossible.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""There are some fish that cannot be caught.""","A lovely, touching film that has only gotten better over time. Big Fish has many detractors, even among people who are normally big fans of Tim Burton. I wonder if these people expect that every film he does should look the same? Because by the time Big Fish came out, he was frankly in a rut. I think it's his most unique film and certainly one of his best. The performances by the cast are all excellent, particularly the supporting players. As the present-day Edward and Sandra, Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are every bit as good as you would expect from these vets. As the younger Ed and Sandra, Ewan McGregor and Alison Lohman both hold their own, though Lohman gets little to do. McGregor's Southern accent is a little over the top but this is a story about a man who was over the top so it doesn't really hurt anything. The rest of the cast is great. The look of the film is superb. I do wish he could have made it without much CGI (the ""big fish,"" for example, looked extremely fake). But I realize that I'm fighting an uphill battle asking that of mainstream directors these days. Anyway, great film. Heartfelt and magical. A tribute to storytellers. It's also the film debut of Miley Cyrus but we'll forgive it for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Outstanding, in spite of ...","I did not care much for the performance of Ewan McGregor and I am not a fan of Albert Finney.  In spite of that, I thought the movie was absolutely outstanding.  My wife and I watched ""Love Actually"" the night before and after seeing ""Big Fish"" we had no doubt that we saved the better for last. Perhaps, for those who didn't care for it, a certain amount of experience with people you don't care for until you come to understand them and then realize how nice they really are helps.  The fact that it reminded me of my dad who passed away several years ago and whom I miss very much made the ending more poignant for me.  But, I liked the movie before that.In a way, the movie was a bit of a mystery with the viewer trying to figure out just what was true and what was not as the story progressed.  Such clues as the fact that older Ed was always thirsty, which implied that the fish story was more significant than the others, and the obvious significance of the town of Specter gave the viewer a lot to think about.  I think that for me, trying to solve the riddle was what held my attention: and then, given all that, the ending made perfect sense.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad Casting,"Albert Finney is a great actor, but he ain't from the South, no way, no how. Five Southern kids in the woods, with four of them white and the other black; it may be politically correct, but it's not correct for the time and place. And a black physician treating an elderly white guy, see problem above. Don't get me wrong, I actually liked the movie and found it quite moving at the end, but I think there were some major gaffes in it. Believe it or not, I actually found Nicole Kidman and Jude Law (in Cold Mountain) more believable as Southerners than Albert Finney.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Wonderful Story, A Captivating Film","In short, one of the best films I have ever seen. The story is funny, but not comic and very touching, but not sad. It caught me from the beginning and held me, captivated, through the end. The distinctions between reality and fantasy are clearly defined and beautifully intertwined. I should think that all who see this film, with the exception of the young perhaps, can relate to some our all of the emotional aspects behind the story. In fact, the film has made me anxious to read the novel. Having not read the novel I can only comment on the story itself and hope that the screenplay represents as much depth as I anticipate that the novel will. The cinematography is stunning and at times breathtakingly beautiful. The acting is superb, especially from Finney and McGregor who complete the main character both precisely and with supreme conviction. The entire cast simply fit in to the story, made it real and brought it to life. The direction? Well it is Tim Burton after all and that is what really drew me to see the film in the first place. So being a fan I can't say that my opinion would be completely objective but I believe this to be perhaps his best work to date, in the commercial realm at least. Well done once again, Mr. Burton! This film, much as the life of the main character, will live on for a long time. I certainly will carry this story with me, like a few of the more flamboyant and colorful people in my life, in my heart until I can't remember anything anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magnificent potential sadly stupefied.,"There was just so much to like here, a great idea and then the flaws started.  The middle drags so badly I thought is it ever going to pick up steam ? Poor Albert Finney's accent comes and goes with each scene change. Jessica Lange glows.  The love story shines - the scene in the daffodil field is wonderful. Ewan McGregor is awesome as the younger Bloom. The scene in the hospital room is a marvel.  However, the unevenness of the scenes and continuity stalls the story and the ending just whacks you over the head too harshly. I would have been more satisfied if the ""stories"" had been left as a question mark, with perhaps only Will seeing the characters at the end. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great family and fatherhood movie in an adventure wrapping,"I really like how the story rolls out quite fast using the back and forth flow style but still maintaining focus and delivering just enough detail to build up at the very beginning. The next moments also introduces nice variations by having not just one person telling the stories. I like how Tim Burton can get the story to be so alive with all those fantastic details. And there is a really nice positive message conveyed through the father and son interaction scenes. Ewan McGregorr did great in making the fantastic story feels alive, while Albert Finney did nice to build the older version of Ed Bloom to have a deeper character while still retaining the story teller's enthusiasm. Billy Crudup did okay in building up the balancing angle for the story. Marion Cotillard gave a nice color in completing the whole story. Helena Bonham Carter did very nice in keeping the little girl's character, and she is also very pretty in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Three tales about Big Fish - one man's impressions of a very busy, ambitious film.","Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a sick old man. His son (Billy Crudup) is frustrated by the fact that he's spent his entire life telling tall tales instead of really talking about himself. So, to tell us about his father as a young man (Ewan McGregor), Crudup only has these stories to tell us.Obviously an intensely personal film for Burton, who is really here telling us a tale about his own father.* I could imagine it all before I saw it. Or maybe I felt the exact content of it wasn't relevant - the initial idea said everything there was to say: man tells tall tales instead of talking, son is not impressed. I could imagine these fairy tales from watching the previews. Just tall tales.* Or maybe its because I just found the character of Burton's father so frustrating. Always claiming he cares so much about people and about life in his stories, yet not caring enough to talk with them like a human being. Stories make nice movies; but would i take them instead of life?Burton isn't naive to this. Its the conflict at the centre of the film.But i just couldn't forgive Albert Finney's character. Burton clearly can. That's the problem with too-personal projects. You can't be objective about what you expect the audience to be experiencing while they watch it - because your own experience of it is informed by so much that's offscreen. So of course Burton can forgive Finney, because he's his own father! You love him despite the fact that he's a selfish, frustrating old rat. But he's not my father, or anybody else's - why should we forgive him?* Its such a busy film, too. Burton really shot for the moon with this one. He tries to tell us a million movies at once: every five minutes a new movie, and frankly I didn't care about any of them. The twenty minute tangents into his fathers' stories had about as much dramatic tension as my own grandfather's stories. They were all just silly stories his father was telling. I thought the gawdy colours were too much for the same reason.6/10. I find his simpler films like Edward Scissorhands more profound and beautiful: less is indeed more. Maybe I just didn't like Billy Crudup (BO-RING! Think robotic Hayley-Joel in Secondhand Lions). It didn't work for me.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I don't see how this movie got an 8 out of 10...,"It would be strong to say that I hated the movie, and maybe my expectations were too high going into it, but other than the story being a pretty original idea, I didn't really like it and wasn't entertained much at all. I hadn't seen this in the theater and as soon as it came out on DVD I checked IMDB for ratings & reviews.  When I saw that it had got 8 out of 10 rating, plus it was a father son / fantasy movie, I raced over to blockbuster to rent it thinking for sure I would have liked it.  Sadly enough and to my surprise, it did nothing for me.  I did watch it pretty late in the day and found myself yawning and wondering when it would pick up, but in my opinion any good movie would keep me awake no matter what time I watch it.As I said, it had a pretty original story, and the acting was certainly believable.  For me though I had a hard time just simply enjoying the fantasy and imagination of the stories and how they unfolded when instead I focused on the credibility of them and the damage it was causing to his son. Don't get me wrong I am a movie freak and my favorite movies are action, Sci-Fi, fantasy, and horror, so I depend heavily on the make believe.  I like a good drama too, but in this movie, I think too because I am a father, I sided more with the son in that, I just saw him as a terrible father, possibly terrible husband too.  I kept thinking to myself, now here's a guy who apparently wasn't satisfied with his normal life so he creates this second life, most of which is fantasy, but you don't really know which is fact and fiction.  But because he was a good story teller and such a social person, the stories were enjoyed by most rather than just passed off as a pathological liar.  I might have been able to get in the spirit of that, but his son resented him for it and I guess so did I.  I think too it struck to close to home for me as it reminded me partly of my own father in that I can't ask the guy what time it is without him telling me how to build a clock.  Or if I try to tell him about something, he'll interrupt me and go off on some tangent story himself.  Another pet peeve of mine is that it pains me to see parents mistreat there kids or tell them lies and from one perspective that's all this movie is about.  In one scene the son told his father that he didn't know anything about the real him because all he got were these fantasy stories rather than stories of how his father really was. And because he too was going to become a father he wanted his son to know the real him.  In this scene I cried out `Amen!'  But in the end (which was pretty un-climactic), because his father was dying and more or less to make piece with him, the son reluctantly told him a story of how he dies, or moves on I should say.I guess another issue that bothered me was that the father was always seen as a man who was a good person and who helped others out because he was such a good person.  And here he ended up buying up a whole town (which appeared to be a true story) in order to preserve it.  But again rather than admiring him for that I kept thinking, that his son and wife never saw him because he was too busy working and keeping up this other life.  It's kind of like feeding others when your own family starves, and I guess that's the feeling that I came away with on this movie.  It shocks me quite frankly that it received 8 out of 10 as very few movies hit that mark.  I have thought that Tim Burton's past movies have been really good, this one just didn't sit too well with me.  But as it stands now, it's in the top 250 movies of all time (shocking), so it must be worth a watch.  Hope you like it and get more out of it than I did.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was certainly something,"I had never heard about this movie until now. According to those around me, it was ""the movie ever"". As someone who doesn't watch films as often as I used too, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went into this film blind. I have to say I liked the beginning of the film and how the dad's story about catching the biggest fish was told while showing different periods of Will's life and how the magic of the story started dwindling as he got older. That perfectly set up the entire film with the theme of Will being so indifferent about his father and how he didn't want to be like him since he and his wife were expecting a kid. I think that this movie perfectly shows how being on one side of a spectrum to the extreme can lead to different outlooks on life. On one end we had Edward, the free thinker and the other end was Will, who was more of a logical person. Although., I will have to say that I did not like how the stories that Edward told were directed. It felt choppy and sometimes really fast. I get that it's an older movie but I just can't get over that part. Overall decent movie, probably will not watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Seriously, if father-son relationships tug at you, you MUST see this movie. I thought about this movie for quite some time afterwards. I have not done a power calculation to see if this is statistically significant or not, but almost every guy I asked loved it and almost every woman thought it was dumb.

At the crossroad of life's components,"In a time where the movies industry can build a 2-hour show with plenty of precisely timed plot twists and epic audiovisual effects it needs, at least, patience and courage to enjoy a film like 'Big Fish'. Tim Burton wishes to deliver a deeply human myth and begins his effort by the obvious trick: all tricks to the minimum! Even those used, are, more or less, a mere visualization of the spoken tales: how many times have you listened to your grandpa talking about his giant friend who could move heavy rocks (500kg each), or of his second friend who once caught a 10kg fish using his sardine fishing line?The story behind 'Big Fish' has many readings. I used the word 'myth' because, in my opinion, Burton knows precisely what a myth IS and in the same time IS NOT. He can feel the simultaneous truth and lie behind the act of storytelling, which might be the essence of our civilization, or more accurately the essence of all mankind.Pause your DVD a quarter before end credits and you will be disappointed. Fragments of stories, interesting but not connected tales, characters that are merely explained etc etc. Be patient until the ending and you will get wiser. Every loose element finds its position and there is not a 'solution', but more important, a FEELING that floods you and bears the key to the whole movie.I will disagree with the rest of the comments in that the film is not only about a man that made his life. In the end, all the poles of the story find their opposites: father/son, myth/reality, family/individuality, utopia/feasible, destiny/self-control, discrimination and conduct/self-esteem and recognition. I think that the strong point of the movie is this feeling of reconciliation that floods its end. A situation where all the opposites don't claim their victory and prevalence over their counterparts but stand in a equilibrium that, essentially, is the essence of what is an everlasting myth.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Immortal Father-Son Story,"Big Fish tells the tale of Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as he tries to learn the true story about his dying father's life. The stories that Will knows about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) are fact and fiction blended and Will spends his time for most of the film trying to separate the two. The audience views the journey of Young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) through flashbacks as Will recaps the tales his father has told over the years.Director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) and Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (A River Runs Through It, Remember the Titans) create a tall tale world that combines both fact and fiction, the story of Edward Bloom. It could have been very easy for the effects to feel awkward, but they truly compliment the stunning story.The cast in the film is immense in talent. Supporting Crudup, McGregor, and Finney are: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Allison Lohman, Robert Guillame, Matthew McGrory, Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi, and Danny DeVito. Each bring their own brilliance to the story and together they make the film shine bright.Will Bloom has to come to terms with his father, Edward, and he has to decide how he wants to view the legacy of the man.

That you'll one day transform into the bloke you're pretending to be in all of your lies if you just tell them often enough? The answer remains unclear in this peculiar Tim Burton film – or, as specialists on Tim Burton films would say, in this Tim Burton film.The audience experiences the father and son story through the eyes of the son (a character about as nuanced as the defecating elephant that also stars in the film) who visits his moribund old man after not having talked to him for three years. Upon this foundation, Burton and screenwriter John August create myriads of fairy-tale flashbacks, seemingly taking Forrest Gump as an inspiration, but never explain why all of this should be told to begin with – if not for some lads in the visual effects department amusing themselves by designing all sorts of unreal creatures and objects. The story is almost entirely void of emotions while most of the life lessons spouted by the father consist of him not being your usual fellow and that one can achieve quite a bit if mythical things happen in your life.I'm not expecting every children's film to exhibit a life lesson or have a specified purpose for existing, seeing as two hours purely dedicated on entertaining can produce a wonderful time for cinema-goers. However, Tim Burton strikes me as being more driven to entertain himself than the people watching his films – something that isn't inherently counterproductive for his work, but gives it a sense of being rich on the outside and empty on the inside all too often. Big Fish thoroughly matches that description, boasting elaborate designs and colours for various locations and creatures, captured in beautiful cinematography, yet quickly loses this appeal, as there isn't any more added to it. To be fair, the romance at the centre of it is lovely to watch and the story arc in the town of Spectre a highly amusing one. But even if all little branches that come sprawling from the film's premise were that enjoyable and assembled more coherently, I'd remain underwhelmed by its premise.Introducing a fully new plot point on a five minute basis, Big Fish is quite the antithesis of a dull film and shows the occasional potential of becoming a remarkable film for young and old. However, it turns out to be for neither of them: too frightening and violent for one, too absurd for the other.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
excellent fairy tale that makes you think,"I knew this film was brilliant just from the trailer. OK, so I'm an Ewan McGregor huge fan, but had the lead actor been someone else, I'd still love this film nonetheless.I've watched this several times and it made me choke with tears every time towards the end of the film. I don't cry over films, but this one made me have to sink down my seat and swallow my tears. Apart from touching, another strong point is how the visuals are much like those of a fairy tale. Edward Bloom's world looks surreal but warmly believable. You'd want to believe his world. You'd wish your world is like that. You'd fall in love with Edward Bloom.His relationship with his wife is very romantic as well. It's far from the usual shallow Hollywood-romance-type of love. Their love is very dreamy and daring, but is that not how love is? Their romance might be one of the greatest on-screen romances of all time, although it's not the main plot of the story.And, this film makes the audience contemplate of whether or not they have lived their lives to the fullest, like Bloom has.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Talking About a Life,"A son does not like his father because he always tells a story about his own life as if he read out a fairy tale. The son considers the story as ridiculous therefore he is fed up with the attitude of his father. However as he listens to the story more times, he little by little understands what his father wants to say.What the film shows that; regardless of whether it is true or not, when we get on the edge of death, it is important how we can talk about our own life as a great, bright and happy one. The father's smile in the last scene probably means this.After watching this movie, I cannot help but think about my own life. Though I have not lived for so long, I wonder if I have stories which I will be able to talk to others with smile and proud. Maybe now I do not. From now I will create the story and when I am 80 years old, I hope, I may tell it to my grandchildren.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Tim Burton best but a good effort anyway.,"Big fish is a pretty good film but it's more a lightweight effort than most of the other Burton films, and it's less whimsical well. Ewan  McGregor and Albert Finney  are great as the younger and senior Ed Bloom , and Jessica Lange is good as well as his wife. The balance between what is real and imaginary is really a good way to view the world through the main character eyes, and the way Burton puts that to use is a grand effort indeed.It's a good movie but it's not Tim Burton's Best.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An enchanting fantasy. Ten out of ten.,"From the imagination of Daniel Wallace (novelist) comes an extraordinary fairytale, adapted for the big screen by John August, and directed by Tim Burton.Albert Finney takes the helm of this wonderful story which chronicles the life and loves of Edward Bloom. Edwards' son, William (Billy Crudup), has had quite enough of his father's childish fairy stories and never-ending quest to always be the centre of attention. After hearing his father's story about the infamous `Big Fish' at his wedding, William vows never to speak to his father again. It's not until Edward is diagnosed as being terminally ill that the pair once again meet.William is determined to hear the true story of his father's life before it's too late. The only problem is separating the truth from the fiction.Ewan McGregor has a fantastic role as the young Edward Bloom. After conquering the town of Ashton, Alabama, Ed realises he has out-grown the small town life. With the arrival of Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), Ed leaves Ashton to find his fins in the Big Wide World, armed with enthusiasm and the knowledge of his own death, which he has seen in the eye of a witch (Helena Bonham Carter).During his journey he encounters Spectre (a perfect village filled with charming people), and the circus, where he falls madly in love with his future wife Sandra (Alison Lohman, later played by Jessica Lange).This is an enchanting story filled with fantasy, drama and comedy. There are a few twists along the way, and the ending is certainly worth the wait. Ten out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Tim Burton Masterpiece,"My current personal favorite movie of all time. You either get Tim Burton or you don't. If you ""get"" him, then this is a must see. If you don't ""get"" him, watch it anyway, you might enjoy. Not as dark as most of his flicks and great performances by just about everybody involved. Very funny and very moving at the same time. Ewan McGregor was especially good. After seeing him previously in only his Star War flicks and several other films, I was not particularly impressed with his acting. This film gave him a chance to show his true ability. Would like to see him team with Burton again. Steve Buscemi's performance was also impressive, as usual.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I expected something quite different (and a lot better),"Big Fish appears before viewing to be a fantasy with an unusual and interesting twist. What a treat that would have been.Unfortunately, it turns out to be another boring character study, this time of an old man who has been fantasizing and telling tall tales his entire life, and how the people around him react to him and his imaginings. Naturally for this type of film, the characters react in a completely unrealistic manner. They all find him to be fascinating in a way that makes one think that the filmmaker has as much touch with how real human beings act as the main character in this film appears to have with reality.Of course I won't relate the ""touching"" conclusion, but my reaction at the end was ""Bah, I've wasted another two hours.""",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Believe It Or Not: Fact or Fiction,"When someone tells a story, the listener must decide for himself (or herself) how much of the story is fiction and how much is non-fiction. Often, the line between fantasy and reality is a thin one.  Tim Burton explores this line beautifully in ""Big Fish.""First of all, the direction and cinematography, especially during the flashbacks, helps maintain a dream-like quality throughout the film. Philippe Rousselot plays with a variety of bright colors, like a joyful memory where you remember everything brighter than it actually was.  Yes, there are dark moments in the movie, but those too seem less like a nightmare and more like a daydream.  Danny Elfman's score also fits the movie and its subject matter very well.Second of all is the acting, which keeps the movie a good distance from its potential.  It's not that one character's acting is horrible, but certain scenes seem to take the actors to a ground on which they are not as easily able to stand.Third, the idea of the movie of alone makes it worth watching.  It is only the way in which it is executed that keeps the movie from perfection.Final Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Journey to the center of your mind.,"Big Fish is a pretty incredible story that, more than anything else, makes me wonder if this is how director Tim Burton viewed the world as a child. Judging by the atmosphere of his other films, I would guess that young Burton had a more wild imagination than most. And, it made for some fine films.The movie starts out with one too many flashbacks in the first few minutes as Will is going to tell you (in too many words) that his father always told him storys, and that these are the stories you will see as he told them to him. But, after those few minutes, things work out smoothly once the audience is able to get one track about what's going on.Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as a boy, enjoyed his father's (Albert Finney) remarkable tall tales about himself as a bold, adventurous young man (Ewan McGregor). But, Will, later in life, is tired of hearing the stories repeated at every occassion as his father gladly orates to eager audiences the wild stories. As Will explains, ""The thing about icebergs in that you only see 10% of them. The other 90% are under water."" He thinks that his father's stories only reveal to him, 10 percent of who his father is. And as he is visiting his father who is dying of cancer, Will pleads with him to tell him some facts as he wants to share the legacy of his father with his own child, whom his wife is expecting. But as his father insists, these tall tales are anything but fiction, and are quite revealing of the true Edward Bloom. As the story goes along, the things we think to be fact and fiction are not always so.This is especially a great movie for young kids. The movie is quite cartoonish in appearance, kind of like the live-action cartoonish atmosphere that Blake Edwards was able to achieve in 'The Great Race,' which aids in carrying you away to the reality of Edward Bloom.Edward Bloom (both Finney and McGregor) narrates the various comical situations he encounters in his travels as the 'Big Fish' who outgrows many environments (and thus his reason for always embarking on different, larger adventures). It is like Alice wondering through the looking glass, or Dorothy travelling to see the Wizard, as each of young Edward Bloom's always involve something incredible, and whatever seems least likely, should always be expected. Big Fish is a fantastic rendition of a modern Tall Tales.I was a little disappointed in that the movie seems to be missing that particularly magic Burton 'umpf' that was always present in his earlier films (pre-Planet of the Apes). Something so rich and so uniquely Burton, I just can't seem to figure out what's missing or why. I think part of it has to do with the intermitten reverting back to reality of old man Edward Bloom (Finney) and his interactions with his family. Perhaps it breaks up the dreamy world of the tall tales of young Edward Bloom. I'm not sure about that yet.But otherwise, it is was a wonderful idea and turned out to be a quite a remarkable undertaking, with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, who are really the major stars of the production, giving fine performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wondrous tale,"Tim Burton's Big Fish is the fantastically inclined director at his most mature, while never losing the whimsy and otherworldly elements that have made his films so beloved. While the film is literally about larger than life stories that are perceived by characters in the narrative as wildly embellished tall tales, the tone is one of utmost sincerity and unblinking frankness, leaving out the winks, nudges and sly jabs that usually come with Burton's aesthetic. It's straight up drama, coming from a place of true humanity, that just happens to take place in a story where we get to see these tales of fantasy and unbelievable occurrences. It's this merging of the serious with a dose of utter magical flair that makes it so special, and a beacon of memorable, down to earth style in Burton's otherwise spooky lineup of stories. Billy Crudup, an extremely underestimated actor, plays rational, logical Will Bloom, who is visiting his ailing father Edward (Albert Finney) in the countryside. He grew up hearing wild stories from his father about daring, impossible exploits that he went through in his youth, stories that couldn't fathomably be true. Or could they? Will resents his father for his blatant eccentricities and Crudup expertly displays the subtle rift this has formed between the two of them, creating wounds that only open again with this visit. He brings along his wife (a dazzling Marion Cotillard). As Edward continues to regale them with stories that Will has heard a thousand times (and Cotillard for the first time, humouring him with her warmhearted patience), the film transports us back in time and brings these stories to wild, colour filled life, with a youthful and vibrant Ewan Mcgregor playing the young version of Edward. We learn of his encounter with a mysterious witch, an eerie town in the forest inhabited by a future bank robber (Steve Buscemi), a giant, his time in the war and subsequent escape, and in the film's most touching vignette, a stint working for a local circus, run by a flamboyant ringleader (Danny Devito, the crass little teddy bear) with a scary secret. There he meets his gorgeous future wife, played by Alison Lohman, a positive vision of beauty. Jessica Lange plays her in the present time, infusing quiet warmth and aching love with simple gestures. These tales from the past all have a brilliantly bright, storybook wonder to them, reigned in towards introspect by the characters in the present who they are being told to, and ruminated on by. Whether they are true or not (although there is a concrete answer, surprisingly) doesn't really figure in our enjoyment of the film, or its validity as a moving piece of work, but they instead serve as an illustration of Edward's enormous imagination, only equaled by the size of his heart, and love for his wife and son. The ending sequence is one you'll be fighting back tears during, and is one of the most genuine, earnest moments in a career that for Burton tends to dwell in the realms of detached, emotionally gray territory, but here he orchestrates the most moving, heartfelt work I've ever seen him do. From beginning to end, this tall tale makes your imagination leap with the notion of fantasy and larger than life endeavours, but always beckons you back to relatable, human roots with the back and forth synergy of an orchestral symphony. A classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Schmaltz sells,"Schmaltz - it's a Yiddish word for gushy sentiment, for the use of cloying and manipulative emotionalism.    I thought that this movie was a perfect representation of Hollywood Schmaltz.A lot of people love this movie.   There's an understandable yearning for stories, for fantasy.   But I thought that these stories, these fantasies, were trite and predictable.   (Especially the ending.)   It was also a little disturbing to me the way that the film whitewashes (literally) the history of Alabama, making it seem like some paradise of ideal race relations.    Notice how the ""fantasy"" scenes set in the protagonist's past are completely free of any tinge of racism, and that aside from a single Black boy, there are no African-Americans to be seen at all.   And ""Big Fish"" was filmed in and around Montgomery Alabama, where ML King preached and Rosa Parks boycotted.   It's so much easier to construct false images of the past than to remember what it is was really like.When the past is too uncomfortable to remember, it is often distorted and made to be the subject of fantasy.    But just because amnesia is popular doesn't mean that is healthy.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very inspiring and original,"Has someone ever told you a story that was so awe-inspiring and so fantastic that you wondered if it could possibly be true? This is how William Bloom feels about his father, Edward Bloom. So much so that he doesn't even talk to him anymore. Edward Bloom is a storytelling, eager to tell everyone about his life adventures. Will knows they can't be true and so as his father grows close to death, he decides to set things straight. This film, based on Daniel Wallace's book, is one of my favorites because it clearly portrays a life well lived. Edward Bloom is one of the most inspiring characters I have ever seen on screen because he puts so much into life; and gets so much out of it. Tim Burton's usual films are quite dark in tone, but with this, he takes a break from that style, while still managing to put his unmistakable creativeness and true sense of wonder into it. I also highly recommend Daniel Wallace's book which is just as good, if not better, than the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It has the usual Gothic atmosphere of burton's movies, the same magic.

Big Fish,"This is a movie that will truly make you believe in fairy tales. When I think about movies that really truly affected me in some way, Big Fish is definitely one of those movies. I believe it to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie had high morals and a deep story line with dramatic and sometimes unbelievably fantastic turns. The movie tells the tale of a father and son, who is about to become a father himself, the mythology surrounding the father's life, and the reconciliation between fact and fiction. It's not what you would expect from Tim Burton on the surface, but true to form with 'Edward Sissorhands,' Burton's cinematic flair perfectly captures the human condition of life, death, the unimaginable, and the unbelievable in a beautiful piece of art. The scenery in the movie was museum worthy. One sad fact that I believe is that this movie didn't get the publicity it deserved. Not too many people have ever seen this movie, or even heard about it, and that's a shame. I would highly advise if you ever walk by this film in a movie store to turn around and pick it up and watch it.....You'll love it..",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Whimsical,"This is a movie that is everything and nothing all at once. There's a moral here, but what is the moral? That's more of a rhetorical question, but the moral I've earned from this movie is: embellish the truth. So, just lie. Which, obviously movies don't have to have a moral, but for some reason to me this movie seems like it's trying to have an overall fairy-tale like moral to it. I thought it was whimsical, and did not completely hate it - not knowing what comes next seems to be its charm. There's a very fantastical air to this movie that I find is neat, even if at first I thought it was outlandish. I found it charming, even, and the characters - though frustrating at times, especially not in the flashbacks - were interesting. Sometimes the acting felt off and the pacing was something absurd there - It was enjoyable. There are still a lot of questions that are left unanswered by this film, but i'm sure you can find them if you try hard enough. That seems to be the way of the movie, anyway.Overall, I thought the character of Bloom was interesting. I thought the ending was one of the only nice parts that I thought tied it all together really, and the humor could hit at times. I do think it would have translated better to Tim Burton's claymation style - with how that could make a lot of things pop and let the dissonance between audience member and character dissipate a little. Also, the fish wasn't even that big. There's a lot of things to like and hate about this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I`m also happy that I can say that Helena Bonham Carter is the one of best actress nowadays, though in The Big Fish she just confirmed my earlier opinion of her good acting. The movie is technical correct, music is fine, the fabula is interesting, but something is missing. For, through all of those blooming colors, small fine details, Will Bloom`s (Billy Crudup) searching for the reality in his fathers stories, I did not find any of development, neither deeper devotion to the main issue, nor the point which could to endure such a quantity of varies scenes, placed in the different times and places, yet not to be faded away, even  quashed.

Somewhat disappointing but still very good  (***),"Tim Burton's thankful return to making films in his own style after the dull, ordinary ""Planet Of The Apes"" remake in 2001, ""Big Fish"" isn't quite the fantasy masterpiece I wanted it to be, but is quite good anyway.Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is what you would call a storyteller. All his life he has dazzled everyone around him with tall tales about his own life at the drop of a hat, and they are always the right story for the situation. According to him, he has worked in a circus, traveled with a giant, braved a haunted forest, met a witch with a mystical glass eye, found an Eden-like town in the middle of a forest where everyone is always happy, and much, much more. Now, though, he is old, with cancer, and about to die.His son, William (Billy Crudup), was once just as dazzled as everyone else at his stories, but over time grew tired of his father constantly hogging the spotlight with his silly stories and hasn't spoken to him in years. He leaves with his wife from his home in Paris to return home and try to reconcile with his father.The elder Bloom has always maintained that every word of his tall tales are absolutely true, that he really did do all those things, but William finally wants to hear the truth about his life. Edward, though, is still resolute that all those stories are true, and as we see those stories for ourselves (with a fresh-faced Ewan MacGregor as the young Edward), we begin to wonder (hope, actually) that some of it might be true.If ever there was a story that was perfect for Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"") to tell, this story, about the power of imagination, is it. However, something about it just didn't come together for me. Some of the stories just didn't engage me very much and at times the Burton-esque oddness seems a little forced.But there are tons of good qualities, not the least of which are good performances by Finney, MacGregor, Crudup, Jessica Lange (as the elder Bloom's wife and William's mother), and Steve Buscemi (as a traveling poet). And I freely admit to crying my eyes out in the last 15 minutes, when the entire film comes together beautifully. Suddenly, right then, I felt the Tim Burton whose style I fell in love with in ""Edward Scissorhands"" back when I was 12, and that, more than anything, made it worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Touching and playful,"""The truth is, I didn't see anything of myself in my father. And I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well.""For those who've had a difficult relationship with a parent, this film might be especially touching. Perhaps it asks whether a son can truly know his father, and what the sum total of one's memories (or their embellishment) mean when life is finite, and they die when we do. To try to connect with one's father at the end of his life, to make peace, and to better understand his life, particularly with the perspective shift that comes from being on the cusp of fatherhood oneself - there's something profound in this.While telling these tall tales from his life, where he has fantastical adventures and is always the hero, perhaps the father substitutes the life he wish he'd led for his own, which in some way gives his son a model to follow both morally and creatively. We are here, we lead a humdrum life, we die - how much nicer is it to jazz up the meaningless of it all with stories? The wonderful line ""A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal"" can be devastating if you think of the stories of loved ones who have passed away in your own life.The film is playful and fun because while we're given what amounts to a deathbed in the present, we're also given wild, unpredictable tales in the flashbacks to the past, which are filled with romance, adventure, and comedy. While the film can get a little sentimental and cheesy at times, the emotional range is broad, and there are some truly sweet moments, like the field of daffodils the father presents his wife-to-be in courtship. You have to also love the attempts at poetry from Steve Buscemi's character. It might have worked even better had the overall tone been shifted a teeny bit darker, but the poignant, uplifting ending is perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best movie I have ever seen,"Big Fish is an optimistic masterpiece that combines adventure, drama, suspense. romance and of course tons of fantasy. I believe that the thing that makes it so special is its originality.Tim Burton ,the director of the film, has given his best shot in order to make a film that has nothing to do with any other film, staying loyal ,of course, to the peculiarity of his own unique style.The positive aspects of this film are numerous. Firstly, the story is interesting and at the same time moving. Then, the special effects are stunning, considering the period in which the film was created. Moreover, the score, created by a usual suspect when talking about a Tim Burton's film, Danny Elfman, totally deserved the nominations it received.As far as the interpretations of the actors are concerned, they are all flawless. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter as well as Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito are not only big names but also great in their own way. They achieve to make the character they play appealing to the audience. Speaking the truth, if I had the chance I wouldn't replace any of them as the roles were tailor made. By this I don't mean that this film gives them the opportunity to unfold every aspect of their talent but that they meet perfectly the expectations created by their role.This film is a proof to the theory that great films don't always receive Oscars, Golden Globes or other important awards, despite the fact that they deserve them.

It made me laugh and cry at the same time while not expecting the viewer to be a complete idiot. The pressuring happy/sad atmosphere kept on during the whole movie and this showed that Burton can still make perfect movies even after that not-so-perfect Planet of the apes. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't Burton...Well, back to the movie at hand... The casting was good, and all the actors and actresses lived their characters. The fairytale-like places and colorful world was great, at some points you just knew that something was not possible, but because it was a story, you didn't even care about it.. (the grass-street at Spectre for instance) :)I'm getting too carried away, so better if I watch the movie again and stop yapping about it.. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I did'nt hate it.,"This movie was ok, I guess. It was very sentimental and really a little overblown. The story was OK but it felt like Tim Burton was just being self-indulgent seeing what images he could create like the field full of daffodils. A major gripe concerns the movie's re-writting of history in regards to race relations in Alabama and the US. I so sure there were black doctors delivering babies for white women in the south in the 1930's!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hope life is a beautiful fairy,"Life should be like a fairy tale, and each encounter is a small plot in the story. You don't need to know the result, but you must believe that there is no sadness, no sadness, no misfortune in the fairy tale world.

Therefore, no matter what kind of encounter, you will definitely see the most beautiful star in the sky, and you will definitely get the warmest embrace that belongs to you.

Moving and visually stunning,"Moving and visually amazing drama from Tim Burton. Burton is renowned for his quirky comedies but here he manages to mix that with raw emotion. A family relationship drama mixed with fairy tales (or are they?).As you would expect from Tim Burton, the special effects are amazing. Throw in a good soundtrack (by Danny Elfman, of course) and you have a well-crafted, visually appealing, often light-hearted yet emotional movie.Good performances by a host of stars: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Billy Cradup, Helena Bonham Carter, Marion Cotillard, Robert Guillaume, Danny DeVito, Alison Lohman and Steve Buscemi. Also includes a 10-year old Miley Cyrus in her first cinema movie role (though I am not sure this is anything for the movie to be proud of...).Only negative is that the ending lacks punch. Having set up the intrigue with the interesting tales and snippets of the father's life, the conclusion is not that profound and feels a bit predictable. It's as if Burton focused most of his attention on the first and second Acts and relaxed on the third.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

How to make a grown man cry,"I think that the male ego prevents much emotion being shown on a regular basis. Certainly, I find that that is the case myself. However, there have been a few occasions where I have found the smallest traces of water forming in my eyes whilst watching a film. Yes, I guess they would just about constitute tears! Anyway, there are quite a few comedies that have generated tears of laughter, quite a few films that have had me crying through boredom. But I don't think that any film has generated proper heart felt emotion and made me blub as much as Big Fish.The story centres on the relationship between a dying father and his son. The father is a story teller, and his whole life as told to his son has been greatly exaggerated, and turned into a fairytale. Realising that his father is dying, the son wishes to try and understand who he really is, and to discover the truth amongst the fiction.I'm sorry, I realise that this makes the film sound very dull, but it most certainly is not - it is both tear jerkingly sad, yet uplifting. Tim Burton again using his genius imagination to make this film, and its larger than life characters and fairy tales, really come to life. Albeit, an exaggerated lie of a life.I won't pretend that this film would be to everyones taste, but I do think that it deals with both life and death in a very uplifting way, and as such everybody should give it a few hours of their time.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining with some Burton added to it,I really did enjoy this film.  It wasn't excellent but the story was interesting and the acting was great on almost all parts.

It is well worth the time spent.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Emotional Truth,"The important truths of one's life are revealed in how they embellish the facts, maybe not the dry hard truth but certainly the more profound emotional truth. That's what Will (Billy Crudup) comes to realize in the last days of his dying, eccentric, story telling father, a man he feels he's never gotten to know because he believes that his father's tall tales are an annoying diversion that prevent anyone from knowing the real man. What he comes to learn is exactly the opposite, which is that his father with his amusing yarns has been telling the world volumes more about himself and the real truth of his vision than any fact sheet could hope to reveal. In essence he's come closer to baring the inner dreams of his soul than most men do, no matter how ""honest"" they might attempt to be.This is a Tim Burton masterpiece and a gem in storytelling in itself. Of course the trademark Burton visuals are here and never used to better effect and have never been more appealing. This one stands high right next to ""Scissorhands"" and ""Nightmare"" as a film that will mark Burton's place in film history. This one's a bona fide 10. If you find a good fish story told well brings a wry smile to your face then by all means don't let this one get away.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Exaggerated, But How Could It Not Be?","In the movie ""Big Fish"" we are asked to follow the life of a weaver of tall tales as described by same.  What might we expect? Raised by a man larger than life (Albert Finney as the father), Billy Cruddup (as the son)has tired of his father's larger-than-life image, an image cultivated through a lifetime of storytelling.  So many lies and half-truths and distortions that the son cannot perceive where the truth begins and the disinformation ends.  And so the two are at odds even though the father is probably on his death bed. Director Tim Burton's fantastically exaggerated view of the father's early life is probably about right.  To put it another way, how would a liar describe his own life?  Well, certainly not any matter-of-fact recounting would be expected. There are enough diversions strewn in the film's path it elevate it to higher than average level.  There are delightful moments punctuated by highjinks that almost elicit a groan of disbelief.  Some effects look very good, the actual visual sensations illustrate very high production values - and we would expect that from Burton - yet there enough mild surprises to entertain.  And enough about the relationship(s) explored to stir the cerebral in us. But what of the father?  What is he really all about, what really happened and why should we care?  And do we resolve this father/son dispute? Imagine a lens that magnifies a person-sized object about 1.2 times.  That is what a character like that portrayed by Albert Finney appears like to a boy.  And does even as an adult.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
nodded off,"Really wanted to like this movie, but couldn't keep my eyes open.  It lacks both a compelling conflict and suspenseful storyline.  Or any story to speak of.  Delightful little episodes that add up to nothing and the charm wears on you after a while.  Keep waiting for Billy Crudup to find a role that really allows him to shin",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Curiouser and curiouser,"When Helena Bonham Carter recently gave birth to Tim Burton's baby and settled down to blissful (if presumably slightly quirky) family life, it finally dawned on me that we were probably not going to end up together. This was a thumping blow to say the least  I have carried a torch for Britain's most elegant and enigmatic actress ever since she flapped her arms about in a cornfield in Room With a View in 1986 - and I knew that if I was to finally allow myself to move on, I would need to stop thinking of Burton as a scheming, manipulative freak-show who was holding my precious English rose against her will and just be happy for the pair of them. So I stopped sticking pins in my crudely crafted Burton effigy and began to grudgingly concede that he was actually a pretty good director.Still, he doesn't half take liberties with his missus: Not content with turning her into a talking gorilla in Planet of the Apes, his latest offering, Big Fish, has her playing both a scabby, one-eyed witch and a wistful middle-aged spinster who couldn't even lure Ewan McGregor into the sack.Bonham Carter is not the only one readily jumping through hoops for Burton in this movie. He has a knack of creating unique and irresistible characters that light up his narrative and captivate his audiences. Why has nobody else ever cast Danny DeVito as a pint-sized, moustache-twirling ringleader or Steve Buscemi as terrible poet-cum-bank robber? What other director could assemble such a blistering supporting cast in what is essentially a glorified fairy tale? Big Fish was never the sort of project that was going to win truckloads of academy awards  the reason the cream of Hollywood are queuing up to be in his films is not one of artistic recognition, but because it looks like it would be a bloody good laugh.What is also clear is that if you happen to land one of the plumb roles, you strive with every sinew to make the most of it. Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom: Charismatic, popular and richly entertaining, but dying of cancer. Billy Crudup is his son Will, who has endured a life of drudgery by comparison. Will is fed-up with his father's preposterous tales and it eventually drives them apart. As it becomes obvious Edward has only a short time to live, Will seeks reconciliation and acknowledgement from his father that his stories are all whopping great lies.But Edward is a stubborn bugger and maintains that he only ever speaks the truth. And so, his history is recounted in a succession of vivid flashbacks where we follow his younger self (Ewan McGregor) through a life that was certainly less ordinary and frankly (to Will anyway) pretty unlikely. Young Edward, it seems, was a gifted individual to say the least: His anecdotes include a long list of sporting accolades; tussles with witches and giants; joining the circus and falling in love; escaping from the far East with the help of Siamese twin cabaret singers and saving a whole town from debt and destitution.The tales are brought to life by Finney's sparkling voice-overs and McGregor's wide-eyed enthusiasm  Edward Bloom's past is Tim Burton's Wonderland; The town of Spectre, Alabama is his Bedford Falls, 'a place so great, nobody ever leaves!'References and sly nods are scattered everywhere and colour and imagery stream out of every set. Here it is the present that is dreary and sepia. Edward, stymied in his later years through the relentless march of time and eventually bedridden, lives vicariously through his splendid reminiscences. Because, as Will eventually realises, his father is not interested in showing off or telling porkies  he just wants to remember the good times.Big Fish is about cherishing memories. In Burton's book they can be as rose-tinted as you like. The cold facts are not important; feelings are what count. How he can pull off such an unapologetically sentimental motto like that without drowning in a fetid swamp of cheese and schmaltz is anybody's guess. But he does, and with his own inimitable aplomb. Burton just has this incredible imagination (although it helps that he is as mad as a snake).My final word must rest with Helena. These pages are laced with praise for the entire cast of Big Fish. All the aforementioned actors deserve credit as well as Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange as the young and old incarnations of Edward's wife Sandra (Lange in particular is the foxiest pensioner you are ever likely to meet), but Bonham Carter proves once and for all she is one of the most talented and versatile actresses currently around. Once mocked as being fit only for corsets and period drama, she has laughed off the criticism and taken a series of challenging and thought-provoking roles. She is not afraid to experiment or risk looking silly and has a laissez faire attitude to stardom that is as admirable as it is unusual. If this film is Burton's homage to his new family lifestyle then it is a fitting tribute indeed.OK, now I have closure.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Film has EVERYTHING you need to make a Personal Story,"Big Fish is one of the best Tim Burton movies ever. Now I have only seen this, Beetlejuice, Batman, Batman Returns, and Charlie and the Chocolate factory. This is my favorite of all the ones I've seen but I haven't seen most of his movies. But I think this film is a masterpiece.The storytelling is what makes this movie great. Even though the cast is fantastic and the shots are stunning, it's the storytelling which makes this one brilliant.You have all of these locations, creatures, and characters that are so creatively made. Edward Bloom is a really interesting character to explore and the stories he tells are always exciting. Then on the other hand you have this depressive son who is sick of his fathers stories. I feel like some people can really relate to this story and everyone can connect to it. And the ending is just one of the most satisfying endings ever.

Since watching 'Big Fish' a few months ago it has quickly become one of my guilty pleasure films; it's so bright, colorful, and overall humorously zany.

A terrific way to tell a life story,"I have no hesitation in giving this movie 10/10, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and one that is engaging from the very first minute.Burton uses his trademark ""painting"" to create backdrops that draw the viewer to the scene without being distracting from the dialogue and voice-overs that move the story along (I'm thinking of the circus, the show with the Siamese twins and Specter, but there are many more).The movie has one of the best endings of ANY one that I have seen. As the film begins and progresses, it seems as if it is a ridiculous exaggeration of a man's life, and even though the series of flashbacks are interesting and pithy it seems as if the point of the movie is to put together a chain of fables and embellishments. Then in the last few minutes of the movie you realize that there is a very good reason for all of this.An example of superb story-telling, I count it among a very limited number of movies that I could watch every day and still appreciate.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pointless...,"I had high hopes for the film as I imagine most people doing seeing as its been getting good reviews.If anyone could give me back the two hours I just wasted I'd be most appreciative.

I'll be the first to admit I'm not a massive fan of Burton but even then god knows how he got away with this. It was just totally uninspiring, uninteresting, unengaging and down right boring. The story was predictable and simple with nothing to entice the watcher into he world he was trying to create with each story piece.Personally I'd recommend watching something with a lot more thought to it, if you like the fantasy type genre then Princess Mononoki is a prime example of great story telling and well executed drive.Big Fish - 3, and if the actors were bad, then it'd have been a 1.

An adventure in fantasy,"Tim Burton has completed his masterpiece. We see so much symbolism along with all the heartwarming messages. Ewan McGregor plays a man from a small town who sees a world that is so big and wants to explore and experience everything he can. Through many adventures, he finds hardship in some, but life changing experiences in all. Aside from the brilliant writing of the script, the use of color certainly boosts the viewers interest. I have watched this movie several times. Often, If I come across a friend or family member who has not seen it, I will set aside time to watch it with them to see their reaction. Everyone I have watched it with has truly enjoyed it...some more than others. But I would have to say, I recommend this film if you have not had the chance to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Tim Burton fairytale.,"Yet another fairytale from one of my personal favorite directors. Tim Burton's typical atmosphere and characters make this movie an unique one.Still I can't help it to be somewhat disappointed. The movie was not quite what I had expected and hoped for. Judging from the trailer I seriously thought this could be my favorite movie of all time, it had all the right ingredients to become so. Maybe I expected a bit too much of an ""Forrest Gump"" in fantasy land.But really, ""Big Fish"" still is a treat of a movie. The visual look of it is typically Tim Burton style and I absolutely love it. There also was some wonderful humor present which make this movie mainly fun and entertaining to watch even though there also is enough room for some drama.Thing I really missed in this movie was the presence of Johnny Depp. Burton + Depp is always fireworks and I really think that it could have lifted the movie even more, not that Ewan McGregor is a bad actor of course. Oh well, at least we still get to see Danny DeVito's naked behind instead...Albert Finney really was excellent in this and Billy Crudup also was surprising good.The characters are probably what makes this movie work. The fairytale like characters and storyline's are truly stimulating for the fantasy.I'm really surprised with the high rating it receives here, not that it doesn't deserve so but because I felt that not everybody would be able to connect and relate with the weird and unusual visual style and story of the movie.

Perfect in its own way.,"This movie is basically Forest Gump except even better. I'm not trying to c*** on Forest, he's awesome, but this brings something special.A collage of bizarre encounters and experiences with a deft sense of comic timing though never quite losing a disquieting tone, this is a delightful weirdness trip that also has something unexpected up its sleeve.It's not trying to touch the feels the way FG did. it's not meant to be Zeligesque or pseudo-historical, it's the gaiety of the tall story that uses narration as narration should be used; to supplement the picture, not as an excuse to not tell the story visually.Not heavy, but with hard edge, this is a festival of anecdote telling first and a meditation on the blurring of fantasy and reality second. I personally don't do unreliable narrators and just take everything at face value. It's more enjoyable that way.This is an understated movie that lets you follow it on your own terms. It's fun and has an ineffable poignancy of an unassuming sort that I rarely see.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Big Fish - 4.5 Stars,"What a magical movie this is. ""Big Fish"" challenges our faith and imagination with tales that sound too marvelous to be true, too extraordinary to be believable. But the strongest emotions are found between the broken relationship of a dying father and his doubtful son. After years of no communication, they are reunited when human age reaches its fragile state. The son sits on a chair as he observes his weak father, who lies in what could be his deathbed.Old Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a devoted storyteller who believes that true stories could use a little fiction for entertainment purposes. On the day his only son, Will, was born, he was out of town selling home appliances. Not a very exciting story for such a very momentous event. When Will is set to be married, his father shares with everyone the false account of how he caught a really big fish with his wedding ring the same day Will was born. This draws smiles from his listeners, but not from Will, who has heard the same lie repeatedly throughout his life. He walks away. And he doesn't return until old Edward becomes confined to his bedroom.Other than the tale about the big fish, Edward has shared more of his past experiences with Will, which he starts to recall in great detail. A series of flashbacks begin, and we are introduced to the mysterious memories of Edward, which gives an opportunity for director Tim Burton to indulge in his obsession for all things weird. Edward narrates as nostalgia kicks in, but it's Tim Burton who supplies the imagination.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/big-fish/",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
love it!,"Tim Burton creates a phenomenal movie with believable acting, imaginative cinematography and costumes, and a touching and irreplaceable narrative. The movie is about William Bloom, a young man who never really knew his dying father, Edward. William only knew tall tales about his father's life. Edward told William elaborate stories about growing up, making his way in life, and meeting his mother. During Edward's last days, William and his wife Josephine stay with him as the old man recollects intricate memories of his youth. The unique plot creates a journey that is unexpected, enchanting, outrageous, and genuinely moving. There is no other way to describe it, but as unique. The mythical or possibly true stories of Edward's eventful life captivate me and include me on a journey in an effort to separate fact from fiction. Each story is fascinating and original. William most accurately describes his father's tales; ""And as strange as his stories got the endings were always the most surprising of all."" Big Fish is unlike other dramatic comedies. It is not hilarious moments leading up to a big dramatic climax like most dramatic comedies, but the movie as a whole is filled with comedy and drama. This movie is unique and interesting.

Which makes sense - the themes of family and adventure with a Vignette structure to Forrest Gump, which he produced. But I'm glad he didn't direct. While toned down, Burton's gothic visiual sensibilities and love for all things creepy and weird are still present, and they add a certain edge to this movie that heighten the intentionally exaggerated nature of the story. It's one of those stories about Storytelling, like Princess Bride, where you're viewing the unfolding events in two minds: as the direct viewer, and the viewer of the viewer.

An Extraordinary Tale of a Seemingly Ordinary Man...,"I loved this film. Tim Burton was a great choice for director. He tells his stories so well and in an amazing way. This movie is definitely worth watching.The Jist: A man tells his life story to his son through tall tales. When the son is young, he loves hearing of the amazing adventures of his father. As the boy gets older, the stories start to seem too extraordinary, and he begins to think that maybe he really doesn't know about his father's life as it truly happened. He thinks he is nothing like his father, and begins to become irritated at the tall tales. After not talking to his father for a few years, the son hears of his father's bad health and goes to visit in hopes of hearing his father's true life story. What he finds out is even more amazing.This movie is truly worth watching, but you must sit through the whole thing. I tried to get my mother and friend to watch it, but they couldn't sit still long enough, so they never got the whole story. I finally got my Dad to watch it with me. He sat through the whole thing, and by the end, he was kinda getting into it. He ended up telling me that it was a really great movie.

"""Have I ever told you about the time...?","Before the time of television and movies, the passing of knowledge and wisdom depended on story-telling and the magic of the story-teller. And with the storyteller's twist, fact and fiction becomes a foggy mist.William Blooms (Billy Crudup) is on a search for the ultimate meaning of his father's many tales. He tries to learn the truths of his father in his father's dieing days. When it came to story-telling, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) knew it best. ""Big Fish"" begins with Edward Bloom telling tales about his past at dinner parties, around a campfire, and to anyone else that would listen. Everyone seems intrigued by his stories except his son, Will, who wishes his father would just be able to tell him the truth.Through the film's constant stream of flashbacks, young Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor), goes through countless adventures, unafraid because as a boy he confronted a witch who foretold the exact moment of his death. In one, he befriends a giant and together they hit the road, but Bloom gets sidetracked in an isolated town called Spectre where the streets are paved with grass and all of the residents walk around barefoot. He leaves only to wind up in the circus, shoveling dung and performing dangerous tricks in the attempt to learn the name of the girl he loves.This film, with its storytelling premise, has a small resemblance to the 1994 film ""Forrest Gump"" about a mentally challenged man who is put into a variety of situations and real-life events. And while waiting for a bus, he tells his unbelievable tales to on goers. But Big Fish has a different tone that allows for the relationship development and the deeper emotions felt between the two main characters.Tim Burton engages us with his colorful backdrops and wonderful motif. And since most of the movie is in flashback, we are in a ""dreamy"" state for quite a while. The overall theme of this film is further enhanced by the usage of camera angles, lighting, and color. This greatly contributes to the sense of magic and creativity of Ed's tales and therefore, helps with the exaggerating of the stories that he tells.""Big Fish"" tells the tale of a son who longs to truly know his father and not just the exaggerated stories that his father tells. And as the foggy mist of fact and fiction clears to reveal nothing, should we, in the end, accept that fog to be truth?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not as good as I thought it would be,"I thought this film would have more laughs and be more entertaining. It is about a guy, who goes home to see his estranged father who is gravely ill. He resents the fact that his dad liked to tell him tall tales as a child. Now that's a real reason not to talk to your father for years. So the movie relives of his dad when his dad was young. It shows how he left town with a giant, joined the circus, and how he got his wife to marry him. And how he went to war and bought a town. The part with the giant was probably the best because it was the most laughable. You could see how the son wouldn't believe that. But most of the stories told were so-so and nothing great.FINAL VERDICT: The general idea behind the movie was good, but the stories shown in the film weren't all that great. If they were going to have a movie about tall tales, then make some of them really out there. That would have been more entertaining. So, I don't recommend this one for anyone who is looking for a fun film to watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Movie Tugged at My Heart,"A movie has not moved me this much since ""Forest Gump""-Jenny and all. And that's all I have to say about that, but I need to write more, so I will. This movie tells a wonderful story, and has excellent casting! I can't believe it took me over 21 years to discover it. I truly believe that all of us have a life whose story should be told, and I also believe that we, like Ed want the people in our lives to be interested in us. We may live simple lives, but we wish to be important. My late fiancé was indeed Edwin Bloom, and I felt the same as his son Will Bloom did, and I also shed quite a few tears throughout the entire movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the point is not whether or not he's lying...,"I've never seen a Tim Burton movie that I didn't like (I wasn't too fond of ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", but Burton only produced that). ""Big Fish"" continues this trend. When elderly Alabama resident Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying, his estranged son Will (Billy Crudup) has to return home. Ed has spent much of his life telling fanciful tales of his exploits, none of which Will has ever believed. But when Will investigates, he begins to speculate that these stories may have been true after all.Regardless of whether or not one can believe all these things that Ed is telling people, we grow to respect how the situation is helping the father and son reconnect, and also how Ed and his wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) are trying to rekindle their sexuality. Ewan McGregor is particularly impressive as Ed's younger self, and Danny DeVito is pretty funny as a circus ringmaster with a dark secret. A great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A feel good film that made me cry,"My usual approach to reviewing a film is to be a sarcastic brat about it but this one was just pure goodness and is undeserving of that sort of treatment.It's quite an experience to watch this for the first time in 2024, over two decades (gulp) since its release and I am grateful. My inner child really enjoyed this one.It's a wholesome film with a lovely, fantastical circle-of-life story with many actors and actresses I recognised from movies I watched growing up.

Loved it,"Big Fish is definitively one of the top ten movies of all times. It's a sort of wonderland film. The movie has a very complex sequence of events, which require more than one viewing for full understanding. In fact, the first time i saw it, i didn't enjoy it much. But then i gave it a second chance, and the pleasure of watching it increased exponentially. The more I watch it, the more I discover hidden aspects and new ways to interpret this masterful creation. The scenario is extraordinary, mixing long pipe lines and a almost omnipresent fairytale atmosphere. If you didn't like the movie the first time you saw it, don't be by any means discouraged. This movie requires patience and an active role from the viewer. Finally, Big Fish deserves special praise for all the dream-like sequences of the main character and the music fits in perfectly well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It follows Edward Bloom, a small town Alabama man who has big hopes. Although he lives a full life, he eventually falls sick and his son comes to visit him. His son doesn't see eye to eye with him and feels as though he is a liar and that the stories he tells are all tall tales. The movie is well casted and it's pretty funny. The guy that plays Obi Wan in the new Star Wars plays Edward and thats all I really remember about the names of the cast. The movie is definitely worth the two hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Part fantasy-part reality- All, very well done","I did not know this was a Tim Burton movie. Not being a fan of his, it's likely I would not have tuned in so long ago. I'm very happy I did. There's probably Tim Burton fans out there who could judge better than I, but from the Tim Burton movies I have seen, this is clearly his best.This movie is outstanding in so many ways.I confess I did not read Wallace's book, hence I cannot comment as to the accuracy of the screenplay. However, I can comment on the screenplay itself & direction. Burton pulled off a movie in the 'Magical Realism' genre to perfection. The series vignettes are pure gold. I have watched this movie too many times over the past 20 years. But hey, when you're scanning your DVDs on your shelf, and you come across Big Fish, it often screams at you to be selected. And that puts this flick in an exclusive class.And I love Ewan McGregor in the few movies I have seen with him. ""Impossible"" he did a great job, and ""The Island"", is a rewatched fav in our home.He has a slightly inward, reserved & quiet way about him, that endears others to him. Very high
like-ability factor. Much the same as Michael Beign in 'The 7th Sign' or 'The Terminator'; (but obviously, not as Ringo, in ""Tombstone"", where he really showed the range of his fine acting skills.)And Albert Finney's narration of his fantastic exploits in his youth, is stellar. Jessica Lange is as beautiful as she is delightful as his loving wife.Devito is really good. And I laugh every time I think of Buscemi, as the poet of a fantasy township; struggling to come up with even a nearly infantile, simple 4 line (Roses are Red, Violets are Blue) poem, OVER A PERIOD OF LIKE... 10 YEARS:)It saddens me that the giant (Matthew McGrory), died just a couple of years after this movie's release. For not doing much in the way of acting, he did nothing short of a magnificent job. And it warms my heart to know that the big fella was cast to be a costar, and has left his fine mark in a very successful A movie before his untimely demise.Although a necessary component to the story, Crudup who did a very convincing job as Bloom's adult son, I did find the constant nagging of his father as an annoying distraction. But that's an observation, and certainly not a complaint. Because any adult son would be concerned about their father if they believed he lived in a fantasy world. I just thought his repeated antagonistic approach should have been reconsidered, long before the film's climax forced him to do so. But in the end, I was wrong. Because that would've ruined the surprise his son was in for, which is a crucial element to the film.KUDOS to Burton. I'm an old feller myself, and humbly consider myself a fair & intelligent critic of music & film. And with Big Fish, magic is indeed captured, and timed/blended beautifully with reality.Finally, I'm pleased to see this movie reached a collective ""8"" status. That's rare. For me, it's an easy 10. Relative to the junk on the market it's much higher. Rating it in an absolute sense, there is very little if anything wrong with this movie. Yes, it's a 10 through and through. It is fun, funny, magical & heartwarming. What more could one ask for?I highly recommend;ThxBob R.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fascinating Attempt,"12 January 2004. A touching ""Forest Gump"" on LSD/acid trip. This movie has all those surrealistic elements as well as the emotional buttons that make for a sentimental and fantastic voyage of discovery. The Forest Gump voice-over and the tall tales as if taken from a twilight zone episode series takes the audience on a flashback and present, father/son adventure of almost magical but bumpy story (it's almost as if there were several directors changing the style and appearance of the movie).The fascinating ending destination, the tie-ins, turn arounds are cute and heart-felt, but it seems that the whole story was destined to conclude this way (but the last tale told is from the heart and burns into memory an important relational message). The movie never quite reaches the pinnacle of surrealistic, Twilight Zone, Rod Serling brilliance, never quite completely satisfies with its erratic editing and slightly off-beat cinematography.However, this movie does deserve an honorary mention for its almost Independent film imagery and its innovative and creative weaving tapestry with a few missed strands and threads of the needle.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The work which can enjoy two world,"This is the story that a son and a father reconciled, but is a work having the big theme, reality and the fiction.The charm of this movie is scene constitution distributed neatly. The scene of the reality that there are flashback that is the fantasy which father Edward talks about and son William is repeated in turn. Only a story of the fantasy does not need to extremely advance. William says a story of Edward is lie and he wants him to tell about truth. However, I think; ""then what is lie? And truly what is it? "" For example, I tell a person to have watched a 2 meter-long snake yesterday. The person thinks it is lie, and it becomes the lie among the people at that point. In fact, the snake which I thought to be length of two meters was the snake which had only length measuring 1 meter. However, this is never a lie because I think that I when I tell him am a snake measuring two meters.As for my having learned by this movie, the standard to ascertain a lie and the truth is that different by a person after all.

Many people find this film very confusing and weird, but if you look and follow the film slowly in your mind, you can see how every piece of fiction from his father holds some significance, which eventually leads to a stunning climax.

Landmark in US film making - No spoilers,"Don't be fooled.  Big Fish is not the classic want-to-be ""surreal"" tale with random psychodelic elements.  Big Fish is not a movie that ""tries to hard"" to be different or surreal.  Big Fish is *real*.  It embodies much more than what it may seem at first glance.After a somewhat decline during his last movies (since his masterpieces ""Edward..."" and ""Ed Wood""), Tim Burton finally decided to explore two more realistic subjects: first; a father-son relationship and second; the story of ones life.  Big Fish is left to the viewer to be understood, analyzed, and interpreted.  Like any other film, the final interpretation lays on the viewer.  However many directors are often biased and leave little room for personal interpratation making their own.  Burton, on the contrary, leaves a universe for multiple interpretations.  One can wonder how he managed with such a solid plot. Nonetheless, he succeeded.The beauty of the profound subject, the imaging, the style, and the meaning and purpose of Big Fish, makes it a film to be remembered by many generations to follow.  Tim Burton has delivered a masterpiece like never before: a landmark in US filmaking.10/10 - Big ups for Big Fish",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I didn't mind the acting, but more development for the Albert Finney character would've been helpful.

BIG surprises!,"Or not. I mean, this is Tim Burton we're talking about. Imagine a film that makes Edward Scissorhands look tame. A lot of familiar Tim Burton motifs such as use of trees, small dogs, and wisdom from the mouths of children.Big Fish is profound, and profoundly twisted. Reality bending. A mind-bending experience. I was surprised this film didn't get released for Cannes, this is Palm D'Or material. I saw this at a professional screening and the usually-jaded audience was stunned. It is sentimental, and it got me. I had non-stop tears streaming down my face for the last 20 minutes. A 15 hanky picture.Danny DeVito blew my mind. This is his greatest role - but it's difficult to single out any one performance because every frame of this masterpiece is balls-out brilliant and the cast are incredible. Especially Helena Bonham Carter of course, and she parlays her multiple roles with inspired grace.I am not sure how this film's gonna play in Peori. Expect the critics and pundits and awards-mongers to be in love, but will the great gross middle American proletariat get it? Tough call. The numbers will tell.But it's amazing.

That's how I remembered it.,"Big Fish shows that everyone remembers the past however they want to remember. When William Bloom (Billy Crudupt) returns home to his father's death bed, he just wants to hear the true story of his father's life. The fairly tale story of young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) is retold in flashbacks by the aging Edward Bloom (Albert Finney). Though William Bloom is disappointed by the lack of reality in his father's stories, he learns to accept the fantastical stories and that this is how his father wants to be remembered. The theme of Big Fish is similar to that of Orson Wellles' Citizen Kane. Both movies are told in a series of flashbacks, however, Citizen Kane is told by many people and Big Fish by one. In the film Citizen Kane every person who is interviewed on Kane remembers him a slightly different character, implying that there is some fabrication and personal impression in each version of his life. Much like in Big Fish, Edward remembers his life a whimsical fairy tale. In both films some stories are substantiated by fact. In Citizen Kane the reporter finds some things backed up in records and in Big Fish William finds some truth in his father's stories, looking through old documents in his garage. In the film, scenes in the past are much more colorful and high key lit than scenes in the present. This may have been done to separate the two, and to show how much more exciting Edward's past was, compared to his present state. Also, he remembered his past in such an unrealistic way. The color red is also used a lot in the past. This could represent passion. Another film technique used in Big Fish in relation to the theme is a barefoot motif. One of the first instances of barefooted-ness occurs in the picturesque town of Specter. Everyone in the town was barefoot because they had all tossed their shoes across a telephone pole long ago. Edward's shoes are also tossed up there and he has to continue his journey barefoot. Barefooted-ness occurs again when Edward's wife gets into the bathtub with him, in the present. Some characters are always shoeless as well; such is the woman manifestation of the Big Fish and the smaller giant. The werewolf circus conductor is also seen scratching his head with a barefoot. The movie ends with some one removing the adult Edward's shoes and tossing them over a telephone wire. Barefootedness may represent youthfulness because most young children hate wearing shoes. It is only once people grow up that they always wear shoes when outside. This fits with the theme of remembering a fantastical and youthful past regardless of what really happened. Though Big Fish is an obvious exaggeration, the past is always some what fabricated to fill in the details we forget and subject to each individual's interpretation.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Moderately interesting and entertaining,"The story deals with a father-son relationship.  In the son's early years -- say at bedtime -- the son was enthralled by his father's stories about his previous adventures.But as he hears these same stories repeated (eventually _ad nauseum_), he views them as ""shtick"" -- his father's routine to be performed at any social gathering that permits it -- and he becomes resentful of his father's reliance on them.  His being forced into the posture of a passive, appreciative audience prevents him from ever really knowing his father or having an adult-adult relationship with him. The stories form an impenetrable facade and shield. In reaction, the son becomes estranged from his father until his mother calls him and says his father is dying.  The son returns home with his new wife, hoping to re-establish an honest, intimate relationship with his father before his father dies.  His wife is pregnant and he urgently wants to accomplish this -- to form a satisfying relationship -- before he himself becomes a father.The movie very satisfactorily develops that.What happens next is that son gradually finds some pieces of evidence that his father may have had some adventures that formed building blocks for his father's schtick.Burton and his movie dramatize the father's fanciful stories and that forms the backbone and length (205 minutes!) of the film.Somehow, by finding that the stories were not _entirely_ fanciful, that there may have been some reality building blocks in them, the son reconciles himself to his father and accepts him for what he is. And at the end, at the funeral, we see a visual evidence that his father's fanciful tales had some basis in reality.What's given us are marvelous, fanciful representations of the tall tales. And the son's brief searches for realities behind the stories also are given fanciful, fairy tale twists.  What we are not given (at least not given to me) is a satisfying sense of what helps the son suddenly give up his desire for intimacy with his father and click into accepting his father's stories and his father.IF we view the whole thing as it probably should be -- as a fairy tale composed of a collection of fairy tales -- then it makes a moderately entertaining evening.  The cast was great.  But it could have been more.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Tim Burton Human Fantasy CLASSIC that you'd want to recommend to children and grandchildren,"Big Fish (2003) :
Brief Review -A Tim Burton Human Fantasy CLASSIC that you'd want to recommend to children and grandchildren. It happens rarely, but I really crave those moments when I write movie reviews with tears in my eyes. Big Fish is giving me that honor right this minute. I guess that sums up everything for you all who are reading it, so don't waste time reading it further and go, find this movie on the internet or anywhere you can, and just sit tight for 2 hours. I must thank Tim Burton for making this one. There are some films or some characters that leave you with a question or a wish: What if I could live such a life? Is it possible in reality? The answer should be no, but I am angry at myself. Why not?! ""A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories."" True that. Big Fish don't need your brain, but your heart. The big difference between metascore (58/100) and IMDb user ratings (8.0/10) will tell you why. If you try to find logic in it, then you'll be burned. If you just go with the flow and believe in this fantasy, it will teach you a lot about real life. The film is about a father and son who have a feud over the father's habit of telling adventurous stories. The son likes them all in childhood but starts hating them all and his father too in his young days. When he returns to see his dying father, he begins to know him better through stories he has been telling for years. I tell you, they are all full of metaphors that can't be described in words because the capacity of understanding will be different for every single viewer. For instance, I personally liked that scene when he sees his death in the witch's eye. Logically, it should have made him sad, but metaphorically, it kills the fear of death in him. You just have to understand every single thing like this, no matter how fantastic, weird, and unimaginable it is. Burton had made a film that would transit a message from one generation to another and then the next one.. FOREVER.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Big Liar,"While it's visually stunning and exceptionally filmed, this piece is a little sappy for my tastes although it certainly shows some promise. Being a fan of Burton's previous work, I figured this was worth a look, and while I did enjoy most of the film, especially the visuals and scenery....I had problems with it's sentimentality and the basic underlying story which consists of a pathological liar promoted to a hero. Sure, not all of the stories were complete lies, and I realize that, but I feel the movie was asking me for more than I could give it to succeed.The appearance of the film and characters within it are truly great to watch, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's witch character. The environments and landscapes are filmed with precision and masterful technique. The overall cast is great, although MacGregor has trouble with his Southern accent. The stories are rather boring but all have a whimsical feel to them, which makes them just bearable. However, it really ruins itself with the vomit inducing ending.

And I'm once reassured: ''what a dreadful life we'd have without them!'' I've really enjoyed Big Fish and even if I initially disliked the romanticism (knocking at someone's door and making such a confession and she's not scared to death? ...well, giants I can accept but this is a serious stretch) I later realized that the movie was more about the extent to which we choose to transform (and even transcend, one could argue) our life through the craft of storytelling, how stories infer meaning to our otherwise apparently meaningless lives.The narrative provides a very good example of one might choose to fight nihilism and I think a lot about what Dr. Benett said towards the end: ''And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version...but, then that's just me''.9 out of 10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Life as a big fairy tale,"This is a beautiful story about a man with the rich inner world, which was not understandable to his son. Developed by his imagination, the whole life he told an incredible stories to the others. And so, his ordinary life in a small provincial town,he painted with unreal colors, and made an unfinished fairy tale.
 On the other hand, there is his son, who, due to his father's frequent absence, was forced to relate his life to the fantastic stories which his father left him, instead of reality. And he trusted him, until the moment when he realized that he had believed in only one great fairy-tale throughout his life. And then there is a split in him and he rejects his father, because of his own misunderstanding of the specific personality which his father has.
 As a result of circumstances, he begins to realize that his father was in fact all his life, one honest person, a man who always helped to the others, who was always guided by goodness and courage. Because all of our lives are actually how we seen them, and if someone wants to make his life as a fairytale, let him do it.
 And whats happened at the end? Using the same formula, out of love as a base, not wanting to disappoint his father , he told us the incredible story of his father's end, seeking to round up the magical world in which his father lived. And the fairy tale story continues to live, through the unrealistic adventures that the son is now transmitting to his son. A wonderful story indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing.,This is another Tim Burton masterpiece. First came Edward Scissorhands in 1990 that took you on an odd yet emotional adventure. Now comes Big Fish doing the same with added fantasy. It takes you along for a ride with a interesting and respectful metaphor about life. It tells a great story about a story-telling father and unbelieving son who don't know each other at all. Truth is that the stories his father tells are exaggerated but true but the son thinks their all complete blasphemy. He mostly tells of when he was young and in love with a girl he never met. He works as a circus janitor for information about the girl in which he receives from a family friend of hers. He is also the owner of the circus. All the actors and actresses do an amazing job and fit their roles perfectly. Tim Burton has now added this great film to his long list of glorious movies that he's been a part of. I give this movie a 10 out of 10...no question.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Though, of course, he doesn't talk the fact, he tries to tell his life to his son and everyone in his way. If only what someone says is big fish for the others, he only knows what it means. In fact we may be deaf ears to his story.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
an epic achievement in mediocre film-making,"Anyone who has followed Tim Burton's career should be able to see this movie as what it is: the half-assed product of a director well past his prime attempting to recreate and collect pieces of his former films (most notably Edward Scissorhands and Pee-Wee). Throwing shallow rehashes of previous cinematic glories at a strip of celluloid is no way to make a film, but it is a good way to trick a lot of people into thinking they're seeing something of substance (or, dare i say, ""genius""). The lack of cohesion is only surpassed by the awkward acting of the father and son leads.What's most offensive about this film is the heart and sincerity that it tries so hard to put across to the audience through the story, when none of those passions seemed to be present in the people who actually made this epic piece of mediocrity. Tim Burton long ago forgot how to make a good film. His projects of the past ten or fifteen years have felt more and more like the products of a detached assembly line. it's sad that this former, unique visionary in mainstream cinema finally allowed his art to be wholly corrupted by Hollywood and settled on making filmic equivalents to Disney World rides.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well done Tim Burton,"This movie I wanted to see because it seemed like a good film at the time, but it was a tragedy to see this film crash and burn, there wasn't anything wrong with it, the story was inspiring and trust me once you watch it you become part of it.The story is about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor), a man who has been best known to stretch the truth. Now he is ill and his only son Will (Billy Crudup) comes to visit him in his last dying days, during that time Will begins to learn more about his father by hearing his tall tales of his life which included meeting his wife and many friends.Basically the film is a series of flashbacks of Edward Bloom's life, which we the audience become a part of.If you're a big fan of inspirational films, this one is for you.All in all, I give it a 10/10Thank you",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Burton's best Work but still a Wonderful Movie,"The movie starts of with Edward Bloom(Albert Finney), telling one of his famous yet annoying stories to his son Will(Billy Crudap), who is now a grown married man and about to have a family of his own. Will can't stand his father's stories, I mean, they are just fairytales, none of the stories that his dad has been telling him his whole life really happened, right? Will and his father stop communicating for a few years but when Edward starts growing older and weaker and closer to his dying day, Will and his pregnant wife Josephine(Marion Cotillard) come to visit and the story of Edward Bloom is told. The story is mostly narrated by Will without knowing if his father's stories are true or if they are all just a big lie and part of the story is narrated by Edward himself. The tale starts of with a young Edward Bloom(Ewan McGregor) and his many adventures starting from when he was a little boy and meeting the old witch(Helena Bonham Carter) that lives by the swamp with the glass eye, to meeting Karl the Giant(Matthew McGrory) and leaving town with him, to joining the circus and finally finding the love of his life, his wife Sandra(Alison Lohman). While Edward's life might often sound unbelievable, Will believes there might be some truth to it and he is bound to really find out the story of his father's life and love him for what he was and always will be: A big adventurous fish with an imagination bigger then life itself. I am a big fan of Tim Burton and while this may not be his best work, it's certainly a wonderful movie. All the characters are beautiful and unique in their own way and the movie itself is just simply magical and filled with beautiful moments. I would give Big Fish 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mad Crisp Dream,Big Fish is a good flick.  It's seems to me to be Forrest Gump meets Pee Wee's Big Adventure or rather Big Top Pee Wee considering the amount of circus involved.  THis movie struck a chord with me because I had a father like Ed Bloom which made the ending for me  pretty touching.  Albert Finney and Ewan Mcgreegor were awesome in it and Billy Crudup despite critics bashes kiscked ass as well.  The only thing i didn't love was that I was a expecting a surprise ending but I got an emotional one.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Overly manipulative, poorly written, but PRETTY.  Not Burton's best.","Burton has always been a stylist, and his stories tend to work when the style emphasizes/benefits the story. Ed Wood, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, even Scissorhands all work with his perhaps overly designed baroque films.Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, and this film are not very well written - the stories are clearly on the back burner to the set-pieces, and his favored casting of HBC in some quirky turn. Big Fish has a potentially very affecting story here - the story of a son trying to understand his father, almost when it's too late, to try to find the ""truth"" in the lies, and maybe embrace the ""love of life"" those lies may represent.But that story is not effectively TOLD here - Burton is more concerned with giants, shoes on a line, Elfman musical interludes, Danny DeVito in weird make-up, set design. People love Burton's ""quirky"" touches, but quirky touches do not a good film make. Bad casting (McGregor, as good as he is, does not convince as Finney's young self) doesn't help. Finney COULD have gotten an Oscar nomination if he had been directed properly here, but is wasted in a role that should have been his for the taking. The movie, incredibly, doesn't seem interested in his story, or his son's quest.Much potential, frittered on a soft-headed, overly- and transparently manipulative film that is under-written and poorly executed. Big Fish is beneath Burton's talents, when he's firing on all cylinders.As an earlier poster says, too many clichés and ""Disney""-esque b.s. in this film that is handed to us rather half-assed-ly only makes it seem like a cynical attempt for Burton to have a big and popular hit.I didn't love Mars Attacks, but at least it seemed more heart-felt.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Finally saw it, and couldn't get enough","I remember seeing a trailer, or a commercial, for this film in 2003, which turned me off and I saw it only after a recent recommendation from a trusted friend (with similar tastes). Score one for recommendations. Yes, some of the images are bizarre and look goofy taken out of context (as in a trailer). But on DVD, within one week I had watched the film, again with the director's commentary, again with intermittent trivia, and any other way possible. Probably one of my top 15 films of all time. Many scenes and dialog resonated like a handbell choir. Come to think of it, Tim Burton's films are always at least good, and I've liked them before (including Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands). As I get older it seems like I'm more and more jaded and am moved by less and less. But, I connected the dots in this film/story, and wept at the end (while more overtly sentimental movies leave me cold).",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

AMAZING!,"I am a huge fan of Burton, at least most of his work.  I was sorely disappointed by his work on ""Planet of the Apes"", but found that his visual stylings in ""Sleepy Hollow"" were amazing and helped a lacking story. Anyway, on to ""Big Fish.""Now, I'm not one for the dramatic tear-jerker movies, in fact I try to avoid them like the plague.  But I was tricked into thinking this movie was heartfelt and a good movie with a great story, which it is, but by the end I noticed the lump in my throat getting bigger, and that inevitable tear rolling down my cheek.  Yes, this movie got me, and not many movies do, at least not like this one did.  It really is that good, and if you don't see that then there's something wrong with you, you must not like anything or have had the emotion of compassion taken away.This movies story is simple, at lease simple to tell.  What makes it so good is the underlying meaning, the relationships and chemistry between the characters and of course the emotion that is conveyed.But alas, this is only my 2 cents.  Although just about everyone else in the theater I was in, no matter how hard they tried to play it off or hide it, was crying.  So don't listen to those people who say it's just Burton being Burton, cause it is, but it's not at the same time.

Altogether a wonderful film,"I was biased towards this film by my love of the combo of Tim Burton's films and Danny Elfman's music, but I've been recently disappointed.  I went to see Big Fish with little expectation and came out greatly rewarded by this ultimately simple story with beautiful music and ""wallpaper"".That said, I believe there was some bad acting (with the exception of Ewan McGregor, who played a wonderful part) and some awkward dialogue, but while this took away from the story somewhat, Big Fish was still a great viewing experience.The point of this story, without giving away anything, is that life is ultimately as beautiful and grand as we choose to make it, that we make our own immortality, if not through our actions then our words.  Any one who has loved Burton's films in the past won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Boring collage,"There is a certain type of good musicians who want to compose, yet are able only of bunch of good overtures never a self-contained solid piece. The movie feels like being itself a product of this kind of creative mind. Moreover the idea is presented as stories of one character who is the crazy storyteller himself. It is a mixture of picturesque stories that built an ego of an old chap who happened to have an eager audience in his own family. This is how the film gains sentiment and integrity. I can't believe that this sentimental crap got 8 points. The start is very puzzling. First 15 minutes I had a tough time to orientate myself ..it looked just like a big challenge or a big hype....the latter it was. Credit goes to the form.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The perfect movie,"There are only two other movies I know of that are as charming and sweet as Big Fish, and those are Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption.The story is riveting and it's just overflowing with a magical atmosphere.

If you like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption, then grab your girlfriend and go watch it - you will not be disappointed. It's not like the movie cannot stand on its own other than to be likened to Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption, it's just that all three of them will leave you speechless and filled with wonder and joy.

"Dude, it was a great movie.","I have just seen Big Fish and I believe this is a movie that will go down as a cinematic masterpiece.  I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, so I was a little weary, but I thought it was an actually beautiful film. What is important about this film is that it an asthetic film, and just plain visually pleasing.  I mean how awesome did it look when Ewan McGregor is standing in the middle of a field of daffodils, and how beautiful the town of Spectre was (the first time we see it), the colors were amazing.   I also think that the stories that we see are the listeners interpretation of the events.  (Of course the giant can't be like 20 feet tall, but when you hear a guy talking about giants that's what most listeners will imagine.)  I have to admit the main reason why I did see the movie was because Ewan McGregor was starring in it (I wouldn't mind more scenes with him), but I was not dissapointed with the stellar acting of Albert Finney etc...  What is most important to know is that this is not a ""normal"" movie, so don't go to the theatres expecting to see a ""normal"" movie.  I can understand if you don't appreciate all the metaphors, and the abstract quality to this movie, but please to just bash it saying that is sucked.

An extremely imaginative and touching fantasy.,"Starring: Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Matthew McGrory, Steve Buscemi, Danny Devito, Missi Pyle, David Denman, Ada Tai, Arlene Tai, Deep Roy and Robert Guillame.It's amazing at how touching this film really is. The main plot is a series of flashbacks told by an old dying man, Ed Bloom, telling his son fantasy stories of his life that couldn't possibly have happened. His son, Will finds his dad to be crazy, but he tries to come to terms with him. The flashback story is very odd, including a poet turned bank robber, a giant, a town where nobody ever leaves, a witch that can tell you your death and even a circus master werewolf.This entire movie you know how it will end, and it does end how you think it will. The end is sad and touching, just like the entire movie.

who is the big fish?,"This movie is very weird. It's hard to understand and if you know who the director is you will know why it is so strange. But it is actually a good movie. It has a lot of amazing actors and actresses. And the theme of the movie is so cute. Does it make worldly sense? Absolutely not; but you know what, I still loved it. At the beginning there is a lake and this guy is telling the story of THE BIG FISH. They say it is a guy that died and that's why none can ever catch this fish. And the only bait that will work is gold. The main character's dad tells all of these elaborate stories about this life and I'm still not sure if they are true but they are still cool stories. He is telling a story about some town that he lived in and he was so cool and everyone liked him and he was just everyone's hero. This dog gets eaten and then this giant comes out of nowhere. And no it's not a guy on stilts or a robot. He is a real guy! He was 7'6!!!!! HUGE! Anyway they become friends and go on adventures. The dad goes to the circus and sees a gorgeous girl and doesn't leave till he finds her. He was there for TWO YEARS without getting paid!!! No thank you!!

Literary Parallels for An Excellent Film,"An excellent movie.  A throwback to Faulkner and Southerners.  Yet approachable.  This movie explores some of the same ideas as some works by Faulkner.  Most specifically The Sound and the Furry.  The ideas that overlap are the concept that one can live on through the stories you tell. Also, the propensity for Southerners to uphold this story telling tradition. Another movie that examines some of the same ideas is Second Hand Lions.Both are good movies, but Big Fish is in a class of its own.  A class of greatness. This movie is a legend about the legends of a legend. Good performances and good directing contribute to a good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

beautiful looking film fails to move,"Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"", like it's main character is extravagant, earnest, and likable. Unfortunately also like it's main character it is distant, narcissistic, and delusional. Big Fish has the wrong main character. The one emotionally resonant part of the film is unfortunately sidelined by acres of entertaining glitz. The story concerns the son of the main character {Edward Bloom, played by Albert Finny and Ewan Mcgregor} realizing how little he knows about his father who is slowly dying. That would be the emotionally resonant part of the movie. Unfortunately that is reduced to about 10% of the movies running time, the other 90% concerns the life of Edward which (like the movie) is pretty much 90% made up, hence the frustration of his son. Ideal there would have been a 50-50 balance between the real and the very unreal, though since that is not so it is often jarring when the story briefly switches gears to catch up with real life only to shift right back again. It's frustrating and unsatisfying. My thought is that Burton sees himself as Bloom, who refuses to conform to reality, in a sort of response to critics who have said that his films feel fake. I have always disagreed ( Edward Scisorhands and Sweeny Todd are masterpieces of time and place, anything but fake) though ironically this film feels at times kind of artificial. Not always though, and for the most part it's entertaining and thoughtful. With fine performances by everyone, all though Finny is sometimes garble voiced, and Marion Cotillard and Jessica Lange's characters are underwritten they do their best. Of course the film has a normally gorgeous Burton look to it, and he does a fine job of at least visually underlining the difference in feeling of reality and fantasy. Though by the time it's over your brain might be whizzing your heart will likely remain curiously untouched. At least I thought so. The ending however is pretty fantastic and would probably have had a profound emotional impact if Burton had decided to forgo some of the admittedly trite fantasy in favor of a a more full portrait of the relationship between the father and his sons. There is a heartrendingly real story in lurking Big Fish so it's a shame that Burton ditches it (until the end) for an amusingly fake one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A delightful tale from a modest man's imagination,"where to begin, and where to start....This movie deals with a simple life story of a simple man with an extraordinary imagination..... an imagination that sheds a warm ray of light to our ordinary day-to-day life to make it .... colorful.... wonderful... beautiful... rejubilant ... and worth living. It also deals with a common conflict between a man and his growing son.... put together with simple, yet very meaningful, abstract to make a marvelous 2hrs movie.The director, Tim Burton. This man's mind is full of fantasy and imagination that he can accurately depict in his pictures. One will get drawn into the story, virtually, from the first minute.... till the last. The camera shots and the angels taken takes you right into the movie and makes you live the story with the actors. Not to forget the slow, but never boring, pace in Tim's pictures that gives you time to relax psychologically and absorb the story more.The cast; they all did a great job, and delivered to the standard of Tim's imagination. Their facial expressions, their tone of voice, their complexion and their accent... all fit together in harmony and synchrony beyond any other movie.The music; as perfect as the cast. It provided the movie its dream-like pace.... and bestowed upon my heart a calm rhythm.In short... a great movie, so worth watching... and definitely worth owning.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the movies that you have to see to judge,"Mind you, I like movies that leave me with the urge to find out more and to analyze.  I spent countless hours reading and reflecting on Mulholland Drive and Momento (and enjoy doing it!). This isn't one of those movies. I started out thinking it but realized very quickly that I don't care to figure it out. The truth is all there but it's not that important, really. I think it was a wonderful movie. Some people won't ""get it"", but then again, how can a movie be that great if it's designed to please everyone? Tim Burton has created a movie that speaks to people with a unique attitude about life, and I for one enjoyed it, from deep deep down my gut. Once you put aside wanting to figure out what's real and what's not, it's superb entertainment with great stories (I'm a sucker for good stories), great acting (I'm a sucker for MacGregor, Bonham-Carter, Buscemi) and wonderful imagery. It's a love story between a father and a son (along with a love story between men and women), and I have yet to see many movies that can handle this topic with such delicacy, humour and caring devotion.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Forrest Gump with an extra dose of whimsy,"Tim Burton directs a remake of Forrest Gump. Just... let that sink in for a little while. Done? Okay, now that you're suitably afraid, let me assure you, it's not as bad as it could have been. It's actually rather good, truth be told.And yes, it's perhaps not fair to say that this is a remake of Forrest Gump as the stories are different, the characters are different and it's based on a different book. Still, it feels like a remake of Forrest Gump. Emphasis on feels. The whole 'a young man from a small town travels the world, meets important people and later in life profits from those contacts' is straight out of Forrest Gump. Heck, they're even both set in Alabama.This isn't a flaw, however. There's room for more stories like these and even though Forrest Gump is an obvious inspiration, either for the movie or the novel, it doesn't lessen the value of this film as it is different enough to be called its own creation. The most important differences are the shifted focus from international politics to family values and the vastly different main characters. Forrest Gump, at its heart, was a comedic drama with heavy leaning towards political satire. The whole Vietnam War and Gump's career as a soldier. Big Fish is smaller in scale in that its protagonist doesn't change the world, not even accidentally. The story focuses more on the idea of what it would be like to be related to a person like that. To someone who knows so many important people that sometimes it feels like he doesn't have enough time for his own family. Not for lack of trying, but because he lives in a bigger world. It's an intriguing idea and the film handles it with grace.The actors are also delightfully talented and the various characters are more colourful than in Forrest Gump. Burton's tastes shine through and the whole film has a nice feel of dark Gothic and urban mythology mixed with fairy tales. Colourful film all around. I also really like the central family. They all feel unique personalities and you can see the bonds between them. The relationship between the father (Albert Finney) and the mother (Jessica Lange) is especially heartwarming in a way I haven't seen in a while.If you're a fan of Tim Burton, Forrest Gump, urban fairy tales or good storytelling in general, this one is definitely worth checking out.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not a traditional Tim Burton movie but still works very well,"The week before watching Big Fish, I watched Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas. Both have a more twisted aspect that make the movies absolutely thrilling to watch.

We follow Will Bloom, son of Ed Bloom, and his journey to figure out who his father really is before Ed dies. In order to do so, he must look into the tall tales Ed told him to find the truth behind it all.The movie is spectacular with awesome film work, lively tales, and many fun characters to look out for.

The Storyteller,"It's rather ironic that Tim Burton has found himself making `Big Fish.' He's famously known for utilizing attention-grabbing visuals to slide the story into a slightly offbeat fantasy world and is often criticized for being more in tune with the esthetics rather than script details. Still, he works under scrutiny from the critics in a medium that tells the tallest of tales but to an audience that is divided over the best way of telling them. Some love the storybook method of adventure and the fantastic, while others don't buy into it and prefer a movie with a heavy foot planted firmly on solid ground. Those of you in the latter will not enjoy Burton's movies but may tolerate them. This is the message in `Big Fish.' It is between Edward Bloom and his son, Will. They both have different perceptions of what is important and what is baloney.The fantasy genre is slowly making a stand for itself after years of being second to others in the Hollywood vocab. In `Big Fish' they make extra evident that fantasy is far more intoxicating than reality and that you can find boundless pleasure in its escapism. Yet `Big Fish' not only tells an entertaining story but it also invokes the imagination. Tim Burton is a very good storyteller, I think, because his visual eye is perfect for the big screen. This time Burton and company manage to combine the best of all elements and make a truly amazing film.This whimsical Tim Burton movie keeps a finger on the human elements, emotion and spirit. The manner in which it is told, with amazing characters found in tall tales, is inherently likeable, as a good yarn has always been over many generations. There is nothing too deep here, just a good story to be shared with the world. And that's the fundamental nature of going to the movies in the first place, to listen to an entertaining story, and this one is told with enthusiasm and heart. `Big Fish' will be as good as you want it to be. The general message is this and it's important to appreciate how the way a story is told can effect your very perception. You must first give into it, kind of like a leap of faith for some, but once you've let go of the world the story will happily reel you in hook, line and sinker.4 out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Modern Munchausen,"Tim Burton is generally at his best directing quirky, offbeat films such as `Edward Scissorhands' or `Ed Wood', and less entertaining when he moves into the mainstream. His two `Batman' movies, although better than their successors and containing some original touches, were just another manifestation of Hollywood's long love affair (dating back to the original `Superman' in the late seventies, and still continuing) with the comic-book superhero, while his recent `Planet of the Apes' was an example of a redundant remake of an original that never needed to be remade.`Big Fish', however, is a film of the type at which Burton excels. The central character, Edward Bloom, is a Baron Munchausen type character, much given to telling entertaining tall stories about his past. (It is interesting that several of Burton's films have a central character named Edward). These stories, however, are not always appreciated by his family, especially by his son William. The film opens with a quarrel between the two men at William's wedding when Edward tells a story about how he once caught an enormous fish which had earlier swallowed his wedding ring. After this, the two do not speak to one another for three years and William only returns home when he hears that his father is seriously ill.William is a rather prosaic, priggish young man. If Edward is a Munchausen figure, William is the spiritual descendant of Dickens's Thomas Gradgrind, a man for whom everything other than hard fact is either nonsense or a lie. He complains that Edward's fictions have always prevented from getting to know his `real' father and wants to be told the pure, unembellished truth about his father's life. Even in the final days of his life, however, Edward persists in telling his old stories, and William tries to make sense of these in an attempt to get at the facts. (It is perhaps ironic that William lives and works in Paris- in American films generally the city of romance and dreams- and even has a view of the Eiffel Tower from his office window).The film proceeds to tell Edward's life-story as narrated by himself, intercut with scenes set in the present day. The earlier scenes relate a series of bizarre adventures reminiscent of `Alice in Wonderland.' Edward meets a witch whose glass eye can foretell the future, befriends a twelve-foot giant, stumbles across an unreal, eerily perfect village where there are no roads and everyone goes barefoot, works in a circus to win the love of his life, serves in the Korean War when he has an adventure involving a pair of female conjoined twins, and takes part, together with a poet, in an unsuccessful bank robbery. This part of the film is shot in a surreal, dreamlike style with some striking visual images- most notably the shots of the village of Spectre and the scene where Edward woos his future wife standing in a whole field of daffodils (which he has been told are her favourite flower).All of the parts are well played, but the best acting performances are from the two actors who play Edward. Albert Finney plays the ageing Edward as an entertaining old rogue, and Ewan McGregor plays him as he was in his younger days, or rather as he would have liked to have been in his younger days- smarter, better-looking and more successful than he doubtless was in reality, and possibly younger too. It is notable that Ewan McGregor appears to be around the same age as Alison Lohman who plays Edward's wife Sandra as a young woman, whereas Jessica Lange, who plays the older Sandra, is markedly younger than Finney's character. In some films I would have put this discrepancy down simply to lazy casting, but here I suspect it is a deliberate way of increasing the film's surreal atmosphere.As the film progresses, there are indications that there may be a core of truth in some of Edward's stories- William discovers that his father did indeed serve in Korea and that Spectre is a real place- but we never find out exactly how much is true and how much is invention.  Nor are we meant to. The central theme of the film is the importance of the imagination. The truth about a man cannot be discovered from bare facts of his life alone without taking into account his imaginative inner world. The `real self', if it lies anywhere, lies in this inner world and in the private mythology which we construct for ourselves. The film comes to an emotionally satisfying conclusion as the world of real life and the world of Edward's imagination fuse together, Edward's life comes to a triumphant end and William comes to accept his father for what he is. I would rate this as the best movie yet that I have seen from Tim Burton. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fairytale Journey,"This movie is best described as the journey of a man's life with a fairytale portrayal.  It chronicles Edward Bloom's sugar-coated life events that initially made for good stories and later defined his character.  His son wishes to discover ""who"" his father really was,  not just some made-up story.  But in the end, it is revealed that sometimes holding on to harmless fantasies in life, like a child's belief in the toothfairy, is not so bad after all.And this movie felt like something out of a children's book, perhaps Gulliver's Travels.  The adventures you are taken on alternate with farcical themes intermingled with semi-serious ones.  And this ""replay"" of Edward Bloom's life seems at times better suited for children.  While still enjoyable by adults, it should not be assumed to be too much more than its ""Jack and The Beanstalk"" type story.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Movie I have seen in a long time...,"Big Fish is a must see. Tim Burton has really stepped off on a ledge and made a beautiful, unbelieveably heart wrenching movie. I was glad to see the surreal, dreamlike side that he brings to a film added to this amazing story. Many men even cried at this one...including myself.Character development is spectacular! It was like ""A River Runs Through It"" meets ""Cirque de Soleil"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"better than ""just the facts""","Tonight I went to Tim Burton's latest film, Big Fish. I highly recommend seeing this movie.The film is masterful storytelling - masterful in the way the Bible is, or the ancient historian Herodotus. Most people today would never accept Herodotus as a historian, but those are the people I would especially like to have sitting in front of Big Fish. Story is not something less than the facts, it is something more.I began counting the number of homilies that could be drawn from the movie - and I stopped counting at 15. This is a movie with some wisdom in it.The acting was brilliant... with the exception of one brief moment by Billy Crudup in the first ten minutes, and this was completely excusable because of the brilliance of the rest of the film. And probably the weak moment was due to a momentary slip in the editing room.Visually, the movie was stunning, as one might expect from a Burton film. I was particularly interested in the way the movie depicted the human body, and the couple of ""nude scenes"" that will inevitably make some Christians uncomfortable. I count this movie among the few I have ever seen that included nudity in a non-violating way for both the actors & audience. Later this month, I will begin presenting a 15-week series on John Paul II's TOB (Theology of the Body) at Family Theater in Hollywood, and I will definitely be citing this film as an example of several TOB themes.I left the theater wondering why I plan to become a screenwriter, when I know that - even if something I write makes it to the screen someday - nothing I create will reach the level of artistry I witnessed in this film. I guess I will just stick to the maxim (from Chesterton? or Eliot?) that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.At any rate, this movie has my highest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Burton's fairy-tale,"Movies don't get better than this.Essentially a love story (both romantic and father to son), Big Fish is a wonderful, imaginative fairy-tale, regaling the viewer with story after story. Any fans of strong cinema or fans of good story telling will love this movie.Director Tim Burton (Batman, Sleepy Hollow) is a talented, original film-maker, and was a strong choice to direct. He often makes fairy-stories, and here he has left behind much of his trademark gothic darkness, replacing it instead with light and cheer and simple imagination.(Big Fish is also a return to form after Planet of the Apes - but let's not go there)Billy Crudup plays Will Bloom, who returns home when his father Ed (Albert Finney) has cancer. He feels as though he doesn't know his father, who only tells tall tales  embellished stories to entertain.Based on the book by Daniel Wallace, the inventive and clever plot revolves around the story of Ed Bloom's life (Ewan McGregor plays the younger Ed Bloom), and his love for his wife Sandra. It's almost like Forrest Gump, in that Ed enjoys a rich and exciting life  which may never have really happened. Midgets, cars in trees, picture-perfect towns, big fish and giants all meld together with remarkable fun.Albert Finney and Jessica Lange portray their characters with realism, and sitting that style of acting against a fanciful plot works cleverly. The acting and the plot offset and compound each other, making the movie stronger.This is sheer genius movie-making, and interestingly, works without violence or the need to shock or scare. Brilliant work.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Masterpiece.,"This must be Tim Burton's masterpiece - an amazing portrayal of father / son relationships brought forward by a series of metaphors, which ends up quite surprisingly. After watching the film, I bought the novel and was (gasp!) disappointed by it. The novel is drier, a lot more realistic, and colder in its approach. Burton's movie is a lot warmer, funnier, exaggerated, and poignant. I watched this movie with my father - it was a most moving experience.Tim Burton's style is quite a feast for the eyes, too. Combining a fantasy story with his strange, eerie vision makes the whole movie a feast for the eyes; the metaphors, combined with surrealistic settings that never seem to fit quite right in reality are fantastic. I'd find it hard to choose between this movie and ""Nightmare Before Christmas""...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is Tim Burton dead?,"This is what came to my mind when I came out of the theater. This is a major disappointment from one of my favorites directors. I found it lame, a bit boring and more surprisingly from Burton: unimaginative. This film don't make you feel anything. What could have been interesting, the relationship between the son and the father seems realy false and dull. And I think it would have been much better with Johnny Depp instead of Ewan McGreggor (not that I have something against him). Also Danny Elfman's music is his worst composition ever. I sincerely hope that ""Charlie & the chocolate factory"" will be better as I love the book and I think Burton is only guy able to direct it right.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Breathtaking,"I want to start out by saying that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. In addition, I suspect that as I'll grow older there won't be many more so touching like this one.The storyline consists in the narration of Ed Bloom's life tales and how he exaggerates the truth only to make them even more fascinating. As the story goes by we get to know the other half of the coin. Despite having lived an amazing life, Ed also neglected his wife and only son who holds a contained resentment against him.In ""Big Fish"" nothing is what it seems but at the same time it really doesn't matter. The density of the characters is just wonderful and it's that kind of movies that you can watch over and over as it leads you to an incredible and personal soul-searching.Tim Burton did a fine fine job with this one.Unquestionable 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Simply awful,"The worst Tim Burton movie I have ever seen, sure many people say, ""Don't insult this movie---if you do I'll slit yer little throat!"" Because they say it's a beautiful movie; and it is...only it became something that sucked. FIRST of all what the hell is with its' Southern-drama thing? It's stupid and way to redneck. Second of all, the ending is bizarre, and I like bizarre but this was terrible because you can be disturbing and bizarre (which Tim Burton is) and good, but you could also be the opposite. Thirdly, this film was way too positive, bright and happy---holy crap! Has Tim Burton gone mad? This isn't his style, it's GREAT to try something different but he took it WAY to extreme. There is even one line that says, ""I consider myself a social person..."" WTF!!! WTF indeed... Tim Burton did this crap and then he did his worst film up-to-date CHARLIE AND THE Chocolate FACTORY.

Silver Screen Poetry,"(This review may contain spoilers, i do not intend to ruin anything, but for your own sake watch the film first before reading this comment)Big Fish is just one of those films which can be a dilemma to a critic, as there is so much to talk about and so little to criticize.Tim Burton's film is an adaptation of a novel of the same name, and the same basic story. As a fan of the book i was a little worried about the concept of a silver screen version...i was very wrong.The book was labeled as something which would never make its way into cinema simply because it wasn't written to suit a director. Whoever said this must have forgotten Tim Burton. He turned all of those mini-stories and mini-characters into something which watches like poetry (if you take my meaning).Because that's what the Big Fish tale essentially is: poetry. I mean the story itself is about stories; a father's stories to his son. Tim Burton captured the deep love shared and closer-to-surface tension between father and son brilliantly, never falling once in his streamlined interpretation of the delicate relationship between grown father and growing son.Not to mention, Danny Elfman's orchestrating is brilliant. He got himself an academy award nomination for his brilliance in Big Fish, and he well deserved it. The pieces that he has created for this film are just beautiful. They fully capture the emotion and sheer...poetry portrayed in the film. Danny Elfman is never always one for subtlety, however in this piece of work he has mastered the art with splendor. The soundtrack is just beautifully poetic, matching perfectly with the delight Tim Burton has created.Also, Tim Burton has managed to create such a...fantastical world, and yet we take it seriously. Moving trees, werewolves, witches, giants, mermaids, larger-than-life characters...all of these are present in the film, and yet none of them seem ridiculous once shown through Burton's magical style.Big Fish is a film of magic and splendor; of love and temporary loss; of the past and the present; of father and son.Big Fish is poetry. However it is seen and heard, not read.-Davismo",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A delightful treat from the mind of Tim Burtan,"I've always been a fan of Tim Burton, he's one of the few directors who is able to put himself into his films without jeopardizing the story, that said, I have never thought of him as a great drama director, his movies are fun to watch, but you rarely have much emotion for the characters.Well after watching Big Fish, i take that back, Tim Burtan can make an emotional drama, you care for the characters of this film, and you want to learn more about them as the films goes on.  The story is great and its still got that lovable Burtan quality and feel to it.The performances are also great, most notable Ewan MacGregor, if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination then i will finally be convinced that the academy are just a bunch of fools.  He proves in Big Fish that he is one of the best actors of his generations (and he should also shut up those who were hard on him for his performance in the star wars films)This is one of the best films of the year, and a real treat to movie goers, go see this, its a film for everyone to enjoy",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A good movie, that could have been even better.","""Big Fish"" is in essence a film about a father - son relation.The son is a journalst who makes stories about reality. The father is a story teller who tries to make realities out of his stories. No wonder their relationship is complex.The son thinks for a long time that his father hides his real personality behind his stories. Only at the end he realises that the stories of his father are his real personality. ""A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal"".It is clear that in this father - son relationship Tim Burton is not neutral. His sympathy is clearly with the father. Much screentime is therefore defoted to the stories of the father, which are fairytales in themselves. In so doing the father - son relationship gets a bit in the background.A good movie, that could have been even better. The reason is the balance between the stories of the father and the father - son relationship. Tim Burton, a real storyteller himself, couldn't contain himself very well and so the stories of the father dominate throughout most of the film. Only towards the end the father - son relationship takes over. Needless to say that this is the best part of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

While this film had all that it also contained something much more, a human element.  Films like Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow had this element, but it was always on a much darker level. Big Fish makes the viewer look at themselves and their family.  How does that person relate to his or her father?

Magical,"In many ways, this doesn't even feel like a Tim Burton film.  Largely shorn of the dark tones and sinister shadows of Edward Scissorhands, Batman or Sleepy Hollow, it's more like Burton via Cameron Crowe, a comparison further held up by the presence of Billy Crudup.  With Ewan McGregor present, however, together with themes of love-against-the-odds and magical realism, the comparison is more with Moulin Rouge!  Add all of this together and you've got an enchanting tale.  But it's not flawless - for starters, it's really quite slow.  (*There follows some plot details, no spoilers*) While, in the present day, we follow Crudup's attempts to get closer to his dying father (Albert Finney), the film simultaneously shows us McGregor as a young Finney, in flashbacks that are almost certainly apocryphal.  He becomes a ""big fish"" in his home town, then strikes off on his own, coming to a village called Spectre.  It's at this point that the movie becomes a little plodding, but it picks up a bit once he spies the love of his life...  In essence, it's a slightly uneven film with wonderful moments - the popcorn, the daffodils, Danny DeVito.  And it's a rollercoaster ride through Tim Burton's imagination with giants, witches, mythological beasts, circuses, romance, sky-writing and fish.  The cast is outstanding, although the most memorable turns come from supporting players such as Steve Buscemi, in great form.  One stand-out aspect is the way it actually gets *better* towards the end.  Films never do that, and certainly not fantasy-tinged films like this! So it gains an extra point for a truly wonderful ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Something Smells Kinda Fishy!,"Let me start by saying that Tim Burton will always be a great artistic director/production designer. His movies will always carry that weird, offbeat imagery which will please fans to no end. Unfortunately, he will always be at fault for choosing such weak scripts for his projects. John August's run-of-the-mill script for Big Fish leaves much to be desired because of the shallow storytelling and flimsy characterization. Most of the characters involved are either too flat, or too deliberately odd, for the viewer to relate to. Big Fish introduces us to Ed Bloom, a man who tells some unbelievably amazing stories. But these episodic stories didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt Burton's visual style and twisted imagination. I failed to see young and old Bloom as inspirational or even likable, rather he came off as annoying. Old Bloom droned on for hours, talking nonsense. Young Bloom was a self-centered dolt, who always got what he wanted. His son, Will, had all the reason to resent his father, but even he came off as a jerk at times. On the bright side, the movie delivers good results in the acting department, although McGregor's southern accent isn't quite convincing. All in all, an unsatisfactory effort.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A fanciful story explaining a life of fanciful stories, beautifully!","'Big Fish' is an intriguing and beautiful fantasy from the imagination of Tim Burton. The  entire cast is brilliant, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and all  the rest too. The movie is charming and lovely, spectacular but not overdone. It was  surprisingly wholesome.This type of movie has the same southern charm as 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya  Sisterhood'. It's a fairytale of the same breed as 'The Princess Bride' though it's more  whimsical, less sarcastic. They let the magic flow, and don't squelch it by explaining it  away. Although, the editing is tight, you don't feel confused at the end. Some of the  special effects are so convincing, I thought they were real, even after a minute or two.  Parts of it remind me of Alice In Wonderland, other parts are more like a classic hero  movie from the 1940's.There's love, fantastic creatures, slapstick, haunted woods, and paradises. The movie is  about overcoming obstacles more than anything. It's mantra could be FDR's famous line  ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself.""

Fantasy and Reality Blend into Surprisingly Beautiful Film,"I just saw ""Big Fish"" at an early screening last night, and I must say I walked away amazed.To be honest, I am a big fan of Ewan McGregor's work; I think he is an excellent actor, and I mainly went to see his performance.  I saw by looking around at all the Edward Scissorhands t-shirts and Jack the Pumpkin King ski caps that I was surrounded by mainly Burton fans.  No matter; I knew I was going to enjoy this film from what I had heard about it, even if it wasn't completely up to par.However, the film turned out to be fantastic in all ways; you'd really have to press me to find a single flaw.  The characters were rich, and perfectly cast (I don't even really like Alison Lohman, but she was THE young Jessica Lange).  I really liked how consistent each character was, as far as McGregor being dead-on as a young Albert Finney, and Finney hitting the mark as an old McGregor.The film was crazily well-written; it was comedic, dramatic, far-fetched, light-hearted, and touching all at once.  But what is amazing is that this was all accomplished without being too cheesy, too sickly-sweet, and too unbelievable. What's more, the way the story was told was very interesting; there was seemless transitioning from the past to present, with parts being told from different points of view.  Also, each principle character had about the same screen time, which I really liked.  The script, direction, and acting were so fresh that I never had a dull moment--the film was always interesting, never boring or lackluster.  I didn't look at my watch once.Tim Burton really surprised me with this one. Of course, I have thoroughly enjoyed a few of his films from the past, but I wasn't sure what to expect from this one.  It is by far the most mature film of his to date.  I appreciated that it wasn't too ""Burton-ny""--but that's not to say that you cannot see him in this work.  It is a true Burton film, down to the last detail, but it's not so out-there that only real Burton fans can enjoy it or understand it.  His directing is superb and focused, and I cannot imagine another at the helm of ""Big Fish"".I can guarantee you will not be disappointed in the acting. Finney is more than convincing as the stubborn, old, and colorful story-teller; Crudup IS the skeptical, annoyed son who really doesn't ""get"" his dad, and who has accepted the fate of never really knowing Edward Bloom; Lohman is the fresh-faced, youthful beauty--the only one who will ever really give Bloom the chance he deserves, no strings attached; Lange gracefully plays the aged wife, the one and only who understands Bloom, who lets him get away with his stories--he is not only devoted to her, but she to him, and you can tell how lucky she feels to have such a loyal companion who loves her unconditionally.  But it is McGregor who really shines; he carries the movie and is flawless as the lovestruck, ambitious, curious, scheming underdog. His expressions convey every emotion perfectly, and his is a very honest performance, not matter how far-fetched the story.  But every performance, from the children to Helena Bonham Carter, is so truthful, and this is what really makes the story work.I think the ending was one of the best and least contrived ones I've ever seen in a movie.  So, if you're curious, I urge you to see the movie.  I really think it's for everyone, young and old, men, women, and children. If you're not curious, you SHOULD be.  You really WILL laugh and cry, but mostly you'll be laughing.  And I promise the tears are from sheer joy, not sadness.  It would be a shame to miss out on this one just because you're not sure of it.  Just so you know, my dad's a manly man who hates crappy movies, and I sure as hell am going to take him to this.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not your typical story or movie structure,"If you are waiting for the storyline to somehow conform to the expected format found in most other popular films, then you are going to have difficulty enjoying this treasure.This film has an incredible way of demonstrating how fantasy can have a place in reality, and that one's imagination doesn't have to be abandoned with adulthood. With all this fairy tale/real life enchantment, this film also contains very touching elements such as a father/son relationship and reconciliation and the presentation of a beautiful perspective on life.I am one of those people who remain in the theatre until all the credits have all scrolled by, and am therefore almost always the last to leave. After this film, however, there were several other viewers remaining in the theatre who were visibly touched by the story. Some were crying in a way that seemed as though it was more than empathy for the characters, but that this film somehow touched elements in their own lives.

The Moose Hole - Review of Big Fish,"`There are some fish that can't be caught. It's not that they're bigger or faster then the other fish, they're just touched by something extra.'Does Columbia enjoy sitting on their butts while the other studios gather Oscar praise? They started 2003 off not so promisingly with Darkness Falls and Tears of the Sun while limping through the summer with sub par hits like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Bad Boys II. Is it that they have no more ambition left in them to put forth the effort? Was it the tremendous embarrassment of Gigli that is the true cause for their lack of marketing strength? If so then that is too bad. No, not because of real Oscar hope for Mona Lisa Smile (Julia Roberts doesn't need another Oscar statue) or Something's Gotta Give is gone but the fact that the studio may have had a real chance with Tim Burton's big screen adaptation of a not so well known tale, Big Fish. It may seem ordinary on the surface, the usual father/son emotionally driven story, but it is the whimsy and the magic that sets this one apart from the rest. Burton, who has had a real success for quite some time, is drawing doubt if he can bring a heart-felt tale to the screen with his track-record of weird projects but the way Columbia is looking for Oscar night at this point, it could hurt to find out.Big Fish is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and it discusses a son's journey to discover who he father really was after years of hearing nothing but tall-tales. Edward Bloom was too big for the small town he grew up in. That was due to his high ambition, or so that is the way he tells it. William Bloom never really knew his father. Edward was either off on business trips or telling the same elaborate fantasies that his son had heard his entire life, more then once or twice. After a couple years of broken communication between them, William returns home after his mother informs him that his father is slowing dying and may pass away soon. The son returns home for one last chance to discover the man his father really was. Going through all the magical and extraordinary adventures once again, William discovers that the truth of his father was there all along, he just needed to know where to look. The story for Big Fish takes several different and elaborate stories, some that work and some that don't, and brings them together in an enjoyable heart warming feature. At times, Fish's plot seems too high for its own good and the huge elaboration of simple stories seem way over done for many to take seriously within the context of what the filmmakers are trying to get across. This leads for some scenes within the film to not come off as effectively as others. Luckily this doesn't happen too often with the course of the film.The cast consists of only two main leads (three if you count two people for the same role in different time periods) but the supporting roles provided by various talented actors and actresses are nearly as entertaining. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney share the role of Edward Bloom in various part of his life, the latter actor portraying the character as a dying old man. Finney's performance is nothing short of spectacular as Edward Bloom deteriorates as the feature moves on and as he struggles to get his son to understand the meaning behind his tall-tales. The last scene involving Finney will have anyone reaching for a tissue. That is a guarantee. McGregor provides that personal charm and spunk that makes the fantasies involving the younger Edward all the more memorable and captivating. Billy Crudup, who portrays William Bloom, seems okay but there is nothing in his performance that really stands out or equals that of Finney's performance along side him. Danny DeVito gives a delightful performance as Amos, the circus ring-leader who eventually hires Bloom to work on his show. Despite this charming performance, be warned! Unless you want horrible images of Mr. DeVito's rear end embedded in your mind, best to keep your eyes shut during a certain portion of the film. Nothing extraordinarily long but long enough. And Steve Buscemi's performance as a less then talented inspiring poet is one of the bigger highlights based on background characters.Overall, Big Fish manages to swim above its own high-watered ambition despite a flop or two too close to shore. Going into this film, one has to understand this: almost everything in the individual tales is a metaphor for something else. The conjoined Japanese twins, for example, aren't actually conjoined in real life but they are so connected to each other, despite their own personal differences, that it seems that way. Many of exaggerations within the film are marvelously well played out but there are moments where you'll be questioning what the filmmakers are trying to do. The most prominent moment(s) involves the naked woman in the river that the young Edward Bloom sees outside his car that has been submerged by a great rainstorm. Of all the other fantasy sequences, this is the one that made the least amount of sense and probably wasn't necessary. Even with a pretty well balanced two hour time length, Big Fish fluxes between consistency and incoherence with some tales struggling to keep the pace more then others. Outside of those issues, Fish is a wonderful surprise from the man who has brought us dark classics such as Batman and Beetlejuice. It manages to be funny and heartwarming without losing its message in its own sea of ambition.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So they DO still make good movies!,"I don't know why this movie didn't make a bigger ""splash"" in Hollywood. It was terrific. But then again, Hollywood wouldn't notice a movie unless it had at least 50 f-words & nudity...all by the 15 minute mark. So I guess it isn't a surprise after all. The storyline was well planned and left you with just enough mystery to wonder whether or not the stories really WERE true. I hope that I leave my family and friends as happy as this man did with nothing but good memories of me to share. I highly recommend watching this movie, but make sure you have enough tissue on hand.

Excellent movie...hesistant to give it a 10,"Big Fish is a rare film that surprised me, in all actuality. I was expecting typical Burton moviemaking, and saw what I consider to be an exceptionally moving film. (As an aside, I will never understand why the Hollywood Foreign Press nominated it as a comedy, but I digress).I admit that I was bored a bit throughout the movie, and slightly annoyed when people laughed at comical events that were more moving that comical. However, as the movie concluded, I looked around and noticed not a single dry eye in the movie theater. I'm a 23 year old male and I've cried while seeing two movies in my life (Life is Beautiful and Big Fish). Take that for what it is.My main concern with the movie is the southern accents and picturesque story of Alabama. As a northern transplant going to school in GA, I will admit that the southern accents were not spot-on. However, if I had never lived in the South, I never would have noticed this and would have viewed the movie a bit differently. I think that northerners have a ""story"" version of the South that is much different than the lived experienced of the South. I prefer the ""story"" version and that is what you get from start to finish in this excellent movie.I urge people to see the movie if you have an enormously strong connection with your father or you are slightly emotionally disconnected from your father. This movie will move you in a way that I was not expecting, even after reading numerous reviews of the movie.9.6/10 = A",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
BIG FISH has a big heart.,"My Take: Wildly imaginative story-telling. And after a second look, a truly great movie.When we hear the name Tim Burton, we don't usually expect merriment or the cheerfulness, at least not without a dash of melancholy or the dark and depressing. This is perhaps one of the reasons why Burton remains one of the most imaginative and bold visionary filmmakers Hollywood still gives a job to. Other than two dark and brilliant BATMAN movies to his credit, he is also responsible for dark ""fairy tales"" such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW, not to mention clever black comedies as BEETLEJUICE and MARS ATTACKS! But much like other artists, confine Burton to some unfamiliar terrain and you either get a good experiment or a terrible film. Burton proves he can't do sci-fi remakes in his disappointing remake of the classic PLANET OF THE APES. Now Burton breaks out on his old routine once more in BIG FISH, a comedy/drama about life with a little dash of fairy tale-esquire metaphors. Despite it's nod to fantasy (one of Burton's favorite genres) and a few talks of dark elements, BIG FISH is more about lightheartedness and sentimentality, certainly not the sort of things Burton works with.But some surprise! BIG FISH, while not pure Burton, is a terrific Tim Burton film nonetheless. It's elaborate, fanciful, imaginative and oftentimes uplifting. Above all, it's an ode to the power of storytelling. It's not in league with Burton's other films, simply parting him from his craft is sets it aside, but that may also be the reason why this film is simply stirring and curious entertainment. It's so unlike Burton that it's also unlike any film I've ever seen.The story's about an old man named Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), already at his deathbed, and to remember him by, he tells the story of his life in a series of stretchy metaphors, much to the delight of his wife (Jessica Lange) and much to the dissatisfaction of his son (Billy Crudup). He tells, as a young man (played by Ewan McGregor), that his life was filled with adventures tied with life, love, revelations, realizations and life-changing moments. But here's the stretch: he also confronts an ugly giant who just happens to be misplaced in a small town, he also works for a carnival barker (Danny DeVito) in a carnival unlike other, he encounters mermaids & other magical entities and when they say when you find the love of your life, time stops, it's true!Perhaps I one of the reasons I didn't love BIG FISH that much when I first saw it is that it was totally different from Burton's other efforts. After seeing it again, I accepted it's differences and was thoroughly satisfied by a fantastic and highly original work. It's treacly to be sure, something that Burton usually avoids in his other films (he usually lets us relate to his characters in pains, not comforts). But BIG FISH, with it's differences, is proof that Burton can go soft on us if he can.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A story for everyone,"Big Fish is a movie that will pull in every member of the audience. Albert Finney, an amazing actor in himself, plays the amazing character with an imagination for the absurd, Edward Bloom. Ewan McGregor plays the young hopeful Ed Bloom, with the heart and soul of a friend worth having. The story takes place in several time frames, from Ed Blooms childhood, young adulthood to his late years with an adult son of his own. Billy Crudup plays the dying old mans son, looking for answers he visits his father for the last time. Big Fish is a drama that plays every genre to a T.The movie begins with a lost man searching for his fathers history. It continues cohesively through Ed Blooms childhood, from a one-eyed witch to jumping spiders. With ""tall-tales"" of wars, Siamese twins and a traveling circus, Will Bloom learns who his father is. Throughout the movie Will and his pregnant wife rehear most of Will's childhood bedtime stories of giants and idolized southern towns.Tim Burton once again mesmerizes us with a heartfelt love story with incredible imagination and flair. He takes us to a new world of fantasy and hope. Burton, usually dark and playful, takes a turn and directs a movie so full of love and compassion the only thing that tells you it was even him is the amazing score by Danny Elfman. Burton tells the story of a young man looking for a place so well you'd think it was his very own biography.Set design plays a huge part in making the movie what it is. The movie takes place in several locations all with very different themes. Forgotten forests, traveling circuses, the hidden south, to a white fenced home. The set designers do an amazing job of making each location a character. Each set has its own feeling, its own personality.Big Fish is an enchanting story of a young man trying to understand his father. Its believable in its total absurdity.

Big Fish? or Wet Fish?,"I really can't decide whether this is an Ok film that didn't quite push the right buttons, or just a plain non-event of a movie. It's rare that I find myself in this position. Usually I either hate or love a film, or find a movie not worth bothering with at all. But this one, whilst most certainly not impressing me at all, is neither bad enough for me to slate it, nor good enough for me to sing it's praises.Quite simply, I'm not sure what Burton was trying to do here. I understand all the metaphors and allegories that are present, but the ultimate goal of the film eludes me. Was it to make me think about how I relate to my father? Was it trying to tell me that not all stories are made up, or true? Was it simply trying to point out the difficulties of having a larger than life personality in a boring, mundane world? Is it all of the above? And, at the end, do we actually care?A film has to be entertaining on some level in order to keep the audience's attention. BF does this, but only just. At no point do you feel any great empathy for the character of the Father, as told in his stories. In fact, there's nothing about the film as a whole which really grasps your attention and demands that you continue watching.Perhaps the biggest failing, as with many other films, is the hype that surrounds them. BF has been hyped up as a wonderful movie that will astonish and delight. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver on that promise. In the end, it's just the story of a man coming to terms with his father's death and helping through that time and coming to understand himself better in the process.

A Bit Too Tall of a Tale,"""Big Fish"" as directed by Tim Burton pays lavish attention to detail, and that alone makes for this to be an enjoyable and entertaining film viewing experience.  The renderings of the fantastic tales of the elder Mr. Bloom are very visually rewarding and interesting, and the plot-line of the son's reconciliation with the dying father (and all of those tall tales) is a reasonable enough framework on which to have constructed the movie.  In all that detail and elaborate storytelling, however, some elaborate threads are left dangling, some storylines seem to have been changed mid-movie and some, briefly alluded to, and left sadly unexplored. These deficiencies do not prevent the film from being sentimental fun, creatively satisfying and well worth seeing, but nonetheless hold it short of attaining the distinction of a ""great"" movie.  There is enough symbolism and allusions to previous movies (his own and others)to keep film students and movie buffs busy analyzing and debating for years, but maybe Mr. Burton should have kept his eye more on the actual telling of the storyteller's story, rather than on constructing some of the perhaps too clever asides.  I hate to say it, but there's just something fishy about that.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I am a huge Tim Burton fan, I love just about every film he's ever made with the exception of 'Mars Attacks' but this was of extra high standard.It tells the story of a man called Edward Bloom except at the same time it doesn't. The story revolves around the idea that Edward likes to make up stories to make his life more interesting. No-one seems to mind, his stories have a certain charm to them, no-one except his son that is who goes to visit him on his deathbed in the hope that he might learn something true about his father. Besides the human relationships side of the story is a charming fantasy side including giants, Siamese twins and a poet turned criminal.It has to appeal to everyone surely?

Surreal movie but very touching,"I watched this movie with a good friend recently, and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it. I've been a big fan of Tim Burton's eccentric films (Ed Wood, Mars Attacks), as well as his atmospheric ones (Sleepy Hollow). This one had the feel and look of a movie that was made 30 years ago, though the whole movie had a surreal and dreamy feel to it. The storyline is simple, with a young man (Billy Crudup) trying to get to know his father (Albert Finney), a man with some wild stories, as he lies on his death bed. Of course, that wouldn't do the movie justice, as the quality of film-making is very Burtonesque, so it's hard to pigeonhole.The main thing I want to say about this film is that Ewen McCregor is one heck of an actor. He plays the young Ed Bloom, a gifted, smart, fearless, man with a heart of gold, flawlessly. The adventures of this young man are so poignant and well articulated, I can't Burton didn't get more acclaim for this flick. Albert Finney is remarkable in this role and I'm really surprised he didn't noticed for his work. I'd probably give this film a 9 out of 10, as it did leave me a little bit confused at times. However, I was speechless for about the last 30 minutes, as the movie really comes to a head and grips you.

Why can't we just live in the fabulous fiction,"The movie is just so lovely that I kept a smile on my face when watching it. The father had build up a fantastic world filled with witch, giant, big fish, circus They are interesting and attractive stories but he told these to everyone including himself all the time, and finally became a legend himself.It is natural that the father told his son about his ""experiences"" in the first place, and he kept doing this year after year. It would bring him great pride if he brought his son into his world, but it seemed not. His son, soon found out that all the stories had been told thousands of times, were actually non-existence. This happened when the little boy grew up, old enough to identify illusion from reality. At the son's wedding, he found his father stood in front of all the guests, again telling his story (the one with the big fish). Feeling so embarrassed and angry, he ran out and shouted to his father, blamed him for had never let him know the true version of his life, for ignoring him years after years even kept talking about himself at his singleton's wedding... After that, he hadnever talked to his father for three years.Stop from here, I'd like to digress a little bit for another similar plot I remember from Peter Pan. When Peter told Wendy something about fairies, he said: ""When the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies. ...children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead."" There must be many fairies fell and dead in the dad's stories when the son grew up.It is not that I was unwilling to grow up, and it is not that I pay specific sympathy to the father. Actually, I totally understand the mood that the son wanted to know about his father. I'm just wondering why people always want to dig up the truth, put the more wonderful and interesting way to explain it aside. Even though most of the time they do know the truth is unimportant and plain, or worse, fellness. As well as the doctor said at the end of the movie: ""I like your father's version more."" Maybe that's why people like the father. He kinda has an ability to tell things in a different way, a more acceptable way, eliminate all the banalities.The most impressive story the father talked about ever is the one with The Beast. At the beginning of the movie, we are told that there some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they are faster or stronger than other fish; they are just touched by something extra. This just seemed ridiculous when first heard, but alone with the movie moved, it gradually turned out that the big fish was actually stand for the father himself. A man, who was unwilling to tie himself down. But after fell in love at first sight with his wife, he convinced that she was the one he would spend the rest of his life with. Finally he took the wedding wing with no hesitate. And after that, no mater where he reached to, no mater who he met, he never stopped.Here're some sentences the father concluded after telling each story:Death is the worst thing that ever happened to me.Kept in a small pool, the goldfish will remain small. With more space, the fish will grow double, triple, or quadruple its size.Fish looks difference to different people.They say when you meet your lover in your life, time stops. While they don't say when it starts to move again, it will add extra speed that you cannot catch it.That night, I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicket are simply lonely and lacking in social niceties.   Ultimately, the son found something that really happened both in his father's stories and his life, and he began to understand his father's behavior. He found it was not that his father has a habit of lying or hiding himself. It was in fact an attitude of life, a special way to express his understanding through life. This is the spirit of his fiction world. So when the son were sitting beside his dying father, and were told to tell how death would be toward his father, he did so. He told a story successfully, both satisfied his father and himself. Good enough to make death no longer seems terrific. It made death like a beginning to another journey, but warmer, as coming home.The ending is delightful. It was just a scene of the son's little boy telling stories to his pal. It was stories of his grandpa. Stories finally continue, and the spirit of telling them may passed on from one generation to another.Have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it funny? And then you hear it again and suddenly it's new. You remember why you loved it in the first place.Let's give everything a chance to show its charm again, and give you a chance to find out that everything around you is actually shinning all the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Patchily successful,"Young man, estranged from his storytelling father for years, returns home to his father's death-bed and learns more tall tales, more legends, and how sometimes true stories are saved from the mundane by a dash of colorful whimsy. Director Tim Burton obviously felt a kinship to this journey, and to the relationship between father and son, but he can't seem to work up much energy or enthusiasm in the present day sequences (this despite the fact Albert Finney seems to be having a ball). The fantastic flashbacks, with Ewan McGregor as the young Finney, are fabulous however, and these episodes are the best things in ""Big Fish"". The film is handsomely-made, well-conceived, but you have to get through many lulls to find the good stuff, as if it were a crime to have one completely good movie. The production is very bright and beguiling, although comparisons to ""The Wizard of Oz"" (by one professional critic) seem somewhat premature. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heart-warming tale,"I bought Big Fish sight unseen because of the trailers I saw on it and because I am a big fan of Tim Burton and Ewan McGregor.  This film was delightful and was more of a mainstream drama than anything I have seen Tim Burton direct before.  Granted, there were some mystical characters in the film, but overall it was very much a well done story about a grown man who desperately wants to find out who the man who is his father really is.  His father played by Albert Finney as an old man and Ewan McGregor as a young man tendency to stretch the truth a bit about events that occurred in his life.  The son played by Billy Crudup appears resentful and embarassed of his father because his father won't answer a question with a straight answer.  The whole film is a combination of flashback and current events documenting the life of a truly remarkable man, whether the fathers stories make him more interesting or not, the man himself is remarkable simply in his ability to spin yars like he can.  The movie has a rather undramatic ending but it does leave the viewer with closure as the son finally understands who his dad is, even if he was reluctant to believe the story at first.  Tim Burton does a very good job in guiding this film from start to finish.  It is comical at times, heartfelt at others, but at no time does the story seem so completely out in left field to be unbelievable.  I was leery of taking my children 11 & 6 to see this film as from the trailers, it appeared to be somewhat scary, however after seeing it, I feel I would be comfortable in sharing it with children.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Touching, Imaginative Film","""Big Fish"" is the type of movie that made me think about the good things in life and inspires me to make the most of my life. We all know someone in our lives that would tell some big stories that would let our imaginations run wild, particularly when we were little kids. ""Big Fish"" centers on a father that does this frequently and a son that doesn't know whether to believe anything his father has told him.All the stories are fun and intriguing with great directing and imagery from Tim Burton and fine acting by everyone involved in this picture. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor (who I just realized is one of my favorite actors, possibly because of my Star Wars bias) effectively bring the adventurous storyteller, Edward Bloom, to life. Both actors were just fun to watch in this movie as was Danny DeVito, in a perfectly fitted role as a circus owner/ringmaster, and the beautiful Alison Lohman as the object of Ed Bloom's affection.However, there were some moments in the movie that did test my patience a little. The movie was a little long, some of the lighting in the scenes was pretty dark, and I realized I preferred watching Ed Bloom's stories acted out rather than just hearing Ed Bloom talk about them. Whenever I have talked to someone like Ed Bloom, who goes off on stories like he did, I'd probably roll my eyes and tune them out. Maybe I won't do that anymore!!All that aside, though, this is one hell of a movie! It has a lot of heart and imagination, and it actually choked me up a little. It definitely got to me in a very good way.

Simply Fantastic,"First of all...My English is not very good, so, my apologies....Well, I think that Tim Burton did one of the most amazing movies of all times...man, he´s great!!....Every scene in the film is full of surprises that you could never expect at all, the visual effects are great too, and the plot is very emotive....Not every one who see it likes it, but Big Fish is exactly my kind of movie and I wish this year was full of ""Big Fishes""...Albert Finney and Billy crudup play their parts very well, but Ewan Mc Gregor make this film even better than it was....I don´t know why this movie didn´t get an Oscar nomination, hey, I´m a great fan of Lord Of Rings, and I think that the people and the movies that won an Oscar really deserve it, but Big Fish was one of the films which had to be there in the ceremony, nominated in one or more categories...I want to say that I almost cried seeing the film (I´m a 16 boy) and never a movie make me feel that....Big Fish is original, creative, fantastic and a different but really good filmSorry Again For My English",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best feel good film for years!,Excellent movie which everyone should go see. Must win BAFTAs and Academy Awards. Brilliant performances by all the cast especially Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. I have never seen so many men wiping away tears at the end of a movie!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great Acting, Great Mini Stories, Never Ending","I thought the movie had great characters and everyone performed well. The characters were all unique and had a mystical era to them. After the first few characters were introduced I was interested in who Mr. Bloom would meet next.I liked the mini-stories, but I fealt like they caused the film to go on and on. There wasn't ever a real climax. This seemed to make the movie drag and you couldn't tell when it was coming to an end.I was a little disappointed with the music because lots of it was derived from ""Edward Scissorhands."" Music helps make the mood of the movie. The music fits to it, but when I hear it, it reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, which isn't Big Fish. I thought it should have had its own original music.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stunning,"Absolutely stunning.  Powerful, emotional, hilarious...all these things and more.  A movie about reconciliation, love and the joy of life. I highly recommend this movie; particularly for those who need a ""lift"" without the typical hollywood transparency.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I guess ""feel good"" is worth an extra 6 points","And in a way that's OK. But really, 27% of people give this a 10?? Come on, if this is a 10, then what is Forrest Gump, a 20? Please, somebody who voted 10 tell me how this is a better movie than Forrest Gump. Please.The acting is great, esp A. Finney & J. Lange, as is Tim Burton's cinematography & the power-of-positive-thinking philosophy feels good. The idea that a son would dislike his father and not talk to him for 3 years just because he tells tall tales gets the whole thing off on a very bad foot, from which it never really recovers.But really, to vote a 10 for a movie that espouses the way to leave a legacy is to make stuff up, you would have to not only have voted for Bush & Cheney, you would have to believe their stuff.I won't bother explaining the story. The 10 voters do that much better.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WHAT A DELIGHTFUL STORY AND SUPERB ACTING,"This certainly was a change of pace from the movies put out nowadays. Albert Finney is one of our finest actors, and it is sad to see him getting older, when he was a delight in his early film with Audrey Hepburn ONE FOR THE ROAD.  The two hours went fast and the direction was excellent.  Go see this one if you want a movie that is not a shoot em up, blow em up movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Christian allegory to the Bible (esp. Revelation),"Big Fish takes you to that hidden place that only a select few only ever get to know or see. Bjork sang about it. Tim Burton recreates it. Take your shoes off and stay for awhile. Mcgregor/Finney is the Big Fish; He is the Christian soul winner who walks by faith and trusts God's word. His stories sound like fairy tales to his son because he has no faith in God or the Bible. Crudup plays the cynical unbeliever. ""There is no way Jesus could have walked on water, it's just a made up story!"" But you will soon learn that it is not. Amazing parables begin to reveal themselves if only you have argus eyes to see. Carter is Jezebel, the adultress. The fallen angel, Satan, is Buscemi. (He put his shoes back on).  Jessica Lange is Eve (the naked woman in the water). Josephine (Cotelliard) I'm not so sure of yet..if you figure her out please let me know! This movie is really going to make God smile...and hopefully you too.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
9/10--A Breath of Fresh Air,It's too bad some people don't like this movie.  With the attention span some people have nowadays if there isn't an explosion or nude scene every 5 minutes they lose interest.This movie was great.  Albert Finney (the older Bloom) was superb and makes me wish he was my father.  It would be great to have a relative with such a vivid imagination and rich life.  It's the kind of film you need to watch a few times to see the connectedness of the different parts.  I loved it.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"one of the best ever, period.","some people will remark that it was okay and some will say they didn't enjoy it and some will be like me.  it is one of the truly inspirational films of our time and should be remembered as a classic forever.  certainly similar formulas have been used in previous films and will be used again in the future, but never so beautifully.  tim burton is a master and capturing the right music, moment, setting, and characters to tell a story that you will never forget.  that being said i have to recommend this movie to everyone who is not sitting in a theatre going ""yeah right"" or ""that couldn't happen"" this is movie for those people who realize that movies are a few hour period in ones life to escape reality and to forget about the bad in your life for a while, and nothing in recent memory has brought me back to that feeling more than this.  a perfect 10 and i can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Delicate, poetic... fabulous!","This will be for sure one of the top ten of 2004! I loved Big Fish! Burton's back with his traditional symbolic tale, so full of poetry, so delicate in it's metaphores. It makes you smile, it makes you feel good... and it makes you think. Ewan McGregor is very good, and so are the other actors, with an exception maybe for Cudrup, who's a bit too fake and makes a bit too much the ""serious son"". Dialogs are excellent (I love Senior Ed Bloom, who ALWAYS has a story ready, an answer ready!), scenes are excellent and the whole movie is drowned in Burton's poetry. Excellent movie! Definitely a ""must"" of the year, and not only for Burton's fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
When Tim Burton has a Lobotomy,"I'll admit I'm not the biggest Burton fan. I don't like Corpse Bride (gasp! How dare I?) and Nightmare Before Christmas still creeps me out when the little creepy Lock, Shock and Barrel kids start singing. I think I can pick out two movies from Burton's bag of tricks that surprised me, that I really like: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Edward Scissorhands. So, being a fair-weather fan of this cinematic veteran, I did my best to put on a happy face and give this movie a chance. I was, deep down, not expecting much. And that's exactly what I got. Not bad, but not good either. It was somewhere in the middle, but I'm rating it toward the lower end of the scale. Ewan, my sweet Ewan, what the heck was with that accent? I've seen some darn good souther accents in my short days as a critical movie viewer, and honey, you didn't cut the mustard. I don't mind Albert Finney, he does a pretty good job as a dying old guy with just a touch of senility. The costumes have their shining moments, and they storyline rises and falls throughout. All around, I didn't like this movie. But, if I was forced into a corner and told to watch this movie, I'd do it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
By Far one of the best movies!,"I was able to see a screening of the movie last night courtesy of a marketing firm out in Denver area. Other than the fact that it was the new Tim Burton movie, I didn't know much about this movie going into it. I remember seeing a spread for it in Vanity Fair a while back, but didn't connect the two. The spread I saw focused on a circus cast. This was NOT the entirety of the movie.The movie is about a man who, as a boy growing up, was told what seemed like tall tales of his father's life. He is haunted by the story of his father catching a fish on the day he was born, and it seems to overshadow every important event of this man's life. When the father becomes sick, William Bloom, played by Billy Crudup of 'Almost Famous' fame, heads home.It is then when William Bloom tries to pry more into his father's life and find out how to separate fact from fiction. The stories that the Edward Bloom, younger version played by Ewan McGregor, tells are definitely a hard thing to believe, but the vision and artwork of this movie and the production crew make the scenes and ""stories"" absolutely beautiful. As you travel along with the younger Edward Bloom you begin to realize that he is indeed ""A big fish in a small pond."" Throughout the stories, and the uncovering of ""the truth"" William learns more about his father, and yet at the same time learns nothing new.Overall, I LOVED this movie. I strongly suggest that you go see it. Billy Crudup played William excellently, and Ewan as the young Edward Bloom was captivating. Albert Finney, of Erin Brocovich and Traffic fame, plays the older version of Edward Bloom and you can't help but wish you had a grandpa like him. Some of the smaller roles were actually the biggest names in the movie. Steve Buscemi (known for his wacky character in Armageddon) was a small-town poet who goes missing, Danny Devito is the circus ringmaster, Jessica Lange plays Mrs. Bloom, and Helena Boham Carter plays a young girl who happens to be in the path of young Edward Bloom, and the lovable ""Giant"" is exactly that... you somehow imagine to see a bit of every friend you ever had in this giant, and possibly even a bit of yourself. The saddest note about it? Marion Cotillard, who plays William's wife, gets no credit for her role on imdb.com and yet she is just as important as the elder Mrs. Bloom.The movie gets two enthusiastic thumbs up from me, and I would definitely love to own this movie. In my humble opinion, it is the BEST work from Tim Burton that I've seen, and definitely ranks with the best of the best from this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of burton's best!,"I'am a hudge fan of Tim Burton. I think he is the only director out there with the guts to do something different. Some of his movies I would only recommend to fans of his(Mars Attacks!)but his really excellent ones(Edward Scissoerhands, Ed Wood) I would recomend to anyone. Big Fish is one of Burton's really excellent ones. Big Fsh was a truely marvelous movie. I have seen it twice in the theaters already and will probably see it a third time. I don't want to give anything away but just take my advice and see it. It without question deserves a best picture and best director nomination at the Oscars.(For once the Academy better give Burton some credit).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent!,"I'm not usually a big fan of Tim Burton films but I have to congratulate him on Big Fish. Ewen McGregor was the perfect choice for this movie.When Will's father falls ill he returns home to be with him. He wants to know how many of his father's absurd stories are true. Through story telling, flashbacks and a little investigation, Will is able to piece together the strange and wonderful life of the young Edward Bloom, played by Ewen McGregor. He finds love, adventure and even meets a giant, played by the late Mathew McGrory.Its a wonderful story and the end is very touching. Burton's scene setting makes the movie very memorable.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Enjoyable movie, not the best ending...","There are comments here that suggest you not to see the movie. But, looking at the rating which is high, I thought that I should see it. The movie is enjoyable. The fantasy is very well mixed with real life. The flashbacks are made very well. You will have a great time watching it and it's very funny at most parts. I see no reason why someone could hate this movie or just not enjoy it. In my opinion, the ending is not the best that could be made for this movie. It wasn't what I wanted to see as the ending. It could end with something interesting. Something that made you come out of the theater very excited. But well, it isn't that way. But that's my opinion. There are people that liked the ending the way it was. Want my suggestion? Go see it, it's a ""must see"" and you will hopefully like the ending! I give it 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Heartfelt Story,Big Fish is about a dad that tells a lot of stories. His son does not like that he always ruins his moments with his story so he tries to find out if they are real.Big Fish is a great movie. The story was great. It was such an interesting story. Some times it was a little farfetched but for the most part it was great. The acting was great. Ewan McGregor did great is his role. He felt like a real person did all the things he did. The scenery was great. The town looked great. It looked really realistic. Some times the movie also got funny. That was a great touch to this movie. The whole time it did feel like a person was actually telling the story of his past years.Big Fish is a great movie. On of the best Tim Burton movies out there.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The new title is 'A Goofy Movie',"One word to describe this movie is goofy. This movie is so so so goofy and it works! The reason why it works so well is because that's the entire plot. The fairy-tale events and all the stories make this movie work. Even though there are story-tale plot events and it's so very unrealistic, it's not just a kids movie. The whole plot with the son and the dad just makes the movie able to connect with a larger audience with a bigger age group. The effects for this movie aren't even bad, it didn't take away from the movie. Overall this movie is fun, silly, goofy, and really effective. I will most likely watch this on my own again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unforgettable rare treat.,"After watching a movie like this, I really want to say ""Thank you."" to someone, instead of just wondering what could be a better way to spend 9 bucks and 2 hours.

a really nice movie...,"Well, what do you do when you are tired and frustrated- it's midnight, dark and you are suffering from the bouts of Insomania- you watch the Big Fish by Tom Burton- well it ain't no Sherlock Holmes but Big Fish is a tale of a tale-yarner: a story teller. Well, in the back waters, a man wished to catch the biggest fish in the river- how he finally did catch it on the day his son was born and let it go after the fish had grasped his wedding ring. This story teller is a man who had sucked everyone with his story telling charms. The only guy unimpressed by his tall tales is his son- who feels that he had never been able to hear the true story of his father. He thinks his father is a megalomaniac and the world revolves around him......... So this story is basically a search- where his son finally discovers the true threads of the story- when his father is nearly dying. To his amazement, fact and fiction mingles and he could not believe his eyes when all the characters- giants, two headed Vietnam sisters, The Poet who went to the Wall Street, the Witch of his Father's stories pop out right at his funeral. Ultimately his son realizes- the wild imaginations that his father engulfed in were far vibrant and romantic than the real life monotony. He becomes a believer.And the story-teller becomes the story.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Emotional ending but not much depth,"If you want a fantastical story about someone's life then watch Forrest Gump instead. The moral of the story is that having wonder at your own life is important, even if it means occasionally embellishing the truth. I don't think that's a super important message and they only land it half decently. It did make me reflect on my relationship to my own father though, and genuinely consider wether my parents take comfort in the idea that when they die I'll carry on their legacy.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton's masterpiece,"Just so all of you know, I am a huge Tim Burton fan because I have always thought that if I were to make a movie about any of the same subjects as his films, I would use the same fascinating visual style. However, I skipped ""Ed Wood"", which is considered for many his best film, because he didn't use his usual visual style. So when I saw the trailer for Burton's ""Big Fish"", I thought Burton was going to use it as an attempt to free himself from his style and try to be more ""normal"". I did not go to the theater and see it, but when it came out on DVD I saw it at a friends house only because I was bored. Then the movie began, and i realized I was very wrong to doubt.""Big Fish"" is a simple story with great visuals, a touching message, and it shows that Burton, if given the chance, can be a great storyteller. The film stars Billy Crudup as Will Bloom a man who has never really liked his father, Edward Bloom, who is played by Albert Finney. The reason for it is that his father has been telling unbelievable stories about his own life since his son was born. Tales such as meeting a witch that if you look into her eye, you can see how you will die. Also about meeting and befriending a giant, going to war and meeting conjoined twins who help him return home, and catching a humongous fish. But the story that beats them all is the story of when he meets the love of his life and time stops. The young Edward Bloom is played by Ewan McGreggor and his wife, in her old years, is played by Jessica Lange. Finally, when his father is dying, Will returns home to spend time with his father and hopes to finally discover the truth of his life.""Big Fish"" is Tim Burton's masterpiece. He is not known for directing dramas, but here he shows his gifts as a director. He takes a story that, while simple, could have gone over the top in sappiness and cheesiness, but his visuals and characters are convincing, the plot gets you involved, and when the incredibly sad ending comes, you feel completely moved by the film and admire the fact that Burton has proved himself not only as a brilliant visual creator, but as a serious filmmaker that could make a great drama even without his visuals. 10 stars/ 10.By the way, this film made me give ""Ed Wood"" a chance, and I thought it was surprisingly good, but not as good as ""Big Fish"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love Thy Father,"The importance of story-telling is explored in 'Big Fish', a movie you have to keep an open mind for, to truly appreciate it's richness. When Will Bloom comes to see his dying father, he tries to get answers, and not just these hackneyed stories that his father loves to tell. The problem is of course, that Will refuses to keep an open mind to interpret these stories, as Edward's wife knows all to well, and Will's wife quickly learns as well. This is quite a tricky story to pull off, but the word 'tricky' must make lightbulbs pop in Tim Burton's head, because I have to hand it to the guy how clever this movie is. Burton cleverly shifts from present day Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney) to the past Bloom (played with a great full-on accent by Ewan Mcgregor). During the movie, we meet a whole PILE of characters from Edward's life, all of which are highly interesting. The most interesting to me were Steve Buscemi's (no surprise there) Norther Winslow, and the Siamese Asian singing combo (!!) played by Arlene and Ada Tai. You may other favorites. There are also different stories, some of which you'll like (I liked the first visit to Spectre and the encounter with the witch (played by Helena Bonham-Carter) and some you won't (Mine? The second visit to Spectre and his visit to a girl in the town (again played by Helena Bonham-Carter). This is what I love about movies about this, there's all sorts of stories that you can attach to, and you can discuss of what you like and don't like.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
