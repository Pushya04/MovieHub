Intense and interesting throughout,"I must have been the right audience for this movie. Before watching it I read several reviews and some of them critized it for being pointless and also for being a waste of two hours. But I decided to still watch it and that was great. Why? Probably because I am a father to a two year old son that I love more than anything. So I could relate to Sandra Bullocks character throughout. The decisions she took, the dedication she showed throughout was based on the love and protection for her child and loved ones. I don't want to write more than that. I thought the movie was great thoughout. Two hours felt like one hour. It was intense and interesting. Perhaps predictable as well but for this movie I didn't mind that. My curiosity was still on the highest level throughout.One thought though is that perhaps some bad reviews comes from people watching this on a small screen. This movie is probably best viewed on a big screen with a good sound.I don't want to write reviews for good movies because I think a good movie should be seen without any previous knowledge. But since this in my opinion is underrated and many of the negative reviews will scare viewers I felt I needed to say something.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

With all the hype it's actually a good movie.,"A bit over hyped but it's an ok to good movie watchable and intense at times , I would say it's a really good science fiction movie without all the stupid unbelievable imagination.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some people don't mind the mystery.,"The most common complaint I'm reading from user critics here is the lack of answers at the end of the movie. However, if we're meant to be seeing everything unfold from Malorie's point of view, it makes perfect sense that we would know as little as she does. I thought the ending was lovely. Not every single film needs to give answers to every little thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Quiet Place Where Nobody Can See,"""Bird Box"" is a sci-fi action movie produced by Neflix and like in other films, with many overrated fake reviews in IMDb by hired users or robots promoting the flick. The storyline is the same of ""A Quiet Place"" as well the lack of explanation who the creatures are. The unbelievable plot, where a man is capable to drive a car with black windows using the GPS through streets full of corpses and accidents or a woman with two children rows a boat in a river and runs through a forest blindfolded is boring in many moments. Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, who are the greatest names of this film, perform obnoxious characters. The conclusion is awful with a ridiculous sanctuary and leaves the viewers with many questions and no answers. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What The Happening should have been.,"Whilst Bird Box isn't going to win any awards for originality, it packs just enough of a punch to succeed on the whole. Some people complain about the pacing being too slow. I found it just about right, with the timeline shift back and forth providing some much needed intrigue and mystery as the film develops. I have to say, this film has one of the more memorable and affecting opening sequences I've seen for some time and is played brilliantly.The cast does a stellar job with what is ultimately a minimalist piece relying on tension building and dread, which they do admirably. A special mention has to go to Sandra Bullock who is terrific as Malorie, and Sarah Paulson who turns in an extremely brief but memorable performance that I was thinking about long after the credits had rolled.All in all a very solid little movie without any bells and whistles. Give it a go, you might be surprised. It certainly surprised me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
an interesting but slightly underwhelming thriller,"A post-apocalyptic thriller in the vein of A Quiet Place. There are plenty of differences that makes this movie worth watching but has a hard time giving the viewer a surprising or new experience. As I was watching I was able to predict some things that happened, and a twist that should have been shocking ends up being the weakest part of the movie. The movie is at its best when the tension from the mysterious creatures is heightened in small places. When there are too many characters on screen you don't feel the urgency or connect with the characters that may not make it. Sandra Bullock gives another great performance and I can't wait to see Trevante Rhodes in more movies, he really left an impact on the story. Overall a nice watch on Netflix when it comes out, with some great tension, and a nice arc of Sandra Bullock's character.just as an FYI - I did see this at the World Premiere at AFI Fest with the whole cast and director in person. so I did see it in a theatre and I am so glad I did! Definitely worth watching on Netflix too.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bird Box,"I didn't read the book before I watched the movie and I saw lot's of people on Facebook saying they had questions after they watched the movie but those who read the book said that not everything from the book could've been included into the movie. I've started reading the book and I'm only two chapters in and can see that this is true. I loved the movie but I'm already loving the book more. So judging by those who gave this movie scathing review, I'd say they didn't read the book and if they did and still didn't get the movie, that's sad on their part. If they didn't read the book, give that a try. I bet it'll change their perspective.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Quiet Place is the wrong comparison...,"This was a decent horror/ sci-fi film in it's own right, with great acting performances by all.

I watched this with my mom last year and was intrigued by everything going on. Upon watching it again (which I haven't done) I will say there are many flaws, but for a singular viewing this movie isn't too terrible. I am comfortable giving a 7/10. A decent movie to sit back and watch everything unfold, but probably not worth more than one viewing. Just my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Who are the Creatures?,"What/Who are these creatures?

Bird Box: Expected gem of a movie,"Bird Box was an unknown entity to me, one of those films from Netflix I just slapped on to end the evening. Little did I know it would wind up being the best movie I've seen in months.Remember The Happening (2008)? Well it's like that, except it actually has a great story, competent cast, great cinematography and incredible payoff. Okay scratch that it's nothing like The Happening.It tells the story of a pregnant woman trying to survive during a global incident which is causing people to show erratic, psychotic and suicidal behavior.It's a fantastically crafted little horror starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, two veterans who aren't exactly known for that genre. Regardless they knock it out of the park with incredible performances (But with Malkovich that's the only kind of performance he does).The story is a tour de force with multiple emotional and psychological levels when you stop and really think about what you're watching. Deep, meaningful, well written and looks amazing. The presence of two children couldn't even damage it for me!Bird Box is a wondrous film and would recommend it to all. It does mostly follow the Hollywood formula, but it does it in a respectful manner as to not patronize the viewer as most do.Excellent stuff.The Good:Great storyVery well constructedStrong performancesLooks the partThe Bad:Nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:There is hope for modern cinema yetNames are overratedSarah Paulson is Merlyn Temple, that's all I can seeA sequel is ABSOLUTELY not necessary, yet a guilty part of me would like to see one",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A wise reasoning and a red flag for a certain crowd.,"This movie is perfectly well acted and well produced in almost every aspect. It portrays the theme of blindness surprisingly subtle and more realistic then most movies. It doesn't have the ""I iron my pancakes""-flatness that is often found within the genre. So why do so many people still hate it?--- :
It makes too many, too valid points that are pro-empathy. Wich is unusual for a most horror movies. A large subdivision of the horror crowd really hates that.
It provides near impenetrable reasons, that egoistic ""preserve-myself-and-my-family-and-defend-against-parasites"" behavior falls short in front of the multitude a threats that require different kinds of ""evolutionary fitness"". Even in an apocalyptic situation.
A movie arguing so well, that a live worth living, doesn't only include empathy as a core value, but actually REQUIRES it for the survival, makes them feel guilty. So they dismiss it.
After all, believing that ""helping"" is ""something weak and stupid people do, to preserve themselves"" is how they manage to live with themselves. When they're faced with a valid point of how altruism is a successful way of survival, they run out of ""weak"" or ""soft"" people to blame. So they get spiteful.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

For those who don't understand the bad reviews,"I mean come on people, really?This movie wasn't bad because it has unanswered questions, I'll give you that. I'm okay with not having answers - especially because why shoud we? Do people think if something like this ever happened (which I know it won't, but still), we would have answers? That is definitely not the problem. Without any answers, there still could have been scary or shocking moments, action, character development.The problem is this movie is just pointless. There are no interesting characters, there are no scary or shocking moments, there is limited and dumb action, no character development, nothing. I'ts really just 2 hours of nothing.I have seen reviews here before watching, but I thought there is so much hype, it can't be that bad. IT IS. I mean should this be a horror movie? Drama? Sc-Fi? I just couldn't tell, becuase it is none of those. It's just a bad movie.To anyone with a little sense for the genre or movies in general, just don't waste 2 hours of your valuable time.Also, I don't care that it's based on a book. It's either a bad adaptation or a really bad book. Maybe both. But after this movie, I'm definitely not reading the book.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some Early Reviews Are Legit,"Just wanted to say, there is a thing called on demand and pay per view, and often times movies, especially ones that aren't big budget blockbusters, are released earlier abroad (overseas) either in theaters on or On Demand PPV. I can confirm this because I have seen movies this way, before they were released in the US. I suppose if ones world view were limited to the US being the center of the world, they might not comprehend this.As for this movie, it's alright, good enough for a time killer, but won't be saved in my personal library. To me it seems like it's trying the ride on the coat tails of A Quiet Places's success. Instead of not being able to make a sound, you can't look at a certain thing. It's 6.5 star rating as of now, seems fair and accurate.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Happening,"Netflix produced movies always seem to have a touch of not quiet being the final product about them. A star vehicle of a slightly over the hill star with a third rate script, an expensive bomb sold to Netflix or something low key that might had done well in the independent film circuit.Bird Box has provided them with hype and an Oscar winning star in Sandra Bullock.Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is a pregnant woman in a society that has fallen apart as people inexplicably commit suicide.It seems something the victims see causes them to harm themselves.Malorie hooks up with other survivors and shut themselves off from the world.The film goes forward and back in time. In the future, Malorie and two young children, all blindfolded try to find a safe haven. They have a bird box as birds chirp when an alien danger is nearby.You get a sense that in this society that the blind man is king. Like the film A Quiet Place, you sense there is an alien presence. Instead of not making a noise, you need to avoid seeing them.The initial scenes are shocking, horrifying and mesmerising. Then it has all the tropes of a zombie movie as the survivors are holed up and one of the character's is played by John Malkovich and he dislikes everyone.The bits with Malorie and the blindfolded kids did not work for me, it takes a serious leap of logic as to how they got to the river and go whitewater rafting while blindfolded. It is hairraising to do the rapids while you have your eyes open.'If you look, you will die' Mallory sternly tells the two children. It reminded me of David Tennant's tenth Doctor telling people not to blink.Elements of the film is clunky, silly, it does not always add up. Why do some people see the monsters and not top themselves? Instead force others to open their eyes. Surely not all of them can be insane. Madness in people have different layers, here they become the alien entity fan club.Susanne Bier showed she is an interesting and effective director in the BBC television series, The Night Manager. Here she does well with a script that is rather cumbrous and derivative of similar themed films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
See No Evil...,"For a world which has become so sight-orientated there are times when the sense of dread you feel whilst watching Bird Box is almost incapacitating.Much has been said about how this is a 'blind' version of 'A Quiet Place' - it is most definitely not. The source material 'Bird Box' written by Josh Malerman was published in 2014. In many ways this film is all the more terrifying because of society's reliance on seeing the world around them. As you watch and come to understand (although not fully) the mechanics of the horror that is the basis of this post apocalyptic tale you find yourself wondering what would you do in a world where your eyes are your greatest weakness?Yes, perhaps more could have been done to fill out the concepts of family, parenthood, and connecting. With a run-time of just under 2 hours the film does enough and manages to intertwine these themes with the base horror and makes you care enough to take the journey through the fear with Sandra Bullock's Malorie and the rest of the cast who perform admirably. The way the film is split over different time periods is not a clever gimmick as has been the case with so much output over the last few years. It simply layers on another level of dread as the film proceeds towards it's conclusion.As is fitting a film who's protagonists are reliant on a life without vision, it is not full of bombastic CGI action sequences and instead wraps itself in a sense of horror that I found both terrifying and refreshing.This is an excellent film in a theater or at home, with a story that will touch at a core vulnerability that makes many of us uncomfortable. Yet as the 280 million+ people around the world who are classed as having 'low-vision' or 'blind' already know' - if you have the will there is life to be had, sighted or not.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid adventure,"A good and gripping start with a wonderful performance by John Malkovich, but a film that doesn't always live up to that initial promise. I enjoyed watching to the end though and would recommend giving it a go as it's much better than the last couple of netflix specials. The only downside for non-US viewers is the over botoxed, made up face of Sandra Bullock looks nothing like a person who'd lived in a post-apocalyptic world for 5 years would but I imagine we, in Europe, will have faces like that soon....",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Underwhelming,"I'm only comparing it because just about everyone online is doing the same, but remember when A Quiet Place displayed relentless tension with a PG-13 rating and made great use of its cast in a contained setting? Well Bird Box has big great ideas with an even better cast, but chooses to rarely explore those ideas and talents to its full potential. A post-apocalyptic film based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Josh Malerman, focuses on a mother and her two children who navigate the terrifying landscapes of a world where a certain 'presence' is able to manipulate your brain into killing yourself if you look in its direction outdoors. Just reading what I just typed out could either make the film sound incredibly stupid or incredibly scary. It's neither. Director Susanne Bier establishes a creepy mood and tone throughout, but never follows through with any true horror or scares. The best way I can describe it as a sporting event that has all the hype and potential but due to several different circumstances is a slightly boring and extremely underwhelming piece of entertainment.6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Social media as a means for this entity to spread the chaos much faster. The Republican drunkard in Malkovic helping to ""make the Apocalypse great again!""

"Why do some people want everything to be ""explained"" to them all the time?","How have human beings become this dumb? Seems like in this day and age, you can't make movies that don't show and explain everything anymore. People don't even trust their own imaginations/assumptions, or people just don't have imaginations anymore. One reviewer said ""If I wanted to imagine my own ending I'd just imagine the entire story!"" except that he can't. You can't even use your brain to imagine an ending to a ridiculously simple movie, how can you imagine the entire story? Now, the movie itself, to me, was nothing to write home about. It's a post-apocalypse movie, post-apocalypse movies are like zombie movies, they are not to be taken seriously. They usually don't have sensible plot, they exist just for the sole purpose of entertainment (other than to make money of course), not awards season, and one viewing is enough. Just ignore the hype around this movie. Don't expect anything groundbreaking or original. Yes, some characters did do stupid things like characters in post-apocalypse/zombie/horror movies always do, but it's tolerable. If you can sit back and enjoy it for what it is, you might as well be entertained. I think if you watch it with this mindset you won't be disappointed UNLESS you are the type who want everything to be shown and explained to you all the time.

My honest review.,"I don't know if anyone really reads my reviews so I include a 'disclaimer' of sorts at first. Really, I rate on a fair scale. 5 is average (as in was ok but nothing special), I very rarely give out 1's or 10's because very few movies are perfect or complete crap.TLDR: Overall this is a really good movie that I'm surprised came from Netflix Studios and wasn't released in theaters. It's a slow moving suspenseful movie with amazing acting and a good plot, and the ending is kind of a let down, but also fits into the entire narrative of the movie. Almost rated this an 8, but point deducted for some problems with the pacing and the ending. 100% worth watching though!So anyway, it seems like most of the reviews here are divided into three categories. Those that 1star said ""Ending sucked"" or ""No Plot"",those that give it 10 stars and call it a masterpiece without really explaining anything. or those like me, that give it a fair and unbiased review. So here we go. 7 stars because this is an above average movie that almost made me want to give it 8, but just missed.Acting - Just amazing. Really don't need to say more than that.Plot - The plot is rough at some points and the ending is kind of a ""um what?"" moment, but overall the acting makes the plot / script work in a way that at least makes it enjoyable.Directing / Camera work / cinematography / music- Again, all are just amazing. It actually shocked me that this was a Netflix film and not released in theaters. Simply beautifuly shot and it's amazing what the director got out of the actorsPacing (just including this since a lot of people complain about it). The movie is a slow burn for sure, the pacing IS a little scattered but overall, the flashbacks are well placed and in general, it's not great but it fits the theme of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Another ""Decent"" Movie From Netflix","To me, a lot of the Netflix original movies feel churned out. They're well produced and it's not bad filmmaking at all, but something is missing. Maybe the Netflix executives discourage the filmmakers they work with from taking risks? Whatever the case may be, their movies don't feel very passionate. Bird Box fits into this mold. The best way I can describe this movie is ""decent."" With all the good ingredients they had to work with (top actors, strong production value, etc), it's disappointing that the filmmakers behind this made something with such a flat affect. Unfortunately, I think we're going to see a lot of 6 out 10 movies from Netflix in 2019.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The whole movie is just too perfect in how things worked out for her. It was decent entertainment but not a very good movie. The only reason I rated the movie a 6 is because of the acting.

Outstanding,"Bullock carries this movie as a tough survivor, mom, and overall caretaker. I think the main problem people might have with the movie is we can't really relate to what is making people react the way they do. Are they going insane? Possessed?

Much better than most of the theatrical horror/suspense movies that come out these days.It has some similarities to The Happening, but very minor and those reviews are people who went in wanting a popcorn monster movie.

Don't Believe The Hype,"After reading numerous, positive reviews, the wife and I tuned into this one, eager to see what the hype was all about.

In that movie we were really rooting for the family involved but in Bird Box I didn't really care. I normally like Bullock but in this movie I found her really unlikable and felt sorry for the two kids and others stuck with her. She shouts, winges and gives everyone pretty much a hard time. There is a point in the movie when the ever reliable John Malkovich is holding a gun or something and I just want him to actually finish most of those with him off and let the apocalypse take its course. They are all in his house moaning at him and the wife was very much 'it's his house and he let you in to save you so stop giving him grief or do one'. I had to agree with her. I really do like an apocalyptic movie but there are so many better movies out there that offer more scares and suspense.

An overhyped film with a story that brings you nowhere,"Due to the trend in different social media pages, this movie earned a lot of praises due to its, say, ""new"" concept. However, anyone who's watched Wahlberg's ""The Happening"" know that this is not something new. Anyway, I still gave it a try.Let's start it off with the acting, Sandra Bullocks' (Malorie) performance is outstanding, as she has always been. I can almost see some Winona Ryder (Stranger Things) in her eyes and her acting. This is hands-down the best thing the movie has. The rest of the cast was meh.. except for like John Malkovich (Douglas).Now the most frustrating part this movie ever had to offer is the most important story. It actually brings you nowhere. Too many angle that the story could interestingly turn into but it kept moving straightward into nothing. The movie only focused on the question ""who should die next?"". And to sum that up, we got a whole bunch of UNDERDEVELOPED characters dying! When people get killed I was like ""What was his name again?"". Really, characters were forgettable and their deaths won't even bother you. Movies really had to put on some character-development on their characters, its extremely important. It's one tool the viewers can feel some attachment to the film. But this film just kept on throwing in some new faces and kill them off later on.
The movie only focuses on survival, that's it. It's like 80% of the dialogue aren't important. The only important plot only appeared on like the last quarter of the film, and it explains why they're on the river at the beginning of the movie.Too many questions this movie left. We don't even know what these creatures are, why they came or what are their purpose. They just kept on going with full killing frenzy except for the psychopathic maniacs. We don't even know why they can't enter a house. The world this film made was too thin.All in all, this movie has some great potential, but wasted. It lacks explanation. You remain in dark for the entire time and questions never get answered. The ending was a disappointment that added more questions to the already hundred questions you had when watching the entire film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
How many times should they have died?,"Another fluff piece from the Netflix stable. Whilst it is enjoyable, has good acting with a great central conceit and a solid plotline it is however one film that by all standards of reality should never have had a happy ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great acting but boring movie :(,"Sandra was great but aaaah the story was soooo sloooow...i acctually started to fastforward some scenes towards the end, just to be able to make it to the end...and it was not worth it - It was so stupid and pointless I couldnt believe it!
Casting was great but I couldnt figure out what I was watching, kept waiting for story to develop...
Also, if someone thinks its scary-its not (for me thats the good part)
Dissapointing",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oof,"A lot of the critics don't seem to understand two major things about this movie. A.) it's based on a book. The book came out before a quiet place, so no, it's not a mindless ripoff, and B.) it's not supposed to be a causal scary movie with a scary looking monster. I find the movie really creepy and well done because it does such a great job building suspense. I've seen a lot of people who dislike this movie say it's boring because you don't see the monster and everything isn't perfectly explained. I don't think it has to be. I think building a world but leaving some details obscure is much better than using a CG monster. It's not made to be terrifying, it's made to keep the viewer on edge. Personally, I really enjoyed it, otherwise I wouldn't be reviewing it. I wouldn't normally give it a 10/10 because I don't believe in perfect movies, and it does have its flaws, but it deserves better than a 6.8 and I want to boost its rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Almost missed watching this great movie because of the negative reviews here!!,Where to start.. I'm a real life movie encyclopedia with very sharp taste for quality movies and over the screen drama experience in general yet I don't let my high expectations ruin any movie experience so I judge it exactly as it is.. Luckily there was no hype or expectations for this one as I just heard about it.. However prior to watching it I came here as usually do to check the non spoiler reviews and ratings to decide it wether it's worth or not and immediately I was underwhelmed by the majority of the comments slating the movie with some redicolous scores to back it up and how misleading that was!! Almost every comment I read was too concerned comparing it to The Happening which was not a cinematic success yet I personally enjoyed The Happening despite its misfits.. Now the question is what defines a good movie?!! What is an entertaining movie?!! To me it's a movie that manage to capture and grab my attention from start to finish and for someone like myself who has seen it all and I mean all it takes quite alot to engage I have as I consciously and subconsciously go through all the cinematic elements of any movie and based on its budget and genre I decide where this movie stands.. In the process I don't consider only one or two elements as many people do when they evaluate a movie while ignoring the the most important aspects and ingredients that makes a good movie and the core of any good movie experience is the actual story line and how it is told and executed and here in this movie we have a quite engaging story that is extremely well acted and executed with a decent budget that provided me with the full experience and kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end and unlike many people I did actually like the ending.. My basic conclusion and advise.. Go watch it people and do yourselves a favour go to enjoy a true decent cinematic experience without any prior prejudice or over expectations and you will love it as Sandra Bullock shines in this one providing when of her best roles in quite some time in a high tempo Sci fi thriller that delivers from start to finish.. I think this movie will get more credit as years go by!,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was pretty good,"It was suspenseful, dramatic a bit longer than it needed to be. It does leave a ton of questions unanswered. It's not a copy cat of ""the quiet place"" since they actually had physical monsters, and it was more about sound than sight.

Winner of the Off Book awards,"I'm doing my best to not rate this movie against the book but it's very hard. This movie falls short on intensity, horror, and character building. The characters seemed to fall into typical cliché roles. The premise is interesting and while it seems rushed and doesn't give details or follow through on individual situations the actors and acting are great, the special effects were pretty good. It was entertaining and worth the watch.
Having said that...Bird Box the book is an intense, gruesome, scary, page turner with excellent characters, probably one of the best horror novels in recent years. It's unfortunate they didn't do better to follow the story from the actual book which was amazing.I've seen some reviews mentioning The Quiet Place.... But while they seem to have the same type of Scifi, unexplained, post-apocalyptic theme it's not really fair to compare. Bird Box the movie begins...at the beginning and doesn't just focus on survival but gets pretty tangled up in the social aspects of strangers that are forced to cooperate to get by.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is NOT a horror move, but it's still good.","There are a ton of bad reviews on here by people who were disappointed that the creature horror didn't really deliver and answers weren't really provided. This isn't really that type of move. It's about people and their reactions to difficult circumstances and how they interact with each other.It's really the story of the main character played by Sandra, and she does a pretty good job. If you are looking for straightup horror or a creature film this isn't what you are looking for. If you want an adventure story about the human spirit this movie will fit the bill.7 is my honest opinion, I consider anything 6 or above worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent all-around film that's refreshing for this genre,"Can't believe some of the negative comments from these wannabe critics. This film was amazing in every aspect; directing was perfect, acting was outstanding - especially from the all star cast, and the writing was great!Comparing this to ""A Quiet Place"" is just plain dumb. This film is based on a novel, and is in its own category. Sure the ending may have been a little underwhelming and not ""Hollywood enough"", but I still enjoyed it, and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.Those who question the ending, think ""see no evil"" thus the purity - all I can say without giving anything away. As for unanswered questions (that really is an entire 2nd film), or what was the 'entity', use your imagination, or read the book if anyone wants to split hairs and know every detail.The score was perfect, the pacing was excellent, the flashback scenes were well spaced out, and the length just right.Ignore all the negative reviews, this film is perfectly produced based on a book adaptation. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining end of the world stuff if you don't think too hard about it!,"Bird BoxDo not even try to make this make sense. Relax and go with the bigger set up, the feeling of helplessness, the dependency on friends and strangers. The high drama in a near-future dystopia (the favorite new realm for movies since 9/11).
Fairly quickly into the movie, something goes terribly wrong in the world, and for the few people who are not immediately affected and killed, the one hope is to hide. And hiding in various ways becomes the rest of the trip. Oddly, that creates enough suspense to make it work.
Sandra Bullock is key, a strong female lead. The surrounding cast (including a really good John Malkevich for awhile) helps keep it together. And the filming and pacing is really good.
But of course the premise of the movie is really its biggest point, and its famous weakness because there are just so many unexplained and unlikely aspects to the perils, and to the solutions, to make your brain happy. So shut off the brain and enjoy the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"don't mind the negative comments, the movie is a must-watch!","My mother recommended that i watch this movie and that she absolutely liked it, i usually don't like any movie i watch, i feel there's always something missing about it, no matter how good it is, there's a small list of movies that i actually liked watching from every aspect.
However, i usually just check the movie review but i only read the comments after i watch the film, i watched it and well, it's a very well executed movie i must say! the acting is good and convincing, the character development is well paced, the characters themselves are quite good and entertaining, overall it's a very nice movie.
The reason why i gave it a 9/10 is because i didn't quite like the ending, it is good and unexpected but not my cup of tea. it is my opinion and i do not say that you should not watch the movie, it'll keep you on the edge of your seat and i'm sure you'll like it.

I liked it,"I don't normally write reviews but I just read some of them & thought they were a bit harsh.It seems some people like to be spoon-fed every little detail & plot point when they watch a movie. ""Why didn't it explain this? Why didn't it show that? Why were some people affected differently?"" etc... ffs!It's a movie about an unseen terror which makes people want to hurt themselves & others once they see it. That's pretty much it. What we get to watch for a couple of hours is how a small group of people choose to deal with the situation they're in. Some of it is predictable, yes, but people are generally quite predictable & clichéd in real life, too.I personally felt the acting, special effects, cinematography, sound, etc... were all very good. Reason enough to watch the film.On top of that, there were elements of other movies I've enjoyed over the years which could be found in this. The Crazies, Dawn of the Dead (remake), The Happening, Blindness, World War Z, The Mist, etc...As a father of two young boys (6 & 3), I also found the scenes where Bullock's character struggles to keep the two 5 year olds safe (in the boat, in the woods, etc...) particularly distressing as it was all too easy to imagine how my own kids would be wandering off in different directions & constantly wanting to remove their blindfolds.In summary, it's a decent enough way to spend a couple of hours if you're into this sort of genre (post-apocalyptic, horror, science-fiction). If, however, you're wanting to watch something with a clearly defined start, middle & end, & with every last detail explained to you, then save yourself the potential anguish & maybe watch something else.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Entertaining Thriller with a Disappointing ending...,"Bird box was one of the most hyped netflix movies of 2018. And tbh, it does deserve that. It's an entertaining and creepy thriller that pulls you at the edge of your seats, wondering what would happen next.But there's one thing that left me and I guess, most of the viewers disappointed i.e. THE ENDING. In the novel, the ending was darker and tbh much realistic and accepting
But, in the novie the director decided to show us an optimistic or so called HAPPY ENDING and that ruined all the efforts. Especially, I was disappointed that they did'nt show the monsters or the forces that were making the people psychotic and murderers. I waited too long for the monsters and their purpose. All these things are not clear. But anyways, it was a good watch, if you're into a gripping thriller genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Maybe you'll need a blindfold while watching?,"If you have seen 'A Quiet Place' early this year, 'Bird Box' kind of run along the same concept except instead of staying quiet they need to blindfold themselves in order to stay alive. If you read my review about AQP, I pointed out that it reminded me of a 'Black Mirror' episode 'Metalhead' released a year ago. Considering the short timelines in between, it is possible that these three just coincidentally showed up one after the other (BB is based on book that came out in 2014.) While it is derivative, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie, it's just that you can't help but compare and point out the weaknesses and usually the last one to come out gets hit the hardest. And maybe that's why I don't get all the hype about it, because I've already seen two earlier versions of it.Sandra Bullock as expected delivers, playing Mallorie, a hesitant mother that took on the responsibility of looking after two kids when she wasn't even ready to look after for one. She effortlessly exudes the struggle between keeping the kids alive because she's still a decent human being or to just leave them behind as the excess baggage that she sees them as. Sarah Paulson as per usual was great, you can see the fear in her eyes, trained well having been in American Horror Story for many seasons now, and she would've made a great stand-in for Sandra if she refused her role for the second time. Lastly the breakout star here is young actress Vivien Lyra Blair. Sure she was annoying every time she didn't listen to Mallorie, but that staring scene when she was told to go to bed but she wanted to hear the end of the story, and the scene when she knew she was going to be chosen against her will, I felt those.Now the ugly parts. The build-up was there and I kept waiting for the denouement but it never came which left me hanging and with more questions than answers. Where did the entities come from? Why did it have a different effect on others? And don't get me started on the way they handled latter part of the river scene. Another matter to consider is since we don't get to see the antagonist, the clear and present danger we felt early in the movie was never validated. The Director said they specifically did not show the entity as it is different for each person but I read that they shot a scene that shows what monster Mallorie would've seen but she kept laughing at it that they decided to drop it altogether. And the decision to not show anything at all for me I feel was part of why the movie didn't make such an impact on me. It left me with nothing by the time the credits started rolling.For now there is no indication yet that a sequel is in the works but I wouldn't be surprised if they make another, and then we can see if they can really offer us something new and save the first one by association.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not bad, but has some faults and a lackluster ending","Ok let's get one of the biggest things out of the way that happened with the release of this film, the comparisons to ""A Quiet Place""Yes they share a similar premise with the most major change being that it's a different sense of the 5 senses (sight instead of sound), however it should be noted that the novel of the same name came out before A Quiet Place.Ok with that out of the way, how is the actual movie?
It's ok, it's not great, and it's not as good as A Quiet Place, it suffers from a thin script in a thick concept, the character development is a bit weak and it doesn't really have an ending, it kind of just stops. However the mystery around what causes people to commit suicide and the followers is incredibly interesting with a better script would have served well with giving us more information of the followers of the thing. Another thing is that the acting is really good this is of course partially due to Sandra Bullock but the other actors do their jobs extremely well too.Overall this film while not high art is good for a few viewings however it does suffer from some faults but I enjoyed it.Honestly this is more of a 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Better than ""A Quiet Place"" in every possible way","If you though ""A Quiet Place was suspenseful, you haven't seen anything until you watch Bird Box. A port-apocalyptic movie made for adults, it tells a story that pulls no punches. It doesn't try to hold your hand and tell you that everything will be okay. It shows you how the slightest mistake will cause someone to die, and it doesn't shy away from showing you the aftermath. It's visceral, it's violent and it's distirbing, the way the end of the world should be. My main problem with ""A Quiet Place"" was that it was too tame and catered to a sensitive audience that can't take any serious events in their movies. Bird Box was made for an adult audience, as everything about it is more mature, the stakes are higher, and the enemy is much more dangerous.If you liked ""A Quiet Place"", but felt that it was made for a teen audience and could have been much better, then you will love Bird Box.

Two nagging details!,"This was pretty good for the genre, i.e. People going crazy and stuff and suicidal, like the Happening and the Crazies and Mom and Dad. The Netflix Spanish if you can call it sequel wasn't too bad either. However I do have some criticisms on the script/storyline. Malorie (Bullock) indirectly got Douglas' (Malcovich) wife killed and she was the one who held an attitude against Douglas. She never once apologized for his wife's death. And then there was the incident on the shopping trip to the supermarket. It was Tom who opened the door after he heard a pleading voice, in spite of some telling him not too. And it turned out it Charlie's co-worker from the supermarket who was one of the crazies who had seen ""them"" but not committed suicide. So by opening the door Tom caused Charlie's death. In other words Charlie died because of Tom. No one seemed to pick up on that and they just went on. And when on their return Douglas said something sarcastic about Charlie's demise, Malorie snapped at him.I hate it when small and yet important details like that are overlooked by the story or script writers. I am generally not a picky person but sometimes I think some things should be done properly, continuity is pretty much important to me.Other than these two minor details, the movie was enjoyable. Bullock put in a powerful performance. I think she is a lot better in serious dramas than in romcoms.",,Anonymous,Horror
An interesting inclusion in the genre of terror.,"Bird Box is a movie based on a novel with an interesting and curious concept to carry out, taking the main idea of fear of something incomprehensible, but above all, imperceivable, thanks to the fact that they are unable to see their enemy, this monster or creature, this strange entity that has the ability to kill them with just a second inside the eye orbits of these people. A creature that is impossible to see, the fear of something that we cannot even defend ourselves.With an interesting idea the movie starts, developing at a slow pace, but solid, with good performances by the cast, especially Bullock, which gives an interesting perspective to the tough girl but able to open her heart to those who deserve it, both their care and love.The film is directed in a good way, with quite interesting and entertaining moments, although a narrative structure based mainly on flashbacks and memories that end up becoming a bit of overexposure, however, it gives a good idea about the main plot and the first days of the disaster. After this, the final act concentrates mainly on the present and takes us through the most tense moments of the film. Although it remains stable with all these aspects, I think it fails a lot in the logical aspect or at least the logical narrative, also becoming a little slow with the development of the 2nd act of the story, and I must say, that the movie really,is not scary, it can be tense and somewhat exciting, but I never had a sensation of terror while watching it.Still, it was very entertaining and worthwhile for horror movie lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not worth the hype,"Bird Box has a fun concept and huge star (Sandra Bullock) that combined to make this one of the most streaming Netflix movies ever. It's memeable though not exactly memorable. In a year, how clearly will you remember the plot and the ending? How well do you remember it right now?The movie is fine for a night of mindless entertainment. That's about it.It features a problematic storytelling technique. The flashbacks remove some of what would have been the most suspenseful moments of the film. Instead of wondering what will happen and who will survive, viewers connect a few simple dots and figure out the answer. Suspense gone.Many moments lean too heavily into the blood and violent imagery for effect. These tactics work to an extent, but they elicit cheap reactions. They are not earned, and they are not lasting.Upon some reflection after watching, I found myself wondering, ""what is this movie about?"" A woman unsure if she can learn to love her child?

"Don't Look, You May Not Like What You See","If this were the first film of it's kind, it would still be unoriginal. The unseen monster is not a new idea in story telling, nor is having no ultimate meaning or purposeful intent. There are no spoilers here, that's the conceit. We can retitle this ""Don't look Mrs. Lot"".Let's consider the qualities of the films makeup:1. cinematography is adequate, like the work of a cameraman who has made films for television with limited resources. The multitudes of closeups and quick edits obscure the lack of uninteresting scenes, a trick borrowed from low budget television. I think the TV series ""Lost"" had better photography.2. The sound is actually high fidelity. That said, it plays with the same intensity as it did in the last ten thousand horror films. It acts as a cover for dead scenes and pablum dialogue. In short, unoriginal.3. The acting, which has been hailed as fantastic, is true hack work. Bullock and Malkovich could have phoned it in. Hack: ""A cheap, mediocre, or second-rate practitioner, especially in the fields of literature and the arts"". I would have preferred unknowns with potential, than reprisals of every character these two have played before. It must have taken them minutes to prepare for their roles.4. The worst part is the story, dialogue and screenplay. Josh Malerman's book wasn't even that good to start with. The ""Bird Box"" was a first novel by a rock musician. Go figure. As I've said, the premise is unoriginal, the characters are thinly drawn, and the dialogue is just lubrication for a rusty script. ""Hold on, hold on,. . . hold on . . . jump please . . . jump . . . over here girls, "" You get the picture.Overall, the comparisons to M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" are apt. It's equally drawn out and unsatisfying in the end. There is no there there. . .Comparisons to ""The Quiet Place"" are unfair. The ""Quiet Place"" was far more engaging, had solid cinematography and a very original soundtrack to instill fear. Though that film wasn't too deep either, it's portrayal of family bonds and the fall of humanity were at least touching. In contrast, here we root for many of the annoying characters to die.Lastly, there are alot of shill reviews about this movie. Shill: ""an accomplice of a hawker, who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others"". The glowing reviews appear canned and absurd, even if they enjoyed it as film fodder, their one paragraph enthusiasm is clearly insincere. I encourage you to be harsh in your ratings to counteract this ploy to raise this films overall score.In the end, this horror film is a simulacrum: ""an unsatisfactory imitation or substitute"". Example: The ""Bird Box"" is a bland simulacrum of an original horror story.This might has well be likened to a modern ghost story, with an unseen entity from beyond, not knowing where it came from or what it wants.

Not sure what all the hype is about,Completely ridiculous and not worth going into specifics about.Took me two attempts to watchGreat concept but miserably fails on poor acting and stupid dialogue,,Anonymous,Horror
This movie does its job,"All of the Netflix promotion for Bird Box was a curiosity for me as I get accustomed to hype I associate with movie theatre releases. It was cool to be able to settle down in front of my own television for what was presented to me as a movie theatre experience. The movie itself is rocker recliner worthy, thanks in large measure to Sandra Bulloch. I find her entertaining to watch in whatever she does - I just like her presence and this movie was among the best to showcase the gritty dispassionate persona she excels at portraying. John Malkovich was mildly irritating owing to being the stereotypical malcontent character but that was the only drawback for me. In terms of the storyline, it doesn't hold up at all under second sober thought, but by then the movie is over, I'm off to bed, and most importantly, I've had my entertainment fix.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Was Expecting More,"Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite female actresses. However, she done the best she could with this.

Still entertaining,"For me, this movie has a same baseline story with 'a quite place'.

"Highly enjoyable, tense from beginning to end","People always demand an ""explanation"" for the creatures. I'm personally satisfied not being given a ""sci fi"" explanation, like viruses or aliens, which may even take away from the charm of a movie like this. Same as ""Children of Men"", another great movie that doesn't bother to give an explanation of why women stopped getting pregnant, as an explanation is almost irrelevant to the theme and the suspense. Particularly if told from the stand point of the survivors: if this truly happened, no one may have been able to figure out why and how it happened, but they'd figure out the bare minimum to survive.
Great acting. Great characters. The tension to me was more important than the number of actual scares. Great ending (what more did you want out of it? There was enough closure in this one).
Some of the secondary characters could have been a little more developed. Also, a minor point: Some criticized how Sandra Bullock was running in the forest holding two kids, and I agree that they should have made it a little more believable as a person running blindfolded typically would seem more careful and scared of slamming into trees.
Otherwise great movie, I disagree with all the haters...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth a watch but not for out and out horror,A cross between The Happening and A Quiet Place but without the rubbish dialogue of the former and without the scares of the latter.Some characters were a tad bland but I enjoyed performances from John Malkovich and Sandra Bullock wasn't as bad as people have said.I'd recommend it but keep your horror expectations low.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

a couple scenes fell into cliche but overall good movie,"I do like this kind of movie premises, I found it similar to ""The Happening"" or ""Blindness"" and other apocalyptic stories that are not zombies.
With these kind of movies I find that the explanation of the events is not necessary really, what's interesting is the situation in which the characters are and how they act. So the strength of the story will be on the characters themselves. Then you can have some good cinematography to back up a creepy atmosphere and the ending to give a twist or shock.
Here I found pretty decent characters, good cinematography and an ok ending, none are great, but it does the job of keeping me interested, not annoy me with extremely stupid behaviours (there was a scene which I found quite silly near the ending, and was quite important, with the main characters, but...) and not disappointing me with an awful ending.
Still, it fell a bit bland in the end, and as I said, everything is ok, but nothing exceptional. It definitely had potential for a better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Honestly watch it,"Really, I mean it watch it, is it a cinematic master piece? No but not is it a waste of your time and it's the only way you'll know the full story.
That said, it's well shot, visually good and an interesting idea, however the characters are flat and uninteresting, the whole idea of the constant blind folds could be negated if the characters actually thought about things. What the films suffers from is story telling, it just doesn't really manage it, the flash backs stunt the flow of the film but are needed because with out them there would be no reason for this film to be 2 hours long, they add very little other than to take the tension away. The ending is very much an English essay ending, (you know when you've written enough words do you can end it 'and then they woke up and it was all a dream') answers no questions but doesnt leave you wanting any answers either, you'll just turn it off and carry on with your day.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worthy of a Watch,"Bird Box is the perfect reflection of where Hollywood Horror/Sci-Fi has gone. Not really all that scary or smart yet entertaining enough to lumber along and keep you mildly entertained. What really is troublesome is that the same apocalyptic themes seem to be what sets up every story. It is either zombies, or viruses, or viruses causing zombies. None of the contemporary stuff seems to stray far from the tired source material. But those who are hungry for a thriller that kills two hours of time, you could do a lot worse. If you can make it through a very slow middle part of the film, the end is pretty dope.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
No One's Fear is Exactly the Same...,"The Bird Box is essentially a movie about what you would do when ""faced"" with your ultimate fear; not only has your boogey-man come alive, or worst scenario unfolded, but, it's been weaponized, and, if you look at it, it will compel you to kill yourself, so, what lengths will you go to to save yourself and your loved ones? I read a lot of reviews, and a lot of people seem to be caught up in the specifics - what do the ""entities"" look like or what are the people seeing, etc., and that's part of the premise - they're not going to look the same to anyone; it's about what each individual imagines (remember imagination?). The ending seems to be a bone of contention, too, and, basically, that's because it's not an ending, it's a beginning.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Omigosh. So bad! Like M. Night Shayamalan's The Happening. Watch with blindfolds on!,I mean something happens to people who look at the sky that causes them to kill themselves. That's it. That's the plot. So Sandra Bullock makes a journey with two kids to a place which she heard is safe. Nothing else. There is no reason given why things are happening or a sense of an ending. It seems like a Damien Lindeloff movie.And don't believe Stephen King. For some reason studios like asking Stephen King if their movie is scary and he always says yes. I don't know what's wrong with the guy.And it looks like all the good reviews are written by Netflix employees. I hear they tell their employees to write good reviews online.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very rarely cheats, unlike most horror movies","With Bird Box, one of the most talked about releases of 2018, Susanne Bier has created a fine chiller from Josh Malerman's best-seller. ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it,"" said Alfred Hitchcock, and Bier's greatest merit in this adaptation is her choice of not visualizing the unknown threat, leaving all the horror in the atmosphere and in the viewer's imagination.Bird Box is basically a two-fold film, both in narrative, style and tempo. The first part of the film (the flashbacks) is the most effective. Here Bier creates a harrowing, intense climate as an unseen spectacle which makes people inexplicable suicidal appears in the city just as our protagonist Malorie (Sandra Bullock) and her sister leave a clinic after a pregnancy check-up. The escalating chaos sets the tone brilliantly, and as Malorie barricades herself together with a number of other survivors inside a nearby house, the film takes on a quality reminiscent of I Am Legend. There are fine performances (particularly from John Malkovich), interesting discussions of existential proportions and for the most part logical character actions in the following middle-part, before the film climaxes halfway through and moves back into the present-day timeline; about Bullock, boyfriend and two children five years later.Unlike most horror movies dealing with the supernatural, Bird Box very rarely cheats, and so we continue to care for these characters, even when their situation seems increasingly hopeless and the threat unfortunately becomes increasingly horror-film-like and stale. The ending has a certain freshness about it, but of course it cannot quite fill the empty space left behind by Malkovich.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

movie delivers extreme tension and fascinating scenes that you have never seen before like this in any other movie. E.g. There is a scene when 4 people go out blindfolded and drive a car with opaqued windows, to get groceries at the supermarket, half a mile away. The entire scene appears surreal and ingenious. This movie has a great story, horror, good characters, a love story which doesn't annoy the viewer, and surreal scenes, and during these 124 minutes of its playtime, you won't find a single boring minute.

A Decent Film If It Is Not Compared With Another Film With The Same Premise,"This is an edited review from one posted by this viewer over three months ago. At the time I gave this film a thumbs up, but I was not completely fair and did not offer the review in my complete format. This was because of having previously viewed Krasinski's, ""A Quite Place"". After writing hundreds of reviews this was the first time I can recall ever comparing two films directly. That is why it was unfair. This viewer has always treated films / series as individual works of art. Hence follows my review. Bier has helmed an exceptional thriller. Excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, score and acting. All the artists involved deliver superlative performances. In particular Bullock and Malkovich stand out. The plot revolves around a women named Malorie who is independent, content with solitude and pregnant. Right from the beginning we learn that an ominous presence has created a world of madness, destruction and suicide. We learn that there is however a safe community from the presence that is accessible by river, but it is unwise to involve children in the trip. We then flash back to five years earlier when the chaos is just beginning around the world and then hits home. This ends up landing Malorie at the home of Douglas, who seems to know that danger is eminent. The plot then flashes back and forth between the trip down the river and the time spent at Douglas' home. Random individuals seek safety at the home, one being another pregnant women, and the individuals collectively determine that sight is the key to the presence driving people insane. As people come and go from the home danger always seems to follow and Douglas' self preservation is constantly being tested. On a blind trip to a supermarket an incident occurs which tips off Malorie to the fact that birds can sense when danger is near. Both Malorie and the other women deliver their children, a boy and a girl. Eventually a visitor arrives and Douglas' instincts are confirmed. This individual destroys the safe haven leaving only Malorie, the two children and Tom left. Some survivors of the presence have embraced it as beautiful and have become psychotic wanting all to experience the beauty. An encounter with these individuals leads to the film focused completely on the river, as now only Malorie and the two children known as boy and girl, and have been navigating at this point for nearly two days. During their journey the three remain blindfolded and carry a box with birds in it to warn them of the presence. Their travel down river includes an encounter with a psychotic embracer of the presence, gathering supplies, running into an obstacle which overturns their boat and finally the treacherous rapids which are a indicator that the safe community is just beyond if they can get past the rapids. The plot is crisp, unique, clever, thrilling, sublime, poetic and has a powerful ending. This is one of the best films Netflix has dropped. It is memorable and a magnificent film in it's genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
BIRD BOX or how to make a hit horror movie.,"BIRD BOXNetflix's Bird Box, directed by Susanne Bier (The Night Manager TV series) and written by Eric Heisserer (Arrival) from a book by Josh Malerman, has created a sensation. While Netflix never releases audience numbers, Bird Box seems to be a hit. Of course, 'hit' must be in context. Hit shows on the major networks like The Big Bang Theory have upward of 18 million viewers. In-theatre only movies have more viewers - Black Panther sold over 70 million tickets.The consensus is that Bird Box had 26 millions viewers (compare that to the Golden Globes with 18.6 million). Whatever the numbers, Bird Box is a hit, generating not only viewers but buzz: Is it a joke, this 'thing' or 'no-thing' that causes people to kill themselves? What makes this story go? Not the characters who have no or little backstory, or the simple plot: if you see 'it', you kill yourself.Bird Box, for the 300 million or so who have not watched it, is about a woman, Sandra Bullock (I am not using character names because, as I said, the characters have no backstory and, in fact, the movie uses the 'public perception' of the actors to fill-in for character development, like casting John Wayne in a western - you know who this guy is based on who is playing the part), who is pregnant but without a husband or father of the child who left, apparently, soon after he did the deed. Her sister, Sarah Paulson, wants to help her since Bullock is not a happy mother-to-be and is even told by her doctor that most mothers end up loving their child. Bullock is so unconvinced that she doesn't want to know the gender of the baby and, in fact, she ends up calling it ""Boy"" (and a same-age girl she ends up taking care of, ""Girl"").The movie is told in two simultaneous parts, five years apart. So, we see the world-wide epidemic of suicides and how it quickly infects the California community where Bullock and Paulson live. There is no explanation, suddenly, people start doing crazy things - banging their heads until they die, driving cars into other cars, stabbing themselves. These scenes of the 'beginning' of the epidemic are interspersed with scenes from five years later when survivors Bullock and her son and ""Girl"" are in her care as she tries to get them to safety. The key to survival is being blindfolded whenever outside and not looking at 'it.'The buzz reminds me of the public's reception of Rosemary's Baby almost 50 years ago. That movie saw newly weds, Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes, move into a Manhattan apartment. Cassavetes is an actor up for a big part. He gets it when the actor who was selected, suddenly, goes blind. Soon after, Farrow gets pregnant and is stuck at home getting unwanted advice and help from an elderly couple who live next door. It turns out that they are a witch/warlock pair and her husband sold Farrow to these demons so that her child could be the new Beelzebub. It's a thrilling and scary movie, a roller coaster ride through the terrors of pregnancy and a parent's worst fears realized - little Johnny turns out to be a devil, literally.Just as in Bird Box, the characters in Rosemary's Baby were not fully drawn. The young couple seem to have landed in Manhattan from the moon, no family and very few friends. There are really only 4 characters in the movie - the young and elderly couples. The plot is not explained very much - yes, a few minutes are spent on talking about witches and warlocks, but nothing that makes any impression other than that they do exist.And that is how to have a hit 'horror' movie. One exciting scene after another, keeping the audience occupied with visuals that are arresting and moments that are shocking. In Bird Box, John Malkovich plays his stereotypical angry, bitter, suspecting character. Trevante Rhodes plays the guy we met in Moonlight. There are other stereotypes you will recognize - happy, overweight pregnant woman who is actually a lot better person than we think, odd couple 20-somethings who end up in bed (well, doing it but not actually in ...), sympathetic looking guy who turns out to be a monster, unsympathetic guy who turns out to be right - you've met them all before but not in this movie.Anyway, it's a fun 2 hours. It comes to a kind of conclusion, just like Rosemary's Baby. And at the end, Sandra Bullock gets to go on another scary, dangerous, thrilling ride - this time in a boat not a bus, but it's the same ride and the same plucky Sandra who survives.FOR MORE GREAT REVIEWS GO TO:

Stop making movies like this,"I'm so sick of apocalypse/monster films that feel the need to focus in heavily on the tribulations and emotions of their cast of protagonists without actually caring to design interesting protagonists. If you're going to make a movie like this, either put all your effort into the danger itself and the unique story you can derive from its existence or write characters that are even slightly notable. Malorie (the main protagonist) is such a bland character for no reason; in the opening they establish her as an artist with biting sarcasm and then they throw any personality she has out the window as she just becomes ""woman who hates apocalypse"". Gary, who comes in about halfway through the movie, is instantly and inexplicably more compelling than any of our previous protagonists and if you've seen the movie you'll know that's not really a good thing. In fact, the sooner a character dies (unrelated to Gary) the more interesting they typically are, which I unfortunately see a whole lot in these sorts of movies and it slowly whittles the cast down to the blandest characters because the audience can project themselves on them more easily, I guess.I should note that the monster was fine, since a lot of peoples' issue with this movie was that there was no explanation or elaboration on the monster; I find that can totally work, and no answers are needed to make for an interesting plot, but you do need SOMETHING interesting beyond just the existence of the monster. Aside from that, the shooting of the film was actually pretty good and as I said before there were some likeable characters, so despite what I've said my rating of this film is higher than I expected, but it's very close to getting lower. I'd only recommend this to people who are so heavily into the premise that they can see past the primary boredom.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as A QUIET PLACE, but still worthy","Coming out right around the same time as the fantastic A QUIET PLACE, this similarly themed end-of-the-world tale has civilization ending by an unseen terror that once someone sees ""it"" they immediately commit suicide. Much like A QUIET PLACE, it's the story of a parent, Sandra Bullock, trying to protect her kids (and yes, yes, I know BIRD BOX was a book before either of these films was made). Unlike A QUIET PLACE, this film shows the breakdown of civilization from the beginning, with Bullock and a group of survivors hold up in a secure house. What disappoints in BIRD BOX is that despite the clever concept of having to navigate the world blindfolded or die, everything else is horribly cliched. The survivors bicker, and feature all the usual stereotypes, though the standard grouch character everyone hates is played by the excellent John Malkovich. They have to deal with the predictable challenges of rationing supplies and eventually having to leave their secure compound to restock (that part is actually the best part of the film). BIRD BOX does get more interesting and more original once Bullock strikes out on her own with her kids and the film does have a solidly clever ending, but the cliches at the outset and the film's overall inferiority to A QUIET PLACE hurt the overall experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thankfully, the script focuses almost exclusively on past world building after explaining what is going on to our protagonists in the film's present day. The ever-ominous presence of the antagonist is thrilling, and I could just feel the frustration of having to stay blind folded while trying to survive.

"A very good movie,, a great cast ,, yet the ending was somewhat expected","So I was mindboggled by the names on the cast and Susanne Bier as a director ... all Academy award winners and nominees,, they all have delivered a great performance ,, especially Sandra Bullock ,, her intense facial interacting is still as good as ever .The plot was good,, not that genuine for Horror/sci-fi genre ,, but since minute one you can feel all the thrill, excitement and rush the events take,, there was some unnecessary storylines like the one with Machine Gun Kelly ,, i mean i still don't know why he is there !! no hard feeling ,but even commercially wise he's no good for the movie... The ending was yes satisfying but somewhat expected ,, i kinda wished for some unpredictability ,, but i mean,, i'm happy all went well.Fianl thought,, i have no idea what the reviewers here are fighting about ,, all aside,, the movie is definitely good ,, i couldn't watch Ocean's Eight so for me this is the first i see something for Sandra Bullock since ""Gravity"" and ""Heat"" back in 2013... so go watch it ,, Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Another pretentious modern horror film, despite all the hype","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMalorie (Sandra Bullock) is an ordinary woman, who's just learned she's pregnant, who is suddenly plunged into a nightmare world of madness and mayhem, when people start suicidally throwing themselves to their doom. After her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson) falls victim to this madness, she hauls herself into the home of Douglas (John Malkovich), a cynical man mistrustful of everyone, along with a group of other survivors. The story cuts between this and Malorie commandeering two young children to safety in blindfolds...Horror films can't seem to get it right these days. They're either taking the cheap and easy route, overloading on jump scares and loud screeching, or they're trying to be too deep and cerebral, literally jumping from one extreme to another. And in the latter case, it's always at the crux of a really far fetched, far out concept, as is the case with Bird Box, the new Netflix film that seems to have everybody talking. The first thing that springs to mind less than five minutes into it is the recent big screen frightener A Quiet Place, a similarly over the top film that perfectly illustrates what I'm talking about.For all its high concept pretensions though, it soon succumbs to the clichés all too easily, with a bunch of stereotypical characters all holed up in a remote location, and echoes of other horror fare, such as 28 Days Later..., also pervade. Telling the story in two separate strands, it all pans out too long and comes off as too long winded. Even the performances, from a mostly seasoned supporting cast, don't feel like they're really heartfelt. Even Bullock feels flat and awkward in the first half, although she does come alive a bit in the second.It's all intriguing and diverting enough not to be a complete failure, but you just wish everyone involved had not tried to be so high handed. In the end, what seems to be some kind of Sixth Sense style twist rolls by, but if you can put it together in one go, you're a better man than me. Personally, I'd got to the stage when I just wanted to slap on one of those damn blindfolds myself and relax. **",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Happening and A Quiet Place Had a Baby,"...and the baby is beautiful. This was a fun movie. The reason I am mentioning those two films is because of the similarities between them. In this movie, the creature (or whatever it is) makes people kill themselves, like in The Happening. Instead of being quiet, though, (like in A Quiet Place) you must be blind. While there are similarities, I don't think it is trying to completely copy the films. It's just using similar ideas.
Sandra Bullock is amazing in this movie. The whole cast is great, including the kids. You care about all of the characters (for the most part) and are left on the edge of your seat wondering who is going to die next. The storytelling is phenomenal and makes it easy to keep track on when the plot jumps back in time and back to present day. Whatever the creatures look like we don't really know (if they even have a physical body), and that can kind of be a let down for a big monster fan like I am. The ending also felt a little underwhelming to me, with it not really giving an explanation for the creatures or anything. But that's okay. Not all movies have to answer all the questions. That's what makes it fun. Overall, I think Bird Box is a great addition to the horror genre, and is very entertaining. Netflix, for the most part, does a very good job with it's original movies. I highly recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

My review of the critics' negative reviews is 1/10.,"I enjoyed the film-it was harrowing with a good old fashioned Twilight Zone vibe in parts. Sandra Bullock was amazing enough that I can almost forgive her for The Blind Side. The rest of the cast was all really good as well-a welcome mix of heavy hitters with some faces unknown to me.However, I don't buy any of the the 50-75% Critics' reviews. When I read these reviews I want them to be either high 80s or absolutely scathing, and creatively cruel.

"Interesting and Original Premise, Solid Execution","It's Christmas night and my family is scrolling desperately through Netflix for something new to watch. After rooting through the endless list of goobery Christmas films, we finally decided on BIRD BOX, the new horror film starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich.First of all, I'd like to say how original the idea for this film is! Sure, one could draw similarities to some other movies out there (A Quiet Place, War of the Worlds, and unfortunately... The Happening are some films that come to mind), but overall the idea of a monster that causes you to kill yourself upon seeing it is a concept that has never been done before. It's creative and a clever way to scare the audience.The downside to this, however, is that the execution is CERTAINLY not on the same level of creativity as the concept itself. The storyline is...solid, but is fairly traditional as far as the horror genre goes (it's the usual ""group caught in one setting during a disaster- tensions ensue"" that sort of thing). The second half is where things really depart from the usual horror conventions.Second downside is the character writing. It is noticeably bad. The first 20-25 minutes have a character that exists solely for exposition, characters meet and become friends in a matter of days (could be weeks, but time moves strangely in this film), and two particular characters fall in love for no reason whatsoever. Fairly odd, but the suspense and drama will keep you interested, despite the characters.Speaking of suspense and drama; there are scenes in this film that had me holding my breath! Won't spoil, but wow the writer of this film understands realistic horror and how mob hysteria works. Also, the sound design! Wow...incredibly disturbing. Not on the same level as a Lynch film, but we're getting somewhere!Final, and shortest point, the ending is a little goofy. Again, won't spoil, but it's exactly what you'd expect out of a horror movie trying to have a semblance of a happy ending...it doesn't work. Would've honestly preferred a downer ending.Overall, I enjoyed THE BIRD BOX, and would rate it a 6 out of 10!Thank you for taking time to read my review!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Is a government debt an allegory here?,"Is it possible for anyone blind grow food in a backyard for several years?

To the end of the movie, I was waiting for some kind of clarity about the creatures and bad insane guys or at least to see some kind of meaning of the whole story, but I was left clueless. To me, the movie is just stupid in general and in many details.If the thing called ""creatures"" is a government debt, then the movie makes perfect sense. Think about it: The debt is so horrifying that when you open your eyes and see what it will bring, you want to commit suicide. Only bad guys are untouched by the debt, because they are actually capitalizing on the destruction. I can live with this allegory.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Aggravating, pointless, preposterous","In all, not very engaging as a story. The idea of journey as blindfolded with two small blindfolded children is not compelling or thriller; it's anxiety-producing. Especially since the protagonist (Bullock) is basically unlikable in this role. The whole premise is preposterous: traveling in a boat blindfolded, driving a car blind, etc. Also, there's an element of child abuse with ""boy"" and ""girl"" who've spent their little lives with the Bullock character as non-entities, until the ending in which there is supposed to be some sort of validation of their presence.

It shouldn't have really gone over 2 hours in my opinion as most scenes were dragged on. It also wasn't the horror I was expecting; some scenes had suspense which was a good addition. Even though the actions of the new character in the house were extremely predictable, all of the characters each had their own identity and it showed how people would normally react during a crazy outbreak such as this one. It was also awesome seeing the older Lennie from Of Mice and Men :) Sandra Bullock was great and the kids actually stole the show. I would say if a new Bird Box is being thought of, please make it shorter. I must say the end of the movie is a wonderful surprise. I would recommend a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Might as well weigh in on the whole viral sensation thing that is Bird Box! Light spoilers ahead...,"Nice little b-movie concept film elevated by a mostly great cast. Basically M.Night Shyamalan's The Happening done right. Fits right in with some recent cool-concept suspense movies such as A Quiet Place, that focus on family-building elements to encourage more investment in their characters.Some scenes could have done with a little more commitment to the idea though, and really played on the inability to see. Kind of ruins it in the parts where we can see what the characters can't.Good to see more A-list actors willing to go to the small screen, and I've always been a fan of Sandra's massive Bullocks.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The virtue signalling is blatant in this film, every minority is heroic and self sacrificing, the fallen are all white, the gun owner an angry man mad at the gay who again selflessly sacrifices himself as well.
So the only lessons were accidental, the cultural messages being put out by this set are pushing society to self destruction, and even as they are damaged themselves, they try to take others down with them.

Fun and Lazy,"Bird Box is a fun movie, I had a good time while watching it. I cared about the characters (even tho the first scene of the movie already give up their destinies) and was courious about what was going to happen next in every act.The problem is: THE MOVIE IS LAZY!It's commum in horror movies that the plot have to have some dumb characters so they can die. In Bird Box this doesn't happen, the characters act in a reasonable way, but the plot break it's own rules so people can die. All the deaths, and I said ALL OF THEN could be avoided if the script wasn't dumb.This took me completely out of the movie a couple times, made me get a little bit uncomfortable even tho the theme and the tension were making me enjoy the experience.I would recommend the movie, it's, like I said, pretty fun, but it's not a top grade horror.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"I dislike unexpected visitors too, Douglas","It seems John Malkovich's ""Douglas"" and I share the same views in regards to unexpected visitors.Beyond that, ""Bird Box"" is a film that never quite reached its full potential. I can't help but think it could've been in Oscars contention had it been executed better and with more efficient editing. As it is, ""Bird Box"" is a bit too long and a bit too 'superficial' - with it often moving too fast for attachment to characters to develop.I'd seen it all before. ""The Happening"", ""A Quiet Place"" - hell, there was nothing really to separate it from other movies in the apocalypse genre. The theme of parenthood was strong and helped give it (what I considered) a good ending - but damn, it took a while to get there!Overwhelmingly bleak and depressing, with some disturbing scenes and aspects sure to shock some viewers - though I never felt truly ""scared"".What's with so many films these days being so woefully depressive?

A rushed storyline but overall good experience,"This film is certainly worth a watch.The omnipresent threat of the entities that incarnate your worst fear works its way into every aspect of the film, leaving you with an underlying tone of suspense and unease which creates a good overall viewing experience.To its credit, the film starts of very strongly with a harrowing opening sequence. Further scenes, however, fail to live up to this standard and come off as underwhelming. This is partially due to the lack of development during the film for supporting characters, scenes that should provoque emotion simply fail to do so as the audience has little investment in the consequence.I'd therefore disagree with those who say the film could've been 20 minutes long, I don't believe 2 hours was long enough for a plot involving so many different stages and different characters. My personal opinion would suggest that it would need a miniseries to do it justice: whilst the action/horror scenes would be yet more sparce, they would leave a far greater impression if the character(s) involved had been given more than just a couple developing scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cheap thrills.,"Bird Box will give you a proper suspense that will make you hold your breath. It also has great acting, very good actors, good cinematography, and quality music. Bird Box also has some very good thriller scenes.However, there are a lot of idiotic events and situations. I know this is fiction, but post-apocalyptic fiction is supposed to be fiction only up to the cause and driver of the post-apocalyptic event. The reactions and limitations of the characters still have to be realistic. Some things that the characters do in Bird Box are not supposed to happen if this fictional scenario actually took place IRL. The title is also pretty lame since the bird box has very little to do with the plot.Watch this only if you're pretty bored or you've run out of thrillers to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Honest review,"First, Sandra Bullock is appealing in what she is in. Just a great actress that is easy to relate to. As usual, she does a great job and runs the spectrum from vulnerable to strong as the movie goes on. Really, all the actors did great, there just wasn't a lot of character development for most of them and perhaps it wasn't needed, as the story is really centered around Sandra's character. It is a little strange, to say the least, but it doesn't really take away from the movie. Personally, I would have liked a little more transparency as to what exactly was causing the apocalyptic type of behavior, but that is also part of the movie, that it is kind of left up to our imagination. Definitely worth a watch, but not the type of movie I would see multiple times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unworthy of its (current) meme status.,"This movie is so unbelievably bad that the only context that I could recommend it is as a ""so-bad-that-its-good"" movie. Even then its too long and too boring to worth the wonderfully bad moments of hilarity within.Plot - I am extremely hesitant to say that this movie even contains a plot. The script is so unbelievably bad that its hard to believe it was written. I really don't want to blame the screenwriter, because he also wrote Arrival (2016) which was great. Both movies are based on books, so I'm just going to assume that its all in the source material. The book that this was based on must have been terrible though because wow this movie is just so unbelievably bad. I can't believe what I just spent the last 2 hours watching. Its like the writer completely failed to understand what makes horror movies scary. I mean if you're scared of wind, I think that you can get a lot out of this movie. Otherwise, don't watch it.Characters - This movie is listed as a drama, as well as a horror/thriller (which it fails miserably at by not being even remotely scary) but the problem is that it doesn't contain any characters. All of the acting, from both the child and adult actors, is embarrassingly terrible. Honestly I don't blame them. No one is given anything to do. No one has any personalities, backstories, or goals. The weird, time skipping nature of the story doesn't help either. At no point is anyone developed in this movie. Also, sacrificing yourself, being pregnant, or screaming the f bomb all the time are not character traits. This movie is boring.Visuals - This is what $20M burning looks like. This movie has no style or art direction. It just looks like garbage. There are way cheeper movies out there that look so much better. Also, the continuity in this movie is almost nonexistent. From shot to shot there are countless distracting visual errors.I no longer want to talk about this movie or acknowledge it ever. Everything about it is terrible. Don't watch it.

before watching the movie read the book,"I read the book of bird box and I liked it very much and I've finished about a week or something.
I was hoping to hear that this film was filmed later and then heard that it was filmed.Sandra bullockda starring me more but even for that time I thought Sandra Bullock was a little big in this role.
When I watched the film, I saw it change a bit as usual.The movie takes 2 hours and it's hard to fit a big book in 2 hours.So in my opinion if I actually had a series rather than making movies I think it would be more like and really cool.Had a very long and immersive story for the film.In fact, a universe like TWD does more people in the world.or if it would be 3 series, but this would be risky in terms of viewing.
I did not love the film because I read the book but someone not reading the book maybe like this film.I don't find it bad again but it wasn't very good. So they could transfer this perfect scenario to the longer-term audience, and we would be in this universe for longer.

An Effective Post-Apocalyptic Thriller,"When looking at movies like Avatar or even direct remakes of classic movies, it's a fair criticism to hate on it for being unoriginal, but in the same breath, there's also an argument to be made for why it also worked so well for audiences around the world. Familiar storytelling has been around since the beginning of cinema and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Netflix's Bird Box is another example of this but done in an effective way. Taking the world by storm in the online community, this film has received quite a bit of praise by fans, and while I don't believe it's particularly that great, I did have positive viewing experience with it. This movie does many things right, but it stumbles quite a few times along the way. Here's why Bird Box may be worth your time, but also why there are plenty of other movies worth seeing first.The world has been overrun by a disease that has turned people into zombie-like creatures. With weird, unseeable figures making people kill commit suicide, the survivors have turned to wearing blindfolds to stay alive. Survival movies have been around forever and it's very rare that one does something new for the genre, and while Bird Box doesn't really do that, it tries to. Sadly, this movie is going to be compared to 2018's A Quiet Place, due to the fact that instead of not being able to look, that film was about not being able to speak or make a sound. On top of that, the ambiguity of A Quiet Place has been lost here and it really does feel over-explanatory on quite a few occasions.Bird Box begins with the main event having already happened and follows Malorie (Sandra Bullock) and two unknown children characters. I would've loved to see a survival film with these three characters for the full two hours, but the majority of this film actually takes place in the recent past, showing how this situation came to be. While that may work for some viewers, this was the main aspect that almost had me disliking this film. If it was just going to keep cutting away in order to beat the audience over the head with an explanation I would've been upset, but it does focus on the past more than the present. For that reason, I ended up becoming a little more forgiving, as some of the characters leading up to the present were very likeable.Sandra Bullock delivers a great performance here and held this movie together even through its weak moments. Joined by incredible talents in performers like John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, and Jacki Weaver to name a few, the true standout of this film was Trevante Rhodes, in my opinion. Ever since his breakout performance in the Oscar-winning Moonlight, I have been rooting for him to become an A-List star. Even though that hasn't happened for him yet, I believe his time may still come. I think he's a very talented actor and his screen time with Bullock leapt off the screen.In the end, Bird Box isn't going to be remembered by most people as one of the best movies of 2018, but I can definitely see why people are loving it. It's a film that explores multiple genres at once and makes for a very enjoyable experience overall. I admittedly haven't seen the majority of Susanne Bier's work, which is mostly due to the fact that they're foreign movies that I have yet to seek out, but I have seen her previous American film in Serena, which was quite bad in my opinion, so Bird Box was a very nice surprise. I had a very good time with this film and I will absolutely be seeking out this director's previous works. I recommend a watching this on your free time, but it's not something demanding to be watched.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The performances are good, particularly Bullock, who carries the film and gives a strong performance as an exhausted and desperate mother.However, the plot can be somewhat predictable at times, and some aspects of the movie, such as the explanation for the force that causes people to commit suicide, are not entirely satisfying.I hope it can be more bloody or gore because that includes the theme of the movie itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Casting by Committee,"The nod toward ""A Quiet Place"" acknowledged, this one has enough of a decent premise to go the distance on its own: some strange presence walks among us, and to gaze upon it is to go mad. Sounds downright biblical. To be sure, there are some decent moments of tension to be found within its two hour running time; and overall it is worth the watch. That said, it could have been much better.My problem is mainly with the writing and casting. The film's sensibilities are really a throw-back to such 1980s fare as ""The Thing"" or ""The Abyss"". To that end, the first half of the movie plays like a Hollywood idealization of society at large, where a conveniently multi-racial group of survivors hole up in a stylish Monrovian home to bond (and quibble) over their common enemy. There are the usual movie fights (Malkovich's white-guy Libertarian streak vs. The communal approach of his erstwhile companions). And the usual cross-racial movie bonding (Rhodes and Bullock exchanging deep dark fears in a not-entirely-convincing manner).But in the end it is Bullock's role that matters. This is her vehicle, and she does a decent job of playing the unintentional single mom dropped in the middle of a terror, trying to survive and save those around her as well. But decent is not quite enough to carry the script for two hours; and I found myself largely uninvested in her plight for the last twenty minutes of the film.I cannot help but feel the casting was done at a Los Gatos committee table. (""It's 2018. Bullock is 1996, and we need some 2018. Can we get Machine Gun Kelly? Call his agent."") The draw power of some of the stars is undeniable. But the choices also drained the movie of its potential power.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

There were some similarities though, and the similarities were the shortcomings of both. Both had glaring inconsistencies that others have pointed out, and impossibilities that had to be ignored. However, neither movie was ruined by these problems. It is a horror fantasy movie and to enjoy it you have to suspend belief quite a bit. Many good horror/fantasy movies require this.

I actually think it was pretty good. It didn't take too too long to get to the action, and Sandra in this film is very into her character. In fact, I think everyone's acting was solid. Yes, the plot of an unseen force that makes people commit suicide is basically the same as The Happening (the author of the Bird Box novel was inspired by that film so that's why), but Bird Box has an added layer of terror since you can't rely on sight, probably the most important sense we have. Where it falls short, however, is the lack of explanation for most things and plot holes. I found myself asking why and how a lot so it was a bit unsatisfying in that regard. Other than that though it was a nice apocalyptic thriller and I'd recommend it to someone who likes the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good structure but misses the details,"""Bird box"", the post-apocalyptic movie that gained notoriety after the great marketing done by netflix upon its name, but then, did all this marketing make sense? No, ""Bird Box"" did not have to be a cult movie with great acting, fantastic technique and admirable script, it just had to be a charismatic brockbuster, but neither of the two things the long directed by the already experienced Susanne Bier succeeds, is all bad and not horrible as the great criticism has been labeling it in recent weeks, it's just an ordinary movie. The way the script works is very interesting, if using several timelines to close a cohesive story, with beginning middle and end, this is good, but the same boldness applied in the structure could have been applied in the script itself, which is very watery with sugar, with poorly developed characters, superficial plot, lack of chemistry, bad rhythm ... A complete roller coaster, the movie improves and worsens constantly, again praising its script structure and the only good and complex development of the film, Malorie's relationship with the two children, something that is more maternal instinct than proper love. This is very good in the movie. Obviously, the violence contained in the book was diminished in the film, even by being on netflix, but more things were lost, as the various symbologies involving depression, maternity, suffering, hope, all this becomes superficial in the film and surrendered to an action secondly, the personification of the creatures is also medium, could be worse if they had a form, but symbolize their presence with wind, and to show that to the viewer kills the tension, it should be something more animalistic as it is in the book, where the they are symbolized with heavy steps. Although the film has a great deal of tension, not necessarily for the creatures, but for the agony of not seeing and for the crazy people who are well used in the film, mentally weak human beings who are passionate about the visualization of the divine or the monstrosity. A palette of gray colors, open and closed plans, good makeup and weak soundtrack sum up the technique of the long. Sandra Bullock is tough and well in her role, Trevante Rhodes also, although together, there is no chemistry, for me, the best character in the film is John Malkovich Douglas, who steals the scene whenever he appears and ends up serving as a crutch for the development of the protagonist. ""Bird box"" in the end is a film that has caught too much of the criticism and of all, but much has forgotten its good narrative structure and some other high points, nothing much, but it is a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

And entertaining but ultimately unsatisfactory psychological horror film,"So I saw Bird Box on Netflix. I normally do not get too excited about Netflix originals, but I do like Sandra Bullock plus I had a few recommendations from some friends. Overall it was a bit of a mixed bag of a film.The concept of the film is quite interesting. A unknown entity is causing mass suicides across the planet. The meat of the film is a psychological thriller showing a group of people trying to survive in the apocalyptic chaos. The film itself takes place through a series of flashbacks demonstrating how the world fell apart and just what a ""bird box"" is for.The film had a very strong beginning. I genuinely enjoyed the setup of the film and wondering just what was going on. The film does a good job of initially building tension and intrigue to craft an atmosphere that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I also really liked the way the film handled the ""bird box"" monster entities. Some people may not be satisfied, but ultimately they served more as a MacGuffin to push the narrative along.There were also a number of gruesome kills in the movie that came out of nowhere and felt genuinely shocking. There were a few smart underlying concepts regarding loss, alienation, grief, and depression that the films touches on. The movie did a good job with Sandra Bullock's character as well. I really felt attached to her and her emotional struggles as the film went along.The acting was solid all-around. Sandra Bullock is a great actress and she does her best with the material even with its flaws. Same thing with the supporting ensemble cast. I really don't have a complaint about anyone's acting. I will say there is no reason for Machine Gun Kelly to be in this film though. His character or story arc added nothing to the film.Ultimately though the concept is more interesting than the execution. The film felt very reminiscent of A Quiet Place with elements of the Mist and The Happening thrown in for good measure. Bird Box was certainly better than the Happening, but felt like an imitation of better films. This does not mean it wasn't entertaining. It certainly had its moments of intense horror and psychological drama.It does seem like the film was trying too hard to go into many different directions. Is it a smart psychological horror film? A gory monster flick? A meditation on human nature in the face of chaos? A survivalist tale of female empowerment in the face of dread? It just felt like the film never really found its voice with so many narratives.There were also some glaring pacing issues in the film. There was entirely too much filler in the film. It really could have been shaved down 30 minutes or so to make a tighter presentation. The film really began to lose steam halfway through. This of course being a shame considering the strength of the introduction. The middle dragged on, while the conclusion felt rushed and unsatisfactory. The movie fell short of its initial setup with a forced and anticlimactic ending. I won't go into any details regarding the plot holes, but there are a few head scratchers throughout the film that really hurt the internal believability of the film.Overall I liked Bird Box for what it was. It was a well acted film with an interesting concept that dropped the ball on execution. It certainly isn't a classic horror film, but it's not a bad Netflix original either. I would recommend a watch for anyone that has Netflix, but don't expect to be blown away.... and yes the memes are better than the film. A 6.25 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Your parents raised you to be part of the society, to be with people and to fight your negative thoughts and feelings they never tell you ti accept it. So most of the society isn't immune against lonliness. So people can't handle it they just commit suicide.

See What's Happening Now?,"Well, at least the Cloverfield monster didn't show up.Never thought (hoped?) I'd SEE a M. Night Shyamalan remake, but here goes. Bird Box is definitely his Happening Ver. 2 and though somewhat better than the unintentionally hilarious Shyamalan ""thriller,"" it's still a terrible idea and now contains even worse characters.This is like one of those terrible SyFy knockoffs to feed off the Quiet Place bucks. This film's twist? Instead of having to be quiet, our antiheroes have to lose SIGHT. Well, of vision, continuity, logic, reason, brains and physics. Just to name a few.Suddenly Death shows up and anyone caught looking at it wants to commit suicide. Survivors do their survival thing, such as hold up in once location, fight, have montages and come up explanations on why Death's at their doorstep.The movie writes itself into a corner so it comes up with human slaves of Death who lure people to LOOOOOOK and this causes the survivors to LOOOOOOK elsewhere for shelter.Honestly, the movie's not the worst I've SEEN, but it's way too long, too bleak, includes subpar and lazy special effects, was badly written, has huge plot holes, was hardly original and worst of all: Sandra Bullock, the anchor of the film.My guess: Bullock has been on a kick late into her career to shed any decency she had left by playing bland, boring or downright disgustingly bad characters. She was possibly the worst part of Ocean's Eight and here, I hated her from minute one. And she never regained any sparkle in my EYE.Yes, I understood her character and motivations. I pieced together her past and reasons why she acts the way she does, but damn, she is despicable and the whole movie falls on her shoulders. Even her enormously predictable character arc wouldn't save her. The movie's barely worth WATCHING, and she nearly brought the whole mess down. How anyone would want to be ten feet close to her before this Happening is baffling and following, it's even more torturous since there are so few humans to be around.I hope they didn't set this up to be a franchise or TV series as it seems like they did. These original two hours are ones I never want to SEE again.***Final thoughts: Shocked they didn't get Kristen Stewart to play the lead. She's always playing dour and depressing characters that people always seem to mysteriously flock to in movies even though in real life, no one would ever want to give them the time of day. I know I wouldn't. To either person.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost a good film,"One of my favorite films of 2018 is A QUIET PLACE where aliens with extreme hearing can get you if you make a noise. It is a quite interesting and well made film (with a bravura performance by Emily Blunt), so when I heard there was a variant of this theme (this time you can't use your eyes), I decided to check it out and to see if Sandra Bullock could pull off the same sort of bravura performance as Blunt.And, that's too bad, for by comparison the Netflix flick BIRD BOX is no A QUIET PLACE, but if I don't try to compare it to A QUIET PLACE, BIRD BOX is a very entertaining film, indeed.The story follows Bullock as Malorie a pregnant single woman who holds no ""maternal instinct"" towards her unborn child. Malorie is devoid of emotion and compassion and is dreading the day that her child will be born. Enter into this an ""end of world event"" where unseen aliens show up and, if you look at them, you go insane and try to commit suicide. Amidst this chaos, Malorie and a ragtag assortment of survivors find shelter in the house of Douglas (John Malkovich). Can this disparate group of strangers find a way to survive in this insane new world?Well...the fun in this kind of movie is in the characters trapped together and the ""10 Little Indians"" style of demise as the house guests are picked off one by one by the aliens (or each other). It is the drama of these trapped individuals, and the surprise and the ingenuity of how they are killed off that makes or breaks these types of films.And in this way, this film succeeds very well for besides Bullock and Malkovich, the housemates are filled with (for the most part) a strong grouping of actors led, most notably, by Trevante Rhodes (MOONLIGHT) and Jacki Weaver (ANIMAL KINGDOM). They are strong presences in this household and are interesting to watch. Good ol' B.D. Wong (JURASSIC PARK among many, many credits) brings his usual, solid game and Lil Rey Howery (GET OUT) brings much needed energy and humor to the proceedings. Add to this the usual, creepy Tom Hollander (IN THE LOOP) as a mysterious houseguest who is...creepy...and there is enough going on to keep my interest.Add to this the always intriguing work of Malkovich as the paranoid, ""me first"" homeowner and Bullock underplaying her emotions as a counterbalance to Malkovich overplaying his emotions and the scenes in the house were interesting and (at times) gripping.The problem I have with this film is that it inter cuts these scenes with scenes of Bullock (and a few other survivors from the house) ""5 years later"" - so, you already know who makes it and who doesn't - which takes away the tension of the house scenes. It also has an ending that, quite frankly, I saw coming a mile off and so it was not a satisfying conclusion to the proceedings for the ending was uneventful and unsurprising. A poor way to end this sort of film.Don't get me wrong, the scenes in the house of the initial group of survivors is well worth viewing this film, I just wish Director Susanne Bier (THE NIGHT MANAGER) didn't dilute these scenes by bringing us forward in time too soon. I wonder how much better this film could have been had we just watched the events of the film (including all of the ""5 years later scenes"") in chronological order, I gotta think it would have been a better film.This is, by every definition of the term, a ""B"" film, perfect for a snow, rain or cold-bound afternoon at home.Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blindfolded Bird Box,"Good production value.Good acting, for the most part.Entertaining, for the most part.Bird Box would likely have been better received if it was released further after A Quiet Place.The antagonist is a mystery, and the film doesn't attempt to explain it beyond what the characters can imagine. The ""criminally insane"" become allies with the unsympathetic ""force"". I've read that some viewers proclaim it stigmatises mental illness, however, that was not my impression. The only mention I recall from the movie was that these people were ""criminally insane"", like a person incapable of human empathy, imprisoned for a heinous crime. The film doesn't mention ""mental illness"" at all.The opening sequence was sensational.The secondary characters have their purpose in the film, albeit small and seemingly insignificant. They each added flavour to the film, even if it's just for comical relief or a sex-in-the-pantry scene.I don't think the film attempts to deliver a message about society. It does attempt to entertain, thrill, sadden, and offer a somewhat happy ending. I think it delivers what it intended to, and I'll give 7 birds to this box, I reckon.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best Netflix originals,"I avoided the social media frenzy of this movie, so I could watch without any judgement. I am glad I did! A great horror movie in the sense of feeling dread with anxiety and overall 'what would I do?'
This was better than 'A Quiet Place', which is similar in terms of 'horror'. Strong cast, Sandra Bullock is great with her emotions to a point I get angry. Yet I see why she is this way, to separate herself from emotions so she can fight for survival. The children are lovable and my heart hurt for them at times.So to those who are disappointed, saying this isn't 'horror', well you obviously don't see the horror in living this kind of life and the intense dread this film provided.

I found the whole thing pretty gripping, good cast, good acting, characters you cared about.

Mediocre apocalypse tale,"Even if it didn't come out in the same year as A QUIET PLACE, the similar, if to be fair, based on a prior book, Susanne Bier's BIRD BOX would still be a disappointing effort. Replacing sound with vision as the sensory device, BIRD BOX falls firmly in line with a long line of apocalyptic survivor tales, complete with the small isolated group of fellow 'survivors' who end up battling each other as much as the outside force.The major issues here are less about familiarity and cliches (although there are plenty), but, with the movie's lack of forward momentum. The strict flashback structure actually lessens the impact, rather than enhances it (not to mention that it treats the audience as if they have to been spoonfed each and every detail). The cast is game, lead by Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes and John Malkovich, but, it's an unsympathetic and uninteresting lot (Malkovich is the only one seemingly enjoying himself, even if he could do this one note role in his sleep). Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is serviceable, if undistinguished -- as is Salvatore Totino's lensing. BOX may have fewer overt gaping plot holes than QUIET, but on virtually every other count the Blunt-Krasinski film is superior.BIRD BOX has a few effective moments and a couple of striking individual shots, but, it never adds up to much more than a humdrum addition to the end of the world filmmography; Certainly, nothing worthy of a project pairing a Director with a Best Foreign Film Oscar under her belt (IN A BETTER WORLD) with an Oscar winning actress (not to mention Malkovich).",,Anonymous,Horror

Bird Box,"Bullock and 2 young children set off down a river to sanctuary, blindfolded, because you'll commit suicide if you see the dark malevolent force that has infected the planet.Swapping between the river trip and how it all started 5 years ago, this is a really tense and sometimes almost unbearably hard to watch chiller. The force is never explained or seen - definitely for the better - but remains a frightening presence throughout. The cast are terrific, but Bullock is something else, delivering a stonking performance which not since Sigourney Weaver as Ripley has so well combined vulnerability and toughness. This is particularly moving in her relationship with the children where she pulls no punches in her treatment of them to keep them both alive.There are definitely a few plot holes which needed tidying up, but this is definitely one to catch. It never lets go, keeps you longing for a happy ending (I won't say) and finally leaves you exhausted.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

You just have to stay realistic. I, on the other hand, liked Bird Box as there was suspense, mystery, good acting and the cinematography was also good. For once a movie stayed interesting and that without showing monsters or whatever.

Put a blindfold on Bullock and she'll still out-act you,"Very few actors can anchor a Netflix movie and turn it into a massive hit. Sandra Bullock fits this bill, as the Academy Award-winning actress carries the apocalyptic thriller 'Bird Box' on her shoulders.The sign of a solid ""mess with your mind"" thriller is when it stays with you long after you watch it. In 'Box,' Bullock stars as Mallorie, a mother who must guide her children while blindfolded through the wilderness as supernatural forces try to hunt them down. As the film progresses, pieces begin to fall into place that help the audience understand the events that transpired. While some twists can be seen from a mile away, there are plenty of ""OMG"" moments around every corner, which feel like a punch to your gut. Not every film in this genre can accomplish this nowadays, but writer Eric Heisserer and director Susanne Bier were able to achieve this. A lot of this is due to smart cinematography, as well. Using tight shots that leave much to the imagination about what's going on surrounding the actors, as well as quick transitions and flashbacks - these techniques work well here.Bullock is of course the lead here, but a number of familiar faces are seen hiding in houses behind drapes and shades. Sarah Paulson stars as the sister of Mallorie, and although her screentime is not super long, she brings ""horror cred"" to the film. Others like BD Wong, Machine Gun Kelly and Trevante Rhodes do alright, with the latter making the biggest impact. And John Malkovich is quintessential John Malkovich, bourbon and all. But 'Box' is really all about Sandra, and she steals every scene she's in.And then there's the birds. Birds represent much more than winged creatures who sing. Not only do they serve a functional purpose, but they are also emblematic of the psychological imprisonment that humanity experiences throughout the film. And so the film's title is not as random as it seems.There have been a few Netflix films that have gone on to garner buzz (and some even critical acclaim), and 'Bird Box' is surely one that will encourage more to be made.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Did the fanboys see another version of the movie?,"Did people see another version of this movie that I didn't see? Because this film was so bad I couldn't finish it.

Nor do they care.This film lacked actual monsters and the characters face an entity they never see. Much less makes sense. Are the entities aliens or supernatural beings? The movie stays in the middle the whole time and never answers our questions.Rules that seem to make sense get broken later in the film. Random twists and turns get added to build ""suspense"" but end up annoying the audience instead.Though the lineup is great, the cast that lacks real chemistry. Each character is lazily killed off until we're left with Bullock and her two UNNAMED children. I guess the plot is so badly thought out they forgot to give them names.Effects were alright at best. But cliched and don't deserve applause.Finally, the namesake of the film, bird boxes, get introduced late into the film. The bird boxes themselves add little besides build suspense.
