"""The arrogance of men is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around.""","When this came out, people were upset that it did not have enough creatures in it. I agreed back then but now after the sequels I realize that Gareth Edwards was trying to focus on the story and not just a CGI fest. I really enjoyed Bryan Cranston's character and wish I could have more of that too. While I left wanting more, sometimes that is better than having too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla 2014: Should You Watch It?,"Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Godzilla here looks much more like the beloved behemoth than it did in the '98 movie, the music hearkens to the classic Japanese overtures of the old Gojira film era, and the camera work has the comically silly nature of Sam Rami's Spiderman series.Scenario 2: If you are really excited to see a deep, human film with camera angles and writing that really tell a story that is thematically transcendent such as ""District 9"" and the Korean film ""The Host,"" this is not your film. The script is filled with overtly simplistic rhetoric and one dimensional characters (intentionally,) the scenes somehow manage to have very little tension (even for me, the pilot episodes for most sitcoms seem more tense than Gozilla,) and as stated above, the camera-work is intentionally hammy. It should also be noted that to add a human element, the director overuses children to the point that it ends up feeling very obvious, as though he did it to be intentionally campy.Scenario 3: If you are one of those people who really just want a fun popcorn flick such as Pacific Rim, with some solidly choreographed action like in the over-the-top bulletfest Battle:LA, I would say proceed with caution. The fight scenes are less intense and more majestic, like any classic monster movie, and as such the human aspect of the combat is relatively insignificant, less so than any other monster movie I've ever seen. There are no little monsters for anyone to shoot at, if that's your thing.Scenario 4: If you are interested in this film because you love the talented work of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and/or Aaron Taylor- Johnson (three of my favorite actors) and are excited to see what they bring to the table, you should probably sit this one out. Bryan Cranston's role in this film garners far less screen time than advertised, Ken Watanabe spends literally every second walking through the scenes with the pained expression of someone who just walked in on their parents, and all three of the actors give off the vibe that they are very much aware of how cheesy their lines are. Everyone else's performance was similarly forgettable.Honestly, I'm a stickler for deep, human storytelling, but I've also had a softspot for the classic, silly fun of many Godzilla movies, including my favorite, Godzilla vs. Destroyah. All told, depending on which camp you fall under, this will be an entirely different movie for you. As Godzilla movies go, I'd give it a B. As darker, more serious monster movies go, I'd give it a D+.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Satisfying Summer Blockbuster,"I saw the trailers for this a year ago while I attended a screening for Aronofsky's NOAH . I didn't fancy it much . GODZILLA conjures up memories of the big budget blandfest from a decade and a half ago . Just put some CGI on screen and voilà you've a Summer blockbuster . This version did get a very good average rating when it opened , something in the region 8.1 but progressively got lower and it now has a rating of 6.6 indicating something average . To be fair I went in with an open mind and did find myself enjoying things more than I probably expectedThe original GODZILLA from 1954 was of a course a Japanese film that used the monster as a metaphor for the bomb . It did quickly abandon this subtext and just became a long running franchise where the titular monster got involved in all sorts of battles with other giant monsters . In its favour Gareth Edwards version of GODZILLA does keep the ethos of this . Radiation is very much to the fore of the story and while Godzilla might not be the hero he's certainly not the villain and this is reserved for ""Massive Unidentified Terreistial Organism"" a sort of hybrid between a giant praying mantis and a dragon . You know at one point they're going to be meeting in a climatic battleOf course two hours of giant CGI creatures getting in to a punch up isn't going to resonate with an audience so Edwards includes a very human backdrop as the story takes place through the eyes of serviceman Ford Brody . You got to love that name , it's sounds like a character John Wayne was born to play , a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do , get off your horse and drink your milk etc . It wasn't until I found out after seeing the film that I found out Brody is played by English actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson who I was totally convinced was one hundred per cent Uncle Sam . That said this isn't an actors type of film and I'm speculating that the casting of Cranston and Binoche might have led to the backlash by many people . If you want to see Binoche try not to be blink because you will literally miss her . It's also difficult not to notice that there's a strong streak of manipulation as to how the characters play out . It's also yet another film where a little kid is used in a scene to keep the audiences emotions on tenterhooksRegardless of this people watch a film like GODZILLA for action set pieces and you can't really fault Edwards for what he's done here . He doesn't have a idiosyncratic quirk to his directorial style and the film does have that kind of Summer blockbuster look but he also previously directed MONSTERS and that movie featured a couple of aliens mating and here the MUTOs have a similar though much more shorter sequence . If you need a film calling for alien reproduction I can see Gareth Edwards being a natural auteur",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It had it's moments,"Finally sat down to watch this movie today. After all the hype it had had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was missing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't. Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story line. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed greatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special effects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for sure. Sit back, grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Form over function Once again.,"OK, let me start off by saying that the new Godzilla is definitely an entertaining movie and well worth the price of an admission ticket. That is – so long as you go into it with popcorn-level expectations. Now, it has to be said that the bar, since the most recent attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998 (which was hilarious at best) wasn't set particularly high, to say it nicely. So in all honesty, with today's budget and special effects, it never had a big chance of being that bad. But I have to admit, judging from the trailer – I thought it would be better.It starts off pretty good. There is proper story build-up and character lay-out. Where we are – what's happening... It's all there. In fact, the story revolving around the main characters is pretty dramatic from the get-go. Death in the family, trauma leading to obsession over finding the truth surrounding the circumstances. Bryan Cranston is impressive as the family father and science guy. He just knows something is up concerning some big beastie and he won't let up until he figures it out. That is – if he gets the chance. Something happens around one third into the movie that is a pivotal turning point in the story. I knew this immediately when it happened and in the end I realised that I had been correct.From this point on, it's out with the story and in with the action. An almost mind-numbing, pummelling assault of non-stop action. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's a lot less interesting than it could have been.Here's the deal: instead of just one Big Monster, they bring in three. One Godzilla, and two huge insect-like creatures that are only designated as MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object). Seriously, they couldn't come up with a proper name? And instead of Godzilla being the big threat to mankind, the MUTO are. In fact, Godzilla turns out to be the good guy because he's the only one that can defeat these insect creeps. This story line is factor one in the reason that this movie isn't what it could have been. Factor two is the plot point that these creatures all feed on nuclear energy instead of ""manburgers"". Consequentially, the only real threat they pose is the massive destruction they cause in big cities (and obviously, the human lives that become casualties by default). It's because of this that there is never any real sense of threat or danger. They don't hunt us, they don't care about us. All they want is nuclear energy and a place to breed. What's worse is, these MUTO take screen time and attention away from the monster who's supposed to be the main antagonist and namesake of the movie! It might as well have been called ""Big Creepy Insects"" instead of ""Godzilla""...In the end, what we're left with is billions of dollars worth of collateral damage and a big-ass monster who's really kind of a nice guy. Weird.Still, it's certainly not bad. Aaron Taylor- Johnson does his best at looking very serious and all grown up since his Kick-Ass days, although I am certain that this is definitely one of his less compelling roles. The problem is that from the 1/3 turning point that I mentioned, his character becomes very formulaic and cliché. Our hero even shares an intimate moment of eye contact with Godzilla in the end... Aww.Ken Watanabe spends every moment of his screen time looking shocked and awed... and pretty much nothing else. Juliette Binoche is shamefully underused. I would have loved to have seen more of her. The biggest asset is definitely Bryan Cranston. He's the only one who managed to make his character 3-dimensional and a real human being. He, too, would have definitely deserved a bigger role. In fact, the film probably would have been much better for it.Visually, everything is very awesome and impressive. The special effects (visual and sound) are top-notch. Every time Godzilla opened his mouth to let out a massive roar, I thought my eardrums were going to pop. It's bone-chilling and very cool. The design of the MUTO is a real treat, they look like giant praying mantises, totally intimidating. The films' SFX really make it worthwhile.All in all, the story is quite weak and riddled with clichés, though I must say one thing: thank God for the complete lack of obligatory footprints. I was seriously dreading the moment these giant ""claw prints in the mud"" would appear on screen, but thankfully it never happened. The overall feel and setting of this film is quite dark and threatening, and adding such a cliché would have been really dumb and unnecessary.I had really hoped that this was going to be the definitive Godzilla movie. Alas, it is not. But I still enjoyed it for what it was and I definitely recommend seeing it for the special effects alone. In any case, 'Gojira' looks awesome.I rate it 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
monster movie better than the human story,"During the 1950s, creatures are awaken from the deepest depths. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that ancient creatures exist that lives in radiation. As the radiation faded from the earth's surface, these creatures retreated to the lower depths. In 1999, miners uncover a vast cavern with a giant skeleton in the Philippines. They also find one of the spores broken open. In Japan at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife in a freak incident. Fifteen years later, Joe is still investigating the incident with the city around the plant quarantined. He is arrested once again for trying to breach the quarantine. His son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has to leave behind his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) in San Francisco to go pick him up from jail in Japan. Joe convinces Ford who is now a US Navy ordnance disposal officer to join him to go to the plant. They discover that there is no radiation leak. Instead the spore from the Philippines named MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) has settled in the plant sucking up all the radiation.This is always going to be a great monster movie. The CGI is terrific and Godzilla has a great time smashing things up. That part seems like a no-brainer. I still give director Gareth Edwards credit for doing a great job. He doesn't disappoint. The problem is once again the human story. The beginning is just too long before it gets to a monster. The Joe Brody story doesn't have the bite. In another movie, his story would be a fun mystery. The problem is that the audience knows it's a monster even if it's not Godzilla. So there is no tension from the mystery since it's not really a mystery. The other problem is that Ford just happens to be at the right place in all of those situations. It's a situation that a lesser movie would rely on. I hoped for better. The final problem I have is that the movie cuts away from the monster action time and time again. It's funny the first time but it gets annoying quickly. Despite all the problems, there is still a fun monster movie and lots of stuff get smashed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The monster action is fun, but, overall, it's a disappointment","Oh, the trailers looked so good. I had hope, and, for the most part, my only criterion was that it be better than Pacific Rim, Hollywood's attempt at the kaiju genre last year. I liked that one, but was disappointed (with Guillermo del Toro, I expected something with a little more meat). Godzilla does not clear that hurdle. It has the same major problem that all these kinds of films do: the human element is lacking. Severely here. And what a fantastic cast to waste! Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe! Every single one of them utterly wasted. Hopefully they all got a big check. We have all these people, but instead we're saddled with charisma black hole Aaron Taylor-Johnson (of Kick-Ass fame), who isn't even adequate. Thankfully, the big monster fights deliver, for the most part. There could maybe be more monster action, but when it's there, it's a lot of fun. I also thank the filmmakers for restraining themselves and keeping the film at only two hours (it runs a tad over that if you stay through the credits).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Let them fight"".","The story is about a a gigantic beast looking to wreak havoc on mankind - and he may not be alone.This movie has one of the best visual effect's of the year by far, The fight scenes at the end are so epic and amazing I also cried with joy. And some critics have said the characters are boring but I didn't mind them. My favorite scene has to be the sky driving part and yeah I know it only lasted only 2 minutes but the music was scary and chilling and the cinematography was beautiful to look at. Godzilla looked awesome in the movie and the final fight at the end was so bad-ass and so much better then pacific Rim fight scenes. Godzilla's roar in this movie was loud and scary. a lot of people said Godzilla didn't do anything in this movie and I didn't know what there where talking about, Godzilla walked around a couple of times and kicked ass at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Although effects and sound are technically impressive, it is quite unsatisfying and superficial","I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.The film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others – all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on – a device that has impact for sure, but doesn't seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.On this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience – so it does it, lots. Considering I didn't care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed – it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness – something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.Unfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"This is worth a watch, but a missed opportunity to be so much better","Godzilla (2014) is a movie that I recently rewatched on MAX. The storyline follows a nuclear plant in Japan 🇯🇵 that is mysteriously destroyed. A husband and son lost their mother/wife in the incident and try to uncover what happened and why. In doing so they get front row seats to the awakening of several monsters, some that want to destroy the world and some that want to save it...This movie is directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters) and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass), Elizabeth Olsen (WandaVision), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), David Strathairn (The Firm) and Richard T. Jones (Event Horizon).This is one of those Godzilla movies I didn't hate, but could have been so much better. The monsters are fairly well done and the monster battles are great. But the first monster battle doesn't happen until there's 20 minutes left in the movie...and this movie is two hours and three minutes long. The cast was great but I'm not sure I loved them in this movie. The story was just okay; and while I liked the monsters, I felt like they could have gone with a more tradition Rodan as the first villain. Overall, this is worth a watch, but a missed opportunity to be so much better and everything we needed from a Godzilla picture. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"After thinking about it, I must replace my own past words...","I said once i went out the theater:Godzilla finally found the perfect movie for itself yet. The story works as well the pace and the special effects. The first half of the movie is absolutely perfect with all the destruction that the monster provokes. It leaves to the viewer unforgettable scenes. But the second half is not at all a disappointment. The action sequences are effective and spectacular. Godzilla is truly frightening. Young viewers are advised! The acting is also so nice delivering solid performances and helping the drama. Bryan Cranston may be a standout but Elisabeth Olsen is a scene stealer and a very important role here. With any doubts I had an encounter with one of the best movies of the year.But now, after some days I say:This is a riveting entertaining that will please the moviegoers. But it's s disappointment in terms of the monster itself and its fights against the other. An important lack.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In a word...EPIC!,"I wasn't going to review this film, however, after reading mostly negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old ""Godzilla vs....."" movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Tedious, Heartless Film","For fans of monster movies, ""Godzilla"" was surely one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Therefore, the most surprising thing about Godzilla is not how empty the story is, but rather how little there is of the monster in the movie after which it is named.The plot in ""Godzilla"" is disposable. It only exists as an excuse to unleash the film's titular character. However, is it too much to ask for an original plot with characters we could care about? Here, the back story is cliché-ridden and the characters simply serve the function of moving the story forwards. As such, one would expect that Godzilla is at least given ample screen time. Surprisingly, this is not the case, and the majority of the film's focus seems to be on the military attempting to find out how to kill Godzilla and the MUTOs, which look like giant, angry cockroaches. Ultimately, it is left up to the score and the Michael Bay-esque dub-step reminiscent sound design to create tension.Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are so one-dimensional that nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspired script. More worrying, however, is how unnecessary Sally Hawkins' character is and how the script manages to make Ken Watanabe look like a second-rate actor, as his character rarely changes expression from the looks of intense thought or surprise.Overall, ""Godzilla"" did not work for me at all. Not only is it a film without heart, but it a film meant to thrill that ends up just being tedious. I could have left halfway through the movie. I just didn't care how things would turn out.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apparently You Love It or Hate It,"I have to say I was disappointed with this film. I was so intrigued by the first half hour as we were brought into the events in a secret facility in Japan. One of the directors watches his wife die after a nuclear breech. Now we cut into the future. The director is still out there. He has become a crusader against the secrecy of this type of research. His son, who lost his other in the earlier incident, has become military and is really annoyed with his father's campaign. Now we throw all that aside. Dad has evidence, but has been arrested for treasonous acts. They see him as more of a nuisance than anything, but they have their own fish to fry. He manages to get back to the house where they lived (which is in rubble) and recover some old floppy disks. During this time, some sort of huge flat headed flying creature with spider legs has come to life. It is causing incredible destruction. Godzilla, who apparently is no secret, is moving around in the ocean. He is on a collision course with these other things. While the special effects are good, there is something really lacking in the story line, in the fights themselves, in the whole attitude toward these monster, and just a sort of malaise. I came to the theater excited because at midnight in 1957, I stayed up past my bedtime to her Raymond Burr in the Americanized version of ""Godzilla"" talk about the destruction of Tokyo. I have since watched so many of these movies, including the forgettable Matthew Broderick one, and I had hoped for some kind of earth shattering, apocalyptic presentation. For me, it was just an ordinary monster movie with little new to offer.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Enjoyable Action Romp That Restores The Franchise's Original Glory,"In 1998, Roland Emmerich attempted to reignite the eponymous film franchise by creating the critically-panned flop 'Godzilla', 16 years on and we are now faced with one of the best adaptations of the iconic monster's adventures. Gareth Edwards created 'Monsters' in 2010 on a mere budget of £500,000, barely 4 years on and Warner Brothers offered him the chance to create a $160 million adaptation of 'Godzilla'. All the aspects from 'Monsters' are employed in this action/sci-fi adventure, but on a much grander scale. This is a treat for all Godzilla fans and a very respectable adaptation that stays true to the 1950s Japanese classic rather than wandering away like Emmerich's one did. Packed with stunning cinematography, vast special effects and a sweeping spectacle of giant monster battles, 'Godzilla' has been a fantastic start to 2014. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performances are outstanding and there is a certain chemistry that makes their relationship that bit more believable. Whilst at time there are some cheesy and over-the-top scenes, 'Godzilla' is nonetheless an enjoyable action romp that restores the franchise's original glory.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the best Godzilla movie but still decent,"I really like this Godzilla movie. Granted it's not as good as the original 1954 version, Mothra vs Godzilla, the Heisei era flicks, or GMK but it's still good. The effects were amazing with everything conveying a strong sense of scale as all the monsters move slowly like larger than life forces. Also they made Godzilla a nigh- indestructible force of nature with his signature durability and atomic breath. Surprisingly the kaiju have lots of personality expressing moments of joy, love, despair, weariness, and wrath. In fact, I'm willing to look past the dull look of the MUTOs because they act like real animals and show so much emotion.Yet as much as I enjoy the movie, there is the main downside everyone brings up: Godzilla doesn't show up enough. Granted there are lots of creature features that focus more on the humans like Jurassic Park, Aliens, Predator, and Jaws. However, those movies at least had characters that while neither the deepest or most complex, were at least likable and recognizable.Here the main human characters are generic and lifeless. Aaron Taylor Johnson's performance as Ford is boring and lacks the stoic intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood. They could've made Ford have an angry grudge against Godzilla and the MUTOs that would clash with Sherizawa's respect for Godzilla. Ditto Elizabeth Olsen's Elle,she never seemed to show emotionally heartache or depressed concern for her patients or her family. Their bland characters would've had been so annoying had they not overshadowed Bryan Cranston's Joe and Ken Watanabe's Sherizawa.If the creators are going to make another Godzilla flick, then they should either increase Godzilla's screen time or at the very least bring in better actors and create more memorable characters. That said,it's still a fun movie on its own merits and I'm looking forward to the sequel",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

See this on the big screen - it's worth it,"This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread out to accommodate the monsters.The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado here.Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend solid support.Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear enough for relaying the plot through dialog.Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster monster movie that deserves a big screen watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, but a bit lackluster","Now, don't get me wrong, Godzilla (2014) was a good movie. It did what it was suppose to do BUT, I do have some issues with it starting with Bryan Cranston's lack of screen time. The trailers would have made you believe Bryan Cranston plays a very big role in the movie but, he doesn't. He had the least screen time out of all the other actors.Also, for a movie called ""Godzilla"", you really don't see Godzilla a whole lot. I take it back, Bryan Cranston had more screen time than Godzilla. Nonetheless, Godzilla (2014) was AMAZINGLY better than the 1998 adaptation. And I have to give credit, where credit is due, Gareth Edwards managed to bring back an iconic feature from the old Godzilla films, something the '98 disaster failed horribly to do.Overall, good entertaining movie.

"Godzilla, King of the Insomnia Cure","Godzilla (2014)* 1/2 (out of 4)The ""plot"" really doesn't matter, now does it? Let's just say there's an accident at a nuclear reactor, which no one pays too much attention to until MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) wakes up and heads to the West Coast of America but also on the way is Godzilla.It's clear that Godzilla movies are always going to be made and some are going to be better than others. I think the nicest thing I can say about this version is that it's slightly better than the remakes from 1984 and 1998 version. However, there are still a lot of problems with this version including the fact that it has to be one of the most boring action films in recent years. I really can't count how many times I kept looking at my clock to see how much longer this thing was going to go on. There's a family drama thrown in to try and balance everything out but this too is incredibly boring and goes nowhere.I guess the worst thing about this film is also the best thing. The special effects are quite frankly excellent and once you doze off to the actual story, it's easy to just admire the work. For the most part the CGI effects really look good and especially the monsters as they come across very realistic and all of it blends in well with the real stuff. The various explosions also look very realistic but with this budget you'd expect that. Now, even though the special effects are great and the highlight of the picture, they're also a major problem. I really, really hated the look of the villain MUTO because it's supposed to be a prehistoric monster but instead it comes off more like a robot. For the life of me I couldn't help but think we were watching some sort of robots do battle and this here was just extremely disappointing. Even Godzilla comes across more like a robot than a prehistoric dinosaur. A real shame that as great as these monsters looked they couldn't have been more realistic.There's a lot of family drama thrown in but all of it is just as boring as the action. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the lead and isn't given much to do, acting wise, and after a while it just becomes laughable that he happens to be at various parts of the globe just as ""important"" things happen. Even the usually wonderful Elizabeth Olsen can't bring any life into the picture. Juliette Binoche has a good cameo but even Ken Watanabe is wasted in his part. The bad story is a real shame on two levels. One, it takes up way too much of the running time and it's simply boring. Two, had they not gone for this boring melodrama then perhaps we would have gotten more of the monsters.But, then again, that might not have been a good thing since the monsters are filmed through dark skies, fog and various bits of smoke. It's hard to ever get a great look at them. GODZILLA certainly has a group of fans out there but for me it was a complete dud.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
King of Monsters: Better than Ever,"Gareth Edwards brings Godzilla into a whole new realm of monster movie. His adaption is intense, well written, and most of all beautiful. Godzilla has never looked better. In fact, no movie creature has ever looked this good, (I saw it in IMAX, which I highly recommend). Godzilla and the other creatures are truly terrifying. The movie is less from the overall perspective of the monsters, but instead a perspective of the people. This idea initially got me worried, being the huge fan I am, but I could not have been more satisfied. Edwards did a great job of integrating classic aspects of the old movies to life all these years later. The action scenes were stunning and heart pounding. And to add to it all, the characters had real motives which brought a whole new realness to the Godzilla story. They integrated him into real history which was very clever, and made the whole situation quite believable. If you're a die-hard fan or just a movie lover, this will not disappoint. One thing is for sure, spend the money to see it on the big screen, it will be worth it!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Alpha Primate Ultimatum...,"I had been a fan of Godzilla ever since I watched the 1998 movie. Don't get me wrong, I was then 6 years old and it was one of the very few Hollywood movies that released at my place. After 10 years, when I had a second watch of 1998 Godzilla, I understood why it was panned so deeply. Still, that movie made me research through the Godzilla mythology and I was pretty much impressed. That's why I visited the movies for this 2014 take on the Alpha Primate. I must say, as a movie fan I'm not quite satisfied with it, but as a classic Godzilla fan, it was more than merry.The technical side is the most note-worthy on this take, since the creature design was so much rooted with the 1950 classic. The scenes which depicts the menace of Godzilla was nearly breath-taking, and the roar was something special. The design of MUTOs were also appreciable, and the CGI works and 3-D effects are also passable. At least, the 3-D didn't made me scratch my head.Considering the story side, it was a weak script, though pretty strong for a disaster movie. It wasn't a throughout smack-smash, or a 2-hour collision of the giants, but had a good human point-of-view over the subject, which takes me to the weak point of the movie.The acting section wasn't that bright. It had a good platform for the actors even though the concentration was on the monster. Bryan Cranston proved it with his charismatic performance. He didn't had a major part on the screen, but was a core element on the script and with the high-voltage sentiments and rage he portrayed the lone crusader for truth brilliantly. Sad thing was, nobody, including Aron-Taylor Johnson and Ken Watanabe, was that much competing. It made me to long for the creature sequences more. But considering the script and the director's intentions, the final product is an adequate one to pass both fans and casual users.As a final note, Godzilla is a classic incarnation of Gojira movies with appropriate human emotions. If you are a classic Gojira fan, never miss it. If you are a movie-goer who likes movies with a strong mythology, go give it a try.........",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A solid entry which takes the franchise back to basics in a whole new way,"Full disclosure: I was given my advanced screening ticket and didn't pay to see the film which may have colored my initial impression. That said...My first thought on leaving the theater last night was: Good, not great.Visually, the movie does what it does exceptionally well. There are a lot of very coolly handled transitions which use drastic perspective changes to change scenes and simultaneously handle the larger scope of Godzilla and the smaller scope of the individual characters. I'm still a firm believer, though, that 3d...even IMAX 3d, is the death of cinematography. 3d forces the viewer's perspective to an intended focal point in either the foreground or background, and as a result, everything else loses definition. I can't imagine directors or principal photography groups actually liking this technology and I'm continually surprised at how well received it is.Sound was well done from an effects perspective. There was absolutely nothing in the way of a score which was disappointing. The only thing that stood out to me thematically from a musical perspective was a drum heavy theme which they overused each time Japan was shown. I'm not certain that there wasn't other music present, but if there was, it was completely forgettable.In terms of plot, it was a Godzilla movie, so I don't think anyone is going into this expecting an Oscar-worthy screenplay, BUT the trailers set an expectation for me that the movie couldn't match. The acting was nothing special and a little over-the-top in some places. Cranston lent some credibility, but the novelty of his appearance wears off pretty quickly. Unfortunately, this film wasted Ken Wantanabe; I'm a fan of his limited work which I've seen, but he had nothing to work with in this script, and to call his performance wooden is a disservice to trees. AT Johnson is much the same, regrettably. I didn't feel that there was much to connect him to the audience, and instead, he becomes more of a vehicle through which to view the movie's world around him.Now, considering it is a Godzilla movie, the important part. Is the monster battle epic, and does it hold up? The answer is, like everything with this movie, a little of both yes and no. Personally, I really liked how they handled it. I felt the build-up and pacing made for a weighty climax with decent enough stakes to keep the audience invested. The director toys with you a bit though and teases a lot of the action from the perspective of the characters on the ground. The timing of these cuts serve as morsel after morsel of payoff, but after the third or fourth of these cuts, I started to wonder if the grand scale would ever come. Fortunately, in the end, it did come with 3 or 4 separate scenes giving the epically scaled battle the foreground and a couple welcome surprises that were contrary to some of the pre-release info which was making the rounds.Is it worth seeing? If you're a fan of the genre, yes. It has some of the campiness and charm of the series while still playing straight within its own construct. To me, this is miles ahead of the travesty that was Godzilla '98, but it lacked some of the cinematic flair and novelty that Cloverfield brought to the genre back in 08. It was way more digestible than Pacific Rim as well which should bode well for better overall audience reception.I'd go with a strong 7.5 out of 10 with a +/- of about .5 expected after a second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is One Great Godzilla Movie!,"Being a fan who used to go to the movie theater in the 1960's to watch all those great (and cheesy) Godzilla movies. This new Godzilla movie is the Godzilla movie I have been waiting my whole life for. Not that 1998 SonyZilla that was so disappointing. But this movie, I know that all the long time fan's like myself will watch it over on over again. I will go back to the movies next week to see it again. Can't wait for the Blu- ray. I honestly do not see what all the haters of this movie are thinking. It's a Monster movie. Plain and simple. For 2 hours I was entertained. I went today to the IMAX with two good friends and their son's and we all liked the movie. No spoilers here so I will not discuss what happens in the movie but I was surprised by a few things. But that is what Gareth Edwards wanted. Why disagree. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. When GODZILLA shows up I just have one word. AWESOME! This is the Godzilla, all of us long time fans have been waiting for. And the MUTO's are really cool too. It must me sad to go to the movies and come out mad all the time. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

A marvel to experience,"When it comes to iconic movie monsters, few others can come close to the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla. Director Gareth Edward's 2014 Godzilla film is the second time that an American studio has taken the reigns in an attempt to bring Japan's most famous kaiju to the big screen. Its predecessor in 1998 met mixed to negative reviews, but this update pays homage to the original 1954 Japanese film while at the same time modernizing the tale for a new audience.The film follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a lieutenant in the United States Navy who specializes in disposing of explosive ordinances. Ford's parents, Joe (Bryan Cranston) and Sandra (Juliette Binoche) work in a Japanese nuclear plant when a terrible accident occurred in 1999. Fifteen years later, Joe is a conspiracy theorist on the search for truth when he is arrested for trespassing on the remains of his old house, now a quarantine zone. Joe believes that it was not a natural disaster that took his wife, but some kind of creature that the government is trying to cover up. Now, believing that history is repeating itself, he embarks on a search for his old data, dragging his son along with him.While the plot of Godzilla is told from the perspective of Lt. Brody, everyone knows who the real star of the film is and the director took great care in portraying the monster in a positive light. The real threat to humanity in the film are two giant, insect-like monsters, called M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) who are attempting to meet and reproduce. The beast known as Godzilla is described by resident monster expert, Dr. Serazawa (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samuri) as a prehistoric animal who is ""nature's power to restore balance."" The director spends a great deal of time in the first act of the movie teasing the audience with the scaly hero, and it was a smart decision to build the tension and anticipation before revealing the beloved monster in a roaring crescendo of excitement.The human story in Godzilla is necessary and while not the most gripping, it remains entertaining enough that it doesn't seem to hurt the action. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) is the film's protagonist and the audience watches the story unfold from his perspective. Viewers will be able to get behind the Navy Lieutenant desperately trying to get back to his family and protect them, and also playing his part to save the world. Taylor-Johnson's performance, however, was rather thin and could have benefited from more emoting as opposed to the serious, blank stare he wears for the majority of the film. Conversely, Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) really steals the show as Taylor-Johnson's eccentric father digging for the truth. He shows so much emotion in his time in the film, that it's a shame that his screen time is cut rather short. Ken Watanabe is great in his role and conveys a sense of respect for the titular monster. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife Elle, spends almost the entire film worrying about the safety of her husband and son, but not much else.Edwards' decision to portray the monsters as animals fighting for their own survival helped keep an otherwise fantastical film somewhat grounded in reality. In addition to the breathtaking visuals, the score by Alexandre Desplat is beautiful, perfectly pulling emotion from the audience. Technically speaking, Godzilla as a film is a marvel to look at, hear, and experience.-Oliver Pascual www.mediumraretv.org",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Non-Spoiler Review,"Godzilla (2014) directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters) seemed like a very suitable choice in directing the Hollywood reboot. I watched Monsters and I thought it was kind of clever by establishing the creatures as background characters, that made them more mysterious in nature, but I don't think it works the same in a movie like this, because Godzilla has been an established character for nearly 60 years. Gareth Edwards had gone on to mention in several interviews that much of the direction of the movie had been influenced by Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975), building up Godzilla before his actual appearance and only showing glimpses of the creature before the final showdown. I felt the way it was handled only ended up hindering the overall experience. A lot of the screen time focused more on the human's like Monsters, but unlike Monsters, the characters were just not as interesting to follow. I felt as if the movie intentionally had starved us into being more appreciative of when Godzilla had appeared, to give us the impression that it was more exciting than it should be. Jaws had done the same, but there was an intensity behind it, not knowing where it was or when it would strike next. It's not a must-see, but it's something to watch if you have nothing better to do, just don't go expecting something deep like the trailers and a few people on this board seem to suggest. It is what it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Return of the King,"Godzilla is a familiar IP to me, like many others I grew up watching practically all of the Toho Godzilla films and was enamored by the spectacle of giant monsters fighting each other. Luckily this new American Godzilla production keeps the spirit of the original which is something that is a welcomed taste cleanser after the 1998 U.S film that left so many fans with disdain. This new film has a solid cast with Bryan Cranston carrying most of the emotional weight of the film. The design of Godzilla is great and keeps true to the Toho one but has been updated to make Godzilla structurally sound as a giant creature that could support itself. The monster fight scenes brought out the kid in me and did a good job of showing off the monster's scale in size, although these scenes are often cut short or viewed through a small television in the background. Though the majority of the characters are not too interesting and people may have a problem with the film's pacing I'd still say that this is an enjoyable film and appreciate the director and writers efforts to understand what the essence of Godzilla is about.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
takes too long before Godzilla comes in,"One of those over-hyped flicks of the year 2014 so expectations were high. Have seen it in 3D I only can say that I liked the 3D even if it wasn't that stunning like in The Hobbit franchise but it do works sometimes rather good. On part of the story itself it was okay but hey, shouldn't it be going all about Godzilla?Mostly you don't watch these monster flicks for the acting but you rather watch it for the monsters itself and there lays the problem. The main actor Godzilla itself isn't that much to catch in this flick, that's a bit sad because I was left with a hunger after one hour with the only question, when will he come? Once Godzilla is there the action really starts and the CGI and effects used are indeed okay but by then it's a bit too late. Don't misunderstand me, it's not a bad flick but face it, we are overwhelmed with monster flicks the last years (Pacific Rim (2013) for example) who are full of action between the monsters itself and that's what Godzilla is in fact all about, Godzilla do saves the world after all.It starts rather good with excellent performance by Brian Cranston we all know of Breaking Bad and I was hooked on the screen. But once we move further 15 years it just starts to become a mediocre flick. I wasn't alone watching it and all I can here was where's Godzilla?Still worth picking up if you do like flicks about giant monsters and naturally Godzilla lovers will have it in their collection but at the end of the day, it wont stick in your mind.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wait... Was that a Godzilla film?,"This film was awesome, the fighting kicked ass, the writing was solid, and the acting was emotionally strong throughout... But I walked out of the theatre thinking I watched something other than a film about Godzilla.Don't get me wrong, Godzilla himself looked great, one of the best examples of CGI this year to be honest (except for the weird reptilian smile he had going on), but I wish there was more of him. If I could I would rename the movie to 'Giant Slimy Moths' because they seemingly got more screen time than Godzilla itself. Other than that timing issue (and Godzilla looking a little on the chubby side) the visuals where seamless and a joy to watch.Immediately after the casting was released everyone was pumped for 'Breaking Bad' star Brian Cranston to play the role of a nuclear engineer living in Japan, and the hype was defiantly lived up to. Cranston truly can act and that really is shown in the beginning of this film, which is where he shines most. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character of some kind of super soldier really showed his talent towards the end but I'm sorry to say, didn't really excite me too much anywhere else (I still can't see him as anything else other than comic book nerd turned super-nerd). And lastly Elizabeth Olsen probably impressed me the most with her convincing portrayal of an emotionally lost, but strong and independent woman.Even if you don't enjoy action, go for the music because the soundtrack resurrected goosebumps all around my body and, not to be clique, sent shivers down my spine.As far as reboots go this film is up there in the stars, or maybe just above sea level, you'll have to watch it yourself to determine that.

Metaphysical Horror,"For the first time during all these years since the original ' Godzilla ' of 1954 I realise the first three letters of the title of all of them ' God ' really does have a meaning, and in a dreadful sense it is echoed in the banal Elvis Presley song ' The Devil in disguise. ' Two monsters in this film, both the natural forces of nature, are finally in combat. The direction of this premise is filmed mainly in a dreadful darkness, and the effect is one of metaphysical horror. One possible spoiler I must partly reveal is the fate of the woman acted beautifully by the actor Juliette Binoche. Quentin Tarantino apparently cried watching it; I was appalled at it. How life has little meaning, if anything, when confronted by the darkest side of nature itself. I do not want to give more away but to say that it is one of the most horrific films I have seen, and somewhere in the primal terror of it is Ligeti's ' Requiem ' an apt piece of the limit of music to be used. I commend the director for making these musical forces, and anyone who wants just sensationalist rubbish to avoid this film. If you take its premise seriously it could drive you mad.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A respectful if flawed interpretation that is nonetheless well made,"I can vividly remember the hype and anxieties surrounding Legendary making a new American Godzilla. Would they get it right? Would it be good? The result is a film that has the ingredients to be great although falls short in execution. The film's greatest success is in Godzilla's character, choosing to characterize him as a natural and eternal force of nature. While I'll always prefer Godzilla as a menace, for a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that meant to able to general audiences it works.Of course the human characters have been a point of debate for years. The ideas behind them are interesting although the actual execution is severely flawed. The first act does a great job in building up character and developing suspense only for the momentum to be lost with the removal of a certain character. It really handicaps the middle act although the climax is admittedly exciting and well done. Had the film not teased the action so much this probably would have been more forgivable although I do appreciate the restraint Edwards showed. The overall film is well made and has a grand sense of scale that makes one feel like you are truly caught in the midst's of the grand natural struggle. The film definitely has it's moments and I do appreciate this film for what it did as both a proper adaptation and as a good gateway entry for new fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Godzilla, Our Hero","This evening I went to the show and saw Godzilla. The theater had an 80% male population and 20% female population. So much for the demographics. I guess guys like monsters. Now onto the movie.Having lived through the big screen release of Jurassic Park and T-Rex, who scared the living daylights out of me, I was really looking forward to another OMG moment of closing my eyes out of terror. Unfortunately, I think I only had one ""holy crap"" pop out of my mouth during the entire movie. Perhaps I'm too old to frighten with make-believe monsters.The movie itself wasn't what I expected. The trailers are pretty spot on setting up the basis for the story. Whatever is down there, it's going to throw us into the stone age again, or so we are led to believe. As it progresses, other monsters emerge who received more screen time than Godzilla. After a while, I felt a bit cheated because I didn't come to see two other creatures get it on and lay eggs. I mean, they're not even that good looking. Sort of leggy, if you ask me, leaping buildings in a single bound. Of course, there's not much left after they leap from rooftop to rooftop.There were a few odd bits in the storyline, one being the captain of the naval ship who seemed to be calling all the shots and making the big decisions to save the United States. Only once did he get on that important red phone to confer with the President on nuking those nasty building stomping, lay egging monsters. Of course, he didn't listen to the guys who knew what they were talking about, telling him the chosen course of action was a bad one. No surprise there.As far as gore and blood, you won't see much. I don't think the movie carries the scare factor enough to leave nightmares behind. Of course, the special effects are a far cry from the 1954 version that I grew up with on television. Godzilla looks like the original big body, small headed monster we've always known. Only, you don't cringe when he shows up. In fact, the audience was cheering the big lizard onto victory. Instead of the terror, he is hailed as the ""savior"" of San Francisco. Hum, I think the religious right may balk over that thought.In any event, it's mildly entertaining. Godzilla sort of sounds like T-Rex, but without the bite. I did not see it in 3D - those progressive lenses I have just ruin the experience for me. The big screen without the 3D was just as much in your face with monsters, falling buildings, and roaring creatures.All in all, it's an okay remake with the cool new technology we have for film making. No complaints with the actors, they all did a fine job of saving the world and showing that they were at least scared to death over the nuclear eating monsters. San Francisco is a pile of rubble, and Las Vegas will never be the same. Such a shame all those casinos were flattened. Oh, well.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Epic is an understatement,"Godzilla is another attempt by Hollywood to revive the giant after Roland Emmerich's juvenile version in 1998. In a more pragmatic depiction, scientific experiments gone awry lead to menacing monsters being unleashed. These beasts are pitted against Godzilla, leaving the fate of humans in the balance.The latest Japanese gem to be reworked following success stories like The Ring and The Grudge, Godzilla represents a chance to resurrect the leviathan. The opportunity lies in the capable hands of Gareth Edwards. First and foremost, in his primary foray into blockbuster territory, Edwards excels in doing justice to the titular character.Godzilla is a force of nature, the biggest ever seen on screen, dwarfing many skyscrapers and laying waste to his surroundings. The belligerent behemoth's appearance and movement are a sight to behold. Furthermore, his iconic roar and colossal scales, exhibited by employing extensive CGI, complete his sinister look.The director clearly prefers building anticipation rather than front loaded action. His attempt at creating anticipation and a sense of awe is akin to classics such as Jaws and Jurassic Park, where the creature lurks ominously but still makes its presence felt. However, the director does entice the viewer with fleeting glimpses and references throughout.Also at his disposal is a coterie of enormous talent, such as veterans Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe and also emerging actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. The human characters are used as the focal point of the action. The makers place great value in establishing a sentimental element in the midst of all the decimation. Bryan Cranston is particularly effective as the doom monger and delivers the most compelling human interaction sequences.Undoubtedly, the highlight of the movie is that Godzilla is on a collision course with other monsters. The resulting encounters are worthy of the price of admission alone. Also, the spectacle renders itself well in IMAX screens.The story also pays homage to Godzilla's roots and legacy as a metaphor for nuclear proliferation. The writer's success lies in creating an aura of plausibility. As opposed to a ludicrous narrative, there is legitimate realism in the story.The production value of the film also shines through: the cinematography, sound design and score are all executed well to provide a haunting effect. However, flaws do persist in the movie. For instance, the acting is found wanting in particular instances in the absence of the action.Nonetheless, such failings are few and far between. All in all, Godzilla is a fitting tribute to the King of Monsters.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

TV monitors. If you enjoyed the movie, THE VILLAGE, after seeing the trailer for it, you will love this version of GODZILLA. If you really just pretty much hate Godzilla movies, then this is the movie you've been waiting for, because you won't have to worry about seeing him
much. The director cuts away to
something far less interesting anytime you think you're about to see him. If you could give the same crew and budget to director, Ed Wood, of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE fame, I bet even he probably could have made something more entertaining than this endurance test, that costs the price of a movie ticket. I still don't see how they messed this movie up so bad, but the problem started when they promised the audience things they didn't deliver...such as a giant radioactive lizard monster.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Most Satisfying Remakes of All Time,"Before I talk about anything about this movie I just have to say, Godzilla is the best giant monster/robot fighting in a city movie I have ever seen. Yes, it was better than Pacific Rim.Godzilla was definitely a must see movie this year. If you think its going to be like Godzilla (1998) then you our wrong, that movie was bad. This movie is just so awesome! Like in my other reviews I'm going to divide it up because I feel likedividing it up.Comparison from 1998 and the Original - Gozilla 1954 was one of the most famous classic movies of all time. And its a good movie especially for people who watched it in the 50s. Godzilla 1998 was bad and it basically ripped of every Jurassic Park Scene. Plus they made Godzilla look like a skinny, small dinosaur. This Godzilla is no doubt the best of them all. And if your like,""But the Classic ones are always the best,"" well then your wrong. Because you have to admit you didn't fall asleep as much as you did in Gozilla's 1954. So I have to say this is the best Godzilla film I have ever seen.Characters - First character I am going to talk about is of course Godzilla. How they made Godzilla was exactly what I wanted him to look like. He looks pretty accurate to the classic Godzilla which is good not like 1998 where he looked like a horrible CGI dinosaur. They pot rayed Godzilla so well in this movie, its almost like you can really see him stopping around your city. So i am very satisfied with how they made Godzilla. Mothra was actually in this movie. Mothra is actually a old classic character to and it was really cool how they put her in it. Yes its a she because the creature was pregnant at the time of the movie. That character was portrayed very well too, kind of reminded me of Pacific Rim aliens for some reason. Bryan Cranston did a very good job making the audience have feelings for him, he seemed to be very into his character. The problem was that he wasn't in the movie a whole lot instead Aaron Taylor- Johnson was in it most of the movie. He didn't seem to catch the audiences attention as much as Bryan did but he did a pretty good job at being in the movie because he had to. Also Ken Watanabe, who was the scientist, wasn't that much of a main character, but he did a good job playing the scientist because he seemed to be so into Godzilla and knowing about him.Story - The story was a bit long in the beginning but overtime it makes you grow excitement and eagerness to see Godzilla beat the living lives out of city buildings and gigantic monsters and this eagerness makes you love Godzilla a lot once he finally appears on screen. Then overtime the story gets pretty good and the scenes get you pumped up and excited and its a fairly, pretty good plot. The story about the monsters are also really good too but you don't get a whole lot about the creatures origins. Scenes/Action Sequences - Again, best gigantic Robot/Monster fighting in a gigantic city scenes I have ever seen. I thought it was better scenes in Pacific Rim just because the robots were quite slow and it wasn't as exciting as watching the flying Mothras beat the you now what out of Godzilla. Godzilla is just such an iconic character you just can hate fight scenes with him in it. I can't spoil about the fight scenes but I wish I could because they are so amazing, but trust me, when you see this movie, you're are going to walk pout of the theater saying,""That was Freaking Awesome."" Mainly the action scenes were what made this movie so good. No its not like Pacific Rim were its a awesome dumb robot fighting movie, this is an emotional awesome monster fighting movie right here. The monsters actually pot rayed some emotions which was absolutely great! Yes, the monsters devoted some heart into the film which really helped make this more than a giant monster/robot fighting Pacific Rim movie. Even with the humans there was a lot of heart devoted into the film with them.Pros And Cons -Pros -Amazing Action Sequences Great Plot and Story Developing Suspense Great Characters Superb CGI Animation Cons -Bryan Cranston is in the movie to little Long BeginningOverall - Overall Godzilla was one of the greatest satisfactions in a movie remake I have ever seen, because movie remakes are never really that good. I am satisfied, and if your looking for a good action packed summer film Godzilla is your #1 option. (A)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More Godzilla Himself Next Time Please!,"Long Story Short – The Cast - Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, and Co. do well with what there are given. There is a personal story of their characters, to go along with the Main Godzilla Crisis. Godzilla and the other creatures look convincing enough.My Qualm – Not enough Godzilla. You wanted to see more of him, and more of him fighting. The Directors and Writers no doubt tried to create the old time feel of the earlier Gozdilla movies, with the music, pace, etc. Just No Enough of the Monster himself!If there is a Sequel – Here is hoping that Ken Watanabe's probably most memorable line will be foreshadowed more - ""Let Them Fight"". Not Bad – Just could have been a lot better – 2 ½ out of 4 Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers with dinosaurs. Only better.,"Do you remember the hype and build up to Roland Emmerich's much-anticipated Godzilla in 1998? Do you recall the disappointment that followed? Did you catch the hype and build up to Gareth Edwards' take on the behemoth? Does it follow the pattern?The short version is yes. And no. Godzilla doesn't live up to the hype, it doesn't match expectations and, yes, it is mildly disappointing. But as for it being a let down, nope, not so much. Edwards, in his second outing as director after 2010's low budget blinder, Monsters, gives us a big budget B movie packed with effects that thrills and entertains even if it doesn't excite, terrorize and inspire awe in the manner we'd like. Part of that comes down to Edward himself. Monsters was such a fine, unexpected delight and he set the bar so high for himself that it was unlikely he could surpass it with so much of other people's money and the pressure and interference that presumably brings.The Godzilla aficionados will possibly find much to howl at, but for the casual viewer and happy bystander amidst the havoc wreaking there is much to enjoy here with the nuke-crunching prehistoric monsters. A little more backstory and reason is given for the emergence of Godzilla and his prey, and the human interest story is given a fair run with the relationship between scientist-cum-embittered-conspiracy-theorist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his estranged, cynical, soldier son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).Though Taylor-Johnson has come a long way since Nowhere Boy and makes a reasonable focal point, Godzilla hangs on the name of Cranston, the biggest 'star' on screen here. That comparatively little is made of Joe is something of a surprise and the greatest disappointment. The charisma he threatens to exude is wasted in a lack of screen time and Taylor-Johnson's Ford has neither the impact to be truly memorable nor the circumstances to really shine on this occasion.Godzilla is sprinkled with a few actors who deserve more, but Edwards wastes them, or rather doesn't waste time on them when he can focus on monsters ripping cities to shreds. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife, Elle; Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa; David Strathairn as Admiral William Stenz; Sally Hawkins as Vivienne Graham; none of them are allowed to really sink their teeth into their characters or dominate the screen. Hawkins is particularly wasted (and more than a little wooden, alas), disappearing for a vast chunk of the movie and reappearing almost as an afterthought as though Edwards suddenly remembered she was on the payroll. Not that I'd noticed she had gone AWOL.Yes, Godzilla is the star of this franchise, but then so were the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park series, but that didn't stop Crichton and Spielberg from making the human characters count for something.There is some lovely camera work on display and this is where Edwards' Godzilla really shines. Frequently we are positioned behind people or objects, jostling for a view of the monsters, our vision frustratingly blocked by heads and obstacles, placing us right there in the action and causing us to unconsciously move in our seats to look around the obstruction. But is it enough?Will you enjoy Godzilla? Think of it as Transformers with dinosaurs (and a smidgen of Alien) only better and if that grabs you, take a punt. Better still, take the kids. And stand by for the sequel.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla - The TRUE King of the Monsters is born...,"Godzilla has found a true admirer in Gareth Edwards. Someone who set out not only to envision a new future for Godzilla but to protect the previous Godzilla's long 60 year history, a man capable of delivering a Godzilla for our time. After seeing Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' it is my opinion that he has succeeded in mastering the vision for the monster that Tomoyuki Tanaka had in mind 60 years ago. Even though the original Godzilla will always be just that - the original, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is for me the first TRUE and complete representation of the vision of Godzilla. Executed in the most masterful of ways in direction by Gareth Edwards and in overall story by Max Borenstein. In delivering the picture that he has Gareth Edwards has completely put to shame directors such as Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich, Zack Snyder and the other go-to blockbuster directors. Injecting a surprising amount of suspense into this 'Godzilla' Gareth's Godzilla will have you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath in anticipation of what is next to come - something a Godzilla movie has not done since 1984. Unlike many of the reviews that I have read, I found the pacing of this movie to be absolutely fine, in fact I would have personally preferred a few more opportunities to catch my breath and gather my wits. Gareth Edwards has clearly given Godzilla the strongest opportunity for continued box office presence that he has ever had in the United States (although the burden of that task in my opinion seems almost insurmountable - and in all honesty - I would prefer to see this 'Godzilla' remain as it is, a superior standalone). A rebirth of epic (but not overwhelming) proportions this Godzilla harks back to the radiated and devastated scenes of Tokyo in Tomoyuki Tanaka and Ishiro Honda's original 1954 'Gojira' capturing with somber respect and sadness the human toll in stark contrast to most summer blockbuster movies in recent memory (especially 'Man of Steel' and 'Star Trek Into Darkness') Gareth Edwards and Max Borenstein can now rightfully join the likes of Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishiro Honda, Akira Ifukube and Eiji Tsuburaya as masters of Godzilla.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as everyone claims it to be..,"Did I enjoy Godzilla? Slightly. More so than I did Amazing Spider-Man 2, but then again that was a bad movie to start off with.1. I find Aaron Taylor-Johnsons character to be ridiculously redundant and unneeded. Most likely the only reason why they put him in there was because Hollywood needed an attractive Caucasian character to be the lead. His character is utterly ridiculous, with no goal or motivation. He didn't disarm the bomb, so him being an EOD was not relevant. He failed to warn his superiors that the female Mothra or Muuto is already going through gestation. The movie made it a big deal about how they were seeking each other to mate, once they joined up, their mating only involved the male giving the female a nuclear payload? She could've obtained that on her own.2. How on earth did they go from Japan, to a carrier, then take a helicopter back to Hawaii? Even military helicopters have a max distance of around 750 miles without refueling, the distance between Japan and Hawaii is 4100 miles. Even if the carrier was half way between Japan and Hawaii, they still wouldn't be able to make the distance on a helicopter.3. Why on earth would the Muutos and Godzilla go to San Francisco? There are no Nuclear power plants, so for a creature who feeds on radiation, they're going pretty far away from a food source.4. Ken Watanabe has ""studied"" Godzilla and the Muuto for decades yet know nothing about them. So his character was not relevant as well.The movie isn't worth the $10-15 that theatre charges, in my opinion it's only worth a $5 discount ticket. The acting was really bad, the only enjoyable moments was the 5 minute fight at the end when Godzilla just wrecked mothra like a boss.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A film that had so much potential, but flatlined.","I followed this film for several months before it's release and my expectations were sky high. What I was hoping for was a fresh new take on the original Godzilla film; a grittier, darker, and far more complex film. What I got instead was a cookie cutter military action film that horrendously segued into a pseudo super hero film.Unfortunately the ending of the film completely ruined it for me. The film blatantly asks the viewer to choose whether or not Godzilla is the hero, when in fact Godzilla is not a hero nor a villain. What Godzilla represents is sheer chaos and destruction; Godzilla is ""a force of nature"" and that's how things should be left off. Unlike the atomic bomb, Godzilla cannot be controlled by man, and the beast operates on it's own terms. Thus this is where the main problem of the film lies. The film teeters between this idea that Godzilla, somehow, is our savior, but for the first 90 minutes of the film the viewers are lead to believe that Godzilla must be stopped at all costs. But this problem mainly stems from the poorly contrived military plot.Which brings me to my second biggest flaw, which are the human characters. The only redeeming characters to the film are Joe Brody, portrayed by Bryan Cranston, and Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, portrayed by Ken Watanabe. Unfortunately their time on screen are severely lacking and any possible resemblance of character development goes out the window once we are introduced to the dry military portrayal of Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson.Instead of going the military/action route the film would have benefited from taking a more detective/mystery/thriller path, which the trailers so falsely advertised. But back to the subject at hand. The characters, besides the previously mentioned two, are dull and lack any redeeming qualities that the viewer can latch on to, which causes us to simply not care about what is happening to them. The film tries so desperately to establish a tone, but that's all the film does. There are no layers or complexities to the situations that are presented, which go hand in hand with the simplistic and boring characters.My third gripe about this film is that it struggles to identify itself. Is it a disaster movie? A hero film? A monster movie? A thriller? A horror? A science fiction? Well in case you couldn't figure it out, it tries to blend all of these different genres and more. But you often see that in military action films that strive to be more than what it is. If the filmmakers simply went 100% the monster/action genre route then the film would succeeded in delivering it's message and concept. Instead this film appears to have been bogged down by multiple script revisions and having too many hands at the wheel.And in regards to the elephant in the room, the film is advertised as Godzilla when it really should have been advertised as ""The People vs Godzilla."" Godzilla is only featured in about 20 mins of this 122 min film. While the human characters, excluding Cranston performances, are featured for a good 60 mins. Try to keep yourself awake during long dialogues between bone-headed military superiors and soldiers not listening to the scientists, a boring and shoe horned love interest and blah blah blah...Overall the film was over-hyped with expertly crafted trailers and advertisements to lead viewers, like me, to believe that this iteration of Godzilla was going to take this franchise to the next level. Like the name itself, Godzilla is a ""God"" like creature that does not play by mankind's rules, vice-versa, mankind must learn that Godzilla is something that we cannot control and we must adapt to live in his realm of destruction and chaos, essentially hell on earth. Godzilla is not a figure that should be labeled as hero or villain, unless that's the initial purpose. Taking cues from films such as Alien and Jurassic Park would have greatly benefited this film in the long run and would have established not just a franchise but a bonafide contender for many Summers to come.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Godzilla movie without Godzilla,"The marketing for this film was building up the tension and excitement that THIS film is THE Godzilla film we wanted to see in a long time. And... it disappoints. There was so little Godzilla in this movie, the antagonists MUTO was the main focus of the movie along with Ford Brody. All the characters are so one dimensional, Ken Watanabe is a typical scientist, Aaron Taylor Johnson is the Heroic character and seriously I cannot get emotionally invested into this characters because I do not feel for them at all even with the relative amount of screen time. Bryan Cranston,the one so heavily marketed in this movie, dies in the first 30 minutes or so, yet I still feel a connection towards his character because there is something more than ""Oh I'm a Nuclear Scientist! Stop Godzilla!"" motivation behind him. The fights between MUTO and Godzilla in the film, are always anti climatic, just as we are expecting a full on fight sequence but nope,screw you audience lets watch more of Ford Brody's Family or the Army taking the nuclear war head instead of that seriously almost made me fell asleep. That said though, the final fight between the Female MUTO and Godzilla was EPIC, my inner 8 year old screamed in delight. This IS WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR. Just because of the Roar and the fight makes the movie from a 4/10 for me to a 6/10. My final conclusion? Go see it if you are interested for a full 1 hour 45 minutes focused on a soldier. If not, save the money, wait for the the DVD release",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Better than Ferris Bueller's version,"Godzilla is a remake of the 1998 Godzilla film starring Matthew Broderick, which is a remake of the 1956 Godzilla: King of the monsters which itself is a reworking of the 1954 classic Godzilla directed by Ishiro Honda.Out of the above mentioned films the new Godzilla is definitely better than the 1998 version which was a disappointment upon its release. The new Godzilla goes back to the roots of the iconic monster, taking inspiration from the 1954 film in both its depiction of Godzilla where instead of keeping the story on Godzilla himself it instead brings the focus of the film to the people and how they are affected by the emergence of a giant radioactive lizard, the other throwback being the social commentary about the use of nuclear bomb, which I felt was cleverly updated to feel relevant today.In the film Brian Cranston plays a scientist who believes that something bad is going to happen as a result of nuclear testing done in Japan, but his theories are dismissed by the scientific world and he is called a 'crackpot' by others. It is only after monsters start appearing that his son (a bomb defuser for the navy seals) played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and others start to believe him, but by this point it is too late and the world has a couple of radio-active monsters to worry about.The film has a much more grounded take on Godzilla than the past films which is why the story is told through the perspective of the humans and how they plan to overcome the current disaster, which leads to interesting choices in terms of the direction of the film. Speaking of the direction I believe that Gareth Edwards direction is the highlight of the film and saves it from turning into something like Pacific Rim, the scenes in the film are very well constructed and I was particularly impressed by the introduction of Godzilla in a draw dropping shot.My main issue with the film would be the way Gareth Edwards teased Godzilla in two scenes where the audience believes they were going to see some monster fighting but the scenes just cut away to something less exciting, which I understand goes with the decision to make the film human based, but it does leave the climax underwhelming as it cannot live up to the hype that is previously established.I do believe that this is probably Godzilla's best American outing but it doesn't live up to the original Ishiro Honda version. This is definitely worth watching as long as you don't go in expecting to see only Godzilla destroying cities.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

7.5/10,"Before saying anything on the movie itself I have to talk about the expectations I had going in: as always I do not watch trailers but what I heard about them was nothing short of spectacular, plus the buzz surrounding this movie was incredible and on the top of this was a talented crew, both behind and in front of the camera, and Legendary Pictures, one of the better studios of the moments. You sum up all of this and you can understand I was very pumped for this movie, yet the result in relation to my expectations was just ""meh"". Don't get me wrong I liked it very much, but I can't deny it being a kind of disappointment. Talking about positives there are many things that could be pointed to: no one in their right mind would dare say this movie looks bad. Everything here is visually stunning, even the small-scale scenes are wonderful to witness and Godzilla and his fellow monsters felt very real, detailed and most certainly looked beautiful. Seamus McGarvey is a really special cinematographer. The cgi department here did a truly breathtaking job, even if there were a couple of shots that made me go ""huh that one was cg"", it is rare for a movie to have the quality special effects you find here. The film also feels very organized and grounded, so from a visual point of view there is lots of continuity. Credit to all of the actors too for making their roles perfectly believable, Bryan Cranston is definitely the highlight here the fact that he isn't in it enough actually detracted a lot of emotion. All in all there's just no way for someone to not have fun or be thrilled here: the money is spectacularly spent in amazing action scenes, add Godzilla and other monsters there and you'll only be excited by it. Quick shout-out to Alexander Desplat and his genius, with this he demonstrates himself as a very versatile composer and pays off with a riveting score. Where this movie fails is in drama and story continuity: on the first point there are small sparkles of interesting character moments, but on the wide scope there isn't enough for getting me attached to the people involved and this is probably due to some wasted time in the first act introducing the characters in very clichéd way (the time feels wasted also because the movie is 10-15 minutes too long) and to the continuous repetition of coincidences and situations that at some point I just gave up on. Talking about repetitions a minor problem I had with the movie, but kind of got on my nerves the more I saw it, was that the action scenes feel always the same in their introduction, they are all opened in the same style and other that being it a kind of clichéd style it was used for two hours and it really bothered me: the action scenes themselves are awesome, but it's the way in which they are introduced that I had a problem with. To the major fault of the movie: the story just did not flow spontaneously enough. There were way too many time where I asked myself: ""but what about that?"" ""oh yea? and where's that been the whole time"" and I went ""Really?"" so dam frequently. An example is when Godzilla (minor spoiler) breathes ""fire"", it was so out of nothing I simply didn't believe in it. Sure it is a iconic characteristic about the monster, but use it wisely or don't use it at all: it felt like a wink to the viewer that ended up being only annoying. Plus, I never fully understood the dynamics of the monsters, it always felt like the logic in it was about to fall a part. The character of Godzilla itself didn't really make much sense. He didn't bother with humans even if they tried to kill him, twice, but then he just leaves them. Very confusing. I don't declare myself a Godzilla fan at all, so I don't know if there's anything behind there, but it could have been easily addressed. Generally the problems I have with the movie are nit-pick, but when it becomes repetitive to a point of stress you loose me, nevertheless the direction was strong and the film was great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The greatest monster movie ever made?,"In terms of sheer awesomeness, hardly any other monster movie can touch this film. Everything about it is massive, and feels massive. This is what all serious monster movies want to be.I had very few complaints when watching the movie. None of the ones I usually had were in the film at all, like the military being completely incompetent or people getting killed by the monster by doing dumb things. It felt very realistic and everything had weight to it. Seeing it in IMAX only helped with this, the depth was fantastic.Godzilla was faithful to the original monster, and felt respected as Godzilla instead of just a big dumb monster. The designs of the MUTO's did seem a little out of place, but they did look great as well. A few scenes were very striking when they stood in full form, same with Godzilla.This was the first movie in a very long time to give me chills. I can't stress enough how massive everything felt.

Better then everyone said,"GodzillaWhen I first saw the trailer to this movie I thought ""This is Bryan Cranston's obligatory summer blockbuster following the success of a TV show role."" (Ex. Dominic West in 300, Deirdre Lovejoy in Step Up, Kiefer Sutherland in Phone Booth, Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness, Martin Freeman in The Hobbit) But, to my surprise, once I started watching the movie I realized that he was cast for a good reason, and not just to sell tickets. I thought he did a great job playing a man who is desperate for answers without looking too much like Hiesenburg. (Maybe it's the hair) And that's all I'm going to say about Mr. Cranston. He's not the main focus of the movie so neither is this review. The first two acts of the movie are satisfying. They were more suspense then action, but it worked well. The opening twenty minutes do a great job of establishing conflict and getting us to care about the characters, but they feel under-developed. I don't even remember the main character's name. None of the characters have an arch, but what do you expect from a summer blockbuster about a monster. David Strathairn's character felt displeasingly similar to his role in the Bourne movies. Overall, the acting was believable except for the unnecessary child. Fortunately, the kid wasn't involved that often, so it wasn't a major issue. Godzilla is shown sparingly and that's a good thing. This movie would have gotten really boring if they just presented Godzilla right off the bat instead of leaving an element of mystery to the monster. It was this choice that made the third act good. Not great; but good. The plane jumping scene was awesome but I felt like it was ruined in the trailer. I did like how they used the same music from the trailer. It helped capture the danger and uncertainty of the situation. I thought the monster fights were great, but the same couldn't be said for the parts with just humans in them. Their was one scene that involved gasoline (people who watched the movie know what I'm talking about) that made no sense and left me feeling frustrated. I thought that the cable news parts were annoying and were clearly just used for exposition. The CGI was impressive and there were only three times were it took me out of the story, but all three of them were during quiet moments so I didn't mind too much. My biggest complaint is the way the movie dragged on. I felt like if the last five minutes were cut out, and the end was left to interpretation, then the movie would be that much better. However, Godzilla was still a satisfying film. It was everything I thought it would be plus a little more, and it was able to sustain legitimate tension throughout the second act. I anticipated giving this film a 6/10 but this movie was a little better then I expected. I'm giving Godzilla a 7/10. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an entertaining summer action movie without superheroes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mindless fight between two monsters,"This is my first Godzilla movie. I'm honestly a bit disappointed.I'm not sure about the plot, it just seems to be weirdly engineered towards a battle between Godzilla and these other monsters, but meh. All those scenes with the soldiers really bored me and the main character had almost no personality. I also feel like there are many plot holes.The best parts were in the first half when they discover the mysterious beings and try to begin giving some explanations. But besides that there is almost no plot.The sinister end-of-the-world mood is well displayed but after 40 of repeatedly the same stuff, it just gets bland and boring.So yeah.

An honest Godzilla fan review,"After my first viewing of the movie, I must say I am satisfied, not only as a movie goer, but more importantly,as a long time fan. Most of the plot points involving the human characters are familiar, but welcomed. Bryan Cranston steals the show in all the scenes he is in. The rest of the characters are fairly simple, with the exception of Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who you can say is an expert in monsters.The human drama at times does seem to override the action. The movie teases you with action which sometimes can be effective whereas other times you feel sort of robbed. However, the final act is something to be witnessed. There are moments where your jaw may hit the floor.The most important thing to keep in mind when going to see this movie is that if you are looking for another ""Pacific Rim"" with nothing but senseless action, you will be disappointed. This film is based more in realism and goes back to Godzilla's roots.Overall, this movie is heavy on the drama but still packs a punch, even though you may wish you could get just a little more Godzilla. It is worth every penny. The King of the Monsters is back ladies and gentlemen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Monster Fail,"I had to do something else less important so decided to watch this with half an eye to save time. Even that was a waste of time as I got nothing from it at all in nearly two hours.

And some highly paid film critics actually praised this – all I wonder now is how much they got paid for their misleading recommendations. The only good thing is it kept a lot of talented people in a job, including the highly paid critics too I suppose.It starts fairly well as a Close Encounters rip-off, a man and his son trying to get into nuclear power station the brass hats have put out of bounds claiming ridiculous radiation poisoning for some lying inexplicable reason.

The remaining ninety minutes drag by in grimy darkness, with admittedly great sporadic cgi cartoonery – although there were far more stretches of dark with only farty noises which reminded me of the great Fred The Oyster and other sound effects from the Goon Show. Apart from periods of incoherent messiness the character, monster and plot development was nil; at least in the original Godzilla everybody and everything was cardboard and more real. My own favourite was Godzilla vs King Kong, what was yours? This sentimental-macho techno-hokum may be pleasing to the psyche of modern Japanese viewers but personally bring back The Prince Of Space or The Neptune Men anyday.Did I mention the dark griminess, only broken by the depressing dysentery green of everything? John Wayne made Iwo Jima look like Paradise compared to this non-splendid vision. It's probably the worst film I've half-seen for ages, doesn't do what it says on the tin, and may leave you with eye-strain.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good start, good effects, but shallow and weak story","Godzilla is almost like 2 films in 1. There's this gritty, emotional beginning with very good acting and generally nothing to criticise. Then it moves into phase 2 which is great special effects but the acting and dialogue was left at the door. It's almost like Michael Bay usurped the production crew about 1/3 of the way into the film.OK, so you probably heard that Brian Cranston is in this film and he is great as you might expect. His character's son, played by some dude who might remind you of Keanu Reeves only with less talent, simply pales in comparison. The problem for the film is that it is the son who is the main character. He was so bad that, on the drive home from the theatre, I was unable to recall a single one of his lines.Whereas the first part all make sense - and even threatens to be intelligent as we get various concepts and scientific notions tossed our way - whilst at the same time endears Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) to the compassionate viewer, the second part of the film abandons all logic and reason as we track Ford Brody (some dude) and the army as they make bad decision after bad decision along the way in a series of forgettable and clichéd scenes until we finally get Godzilla in all his glory.Godzilla truly, though, is glorious. The special effects are excellent with only the occasional iffy moment. If you are watching the film for Godzilla, then you will not be disappointed.Unfortunately for the rest of us, it does appear that this was scripted just when the writers went on strike? Sorry, I'm just speculating as to why 1/3 of the film is very well written and the latter 2/3s of the story/script is appalling.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Acting is subpar but special effects save the film,"Godzilla 7/10- We all know that the 1998 Godzilla with Matthew Broderick was a total train wreck and a pointless remake doing nothing except attempting to copy the original with no success. Now, since I have not seen all of the original Godzilla, I will not make any comparisons. Having said that, the 2014 Godzilla is a good stand-alone film that features near ground breaking special effects plus top-notch acting from supporting actor Bryan Cranston.Aside from the acting from Bryan Cranston, the rest of the acting was sub-par at best. Then again, Bryan Cranston is a great actor and anyone who is compared to him in this film will be put to shame, so I will try not to be too harsh. Still, I expect the other actors to at least try their best and it seemed apparent that in some of the scenes that demanding good acting, they did not.The plot was hard to follow at times, but that may be because the trailer was not bad, but misleading and has you searching for a different path while the movie keeps giving us all of these twists and turns. What I liked about the plot though is that Godzilla was not the only monster, he was not the only possible antagonist. In terms of choosing those types for the other antagonists, I felt like they could have done better since giant mantis looking dinosaurs are not very appealing, but this is all just my opinion.I will not go over much of the acting since most of the movie is special effects, but I would like to give a couple spotlights. Bryan Cranston, as I said before, gave a powerful, literally astounding performance that owned every scene he was in. I was a little worried that he would not be able to set himself aside from Breaking Bad, but no need to worry, he is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now and he shows that in this film. Aaron Taylor- Johnson did nothing special in this film, but it is hard to blame him since he was in the heavy special effects scenes. The only performance I really did not like was from Elizabeth Olsen because she just did not sell the role of her being a loving mother and wife, the same with Aaron Taylor Johnson in terms of father and husband as well. They are both very young though so I think it would have been smarter to either get older actors or to have the couple but not the kid. The rest of the cast did average but again their is only one Bryan Cranston.Now we venture to the best part of the film, the special effects. WOW, that is how I describe the special effects, WOW. I have not said that since Avatar. Just the shear size of Godzilla is something that really leaves in audience in awe. Then adding two other dinosaur/monster characters to the mix really gives the action scenes a lot more depth. I do not want to spoil the part that the entire audience agrees is the highlight of the film, but trust me the final part of the film, the final action is so good that this part alone is enough to see the movie.To put it simply, a lot of tremendous special effects with some fine acting with Bryan Cranston makes the movie very enjoyable to say the least. I definitely recommend Godzilla as your choice going into the theater if you want to see top-quality action film.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A wonderful return too a monster forgotten!,"This, ladies and gentlemen is the Godzilla i always wanted too see. It mixes a great story, with some great characters(Although some did feel a bit underused) and some awesome monsters! While Godzilla's screen time can feel limited too some, the moments we get are more than enough too make up for it! The characters, and how the monsters affect them is also great, and all the monsters themselves do feel like they have a personality(As much as creatures like them can have). Again, sometimes ideas are passed by and characters left unused, but the everything else this movie follows enjoyably well. Its nicely paced, although some moments could have been quite a bit longer. An overall great, enjoyable film.8.5/9 out of 10, check it out!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A good Godzilla film...but at the bottom of the good.,"I am by far a very dedicated Godzilla fan. I own every film in the highest format available and have watched them all plenty of times.I went into this movie excited, it looked RIGHT. The trailers were giving me a tone I could dig an I was interested to see what they did with it. Interestingly the trailer lured us all wrongfully on purpose which was fantastic! This interpretation of Godzilla goes back to an older way of looking at him, that of sort of an anti-hero. The concept is that instead of being created by the Atomic Bombs of Japan years ago, Godzilla is instead millions of years old and basically Earth's way of keeping the balance tipped away from other giant monsters (assumingly because back then, giant monsters ruined everything). In this sense, it's very reminiscent of the Showa Era of Godzilla. Which is where its weaknesses lie.This film is just as slow, if not slower, than the Showa Era Godzilla films. There's a lot of (uninteresting) human character story, a lot of fight teasing, and just a very small amount of Godzilla until the final climax. Which would be fine except for two things. Firstly, the climax still doesn't give us enough giant monster fighting for my taste. Other Godzilla films, even if they have a heavy focus on the human element through the film, give us a climax of about a straight 10 minutes of nothing else happening except Godzilla kicking butt. This film STILL kept cutting back to the humans while everyone just wanted to see Godzilla vs. Muto.Secondly, while it's VERY comparable to the Showa Era, that is my least favorite era of films.Don't get me wrong though! It's still a GOOD Godzilla movie and all around a good movie. It's fun, funny, entertaining, at times jaw dropping and adrenaline pumping. It's well made and belongs right next to all of the Toho created films. As my title says, it's absolutely a good Godzilla movie. Without a doubt! I just would rank all of the other good Godzilla movies over it.Definitely check it out and see if you may like it more than I do!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You've Seen This Story Before.,"This movie was so disappointing on almost every level, that I've taken the time to leave my first review.If you are rating this movie on CGI effects, it's a 9/10. Some of the effects are pretty stunning, and the line between CGI and real life is thread thin.But story wise, it's a dead 2/10, simply this is nothing that hasn't been done before at least ten times. It's the age old, (MAY CONTAIN SPOILER) - white male in his prime, who won't listen until it's too late. The general who doesn't listen until it's too late. The savior that was going to save the day either way, but would have been easier had you not tried to intervene.-I really wanted to like this movie, I had been looking forward to this for months, which is maybe why I'm being so harsh on it, but my expectations weren't that high. There is too much missing from this, too many half stories told, too many short-cuts on fight scenes, terrible ""monster"" fight choreography when you do actually get to see it and you draw an emotional blank when trying to relate to anyone in this movie, because they aren't real characters.A poor age old story with stereotypical characters, no real twist or anything surprising, predictable outcomes and an impressive CGI performance to help draw a subtle explosive curtain over the lack of depth.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Its awesome,"I saw this movie last week, i am completely satisfied. I never ever liked Godzilla because, i don't like monster film(unless Jurassic park part1). But this movie impressed me with its CG work. Even though i am not completely satisfied with the emotions they are trying convey. Because the war is between MUTO and military organization. But after the Godzilla started to fight with MUTO, we can feel the struggle. First time ever i prayed that the monster should not give up. The dark tone for the movie gives some other impression. The new look for the Godzilla is amazing. However, after the there is so many unanswered questions is there. Overall, it was good movie with some minor flaws.worth a watch",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mindless action that survives on the CGI...,"At least it was better than the 1998 version. But it is still not really a memorable movie. It is a little bit too much in terms of taking an iconic Japanese movie monster and exposing it to the glamor of Hollywood.The story is fairly consistent to the Godzilla universe; the massive reptilian Godzilla comes out of hiding to do battle against another equally massive otherworldly creature.That was basically it, so don't sit down to watch ""Godzilla"" with the expectations of being intellectually challenged or stimulated, as that is not going to happen. This is pure and simply one of those movies where you just unhook your mind, sit back, and enjoy the pretty colors on the screen (well, not really colors, but the CGI effects).And of course, the American army is fearless in the face of such a clearly overpowered foe, but halters not in their approach to take on the threat to the American way of life. It becomes a little bit too cliché.What this movie survives on is the effects without a doubt. And hats off to the CGI effects team, because they really pulled it off quite nicely. The creatures were very impressive to look at, and very life-like as well (well, as much life-like as massive monsters would be, I assume).I enjoyed the visual destruction of buildings and everything throughout the movie. And they hadn't been stingy on those. There is a lot of mayhem in the movie, but surprisingly little casualties given the enormity of the structural damage dealt in all locations that the Mutos and Godzilla were. So that was a little bit too Hollywood there with its political correctness.One thing that I was missing was the iconic screech of Godzilla. They weren't really anywhere near that in sound or spirit. And let's face it, you can't have a Godzilla movie without his trademark screech.""Godzilla"" is an entertaining movie for what it is, a mindless CGI galore, and it is perfect for one of those days when you just want to do nothing. 6 out of 10 stars from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watch this movie if you love monster fights,"It was a powerful monster movie. The monster fights were truly amazing placed after the patient teasing buildups. But we didn't get to see the amazing entire Godzilla much. It shows up only in the end of the movie. Rest of the time we see his legs or tail or face. and many times his back while swimming in the ocean, which looks like floating mountains. The MUTOs were really brutal. But I wonder why were they walking in the city when they are able to fly. And why the male MUTO travels around just to hand over the female a nuclear missile. In the end Godzilla just goes in to the ocean and swims away, which I think was weird. During the whole movie I was thinking MUTO is this powerful. They aren't able to fight with him. How will they save themselves from Godzilla. But the end was unpredictable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie is dumb and incredibly boring,"OK, first review, I never meant to post one, but after this I HAVE TO :-D I liked Cloverfield, Pacific Rim, ... but this is just a total mess.

Some Monsters walk from one nuclear facility to the next and break some stuff, that's it. Nothing and no one to care about. You might say ""Hey, it's Godzilla!"" Sorry, no excuse for wasting my time like this. Midclass FX, a step above modern TV Shows, not more. Dumb dialogue. A few (!) decent shots. I mean: 160.000.000 $? Really? What for?

Thank You for Helping to Erase the Memory of Godzilla '98,"It was about 17 years ago when I saw a huge 30 story poster of Godzilla gracing a building in San Francisco. So much money was spent on that movie and it went on to bomb.17 years later, with much fanfare less the 30 story poster, Godzilla is revisited. This time San Francisco would have a role in the movie, not just a role in publicizing the movie.Godzilla 2014 definitely was more dramatic and more intense. Of course we all paid our money to see Godzilla do what Godzilla does best: breathe fire and destroy cities. We were treated to that and we got to see Godzilla more akin to the original other than the muscular slimmed down '98 version.Godzilla was much like a video game I saw years ago. It may have been a Sims game in which the backdrop was a city and two monsters slugged it out laying waste to the city. In this movie the backdrops are Japan (of course), Hawaii and San Francisco. If anyone is pleased by the destruction of San Francisco then you would be very delighted to see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So Godzilla was saviour in the movie!!!!!!,"Godzilla is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. It is a reboot of the Godzilla film franchise and retells the origins of Godzilla in contemporary times as a ""terrifying force of nature"".[5] The film is set in the present day, fifteen years after the unearthing of two chrysalises in a mine in the Philippines. From the pods come two giant radiation-eating creatures, known as ""MUTOs"", which cause great damage in Japan, Hawaii and the western United States. Their awakening also stirs a much larger, destructive, ancient alpha predator known as ""Godzilla"", whose existence has been kept secret by the U.S. government since 1954. It stars Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston.

The big atomic lizard gets another make over.,"Back in 1954 Ishirô Honda introduced to the film world Gojira, a creature that is still today seen as viable cinematic interest. Gojira, in spite of being a man in a rubber suit monster movie, is a smart and feisty film. Tapping into an oppressive nuclear age via moody atmospherics, whilst simultaneously imbuing plenty of creature feature carnage, it got the balance right. The makers of Godzilla 2014 have tried to do the same, they look back fondly to the original wave, pay it respect, but sadly they don't quite pull it off.Plot essentially finds the world under attack by some Kaiju (MUTO) monsters after humans keep dabbling in all things nuclear. The end is nigh, that is unless mankind can find an ally in Godzilla, an almighty prehistoric type lizard who itself is a product of some prior nuclear shenanigans.The human plot strands feature the usual secretive government suits mixing with science guys, all looking worried or running around in a fretful state. There's a father and son axis – with the son a bad ass army guy who has a loving wife and child back home. Characters are many, and they take up a good portion of the film, unfortunately very few of them are interestingly written, which is a shame given the pic is packed with acting talent.It's a two hour plus movie, with the build up being very prolonged, with Zilla not showing up till the hour mark. This renders the main monster as a bit player in its own movie, a mistake often made by others in many a sequel to Honda's original. There's also the irritating fact that what all good Zilla movies need is a shed load of monster mayhem, plenty of smack-downs, but sadly they are in short supply here and are often rendered as background staples. Until the finale that isIt takes a long time to get there, but thankfully saving the pic from below average hell, it's not a let down. It thrills and opens up the eyes and ears considerably, and fans of all things Zilla will get goosebumps upon the arrival of the charge and breathing of nuclear fire sequence. But with that comes the annoyance that the good technical craft within the piece has previously been used sparingly, the decision to put bland characters at the forefront instead of cinema's most famous monster proving to be a huge error.Maybe, just maybe, it's time to let sleeping atomic lizard's lie? Or of course there's always Kong to join the fray for franchise steering purpose... 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla plus seven,"The ""Monarch"" series on Amazon Prime has been a good bonding show for my son and I, so I thought it might be a good time to rewatch Gareth Edwards franchise reboot, that begat the (increasingly silly) monsterverse that has followed. I had my problems with ""King of the Monsters"" which followed and think that the continual teasing of seeing both Godzilla himself, and the fighting, is a much more interesting way to go.A Japanese Nuclear plant disaster, which claimed the life of his mother, is investigated by Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his father (Bryan Cranston), who believes the accident is a cover up. They discover that the site of the accident, is now home to a gigantic cocoon, feeding of the nuclear fallout, and about to birth a gigantic insect like creature. Monarch, established in the 1950's has been secretly studying the history of giant creatures, since discovering a giant lizard creature named Godzilla. Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that Godzilla will try to kill the creature, to maintain his dominance on the planet, but struggles to convince the army of his idea.One thing that this series has never struggled for, regardless of who is directing, is beautiful visuals. This set the trend with some wonderful cinematography. It's a wise move to keep the creatures themselves out of the limelight, particularly when they're fighting as, particularly in the sequel, it does look like two skyscrapers banging into each other. It's a ballsy move from a confident filmmaker.Performances are pretty good. Taylor-Johnson plays the oddly hapless Brody, who stumbles from one disastrous encounter to the next but provides an interesting way of bringing us into the narrative. The films other great controversy, at the time, was the relatively early departure of Bryan Cranston from the story, having been part of the advertising. He's good but it would have seemed even more convoluted to have him keep stumbling into the creatures' way, when it's (just about) justifiable for Brody to do so.I'll have to rewatch the rest of the films in the series (and I am planning to) but from what I recall this is the highpoint of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""Let them fight!""","Not having been able to go out to the theater too much last year, this was one of many films that I missed then but am catching up on now. While it wouldn't have made my top 10 for the year, this was definitely one of the best monster/disaster movies I've seen in recent memory. The story follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson), a Navy bomb disposal expert, who travels to Japan to get his father out of some trouble. His father used to work for a Japanese company, but after a cataclysmic event 15 years ago the area has been quarantined off, yet he still thinks that there's something going on besides the official story that it was a natural disaster. The ""thing"" actually turns out to be a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that they've been keeping contained. However when it escapes all hell breaks loose, and chaos and massive destruction ensue. Of course, you might be wondering where Godzilla fits into all of this. Despite the title of the movie, Godzilla only appears on screen for about 10-15 minutes. Still, the those precious minutes are worth it as he takes on the MUTO. One thing I appreciated about the film was that it didn't overexpose the monsters, instead letting the human drama take center stage. You get to spend time with the characters you'd most identify with, and the effects of a disaster were dealt with in a very realistic, down-to-earth way, even amongst all of the chaos and destruction. In fact, there was quite a large human cast such that I'd almost wish they'd delved a little deeper so that more time could be spent building things up. The worst offender is probably the prologue which set everything up. It was very effective in establishing a baseline, but not so much in terms of character building. Of course, all complaints aside, all of the performances were excellent. I just wish there had been more Bryan Cranston. In terms of visual effects and spectacle, this film stands head and shoulders above everything that came out in 2014. Scenes of destruction and mayhem were handled very well, and the creatures were also very well-animated. I should also mention the outstanding score by Alexandre Desplat, which hit all the right beats and fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Overall, I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't see this on the big screen but it was still an exciting viewing experience. It pays attention to its human characters and while the monsters don't take up too much screen time, when the action comes it delivers big time. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights, and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments, it surprisingly works quite well.","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)It's not easy to start off a new cinematic universe. The first installment must be an undeniable success on almost all fronts for the franchise to take off. From interesting world-building to delivering a good first film, it's a brutally challenging task for any director and writer to take on. Godzilla has been around forever, but Warner Bros. And Legendary Entertainment bravely brought on an inexperienced filmmaker, Gareth Edwards (Monsters), and a debutant screenwriter, Max Borenstein, to handle yet another version of the Godzilla story. Expectations-wise, I know that audiences look at this type of movie from an action-heavy perspective. A massive majority of the viewers just want to see monsters fighting, which is understandable. I enjoy a big battle as much as any other moviegoer, but I do desire a remotely decent story. When it comes to this particular genre, I don't ask for an Oscar-worthy screenplay that leaves me floored by the end of the film. I don't need incredibly complex, multi-layered characters with exquisite motivations. I don't even mind heavy exposition as long as it's not overdone and sluggish. With that said, I also don't want the most annoying, cliche archetypes nor nonsensical plot points. I genuinely hate myself when I get too nitpicky with ""movie logic"" issues, but when the characters make the most ridiculously absurd decisions that no sane human being would make, then the film is really asking for a negative commentary. Borenstein - who goes on to co-write two of the following three installments in the MonsterVerse - gets close to a perfectly balanced narrative, which in this genre is related to the amount of screentime allocated to humans and monsters. This movie can't just be Godzilla fighting a random monster since the visually appealing, constant battles would lose impact with time (besides the lack of a story), but it also can't waste all of its duration with the human characters - after all, the film is titled Godzilla, not The Brody Family. Audiences all over the world enter their respective theaters to be blown away by the action, visuals, score, and be thoroughly entertained by titans punching each other to death. Several characters carry surprisingly compelling arcs, especially Ford and Joe Brody. The father-son relationship between Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kickass) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) feels authentic, with both having a common unsolved problem from their past that links to the King of the Monsters. The emotional attachment to this family elevates the dangerous sequences that the movie holds throughout its runtime. Cranston offers an undeniable commitment to his role, while Taylor-Johnson demonstrates some of the talent that would later be discovered by Marvel. Ken Watanabe (Inception, Batman Begins) is a fantastic addition to the cast as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, a scientist who fortunately doesn't follow the formulaic development usually thrown at this type of character. Elizabeth Olsen (Oldboy, Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine, Happy-Go-Lucky) also get a bit of screentime, but they're basically just ""people close to the important characters"". Gareth Edwards admittedly loves the Godzilla lore, but any viewer can tell the great care that both Edwards and Borenstein have with their characters. More screentime is handed to humanity than to the monsters, which will undoubtedly disappoint many fans. While I do feel invested in the protagonists, too much time is spent with the military, where countless exposition scenes drag the overall narrative. The suspenseful build-up to the climactic third act is efficient, but the action is frustratingly hidden from the viewers. Most of the titanic battles are seen through the windows of a car, train, building, or even TVs. The main problem with the film isn't spending time with humans when the monsters aren't fighting but choosing to remain with these characters even when Godzilla and co. Enter the scene. Titans are fighting right behind the camera, and they keep the audience either entirely in the dark or just partially show a section of the battle. Most of the shots are ground-level, usually showing the POV of a certain character. While that brings a higher sense of danger and desperation to the screen, it also generates a frustrating feeling in the audience who's not seeing Godzilla fighting in its full splendor. I understand that part of this decision might be related to some less polished VFX, and in all honesty, despite the rare wide shots of the monsters, the action is definitely entertaining and quite riveting. Alexandre Desplat's score is vibrant, and the actual monsters look gorgeous in the purposefully dark environment (helps to hide visual imperfections), especially Godzilla. Godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights, and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments, it surprisingly works quite well. As the first installment in the MonsterVerse, Gareth Edwards and Max Borenstein deliver an incredibly compelling story on the human side, fully developing the main characters and handing them interesting arcs. Most of the runtime is spent with these protagonists, which will undoubtedly disappoint some fans who crave the titanic battles, but the suspenseful build-up works in favor of the climactic third act. However, choosing to remain with the humans when the monsters are already fighting in the background is a questionable decision that leaves an extremely frustrating feeling in the audience. Cast, visuals, and score seem to hit the right notes, but the actual combat is rarely seen in its full glory - most of it is shown through a ground-level character's perspective - partially due to the necessity of hiding some VFX imperfections. Still, it's an utterly enjoyable monster flick that sets up a pretty entertaining cinematic universe. Rating: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Monsterfest,"An entertaining monsterfest well suited to the big screen. It doesn't focus to tightly on the monsters allowing for some real suspense to build between action scenes.

"""King of the Monsters"" returns for another shot at the big screen.","When you consider that this Japanese Kaiju creation, which, translated into English, literally means ""strange beast or creature"" was Japan's response to the destruction and devastation in the aftermath of the atomic bomb leveling Hiroshima and Nagasaki, any remake (or, reboot, to those of you are hip to the current terminology presently in use) seems irrelevant in 2014 and on. SPOILER ALERT: Yes, Warner Brothers is planning on a follow up sequel. Still, director Gareth Edwards and screenwriters Max Borenstein (screenplay) and Dave Callaham (story) have done their best to retain the spirit of those films back when ""Godzilla"" was King of the Monsters rampaging and stomping through an already downtrodden Tokyo. How and why ""Godzilla"" (back in the day when ol' radioactive breath was brought to life through suitmation, スーツメーション) would eventually become a celebrated champion capable of committing giganticide of any and all post-atomic mutations threatening Japan is a process which most creatures (the Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, et.al.), emerging from mere legend must undergo before passing into popular folklore. So, I suppose for this reason more than any other, the fact that talk of a sequel currently in the works is a good thing, because, ""it's good to be the king""!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Really needed some decent actors! 6/10,"Review: I'm in 2 minds about this film! For a 2 hour film, you don't really see that much of Godzilla until near the end and the big showdown at the end was a bit difficult to work out. I liked the intense drama throughout the movie but the director got rid of the decent actors really early in the movie so your left with these B actors who look puzzled and confused most of the time. It really needed someone like Will Smith or Channing Tatum who could have brought some wit and action to the main character. The sets looked amazing and realistic, especially when the director pans out so you can see the total destruction of the city, but I was really disappointed with the corny ending. In all, it's a watchable movie which is entertaining and we'll put together, but they really need to get some decent actors if there going to come out with a sequel. Watchable!Round-Up: The main character, whose played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, is mostly known for the Kick- Ass franchise so he was a weird choice for such a massive film. Personally I don't think that he was the right choice because he didn't really bring that much emotion to his character but thats just me being picky. Bryan Cranston played his father well and he brought some intensity to his role, especially when he was watching his wife through the door (trying not to spoiler), but there wasn't any other actors that stood out in the film. With all the attention to detail on the scenery, I wasn't that impressed with the look of Godzilla. He looked very plastic/rubbery which was surprising for this day and age. Anyway, it's definitely an epic movie which will look brilliant on a big screen and sound great with massive speakers, and judging by the movies takings, this is definitely a concept which will always be popular with Godzilla fans.Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $525million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there epic movies about Godzilla taking on some nasty creatures. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla rules!,"Not bad at all considering the fact Godzilla only appears after an hour! Wish we could see him longer. I didn't care about the human characters. They either die too quickly or don't do much throughout the film. David Strathairn was good as the Navy skipper though (he reminded me Sam Elliott minus the mustache). But when the monsters show up, hell yeah! It's a wild ride and Godzilla really kicks butts. I like the fact that the two MUTO look like rejects from Cloverfield and it's sweet to see Godzilla showing them who's the real boss. Because let's face it, Godzilla is like John Wayne. There can be only one! Forget about the version made by Rolland Emmerich.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Guys...,"This is the same old movie made from the same mold. It's no different from a Godzilla movie from 50 years ago or from some of the worst Jurassic Park sequels. The build-up is very slow, the creatures design is copied and pasted. There's a trite and useless family sub-plot, make no mistake.Some months ago I watched Cloverfield for the second time after ten years, and man, that was a terrifying, modern Kaiju movie. Years have passed, and they still make these old-school movies, all with the same plot. At least, the Godzilla from 1998 tried to stun the audience with updated effects, some (bad) humor and the ""size matters"" refrain. Instead, this work from Gareth Edwards is flat and dull even in the action scenes. I didn't like Edwards in his awful ""Monsters"", but this is even worse.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
King of the Monsters,"""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people cried; most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture; Vishnu takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" J. Robert Oppenheimer Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Rises, Super 8, Iron Man 2, Watchmen. For the last five years there has always been one film that I was anticipating more than others. Some films on that list I have enjoyed more than others but none have given me the ""wow"" factor that I had been seeking when leaving the cinema. Walking out of Batman in 1989 as a 6-year-old and showing the first flickers of an obsession with those characters that continues to this day. Leaving, the Cinema, having seen Jurassic Park and genuinely wondering why anyone else would ever bother making a film again because it would never top that. This year my attention on the year's releases was focused squarely on Godzilla. I have never been a massive fan of the original Man in Suit Godzilla films. I have enjoyed some of them and been surprised by the heart they convey, owing in part that the movies were originally made as a criticism of American nuclear weapons testing. However, my enjoyment of these films was hamstrung by the poor, often laughable, effects. I have always been a fan of giant monster movies but much like the horror genre, it is hard to find a genuinely good one. Pacific Rim was amazing for those few moments, during the scene in Japan, but otherwise left me flat. And the less said about the 1998 version of Godzilla the better.So with my excitement at fever pitch, but with the trepidation of someone who has been hurt before, I sat down to watch the latest incarnation of Gojira. Within the first five minutes I would have a smile on my face that would not leave me until long after the credits had rolled. Put simply, it is a masterpiece of event cinema. When Gareth Edwards was announced as the director, I felt it was an interesting choice. I had mostly enjoyed his debut feature Monsters but was curious if his talk heavy, light on action independent film was due to budget or if that was his preferred style. The last Indie darling to be handed an iconic monster movie was Ang Lee and the result was the daddy issue snore fest that was Hulk. Edwards does not make the same mistake. Here he creates some of the most jaw dropping scenes that have ever graced a cinema screen. Monster Vs Monster smack-downs (no Godzuki, sadly), and entire cities being leveled. He holds nothing back. Godzilla's full reveal is a lesson in suspense. There are half glimpses of various parts of the creature to tantalize and tease before we are treated to a full shot of the king of the monsters. This is not to say the director has chosen style over substance and this is clearly evident in his choice of cast. Forgoing the A-list name above the title actors and instead assembling a cast who treat the material with the seriousness of a Shakespearean play. Bryan Cranston has emerged from Breaking Bad as one of the best and most in demand actors in the game right now. Here, he adds a heft and heart to his role as a man racked with guilt over his part in a family tragedy. The scene with Cranston helplessly looking on as he is forced to make an impossible decision with regards to his family shows him at his brilliant best. Watching him devour the screen every bit as much as his 350ft co-star is amazing. To think, if it weren't for Walter White, one of the great acting talents of our time would have been forever known as Malcolm in the Middle's dad. He is supported by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick Ass) as his son, with the vehicular sounding name of Ford Brody. Elizabeth Olsen plays Ford's wife Elle and adding to the Jaws homage, their son is called Sam, which is Quint's first name. The two will be seen together again next year as the super siblings Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age Of Ultron. To say too much about the plot would ruin perhaps the best event movie since Jurassic Park. The movie does not skimp on story and never descends into a clichéd man Vs. military/America-is-awesome that so many of these films tend to do. At its heart there is a real message about man's interference with nature, with a chilling reminder that at any time Mother Nature can remind us that we are the ones under her control and not the other way around. The monster himself is a beautiful design, paying homage to past incarnations but definitely one they have made their own. He feels real and every roar and step is felt. There are moments when his eyes alone convey more depth and emotion than a million Kirsten Stewarts. One moment in particular, showing almost a glimmer of understanding between man and beast, is beautifully understated. Capturing in one moment what the recent Amazing Spider-Man 2 failed to do in the cringe worthy scene with the child. Overall, the film is an undoubted triumph and one that needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. IMAX 3D has always seemed somewhat gimmicky to me, Gravity being an example of one that worked in that medium but does not carry its resonance over to the small screen. However, I don't see Godzilla having this problem. This will be a film I will be re-watching for years to come. Step aside Cloverfield, back to the ocean with the Kaiju of Pacific Rim and as for King Kong, as the song says ""Whats a King to a God?"".The true king ofthe monsters has reclaimed his throne.

Better than I thought,"Godzilla was a lot better than I originally thought it would be. From the CGI, characters (human and monster) and surprisingly story. Sure there were some bad points like some of seemly wooden acting but the overall of movie more than made up for. And Godzilla was great. The filmmakers managed to capture a perfect image of him. Reminiscence of the earlier Japanese films. I didn't think this movie would be any better than the one that came before but the director had a vision of what and how to create a movie fans of Godzilla have been wanting to see. It basically made me forget about the other film 1996. My only complaint is not enough scene time, but when he was on scene. It was awesome. When comes out on DVD, it's going right in my collection.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Looking at the monster from a different perspective,"So for starters if you have watched the earlier version of Godzilla (1998) then I must first tell you that its not anything like the that movie. That movie had an appropriate blend of Godzilla, and the actors, with everyone sharing ample movie time. This new version takes a different angle and tries to show us something that we would not think of when we first sit down to watch a monster movie.The movie's not a bad one. It just takes time to set its thrill and action running. Little heads up: You need to be very patient with this one. The actors have done a good job esp. Bryan. There is not much of role of Ken Watanbe in this movie.The CGI effects are too good. The devastation and the fights are very much entertaining, not to mention the x-factor of the Godzilla, its roar. My god I am a huge fan of that roar, its simply the best.Go watch this movie with not much of expectations like good story telling, suspense, actors that were fulfilled by the earlier Godzilla. Some people with a flair of plenty of action and a tendency to get bored by lots of dialogs during the movie might get bored at times. But it's definitely worth a watch. After all you are going to see a different image of Godzilla.Enjoy the movie for the enormously beautiful CGIs, cities getting destroyed, and most important the ROOOOAAARRRRR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good, but not great","It was more about the people than Godzilla. Acting was pretty good and the plot was acceptable. Effects were great and there is plenty of action and drama. But not nearly enough monster action. It does at least avoid the silliness that ruined many of the past movies. No ""boulder volley ball"" or ""monster kung fu"" in this one.And since they were doing a CGI Godzilla, why make him obese? Seriously, he was fatter than the rubber suit version. I prefer the classic Godzilla over the ""Iguana"" from 1998, but they had a chance to make him look better and they absolutely did not. And their presentation when he finally uses his nuke breath was out and out lame.My son and I arranged for an extra day off work to see it. We were pumped and excited after watching the trailers. We left the cinema a bit disappointed. The movie does not come close to the hype leading up to its release.

Definitely worth watching!,"I just watched this movie today and wow this film is amazing! We finally got a true American Godzilla film! Although this film does have its flaws. The main problem I have with this movie is; it focused too much on his enemies and it didn't feel like Godzilla was the main character. It definitely needed a lot more Godzilla! Also, the story and the character development was a little bland. The trailers make out Bryan Cranston to be the main character but he doesn't even have much screen time which I was a little disappointed with. Apart from it's flaws, this movie had a lot of good things about it. The battle scenes were outstanding! The CGI was very well done.

split-personality: mainstream vs art,"I can enjoy both mainstream and arty films, as long as they're well-made, have a clear vision of what they want to do, and don't ruin it by including too much rubbish. Can a modern blockbuster combine both mainstream & arty principles?This Godzilla, actually the first Godzilla flick I've seen, has artistic ambition, however this ambition is fumbled by several tired disaster-movie clichés, especially the two-dimensional characterisation with shallow family-emoting. The main guy is miscast, probably the least memorable protagonist since the terrible Pacific Rim. Other clichés:no one listens to the respectable scientist until it's too late.destruction of famous landmarks.generic music (with a notable exception).reliance on dark colours to hide dodgy FX and artificially create tension. The monsters looked dull.the military central command resorting to the bomb-option.the main character via plot-contrivances becoming key to events.The entire movie also lacked humour or eccentricity. Dry as a bone....so far, so meh.What makes Godzilla worth watching is the occasional foray into artistic film-making. Some camera angles are striking, the use of sound was very immersive and that one time Ligeti was used was a special highlight. If the whole film had that vibe, we'd be talking about this like we talk about 2001 or Alien.Alas, the artistic vision didn't quite win out over the mainstream formula. This clash didn't do the film any favours as there was less tension or awe than there should've been for an event-movie like this. The movie having a split-personality makes it feel unsure of itself. It didn't go all-in one way or the other.Still, there's just about enough here to warrant a watch for those looking for interesting disaster/monster movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Possibly the best Godzilla movie?,"This film is possibly the best Godzilla film to date, instead of going for an all-out Kaiju movie, it spent a fair bit of time (maybe a bit to much time) developing the human characters that gave us an entirely new perspective on Godzilla. I believe that Godzillas visual design in this film is quite possibly the best we will ever see, the jagged spikes that go along his back make the colossal lizard seem more realistic and natural, and they did a very good job with scaling Godzillas height by putting him next to large buildings that give us an idea on how big he actually is, instead of outright telling us. The things that they could have improved on is giving Godzilla and the M. U. T. Os more screen time and more battles to keep the watcher engaged.

I think they should start bringing more older monsters into the series because everyone wants more Godzilla and if you don't go watch that B rated movie the Purge and have good dreams. Also, Godzilla fans, I liked the rock em sock em robots in Pacific Rim even though only one actually could fight all the monsters.

Return of the King,"There is a scene in Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla"" that made my skin crawl. It is the HALO jump sequence, promoted heavily in the teaser trailer, accompanied by György Ligeti's hair-curling orchestral piece ""Requiem"", made famous in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" when Dave Bowman entered that portal. The sight of minuscule soldiers falling down into apocalyptic clouds as they see destruction all around them with gigantic, moving shadows is a work of terrifying, spectacular beauty; one of the best recent film sequences I've seen and heard. To experience it in IMAX 3D adds to the nightmare fuel.Some other startling bits involve numerous disaster sequences that so closely echoes various natural disasters of the past decade. Viewers may be reminded of terrible events like the tsunamis and earthquakes of 2004 and 2011 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Scenes like these will definitely strike a chord in those who fear mother nature's wrath, but of course they play second fiddle to the real star of the show, who like Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"", doesn't show up until the latter half of the film, but one can definitely sense its brooding, commanding presence.Yes, 60 Years since it laid waste to Tokyo, the King of the Monsters triumphantly returns to the big screen after a 10-year sabbatical in this mammoth-sized entertainment that shifts the Big G into summer blockbuster territory, obliterating Roland Emmerich's turkey into smithereens.Like last summer's ""Pacific Rim"", ""Godzilla"" features gigantic-scale action set-pieces and crowd-pleasing moments, though in large part due to Edwards' skillful and intelligent direction, it entirely eclipses the latter film. Edwards (in only his second directorial feature following the 2010 microbudget ""Monster"") probably felt the same thing a lot of people did in ""Pacific Rim"" - too much action sequences that were dragged out for the purpose of pleasing its core audience. He is wise to limit Godzilla's appearance until the second half of the film, and even so limit his presence until the explosively entertaining climax, taking a page or two from Hitchcock and Spielberg's ""Jaws"" about restraint. The film was made with a ""spectator"" point of view - the audience sees Godzilla as if they were really seeing him, be it the TV screen or while avoiding the unrelenting chaos around them. Edwards didn't just learn from Spielberg as much as he pays a glowing tribute ala J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"". See if you can spot the references to ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters"" in this review. There's even references to ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", among other movies.Not that it isn't a real film. Whilst ""Pacific Rim"" is a film tailor-made for fans of the kaiju/mecha genre, in the same mold that most Marvel superhero films and 'Expendables' films cater to their target audiences, ""Godzilla"" is made like an old-fashioned blockbuster, down from its gripping, foreboding opening to its doom-shrouded action-packed climax that provides a well-earned catharsis to the ominous buildup from the previous 90-minutes. The action sequences are a combination of the classic kaiju franchise with the ominous Biblical paintings of Gustave Doré, especially in the final 30 minutes. Seamus McGarvey's tactful cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's brooding, wildly unleashing orchestral score complement some truly awesome visual effects perfectly to make for the most visually stunning outing of the King yet.Not that there isn't a plot. Max Borenstein's screenplay details something too spoiler that even the mere mention of the basic plot will give away too much, so I won't But the trailers do a damn good job about hiding the true plot of the film, which I must say is formulaic on the human characters' side, but pretty well-written and frenetic for the most part.Oh right, there are other cast members in the film too, all A-listers, ranging from a brief Bryan Cranston giving a combination of Roy Neary and Walter White, Ken Watanabe looking as wise and mournful as the great Takashi Shimura in the original, and a military David Strathairn giving heavy-duty exposition as usual. Add Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and Elizabeth Olsen as obligatory female characters and we have ourselves a heck of a cast that is severely underused. But we didn't come to see a Godzilla movie for a cast surely deserving of an Oscar Bait film. Pretty much the only human who takes center stage is tough, stoic military vet Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of ""Kick-Ass"" fame), who defiantly holds his own against all odds and comes off as a character who demands attention as to what his next plan of action is as chaos rumbles all around him.Bottom line is, I liked what I saw, and Edwards has done a truly bang-up job resurrecting the King of the Monsters from cult fascination. If possible, watch it in IMAX 3D to savor the visual effects and sheer scale, and to hear that famous, mighty roar in terrifying rumbles. It's been a long time coming, but the King is back, and the monster movie is replenished with a vengeance. Would Toho/Legendary mind if I request a future outing?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Godzilla could achieve higher marks if the icon appeared more often, without so much drama and with more horror scenes, but it is a great experience","Godzilla appeared in 1954 as an elegy for those killed in the 1945 atomic bombs. The new American remake of Godzilla tries to honor these two sides: it is much more dramatic and serious than ""Circle of Fire"", for example, but it still offers the rewards cathartics that fans of tokusatsu (""special effects film"") expect. After the character's first original appearances, we noticed that the character stopped being treated as an uncontrollable and unbeatable threat, to assume, under standards that we can better understand, a post of ""anti-hero""; a kind of natural protector, from the monstrous balance of nature to changes in the pattern of terrestrial fauna. Considering the conceptual root for the creation of the Atomic Lizard in the final stretch of World War II, it is impossible to dissociate the many meanings of this genesis for any other post-1954 kaiju production.Based on the Japanese film of the eponymous character and a reboot of the Godzilla / Gojira franchise. This is the second film about Godzilla made by an American studio, the first being the film from 1998. The film recounts the origin of Godzilla today as a ""terrible force of nature"", this new version opens the so-called MonsterVerse, a monster movie franchise that also includes its sequels ""Godzilla II: King of the Monsters"" and Godzilla Vs. Kong, which is due to premiere in 2021 and serves as both ""King of the Monsters"" and the 2017 movie ""Kong"": Skull Island "", also part of the franchise.Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) raised his son alone after the death of his wife (Juliette Binoche) in an accident at the nuclear plant where they both worked in Japan. He never accepted the catastrophe and fifteen years later he continues to mull over what happened, trying to find something. explanation. Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), now an adult, is a US Army soldier and desperately needs to fight desperately to save the world population - and especially his family - from the gigantic, unshakable and incredibly frightening monster Godzilla.From his first feature, Monsters, director Gareth Edwards brings his knowledge in visual effects to imagine a world where the passage of giant creatures, while causing disasters, does not seem spectacular: they are monsters different from those of alien behavior or cornered like that of Cloverfield; here they treat the land as their habitat, and the environment is shaped by them. It remains for humans to conform. In this reinterpretation of 2014, written by Max Borenstein (based on a story by Dave Callaham) we have the basic homework already included in the opening credits, a smart choice of direction to fix in the viewer's head the natural relationship that this animal has with the planet and how much the Atomic Age created, awakened or increased the destructive potential that nature keeps hidden somewhere. Legendary Pictures' ambitious production, together with Warner Bros., makes this second version an exciting journey of survival and attempted natural balance. There is hopelessness inherent in this condition, and it is from there that the film elaborates its sense of gravity and drama. It is as if humanity has always been doomed to be lost.
Superhero, monsters and catastrophes films are self-explanatory. And Godzilla fits perfectly into the last two categories. Except for details that differentiate the plot, even slightly, Godzilla films must have the giant lizard invading cities and causing destruction. And this is no exception. However, the story is conducted in such a way as not to offend the viewer's intelligence. Are there clichés? Logical. In fact, how to escape them in a film of the genre? Are there half-hearted scientific justifications that could not resist a more demanding sieve? No doubt. But, let's face it, in a monster movie, who in their right mind is concerned with the legitimacy of explanations? Whoever goes to the cinema to see Gojira basically wants only two things: a monster that is big enough to be very, very afraid, even if we are safe in the chair; and a lot of destruction caused by the monster. And if there is a fight between monsters even better.With a new vision of the franchise in this ""Godzilla"" in hand, filmmaker Gareth Edwards tried to pay homage to the various visions given to the character over the years, not only in the persona of the creature shown on the scene, but also in the narrative itself. It is a pity that this tribute ends up taking itself too seriously, although it is this same seriousness that ends up sustaining the efficient first act of the projection. Interestingly, the script manages to keep our attention by the simple criterion of growing threat. The soundtrack draws attention to the epic, the danger, the horror and the editing and mixing of sound create the necessary environment to leave us terrified, waiting for more disasters. Not only does Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack somewhat resemble that of John Williams at times, but the sound design also stands out by avoiding punctuating all scenes with the soundtrack, making great use of silence (a dramatic feature that is unfortunately underused, especially in blockbusters). Creating the necessary tension to amplify Godzilla's triumphant appearance.
Throughout the projection, we see that Edwards and Borenstein try to combine the buzzwords of catastrophe films with those of Japanese kaijuu features, playing clearly to the audience with the elements of the latter. The problem is that there is not a perfect mix between these ingredients, which ends up swelling the production a little, especially with the excess of characters' characteristic of the two genres that appear during the projection, which are either little developed or suddenly abandoned, being this especially true in female roles, with Elizabeth Olsen and Sally Hawkins criminally wasted on screen. When Bryan Cranston, the common man who becomes obsessed with tragedy, is left out, his place as a provider of scientific dialogues is taken over by Ken Watanabe, who is the chief scientist at Monarch. In this, the human scenes end up centered on Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is not exactly a well of charisma when compared to Cranston, Watanabe or Godzilla, the real gimmick of the project.While the action sequences starring Johnson fall into clichés, those that focus on monsters always call attention to creativity, which ends up frustrating the public even more with the filmmakers' insistence on turning their attention to Ford, who should have taken on a supporting role in the narrative after the introduction of Godzilla, but ends up participating in some scenes that could easily be omitted without creating prejudice with the audience's identification with the human. There is no mistake in the monster's appearance taking an hour to happen. The slip is in not delivering to him, from this point on, the role of protagonist of the tape, especially considering the direction that the story takes. The cuts of some of the clashes between the creatures during the second act end up irritating instead of generating expectations for the climax of the tape. The film's redemption is in its third act, when finally, the current generation begins to understand why Godzilla has not lost his majesty. Even with the monster's heavy movement referring to the movements of the old films of Ishirô Honda, when he was lived by an actor in a rubber suit, he shows himself threatening and wild, executing his classic blows while attacking his equally monstrous and gigantic enemies, with one of them, winged, alluding to Mothra, one of Godzilla's classic opponents.And let's face it, the text's treatment of MUTOs is very good. The kaiju have a rule regarding this type of extra appearance, so there is nothing new or bad treatment of the animals in the film, nothing that we have not seen in the first three interactions of Godzilla with other creatures, namely, in the fights against Anguirus in Godzilla Attacks Again (1955); against the iconic gorilla in King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and against the cutest and deadliest moth on Earth in Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964). Thus, when the plot points to a clash between the monsters and not a fight essentially against humanity, the work, which was already quite divided, breaks down completely. The human side loses any impact on the viewer and our attention turns only to what really matters, to what is very well treated here: Godzilla hunting and, in the end, facing the MUTOs.It was really to be expected a dark and pessimistic tone, dark photography and real touches, without comic relief as a monster movie should be. In this respect, Godzilla fulfilled its goal: a technically perfect production, whether in effects or in camera settings, without that Cloverfield hustle and bustle. He also scores points for his dramatic and violent style, for the competent cast and, mainly, for the social criticism related to the current world, different from the fears of the 50s: ""The arrogance of Man is in thinking that he has control of Nature... and not contrary. "", In the words of Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, a character present in the original film. The result of all this effort could only be satisfactory. Perhaps Godzilla could achieve higher marks if the icon appeared more often, without so much drama and with more horror scenes, but, in any case, the monster lived up to expectations and was well represented for 21st century viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"I was really excited to see this movie and it was a good build up but honestly I was a bit disappointed by it. It was not exciting, it did not keep me on the edge of my seat. I actually stopped it about half way through because I wasn't interested in it anymore. One of the only reasons I gave it a 6 was because the film looked great and the animations of Godzilla were great and I loved Bryan Cranston being in it since I love Breaking Bad. It think I was being generous giving it a 6. Other than Bryan Cranston the acting was a bit cheesy and made me laugh at some points. The movie never really pulled me in. I found myself reaching for the remote to change to a different movie after the first quarter of the movie. It was kind of boring and nothing really exciting happened. Even if something happened at the very end that was exiting it wasn't good enough to keep me watching it that long. If you are a lifelong Godzilla fan you might like this movie more than I did but overall it's not a must see movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fresh, big, and bold","Following the astronomical failure of the 1998 American Godzilla movie, there was a lot of uneasy feelings surrounding this film. It almost seemed like it was going to make the same mistakes of the 1998 film. It was another American version and Godzilla was CGI again. However this film is, thankfully, dramatically better. One of the biggest reasons for this movies success is in large part due to Gareth Edwards excellent direction. Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of the ""boots on the ground"" type of cinematography. Where the film is shot almost like a documentary. Most of the shots are only from angles that normal humans would be able to get.Inside of buildings, up from the street, and on top of skyscrapers. Again, I usually am not a fan of this style but for this film is actually works very well. Since the major threats of the film are three gigantic monsters this technique helps to give you a sense of realism. It makes these huge creatures have a sense of presence and scale.Being able to see how large these creatures are from a human angle really shows how monstrous they are. While Edwards hasn't shown that he can be a great director yet he has shown with the few films he's made that he understands how to give CG a sense of presence.Filming them mainly at night or in large cities. My favorite part of the film though is it's sound design. Whether it's the thunderous crashes of the creatures footsteps or the intimidating roars they emit, each sound is unique and well designed. Being able to associate noises with the specific monster further helped them feel like they were actually there.It was clear that the majority of the film makers time and effort was spent here because the story is pretty eh. It was difficult to get into things when our main character could remarkably go any where the monsters were. Sure he was in the military so a few times it made sense how he could be there.The problem is the entirety of the story revolves around these creatures. It follows them around to each area they go to. They wreck some stuff and then go somewhere else and repeat. Usually this boring, under developed plot would aggravate me a lot more than it did here.The main reason it didn't was because it never begs you to care about what was going on. It knows what it is and has fun with it. It gives a reason for it being in the place that it was and then showed you some awesome carnage. Because that's what you paid for right? To see these cool beasts throw down.Many will argue that the creatures didn't have enough screen time but I thought they were used just right. Showing them to much would have hurt the immersion of the film and to little would have made this very boring. But they were used just enough to make them intimating every time you see them. ​ Obviously this isn't a perfect film. It's thin and sometimes a bit uneven but it's strengths far out weigh its weaknesses. It's fun, big, and bold. It creates a great atmosphere and doesn't beg for you get into the story. This makes it very easy to get sucked into the film and have a blast watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, but obviously could have been much better..","Having been a fan of Godzilla and in general monster movies (like the ""Gamera"" ones et al) I was really looking forward to this incarnation. Recalling back to the pre-internet, before DVD - even before VHS, days..you had to meticulously comb your local ""TV guide"" for a chance to see once of these late night or early morning weekends.Now over all I found it pretty entertaining, but had a lot of holes in it where it probably could have been much better.First the movie sort felt like it took it self too seriously. Maybe the idea here was to capture the essence of 1956 (USA) version. Where you are sort of a bystander to the story, seeing it from a third-person point of view.To it's credit it captured other parts of the spirit of the movies like where the in the progression of the originals Godzilla is the hero. Also the acting and choice of actors was well, except I don't feel Ken Watanabe was the best role for a ""Dr. Serizawa"". In the original Serizawa hard this dark, sort of maniacal edge to him. After all he was some sort of scientific genius, and thus would be geeky/nerdy, with that weird edge you would expect.Where I think the movie ultimately fails to it's potential was too much of this third-person view. In all of the Godzilla movies I've seen (most if not all of them) more of the focus was on the fights and interactions of monsters. It was one of the thrilling parts. Even being limited by the SFX technology of the time (rubber suits, detailed miniatures, etc.) one of the more interesting aspects. In this movie very downplayed.Also part of the Godzilla experience was about character. You could see Godzilla had this personality, human like emotions, etc. He showed intelligence other then say just animalistic. Severally lacking in this movie.Finally another classic part of the formula this movie misses out on is Godzilla's interaction and affinity for children. In some of the movies you would see a young (in the 8 to 12 year old range) boy talk with and be be bonded buddies. It connected this kind of special understanding, sincerity, and innocence of the child's point of view. A connecting of fantasy and reality and adding more of a personal/human touch.As I write this I feel more and more that the creator's vision of this movie was fairly out of tune with what is/was really great about Godzilla. As if they should have studied more and could have consulted fans of the originals for advice, etc..In the end is was entertaining and worth watching!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very disappointing,"I understand that this is a film about Godzilla, and the masses buying their tickets want to see cities and landscapes smashed to a million billion bits. In this respect, Godzilla 2014 delivers outright. But there's no reason we shouldn't get a decent story as well. As soon as we see the eponymous creature, the humanistic side of the film descends into chaos. The characters are one-dimensional, the script is terrible and I can barely remember any dialogue. In addition, I couldn't help but note how intrusive Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack was. Gone is the tense, choral subtlety of the film's trailer and we are instead treated to Hollywood-standard booming orchestral pieces that actually make the monsters less terrifying.But on a positive note, Godzilla himself was absolutely gorgeous, and Edwards bravely waits almost a full hour to unleash him in one of the best unveilings of any cinematic character of all time. It's mad to think how an entirely digital creation can become the emotional centre of a story. And someone definitely deserves some kind of award for the film's sound design. It's just a shame that Edwards loaded the film with walking clichés, while forgetting to give show-stealer Bryan Cranston anything to do. Very disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love this film...,"Compared to what seems to be the new Marvel Cinematic Universe of monster mash ups, this one from Edwards is a lot more down to earth. I absolutely love this film, and it is completely underrated. Just like monster movies of old, from Cloverfield, the Thing. Jurassic Park and Jaws, the essence of mystery and surprise is present all throughout this film.I don't understand how this film is rated so poorly. Scene for scene, this movie stands on top when it comes to the monster movie genre. There is a horror in how powerful and massive these titans are, and this movie truly makes us feel like it's hopeless.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Monster is Fine, The Story on the Other Hand","I love monster movies, I love disaster movies. What I do not care for is the bait and switch as Godzilla turned out to be. I'm not a fan of spoilers so I didn't ""research"" this movie and went to see it just based off the media blitz, previews and honestly the fact that it was Godzilla! BUT, this movie is not about Bryan Cranston being a scientist against a radioactive monster. This story isn't about Godzilla attacking Tokyo. This movie has nothing to do with the previews. This movie is a pseudo love story that constantly takes you away from the action to watch a less interesting love story between unremarkable characters that the movie creators didn't deem important enough to be in the majority of trailers. This movie wasn't about a monster or the actors I expected. The graphics are top notch, the cinematography is on point but even the awesome monster scenes (which are fine) cant redeem this bait and switch tale.

the monster should always be the star!,"The problem with this movie is similar to many big budget monster movies in that it fails to recognise that the monster is the real star attraction, instead this movie decided to concentrate on the human aspect , it fails miserably as the characters excluding cranston and watanabe aren't appealing in the slightest. In regards to the action it also fails. The monsters in my opinion look incredible and wish there was more of it, unfortunately as soon as it starts to build up it cuts to the humans again and completely kills the tension. I don't hate this movie, it is watchable, but don't watch pacific rim and think you are going to get more of the same, the flip side is if you hated pacific rim you may like this.on another note this movie is leaps and bounds above the previous godzilla film and there are signs the filmmakers are fans of godzilla (atomic breath is awesome)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla: Inert Actors and a Middle-aged Monster,"It was in 1998 that Godzilla last dared to invade American soil. That last endeavor proved to be a critical disaster. Come on! Matthew Broderick's silly, bumbling scientist, and a very un-Godzilla-like mutant lizard! The only thing familiar was the famous roar. Of course, seeing Manhattan's skyscrapers destroyed, in the then new CGI, was pretty impressive. But, other than that, it wasn't Godzilla! In director Gareth Edwards' 2014 version, downtown destruction is spare; heart-pounding action is tempered; and the King of Monsters plays only a supporting role in the film that bears his name. Perhaps ol' King G has hit a point in his sixty-year-long career where all he has to do is show up, shoot some scenes in which he knocks down a few buildings, and fights a couple of monsters (with some rather unsatisfying collateral building damage). Despite putting on a few extra midsection pounds (even movie star monsters get midlife pudge), he still possesses the iconic name that makes audiences cheer when he (or she?) appears on screen. Like a sci-fi version of Brando—who later in his career occasionally came out of obscurity to fill a supporting role, collect his paycheck, become more eccentric, elusive, and obese— Godzilla has a name that is carved in cinema history, and Hollywood has proved in one week that they can bank on that name with ticket sales in excess of $150 million. Although he may need to shed a few pounds, he (or she) has certainly proved that Godzilla is back.Since 1954, when Japan introduced the world to Godzilla, he has played the antagonist, the protagonist, destroyed megacities, fought armies, monsters, aliens; and, with the aid of pocket-size, singing, Japanese twins, he's defeated two giant moths; he's made us examine our neglect of the environment, as he fought a pollution-ingesting smog monster (Godzilla vs. Hedorah, 1971), and he's made us question our use of atomic weapons (Godzilla, 1954). Edwards's subtle homage to the film history of Godzilla is a pleasure for the knowing Godzilla fan. He gives audiences the traditional half-crazy scientist; the scientist's reluctant child, who holds some of their father's knowledge about the monster (see Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, 1974); two modern-day radiation-consuming, winged insects (versions of Mothra, 1964); and a Japanese scientist (Ken Watanabe) in dramatic close-up, with grave seriousness, as he tells the military the giant lizard-monster's name is Godzilla. (insert audience cheers).Despite the young and attractive Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, a large portion of the cast is surprisingly older: Bryan Cranston (wearing a Barry Manilow- like wig), David Strathairn (forgettable military-commander Everyman); Ken Watanabe (whose every close-up says, ""I'm more concerned about my chronic constipation than these radiation-ingesting monsters""), Sally Hawkins (was she in it?), Juliette Binoche (also wearing Cranstone's Barry Manilow wig—or a short-haired wig that seems to say, ""Women scientists can't have long, flowing, girlie hair; they have to have short, practical hair""; but I think they allocated the film's hair- and makeup budget to CGI, or a trainer to build Aaron Taylor-Johnson's massive, Godzilla-like neck). Although these very accomplished actors' talents are grossly ignored and comic-bookized, they seem to serve the purpose of connecting the large audience of baby boomers, who grew up with the Godzilla movies during Monster Week on their local TV stations, to this 2014 version.Like Godzilla vs. Hedorah, which used Godzilla's antagonist—a smog monster—as a metaphor for man's abuse of the environment (an early example of today's trend in environmental sci-fi flicks), environmental worry has supplanted the original Godzilla metaphor for nuclear anxieties. This time it's mistreated nature's wrath that we have to fear in the form of MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). Environmental anxieties are ever-present today with some real monsters causing mass destruction, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, Japan's earthquake, and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and countless Midwest tornadoes, just to name a very few. It's satisfying to symbolically destroy that which is destroying us. We may not be able to take revenge on Hurricane Sandy or predict the next mega-quake, but we can take cathartic satisfaction in watching Godzilla pummel radiation-ravenous, pterodactyl-Mothra-bat-glowworm-like things (a result of man's abuse of nature).Gareth Edwards (Monsters) establishes his cinematic vision with some stunning shots that beg to be seen only on the big screen. One moment of note occurs high above the monster-ravished downtown San Francisco as a team of soldiers skydive into the city holding flairs that stream long ribbons of red smoke. It's a welcomed pause of cinematic beauty. While the special effects are impressive, Edwards doesn't overwhelm the picture with a constant roller-coaster ride of action sequences. There are some careful dynamics to his pacing. However, while we're waiting for the monsters to appear, we're subjected to countless dull scenes, filled with characters who are about as thrilling as watching people wait in line at the DMV. I just wish this Godzilla had fewer stars, less waiting, and more Godzilla. But at least the King of Monsters is finally back!—John David West",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good introduction to Godzilla,"Give it a shot on Netflix, the movie itself is all right.I know next to nothing of Godzilla so I can only speak on behalf of what I watched.Movies featuring monsters tend to be a hit or miss, it's always difficult to create films that appeal universally. This version of Godzilla did a decent job. There was a balance between the main characters and the monster we know next to nothing of. I had no issues with the introduction of this monster, the execution was done well.Like many others, I do agree it's underwhelming after the movie ends. I found myself questioning at certain parts how it would have been better to dive into deeper and more meaningful parts with the legend.Likewise, this movie is just a safe attempt at an introduction.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Movie was Good,"Remember 'Jaws'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance – boy, what an impact he had. Now, that was 40 years ago – but would it be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer?As it turns out, it's not quite possible; at least not as far as this latest version of 'Godzilla' is concerned - but that's probably not for lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards' part. The young director ('Monsters') has stated many times that 'Jaws' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in 'Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's masterpiece (they're both called Brody). Edwards made it very clear that he wanted to take an ""old school"" approach – and as far as the beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets).The ""muto"" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature – is otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and although there is one great creature scene after another, and although those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards the inevitable showdown, it's hard to stay invested in the human side of the story. After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it's hard to feel thrilled. Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since you only just met the guy, you don't feel too much attached.Ultimately – despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale – 'Godzilla' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in 'Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago. Trying to show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way seventies cinema did – you also need the kind of character-driven scenes where someone says: ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Top Notch Monster Effects with a Wooden Protagonist,"When the new GODZILLA had hit theaters in 2014, there was an enormous amount of hatred spewed online about how horrible it was. People were complaining in droves about the wooden acting and the fact that the movie's namesake barely appeared in the film at all. Some of these complaints are perfectly legit, but othersin my opinionnot so much. Before GODZILLA was released, I did a bit of homework. Having never actually seen a Godzilla film before but interested in this new film, I watched the original 1954 film (as well as the 1956 American version) and four different Toho films from the later collection. Maybe it's because I put way more thought into it than I should've, but I didn't hate GODZILLA and each subsequent viewing made it more and more entertaining. The movie opens in the late 90's, when a mining crew stumbled across a couple giant eggs of unknown origin in an underground chamber. Years later, a creature emerges from the within and busts out of the research facility that had contained it. It carves a path of destruction through Japan and then across the Pacific to the western coast of the United States where it intends to mate with another MUTO (massive unidentified terrestrial organism) that has hatched from a similar egg that had been dumped into storage in Nevada. Mankind has only one hope to stop these creatures: Godzilla. The king of monsters awakens and beelines for California where it will do battle with the MUTOsbut can man trust he won't turn his destructive power on them next?I'm going to start by defending this movie. For all the people who complain that Godzilla doesn't get much screen time or that his first couple battles against the MUTOs occur off screen, you went into this movie with the wrong expectations. Considering director Gareth Edwards was most likely brought on based on the strengths of his movie MONSTERS which, as I understand (I haven't seen it), tells the story of a giant monster attack form the perspective of the humans on the ground and doesn't actually feature much of the beast. Then, if you go back and watch the original GOJIRA, Godzilla doesn't feature much until the final march into Tokyo. Until the end, Godzilla is seen in bits and piecesa glimpse of his head towering over a hill, his foot coming down into a home, etc. So I personally understand Edwards' decision to give Godzilla minimal screen time (and even that's unfairwe see plenty of him) and saving the on-screen battle for the very end. He's building tension. If he'd given us what we want right away, what interest would we have had in staying through to the end? The creature design on Godzilla is fantastic. He's got the classic design brought to life with seamless CG with a few updates to make him a little more menacing. I'm not as keen on the look of the MUTOs. That would be a complaint of mine. With all the other monsters already populating Toho's collection, why go with an original creation? And why go with a design that feels too familiar to what we've seen in CLOVERFIELD or PACIFIC RIM? While I'm on the topic of the MUTOs, why would they have developed an EMP defense? From an evolutionary standpoint, the ability to produce an electromagnetic pulse would've only been useful in the last hundred years. These creatures have been around for millennia. It's useful from a storytelling perspective (keeps the humans helpless around them) but makes no sense otherwise.So, while I can forgive Edwards for not spoiling us with an abundance of creature battles, I can't forgive him for his casting and direction. GODZILLA puts us in the perspective of Ford Brody, an explosives expert with the American military played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I know Taylor-Johnson has got skill. He was great in KICK- ASS and NOWHERE BOY. But here, he's the most wooden, uninteresting character I have seen in a film in a long, long time. He never quite emotes, speaking all his lines very quietly without much of any sort of inflection. I think the only emotion he displayed the entire time was mild irritation. He was dull and, since he's our ""main character"", every sequence that wasn't Godzilla or MUTOs tearing through society suffered. Elizabeth Olsen, another talented young star, is similarly wasted on the other end of the spectrum. She spends most of the time crying or panicking. If we were going to spend an entire movie following a character through this fantastical crisis, it should've been Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) or Ford's father Joe (Bryan Cranston). Oh, and don't expect much Joe. Despite being prominently displayed in pretty much every trailer or TV spot, Cranston actually has less screen time than Godzilla. Not cool, Warner/Legendary. Not cool.GODZILLA is a nice blend of elements from both the original, more subtle GOJIRA and the city-smashing monster battles of Toho's later films. It's flawed and its human characters are its weakest bit. But you can't argue with the presentation of Japan's most famous monsterthe design and CG are amazing and his final battle with the MUTOs, while short, is awesome. I might be in the minority but I didn't hate this movie and I find I enjoy it a little more each time I watch it. Manage your expectations and you should find something to enjoy about the 2014 resurrection of the legend: GODZILLA.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"This movie redefines the concept of ""BAD""","When I started watching this (that is after the first 20 minutes), a ray of hope invaded my spirit... that is until 20 minutes into the movie.Anything that happened after that period is utter garbage and I can't state enough reasons without making this a bible instead of a review, so I will state a few points.1- Sound: Really BAD equalization and i mean BAD, like from someone who doesn't know anything about audio. The bass and LFE is so OVER THE PLACE that you can't recognize an explosion from a character walking from a monster screaming... it's all LOUD LOUD LOUD, it's so LOUD that you either cover your ears or throw up. Hint to audio mixer guy: if you put a loud bass to everything you saturate the spectrum, you will loose the shock value and just irritate the viewer.2- Script: I really don't know why in this world a director will put such good actors to such lame roles, they don't have anything meaningful to say, they just go on about a ""plan to destroy the monsters"" and they go on an on forever.. without ANY character development.3- Directing: Important parts relegated as non-important, totally unimportant parts taking the front seat in filming. Hint to director: Godzilla fights ARE the main attraction for watching this movie, if you give us 10 seconds of fight and you then put Godzilla onto the background and blurry it out to show 20 minutes of an imbecile trying to device a plan on how to stop Godzilla you should be bound be hated by the viewers. We wanted to SEE GODZILLA not half the movie wasted on stupid military tactics that amounts to ZERO in the movie.4-Common Sense: Anything that common sense dictates is not present in this movie, the amount of situations in which the characters are trying to resolve it in the worst possible way, and I mean a way which you will scream at the screen ""are you THAT STUPID?"" are excessive. Nothing fits, it's like the director gone straight from the education center to his first movie, he don't have the slightest clue on how to properly do a movie.5- Shock Value: When the best scare in the whole movie is a group of pigeons impacting a BUS window (I am NOT joking) you know something gone terrible wrong in the process..Conclusion: When you're watching the movie with your little kids and your 6 years old girl says out loud ""What is this crap??! I wanna see Godzilla!"" you know you're watching a piece crap. (Specially when they loved the previous one).The previous Godzilla was bad, but if you measure this to the older one you need to completely redesign a set of values in which this movie will be bad and the previous one awesome and this is plain disgusting because this Godzilla looks amazing, but somehow, the director didn't saw appropriate to gives us more of this one and less of the military.This is the WORST monster movie you will ever see in your life.Big Ass Spiders! is a lot more fun than this and that was a B-Movie filmed as a B-Movie and the actors were laughing through the movie!.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla was a fairly decent film but it had so much unfulfilled potential.,"Godzilla was a fairly decent film but it had so much unfulfilled potential. The first flaw in the film is that the protagonist of the film was a miserable fail because Aaron Taylor-Johnson simply cannot act. Sure, he did great in Kick-Ass but the reality is that those films are more silly in nature. Godzilla required him to deliver a few scenes that were more serious and emotional and he simply couldn't do it. Making his lack of acting chops even more apparent was the incredible acting of Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. The other fail in the film was that they tried to artificially manufacture drama in order to add intrigue. All those things did was take away from the film. Honestly, I feel that this movie would've been so much better if it was about 30 minutes shorter. Johnson's lack of acting ability wouldn't have been so pronounced and the ridiculousness of the unrealistic drama wouldn't have existed. Those two adjustments and now we have a legitimately awesome Godzilla film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining reboot,"This was a decent enough creature feature and about what I expected. At least the special effects didn't completely overshadow the whole movie here and there was a pretty good story attached. On the downside all the characters are kinda flat and underdeveloped especially from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is the main hero dude.Bryan Cranston might be the exception, but he (consciously?) overacts his role as Joe the grieving father/scientist/Godzilla conspiracy theorist. There is a decent back story set up for him though. Elizabeth Olsen is in the wife/mother role and this could have been done by anyone. Ken Watanabe also very flat, a grumpy sort of non character. They all take it seriously though, and this is an entertaining movie.The visuals are beautifully done and I enjoyed the story with Godzilla emerging from hibernation to battle winged creatures called Motos, threatening humanity. I also liked the new spin put on Godzilla where he is the good monster, helping to save civilization and bus loads of children from the evil, nuclear loving, ever mating Motos. Wasn't too sure about the spin put on history regarding Hiroshima etc -changing history- but decided to just let that go.Lots of mayhem and destruction, as cities are leveled (which is always fun to watch), some excellent battle scenes with colossal destruction from the creatures, lots of globe trotting through Japan (Vancouver), Hawaii, Las Vegas, and San Francisco.

Monster movie the way it should be,"Monster movies are great for one reason; what if? Over the years Godzilla the beast of all beasts has gone through some monstrous treatment by movie makers who believe they can tell his story and give it some justice. Godzilla is a character developed by the Japanese he has so far stared in 28 movies and a couple of TV series. Personally Godzilla has always been a favourite; I have always had a love of giant monsters, beasts, and creations. I've absolutely hated a lot of the films that have been made so far of Godzilla so I was really hoping that this version will finally see justice done and deliver something to remember, this explains why it took me so long to give it a viewing, I just couldn't handle another fake, horrible, iguana looking creature 1954, there are nuclear bombs being detonated in the middle of the ocean, loud screams of a giant beast can be heard and we get a slight glimpse of some back scales, seems as though the bombs they are dropping are being dropped to destroy something; something very large. 1999 and we are somewhere over the Philippines, a helicopter hovers over a very large mine a Japanese researcher named Ichiro Serizawa finds out that the men there have discovered a monstrous cavern after a cave collapse, inside the cavern the scientist and his assistant discover a very large skeleton unlike anything they have ever seen. Hanging from the cavern are two what appears to be cocoons, one is hatched and appears to be what has made the cave as it dragged its monstrous size across the land and into the ocean. Joe Brady is in Japan trying frantically to organise a meeting to close down the power plant on the island due to very large seismic activity. While in the nuclear plant another tremor happens and before anyone can do anything about it there is a major breach, disaster strikes in more ways than one as the plant comes crashing down killing thousands. 2014 Joe Brady's son Lt Ford Brody has made it back home to wife and son in San Francisco but now needs to go back to Japan to bail his father out of prison. Joe Brady has been searching for answers ever since the meltdown and will do what needs to be done to find them. He makes it back to the island where the plant was originally only to discover the truth to what the local government has been hiding. Godzilla is a monster film unlike any other, it's a trip back to yesteryear, it is a montage to all things BIG but best of all it's a movie that gets it so right. To say there were things done amazingly well would be an insult. The CGI of the Monsters in this movie is second to none, it is outstanding, and a lot of the times BIG means a horrible mess, there are very few films where the big creatures look as menacing and as beautiful as they should. Unfortunately though there is so much that lets the film down as well, horrible acting, very weak storyline, and very BIG plot holes. Personally I feel the good outweighs the bad but I'm sure thousands will disagree. I can forgive the director and the films continuity where it was missing for the amazing creatures he and his team have created. The acting is extremely underwhelming, you don't care about any one of them, at its core it is a story of finding the lost partner once again. Ford making his way back to San Francisco to be with his wife and child before the creatures destroy the city around them. Lt Ford Brody is played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (The Illusionist, Kick Ass) his wife Elle Brody played by Elizabeth Olsen (Oldboy, Kill your Darlings) Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) plays Joe Brody apparently (reading other reviews) he was great in his role, personally I didn't see anything to make him the star. Also Ken Watanabe (Inception, Batman Begins) as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa and Sally Hawkins (Layer Cake, Blue Jasmine) both deserve a mention for their roles as unforgettable as they were. Godzilla should be seen to be enjoyed, it's not at all a masterpiece of cinematic viewing, but it is a monster of a monster movie and that's all it really needs to be. Personally I was so happy with what I seen on the screen ( really want to say more but don't want to give it away) It blew me away and took me back to my childhood. The director Gareth Edwards I feel did an amazing job with the CGI and special effects just next time I think more care needs to be taken with his stars. There are two sequels being made so lets just wait to see what's next.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mildly diverting.... but leave brain at the door,"A terrifying creature is approaching the coast and Brody – half crazed with fear and loss – is trying to convince sceptical authorities of the impending disaster without success. And what a great 5* film Jaws was! Godzilla on the other hand It's not as if the film is absolutely terrible. As an example of the genre of dumb-arsed, popcorn-munching summer blockbusters, it has its diverting moments. Certainly if you get turned on my giant dinosaurs fighting each other and smashing up San Francisco, this is definitely the film for you. But it's not going to set the awards season alight, in just about any category as far as I can see.It starts promisingly enough, with a Jurassic Park-style helicopter ride over lush Philippine jungle to a Raiders of the Lost Ark-style dig where some Alien-style eggs have been discovered. So far, so plagerised. The ever reliable Ken Watanabe (probably hired solely for the way he pronounces ""Godzilla"") plays the investigating scientist with his rather unlikely side-kick Sally Hawkins ('Blue Jasmine').The action then moves to one of the best segments of the film in Japan where nuclear plant boss Brody (Snr), played by Malcolm in the Middle / Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, has to contend with the tragic consequences of what has been disturbed.We then skip 15 years forwards to where explosives expert Ford Brody (Jnr) (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of Kick-Ass fame) has to leave his young family in San Francisco to fly to Japan to bail out his dad from jail. (Yes, I couldn't work that one out either doesn't Japan do Paypal?). The basic premise here is that Godzilla is the good guy in the picture (even though the Americans seem to want to try and shoot him at every opportunity) helping to ""restore balance"" to the prehistoric world by defeating the horny preying-mantis-like monsters (aka MUTOs) before they can have rumpy-pumpy and make thousands of other preying-mantis like monsters, so returning ""man to the stone age"". Much mayhem and destruction naturally follows, showing once again (""Man of Steel"", ""Avengers Assemble"", etc, etc) that the US economic recovery is based solely on jobs for builders, decorators and glaziers.In the acting stakes, Taylor-Johnson is very good (channelling a brooding Jake Gyllenhaal look) but Cranston seems rather over the top. It is also a very sexist films, with the female leads being given scandalously little to do: Elizabeth Olsen (looking wonderfully un-skinny and gorgeous in a non-Hollywood sort of way) is confined to running and screaming and the wonderful Sally Hawkins has even less to do, confined to being Watanabe's bag-carrier for the majority of the film.Where I could get very critical is in the nonsensical story. Leaving aside the scientific problems I have with ""radioactive levels reducing"" due to ""catalysation"" (whatever that means), the story plays fast and loose with the concept of the MUTOs feeding on radioactive materials. In one scene, a MUTO leaves the main US stockpile of radioactive waste voluntarily, but is supposed to be 'lured out to sea' by a single nuclear warhead. Like, WHAT? And why the US army would try to transport said 'bait' through the enemy territory by train rather than fly it out is bizarre. The story is also strong on Watanabe's claim that letting Godzilla duke it out with the MUTOs is the way forwards, and yet there are at least two occasions when Godzilla and one or more of the MUTOs are together, and yet nothing seems to come of that confrontation. The story just moves on to another pursuit of monster vs monster. Like, WHAT? Very unsatisfactory.In other departments, the special effects are passable if not outstanding, but there are some memorably cinematic scenes: notably the free-fall parachuting into San Francisco set to Ligeti's music (as used in 2001: A Space Odyssey), which is impressive. And the rest of the music by the omnipresent Alexandre Duplat is also noteworthy (no pun intended). Relative newcomer Gareth Edwards directs, and clearly made an impact as Disney have just given him a Star Wars spin-off film to direct.A decent early salvo for the summer blockbuster season, but (unlike Godzilla and the MUTOs), unlikely to set the world alight.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bobmann447.wordpress.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!)",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The serpentine skin of flow,"Not many viewers will take to this. I agree with the first complaint, badly scripted and acted, bad even by comparison to Marvel's similar stuff.I take a different tack on the other complaint, not much lizzard time. There's more behind the decision. The idea was to give us the usual Godzilla movie of destruction where a giant creature stomps around but through the eyes of people who run to and from it, as shifting glimpses of unfathomable beings tearing at the skies.One clear example of this choreography begins with the discovery of the Russian sub on the island. We get no more than a vague first glimpse of Godzilla's hulk swimming underneath a ship, rushing to battle, followed by another vague reveal of only bits of a larger creature to the reddish light of cascading flares, a majestic unveiling seen by an audience of onlookers.Then a child's pov from inside the stopped train as lights come back on, popping up one by one in the cordon of tracks, guiding our eye to the monster, another unveiling here. The train drawn towards the monster as if by the urge to see. All this prefigures the first encounter between Godzilla and monster; a first battle which we only catch glimpses of as news footage on TV as another child is dozing off on a couch, again teasing us with postponement.You'll see again and again this choreographed pattern of withthold and unveil; humorously in the destruction of Vegas, more ordinary actionlike in the night bridge scene.A superb moment that encapsulates the approach has a special ops team parachute down on the city from a plane, they have to do a plot thing about a bomb, no matter. A beautiful shot at the edge of the atmosphere as planedoors open, then as they fall, a first-person parachutist's view of the two monsters fighting among skyscrapers unfurls across the screen, a majestic glimpse of the larger event stolen on the way down.How can anyone say there's no creativity here? It's what we came to see all along, monsters, only given to us in this more dynamic way, as ribbons of perception fluttering in the turbulence of spectacle.I don't think a great filmmaker was stifled here by the blandness of what he signed to, but he may be a technician to watch. Watch this. It's pure Gothic horror reinvented by the eye.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Mixed feelings, inevitably","When I heard that the American studios were producing a new GODZILLA movie, I had mixed feelings about it. Their previous GODZILLA film, made in 1998, was absolutely execrable. The director of this new version was Gareth Edwards, who previously made the low budget MONSTERS, which I wasn't too keen on. And as a massive fan of the various Japanese film series, how could the Americans possibly hope to do the subject justice? The answer is that they don't, at least not really. Only in the last half an hour of the film does this become a GODZILLA film properly; until that point, it feels more like MONSTERS 2. Edwards obviously has a passion for huge-sized beasties, but as a film-maker he leaves me cold. Much of the running time here consists of following around an absolutely dull, one-dimensional American family who have little to do with the actual big events of the film.Thus we get Bryan Cranston grieving his wife, Elizabeth Olsen randomly working in a hospital, and an annoying kid lurking around. The worst of the lot is the erstwhile lead, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (KICK ASS) who gives the singularly most wooden performance I've seen in a while. What a poor choice of actor for the lead role, and what a pointless role to begin with anyway. Ken Watanabe is considerably better, but under used in a show of tokenism.As for Godzilla, he has a couple of beetle-like enemies to contend with here, and the creations are larger than ever. Inevitably CGI is used to animate the monsters and the result is visually impressive; enough money has gone into it to make this a dark and brooding visual experience. As I said before, though, it's only in the action of the last half hour that this starts feeling truly like a Japanese GODZILLA film, which is what I was hoping for the whole time. You could excise the whole, somewhat pointless, first hour and a half and still get the same result.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finally the Real Godzilla!,"After the awful Emmerich's Godzilla of 1998, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but indeed I had to change my mind. This movie of course isn't a masterpiece, but has the merit of extablishing a good tone for the sequels, and FINALLY presenting us Godzilla for what he really is. Godzilla is not evil, nor good, hes simply a force of nature. In the 98's movie, I felt really bad, Godzilla was depicted as a poor creature who get's killed by the humans, indeed I had the feeling that humans in that movie were the real evil, suppressing an animal who only tried to survive. I felt really sorry, it was like destroing a legend. This time however, is finally showed the real Godzilla, not good, not evil, simply above human perception of existence. Of course, in this movie there are some bad things too, some inconsistencies and contraddictions, some things seems conveniently too simple, like the main character living with his family in the very same place where in the end the action take place and where the monsters arrives from across the globe... But, whatever.. In the end I think this movie has more good things than bad, a great photograpy, a good script and a evocative soundtrack..",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Godzilla"" (2014) serves as a solid first entry into the recent Godzilla universe, providing a blend of suspense, action, and impressive special effects.","Godzilla"" (2014) serves as a solid first entry into the recent Godzilla universe, providing a blend of suspense, action, and impressive special effects. Revisiting this film after some time reveals that while it remains a fun and engaging blockbuster, it also has its pacing issues and some frustratingly dark action scenes.One of the strengths of the film is its return to Japan to explore Godzilla's origins, paying homage to the classic roots of the franchise. This, along with the backstory of the characters, adds depth and context to the monster's first appearance. The cast, featuring talents like Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen, delivers strong performances that help anchor the human element of the story.However, the movie's slow pace can be a bit of a drawback. It takes a significant amount of time before any substantial action unfolds, which might test the patience of viewers eager to see Godzilla in action. When the creatures, including Godzilla, do finally appear, many of the scenes are set in very dark environments. This obscurity makes it challenging to fully appreciate the detailed designs and the scale of the monsters, which can be frustrating.Despite these issues, the moments when Godzilla is fully visible and engaged in battle are thrilling and well-executed. The special effects and production design are top-notch, effectively bringing the massive creature and the devastation it causes to life. The film succeeds in creating a sense of awe and spectacle that is essential for a Godzilla movie.Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a fun and entertaining film that sets the stage for the subsequent entries in the franchise. While it could benefit from a faster pace and clearer action scenes, it still offers a satisfying blockbuster experience with impressive visuals and a strong cast. Fans of monster movies and the Godzilla legacy will find much to enjoy in this 2014 reboot.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
seriously 2nd best Godzilla movie ever.,"**Contains Spoilers**When it came out that there was plans for another Godzilla, I thought ""here we go again, someone somewhere just wants more money"". Then I found out that Edwards was directing the film. I had already seen 'Monsters' with my fiancé and both of us decided that for a movie neither of us heard of before and for a Netflix movie. It was pretty fantastic. So I allowed myself some room for hope. (1998 made me believe I would never see my Godzilla dreams realized). Bit by bit, I kept hearing snippets come out that Edwards was bringing it back, old school style. My levels for hope kept rising. Then the Halo jump trailer came out and I was sold. For me, I know who Godzilla is, I know what he does. I wanted more.Then the Asia trailer came out, and I was hooked. Everything had a retro feel but darker more original. So I did what any self respecting fan did. I shut myself away from any news about this movie. Then one trip to cost-co gave me an offer I could not refuse. Gojira, the original Gojira sold with the bastardized American version, Godzilla raids again and Godzilla vs Mothra for 12 bucks. I couldn't resist. So for the first time ever, I watched the original Japanese Gojira in all of its amazing glory. The helplessness, the fear, the slow realization of hopelessness. The sacrifice. Everything. It was just perfect. Now onto the movie.The movie sets up really quickly. It brings it so that Gojira is the actual starting off point. Godzilla dies in Gojira but here is the bigger badder one. Everybody is doing what they can to kill Godzilla. In the first 10 min, they explain what I already knew. Godzilla exists and we just cannot kill him. My first thought was fantastic, we are not wasting any time going over him coming out of the water again. We all know, that is what he does. This about what he does next.Next introducing the characters, we meet Bryan who in character cannot be there for his son. He is too busy doing his civic duty at a Nuclear Power Plant, He is so busy that he never realizes that it was his birthday. The son is left feeling disappointed goes to school and unknowingly witnesses the death of this Mother. Turns out a MUTO who has a fondness for Nuclear Energy destroyed the plant. 15 years later, the kid who has been put off to the side by his dad, due to the dads conspiracy theories and lost his mother (essentially left alone) has to get his father out of jail for trying to break into the quarantined area of the broke down power plant. The son is a soldier, which explains his actions throughout the rest of the film. Dad convinces son to go on a trip to the quarantined zone where they successfully break in, and witness the birth of a MUTO. All chaos ensues and Dad ultimately dies, before his death, Dad tells son to go be with his son. Something the dad had never been able to do. And thus, I sit there with a man tear in my right eye. Realizing that this is what the story is. A man trying to get home to his son. I can relate to that. I would do that for my son. The helplessness conveyed in Gojira, is showcased here. Give a soldier a directive and he will do his best to achieve it.Meanwhile Godzilla is down for whatever the MUTO's bring. Godzilla is an Alpha animal that will stop at nothing from being the top dog and for the first time in 50 years, he is presented ""prey"". So he stalks and attacks the MUTO's any chance he can get.I personally loved the wait. I personally loved the focus on the MUTO's. When they screamed, I felt it deep inside my body. The suspense left me white knuckled, and wanting more. When finally allowed to witness Godzilla in all of his awesome glory, I ate in every scene. When it came to the final battle The son, doing his best to make sure he will be able to see his son again. Godzilla doing his best to make sure he is Alpha and the MUTO's doing their best to ensure their survival. It was amazing. When Godzilla got angry (and he did) you felt it. The minute long roar that felt like an eternity left you exhausted. When Godzillas fins started lighting up like as if the depths of hades fury were about to be unleashed (if only for a second), I let out a whispered ""heck yes"". When Godzilla tail whipped a MUTO, while bringing down a MUTO, I winched.When the Female MUTO screamed at the sight of her babies being burned alive, you felt her pain. When Godzilla ended her, you felt his anger and you felt even for a second, that even though this is a complete fantasy made up ridiculous story that if you were Godzilla, you would have kept it going, just like he did, breathing radiation breath down her throat way longer than necessary.I experienced another man tear at the end of the movie. When the son is finally reunited with his own son. That moment was very real to me. The main character went through hell. But he was able to fulfill his mission. He saved his family and 'came home'.#2 greatest Godzilla movie only behind Gojira. Even 60 years later, you should not expect a greater one. This one never tried to out class the original, it merely did its very best to live up to that standard. And it succeeded in almost every way possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Godzilla v the something or other creatures - Same old but better than its peers,"You got to give these guys credit. Over the past 20 years this has been a tired & tested formula genre, and has gone through so many reboots, parodies, copies and rip-offs. The director & writers have taken the genre and stripped it bare to its core from the past, and what we have is a more grown up and interesting take on Godzilla.The special effects are good, but its the tension and build up which is excellent, as we await the inevitable clash between Godzilla and some other bizarre creatures. Compared to the masses of other monster movies, this was far more interesting. I saw a recent Japanese Godzilla remake lately, and it was just boring. This one keeps you interested through much of it.The biggest problem is that simply despite the improvements in various aspects to its peers, there's really not much more you can do with this genre. King Kong, Jurassic World etc have done much enough the same and there's little to get excited. Nothing too original, just another slant on the same old story.The ending was nothing to write home about, and the usual gung-ho US army hero was too jingoistic for me to care about.Anyhow, it was fine for an evening's viewing and better than many of its recent peers, but the genre is done like Westerns etc. It will keep getting rebooted as people seem to like remakes but all we'll see is updated special effects, and no new story.

"Godzilla, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate the Bomb","This film is recommended.True or False: Godzilla has its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in California. Believe it or not, it's true. The King of Monsters is ultra famous, an icon of epic proportions loved and revered by many. Yes, the big guy is back big time in Gareth Edwards' updated reincarnation of the super beast, aptly titled Godzilla.There have been many versions of this reptilian wonder, over thirty sequels since the first successful film in 1954. As a child, I watched that original Godzilla movie on my black & white Zenith TV in awe. I remember going to the movie theater with my buddies and seeing him fight the likes of King Kong, Mothra, and Ghidorah back in the early sixties. I enjoyed the rampaging of Tokyo as the creature lumbered his way across the miniature city models, shrieking and wailing as he gracelessly stomped the citizens and architecture of Japan. No, I didn't get the anti-nuclear message then, nor did I even care as a teenager. It was a group event, a monster movie, badly acted and even worse, badly dubbed, where you could root for the monster and take in all the destruction on the big screen. It was totally cool and mindless fun. This new and improved 2014 version is that too and more. (I also saw the most recent American remake by Roland Emmerich in 1998 which was ravaged by the critics and I didn't love that film, but I didn't hate it that much either.)Godzilla (2014) is a different creature entirely, more refined than crass, a monster with a mission. Even the creature's look and movements are streamlined and adroit. The film also brings in top name stars to add some prestige to the project, trying valiantly to remove the schlock and deliver the shock: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, Elizabeth Olsen, and David Strathairn are here, albeit in minor roles. (There are also many monsters-in- combat scenes, but actually, the most frightening creature in the whole film is Cranston's hideous wig which tends to upstage everyone including the main star of the film. No, not Mr. Cranston, I mean Mr. G. himself! And yes, no doubt, I will be having many restless nights from the recurring nightmares caused by that toupee.) Nevertheless, these actors' presence is felt as the director and the writers weave a more personal story into the mayhem, still paying homage to the creature and its radioactive origins.Besides Godzilla, this reboot focuses on two human characters who fight the monster and their own personal demons: Aaron Taylor- Johnson is Ford Brody, a soldier with an itchy trigger finger and Ken Watanabe is Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, an earnest scientist who views Godzilla in a savior rather than destroyer. The sub-plot is slim and formulaic, but both actors do a solid job of conveying the film's preachy message about man's foolhardy attempt in controlling nuclear power. Much time, perhaps too much time, is spend on the human back-stories and the interrelationship of the film's non-reptilian characters prior to Godzilla's entrance. (The creature doesn't even surface until an hour into the film.)Still, as always, it's the action sequences that matter most. These creatures get around as the film globe-trots from China and Hawaii and California and Nevada, specifically Las Vegas (well, they are high-rollers), to where else but that iconic landmark of monster movies, the Golden Gate Bridge, for a climactic smack-down. This Godzilla uses state-of-the-art visuals to keep interest high. (The tsunami sequence is thrilling.) The CGI work is very impressive. However, the 3-D effects scattered throughout the movie don't really amount to much and the MUTO monsters (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), lack real menace or originality and are inspired too closely from Aliens, Starship Troopers, and Transformers. Production values are strong, especially Seamus McGarvey's imaginative cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's dramatic musical score which helps to contribute to the film's success.As the director, Edwards' unique vision incorporates shadows, aerial perspectives, and clever point of views via masks and goggles to bring some needed tension. He efficiently shoots the film with a minimum of story and a maximum of tightly staged battles, keeping the action at the forefront and making Godzilla (2014) an unexpected guilty pleasure. This film will do serious damage at the box office with, I'm sure, another sequel in the near future. Godzilla lives on!

King of the Monsters...Savior of Kaiju Movies??,"So, it has been a while since I have seen this movie, but after 5 released films in the MonsterVerse, I have a lot of thoughts.I will be completely honest and say that while the movie itself in my opinion is completely watchable, it has A LOT of flaws. One of the BIG complaints that A LOT of people have with these films is the lack of compelling characters, motivation, and growth. I will say that in this film the introduction to these characters were surprisingly solid. But when the film continues after that, it never reaches any real emotional and real character moments.Aaron Taylor Johnson while he does the best he could plays his character kind of flat, and sadly so one else is there to help carry the movie with him. Elizabeth Olsen while her parts as playing a mother were good, I wish she was in this movie more. Bryan Cranston while he plays his part as a father well, he wasn't the true lead, and he should've been.When the movie lacks in character moments, it usually has really exciting monster action. I'm gonna be honest though, I'd expect something better. The problem was that a good portion of the monster action takes place off screen, or the action takes place in the dark, which really doesn't do any favors for this movie. I don't understand the creative choice for keeping the fights in pitch black most of the time.The best thing I can say that when you do get to see Godzilla in his full glory in the day, I'm impressed with his creature design. You get a sense of the Power behind every step he makes, and his roar in my opinion is so iconic.In the long run, I don't hate this movie. I think it is watchable, but if I have to be completely honest, I was expecting more. The best description that I would have for this movie is being a blank slate for how to do a Monster movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cool,"""Godzilla"" emerges as a monstrous spectacle that balances awe-inspiring visuals with a human touch. The cast, led by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Cranston, delivers earnest performances amidst the colossal chaos. The film editing maintains a suspenseful pace, strategically revealing the iconic creature and its adversaries. While the music, composed by Alexandre Desplat, adds to the film's grandeur, it may not be the most memorable element. The movie's strength lies in its breathtaking cinematography, capturing the sheer scale and power of Godzilla in all his glory. However, the weakness lies in moments where the human drama feels overshadowed by the looming monsters. With a 6/10 rating, ""Godzilla"" succeeds in revitalizing the iconic creature for a new generation, offering a blend of heart-pounding action and visual spectacle, even if the human elements occasionally get lost in the monstrous mayhem.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Long live the King of all monsters!,"I don't care if this is a remake of the original 1954 classic, a way to compensate for 1998, or if this was an attempt by Warner Bros. and Legendary to outshine and washout the legacy of Toho Co., Ltd. I went to see this movie in 3D-Imax, not like a regular movie broadcast, and I did whatever I could to keep my eyes on the whole screen. And I do not have a single solitary complaint about this movie. I was blown away by the historical details as well as the graphics. I grew up on Godzilla movies from Toho; from ""King of the Monsters"" to ""Godzilla 1985"". It wasn't until 1994 that I found some newer movies that were setup to be like after 1985. I'll leave my opinions of them to myself and to their respective pages. As for this, my only problem is going to be whether to buy this on DVD or wait until it airs on TV and record it myself.

Godzilla fighting other monsters in never before seen fidelity.

"Great Movie, Much Better than 1998 Version","Since it is so new, I don't want to give away any of the really good parts. But I was really, really disappointed in the 1998 remake. It was not true to the original Godzilla legend. The 1998 Godzilla was a coward who ran from the military. This one does it all. This Godzilla Dominates, as Godzilla was meant to do. When Godzilla finally awakens and fills the screen, he lets out an awesome theater wall shaking roar that makes it clear it is ""game on."" I gave this a 10, not because it was a perfect movie. The human interest stuff was not very effective. I gave it a 10 because Godzilla and his monster foes were truly awesome on a grand scale.I saw it in IMAX 3D, but I am not sure either is necessary (IMAX or 3D). But I think if you wait to see it on DVD or streaming at home, you will definitely miss a lot of the overwhelming spectacle, unless you have a huge screen and professional level theater sound system at home and turn up the volume. But this movie would still be great in 2D at a commercial theater with a decent sound system and large screen.One comment: disappointed they couldn't use Blue Oyster Cult's ""Godzilla"" in the movie somewhere. Probably something to do with too much money for the music rights or something, but I do not know. Maybe they just chose not to use it.Overall: Great Movie. See it in the theater, even 2D would be awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nice blend of Japanese and American setting,"With his first feature film ""Monsters"" (2010), director Gareth Edwards showed a level of ingenuity and creativity that reached far beyond the Hollywood standards. His next project, Godzilla (2014), gave him a budget of $ 160 million. Hollywood had tried before to make its own version of the classic gigantic Japanese movie monster, but failed. Thankfully, Edwards does a lot better than Roland Emmerich did in 1998, creating a Gojira that the audience can care for, becoming the saviour of humanity rather than just a destructive force.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Real Deal,"This new version of Godzilla is basically Hollywood's redemption to the iconic creature after the fiasco back in 1998. To completely forget that awful remake, it goes back to the classic design of the monster, takes a more atmospheric tone, and stripping off the worst parts (mostly the bad humor) of the abomination. The achievement here is rather astounding. It's not the typical type of action movie that most of the time shoves the large scale destruction to the audience. It instead prioritizes the tension which becomes a totally breathtaking experience. Though, there are parts of the story that deserve a little more exploration to make it an ultimately compelling blockbuster, but then it's already compelling when it features the terror and the largeness of this awesome monster.It didn't took that long for it to impress the audience. The first act is already a perfect movie. It focuses on a character with a real grief towards the situation. Even more interesting, there is a sociopolitical theme hidden behind the mission which makes an intriguing piece of commentary. But when it hits to the next act, it somehow abandons it and finally rises to the more bombastic points of the story. What comes afterwards follows a character who has a less interesting plight. The lead character, Ford, may have a pretty basic arc, but it wasn't nearly as compelling as his father's. Maybe if he had a solid one, it might have distracted the disasters going on and that is probably true. This movie is all about the monster, and the human element already lies on their scale and fear. The beginning is just a missed opportunity of something more. Otherwise, it's still an engrossing experience.The film would have been a straightforward explosive extravaganza, but the direction decided to be much challenging. There is an obvious inspiration to ""Jaws"" and even to another giant monster movie ""Cloverfield"" (when it comes to politics). The film does have action, but displaying them aren't the only key to excite the viewers. In fact, the destruction often goes straight to the aftermath. People might feel that they're missing too much mayhem, but actually they're not. The mysteries actually make the threat much larger. Because it's not about how the cities get wrecked, it's more about acknowledging how absolutely formidable these creatures are. The camera also keeps giving tremendous shots of which compares between the scale of a normal human being to the monster.The character development can still be complained at some point. Thankfully, the acting is splendid. Aaron Taylor-Johnson ends up being the weakest among. I'm not sure if it's his fault, the character is not well developed, but he could have improved and filled the gaps of the supposedly heroic Ford Brody. In contrast, Bryan Cranston is simply terrific in every single scene he is in that one would wish he could have been the main character of the entire film. The rest of the cast surpassed the script and somewhat elevated their characters.The message is quite clear, Hollywood has learned their lesson. The rest of the drama may not justify the powerful first act, but the film finally succeeds at portraying the Godzilla everyone deserves. It's just full of love, not only to the original, but also to the genre. Other than the behemoth sized set pieces, the film takes plenty of remarkable inspirations from several creature horror movies, from Spielberg's to Reeves'. Even with all the intriguing politics and gravity, the King of the Monsters still stands as the landmark of the whole film. Godzilla is just amazing for reliving the original spirit of this genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Three Movies in One,"One part disaster movie, one part drama, one part monster movie... Godzilla 2014 was perhaps the perfect mix of all three. Some parts of the movie are a build up. Some parts are emotional. Some parts are pure raw awe inspiring visuals and sounds. Speaking of, be SURE to see this thing in a theater with good audio... and I never say that. As a matter of fact I may have to go all out on my home audio now, because the sounds truly put you in this movie. The roars, the explosions, the everything. It felt real.I will have to say while I enjoyed the acting (I can see how Bryan Cranston made such waves lately) and the place the director made you look internally while viewing (I found myself analyzing my relationship with my family, my job, my country), my favorite parts were definitely when Godzilla showed up in full view. Wow! It was so well done, and somehow stayed true to the many iterations of Godzilla and the many generations of Godzilla fans. It truly is a hair raising, visceral experience to see Godzilla in such a believable way. I just loved that.And to the director, I saw your 2010 Monsters and was very impressed.

Massive Unidentified Terrestial Organism,"I love this movie and I love Godzilla and its lore and history. The second half of the film is great. It is beat for beat enjoyable vices of fan service and character development so contrived you could throw a grappling hook up and over it. The film was undeniably inspired by the post-modern Cloverfield spectacle only they did their own thing with it. Ironically Cloverfield was inspired by Godzilla. I love every kind of Kaiju film including the ones derivative. This film focuses so heavily on the human characters that our Kaiju on the menu serve more as runway-models on a catwalk than they do as a brooding dynamic. The scenes are fleeting but mostly enjoyable however the CGI has not aged too well but I noticed that the first time around too after watching many years later. This film struggles to flaunt it's own identity, and when it does it is small glimpses in the muddled chaos. It tries to tip it's hat to so many motifs that it never breathes.

Good,"Wonderfully intense, from beginning to end! The king of monsters, in a grandiose film, full of nostalgic sentiment, returns with deserving in an epic proportion. There were high expectations for the remake of the new Godzilla, the monster that 50 years ago gained incredible recognition within the cinematographic world. The mission that many considered impossible to bring back the true essence of Godzilla, fell into the hands of the almost inexperienced Gareth Edwards, who brings fans a film that recalls the original merging with techniques that the current cinema offers. The film, which this time features a human drama within the script, creates the prospect of viewing on all sides the consequences caused by Godzilla and the battle of monsters across the city. When a suspicious accident happened at the nuclear plant where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) worked, leading to the death of his wife, doubts were created as to what could cause such destruction. 15 years after the events, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Joe's son and now an adult, is the lieutenant of the American army and needs to take care of his father, who has answers about what happened, but who is not taken seriously. Gareth Edwards is a consistent fan service to Hollywood cinema today, the director creates in moments of tension, anxiety about the viewer and the right moment to release that relief of satisfaction. The script that gradually releases details about the monster and gathers aspects to keep the best in the end, leaves everyone's expectations high and does not disappoint when it delivers the promised action, on the contrary, while puffing out the chest and in the roar of Godzilla, the thrill of contemplating that is terrifyingly incredible. Perhaps it is not wrong to say that on some occasions the film appeals to the apathetic doomsday feeling as seen in many apocalyptic-themed productions, however, what Edwards relates to what humans are able to do when everything is up for grabs. water below - technologies that no longer work, nuclear bombs capable of decimating the entire city and natural disasters ready to start - reflects what it is like to be prepared for adverse situations. The director uses his techniques similar to the interesting one, Monsters, to bring together human drama and all the visual dazzle in high proportions, using techniques for positioning the cameras and the aid of the soundtrack directly affecting the viewing of the film, which at a certain moment determines Godzilla with Ford Brody, like the heroes you're rooting for. Godzilla happily delivers a visually exuberant and terrifying film in the battle of the monsters. A true film that teaches many how to cause destruction in an entire city, without the need for mind-boggling action at all times.Film seen on February 20, 2021.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Moody monster mash.,"Although fun at times, the tone of this was a little too moody for my tastes. It's an enjoyable action monster movie with a little too much focus on uninteresting human characters.When Godzilla or his MUTO foes are onscreen is when this movie really shines, especially in the final city smashing showdown. My only quibble with this was that it all takes place in cover of darkness, to clearly hide any faults in what look like stunning visuals effects, so it either worked or they could've had it in daylight and have us bask in the full glory of the deadly battle.Not as fun as I'd hoped, but I would still recommend this, although I think it's slightly weaker that it's prequel (2017's Kong: Skull Island).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as bad as other users say,"I am costricted by other users' too low rating to give this a 10/10 to attempt balancing the rating.Now, this is not a movie that is mainly about two hours of godzilla walking around a city and smashing all. We have that too, but in a brief way, making it not the main part of the film.The film's first part is a slower, more thriller-like part, with some clear references to Tarkoskij's ""stalker"" that I've personally spotted, but that still drives some plot in it. The second part of the movie is the one that includes the most action and catastrophic-apoc. scenes, and I'd like to underline the use of a track composed by Gyorgy Ligeti, used also in 2001: a space odissey to give the right atmosphere to a scene that I'd define iconic to this movie.Complains about this movie come from the real pro of the movie, the existence of a not- too plain plot, and the short amount of screen time Godzilla has, choice done by Edwards maybe because this is somehow just an ""introduction"" movie, all reasons that make this a ""not-just-action"" movie, and reasons I actually liked it. Also the subplot of the characters involved gives a more real-like feature to the whole movie.Nonetheless, as I said I wouldn't truly rate this 10/10, but more a 8/10, because it still doesn't have a so-complex plot, but I wouldn't blame writers or the director for that, they already tried to do the most possible, but more likely the carachter itself's plainess... let's admit, Godzilla couldn't have a very complicated plot anyhow.Still I liked this movie and suggest everyone to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

My mouth was wide of awestruck and wonder. It - is - Briljant!I saw it in IMax 3D in The Hague. I loved the fact that the movie let you wait for the marvelous fight of Godzilla in the demolished city. There were even some winks from the director I guess: there were scenes Godzilla was about to fight, but the shot was in an angle you could almost see it happen, but not quite. And that happened a few times though. But, hey, if it was only a movie about Godzilla fighting some monsters, it would be a short one without a great storyline.

The King of Monsters has Claimed his Throne!,"Finally Godzilla arrived in the 21 century in all his computer animated glory and it all starts where the myth originally came to life: Japan!What I liked the most about this version is that the director takes the iconic figure of Godzilla very seriously and pays tribute to his roots which is not only mirrored by the monster's traditional looks in contrast to the version of 98, but most of all because the director has understood what Godzilla stands for, which is the pure power of nature, it's a metaphor for all the uncontrollable natural catastrophes that we are helplessly exposed to and a warning of nuclear destruction in the sense of its Japanese creator who developed the idea of Godzilla as a response to the atomic attacks on japan. So it's a logical consequence that we find a lot of references to current major catastrophes in this movie like the great tsunami catastrophe in 2004, the core melt accident in Fukushima, and there are even scenes that reminded me very strongly of ground zero and the aftermath of 09/11 with all the fire men looking for buried survivors in a ruined, dust-covered surrounding. This affinity to real disasters that we have all seen on TV enhances authenticity and thrill factor of the movie.What's also extraordinary about this release is the way the fighting scenes are presented. It's not only the usual confrontation of several monsters whereupon a whole city is getting destroyed, there is more to this, the director plays with our expectations, he postpones fights, uses special camera angle's and finds quite pictorial ways to present the scenes which thus have a certain poetic quality to them, something unique that was not seen in any of the previous Godzilla movies due to the lack of cinematic means.In a time where massive city destructions are seen in movie theaters on a regular basis (I mean, the ""Transformers"" series alone showed them in each of the three parts, not to think of ""Pacific Rim"", ""Avengers"" etc.) it is refreshing to see that you still can get something special out of the same genre-typical elements. so everyone who expected just two hours of mindless battles might be surprised by how much thought lies behind this beautifully depicted clash of monsters. It's true, that it takes a while until we hear Godzillas famous roar, however the time it takes is not spent in vain as it serves the creation of suspense and gives space for character development in the context of which the one and only, living legend Bryan Cranston plays a major role as an obsessive scientist who is involved in a very touching family drama. His son, a soldier, later attracts the focus on his struggle to fight back the threat (very evil MUTOS) with military means as there soon comes the point where scientists get pushed back to an counseling role like it is the case with Ken Watanabe who plays an Japanese scientist, a brooding voice of reason and an intermediary between the cultures; its good that the producers chose a Japanese actor to play such an important figure.The director Gareth Edwards did not reinvent the entire genre, there are still the typical ingredients to be found, but a very smart script that offers some good twists, a strong cast and a very beautiful cinematography make this movie one of the most ambitious and impressive contributions to the monster movie franchise, maybe not as good as ""Jurassic Park"" but definitely worth seeing. If the Godzilla of 1998 was a silly joke than this one is an awakening, the first milestone of a new era of Godzilla movies that will be measured against this one.

"The king of the monsters is back, but we could have used more Godzilla in Godzilla.","The days of miniatures and guys in rubber creature suits are long since past. Back in the previous century, this was a long-standing way of making an entertaining monster movie. It didn't really need much of a character development story to make for a great film. The people who saw this, were here for the monsters and city destruction. That was enough to make the Japanese monster Godzilla such a cultural icon for over fifty years. If you do your homework, you'd be surprised to find out that there are more then thirty Godzilla films, ranging from having him as a terrifying force to saving the world from other monsters to even making him a children's idol to look up to.The Godzilla series was something else I loved as a kid, though it wasn't easy for an American like myself. The movies are very hard to find (these were the days before we had the convenient Netflix) and rarely show in theaters (I saw Godzilla 2000 in theaters), making hard to persuade my friends that wanted modern special effects and better story telling. Today's movies can't work on special effects alone, often needing that griping story that for something like giant monsters, is hard to pull off. The American Godzilla gives the famous monster a second round at combining action and a western setting.The story begins in 1999 inwhere else but Japan where scientists Ishiro Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (played by Sally Hawkins) discover a giant skeleton and a hatched egg where one of the creatures as escaped into the sea. At the same time, a power plant supervisor Joe Brody (played by Bryan Cranston) nearly escapes a meltdown when seismic activity destroys the place. The disaster, written off as an earthquake, results in an evacuation and quarantine of the Japanese area.Cut to fifteen years later where Joe's son Ford (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an officer in the Navy living in San Francisco with his wife Elle (played by Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam. He finds out that Joe has been arrested for trespassing in the quarantined area, forcing Ford to go back to Japan. Joe and Ford return to the quarantine zone to collect disks that reveal a cover up. They are arrested and taken to a facility where an egg hatches, unearthing a winged creature called a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) destroys that place and flies off to the United States. The scientists and the Navy reveal another creature, Godzilla, as the only thing that can fight off the MUTOS as Ford tries everything in his power to get back to his family.To combine a tragic story around a monster like Godzilla in today's time is hard to pull off. Does it work? It does in many areas. Last years Pacific Rim perfected the combination of having good human characters in a giant monster movie. Godzilla took a lesson by applying the same idea of good actors playing good characters. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's story of getting home was good, reminding me of War of the Worlds. Brian Cranston steels every scene as a broken man attempting to expose a conspiracy, even if we've seen this before. Even the story of the military trying to kill the monsters is good. What's missing is Godzilla himself. He doesn't show up until an hour in, but when he does, it brought me back to my childhood. The creature is given a modern, CGI look that is defiantly worthy of the title ""GODzilla"". I just wish there could have been more of him. He's in about twenty-five minutes of the entire movie, giving th story to the people. This is like getting a taste of a gourmet chefs food without getting the full dish. I guess it's better to have a little of something that great rather then to have too much of it.I'll give this seven rubber suit Godzilla's out of ten. Had their been just a little more monster action, this would have been one of the best of 2014, but I had fun. I was satisfied with the new American Godzilla. Lets just hope that if they make sequels, we get to see Mothra, Mechagodzilla or King Ghidorah fight the king of the monsters. Oh, and more Godzilla would be nice.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Decent reboot but feels lacking,"Unlike the 1998 disaster version of Godzilla, this film manages to capture Godzilla with a look and feel that feels closer to the 1954 film version which still remains a classic. Unlike the 98 film which portrays Godzilla more of a villain, this one portrays Godzilla as more of a hero and a defender of mankind just like in the cartoons. One of the perks in the film was the great casting choices particularly Bryan Cranston as Joe but felt as though the character was not given enough screen time to develop. I think Aaron Johnson was great as Joe's son ford. Elizabeth Olsen was also good as fords wife Elle Brody. I do feel as though one of the problems regarding the film was the look of the mute creatures which felt rather cheesy and Godzilla's on screen which didn't happen until an hour into the film. However the film did have plenty of action and destruction in addition to the debate of whether mankind is really in control of nature . I would say that the film is a definite for Godzilla hardcore fans. Just hope that the sequel is better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The characters were all great, there isn't a single bad performance - everyone treats this with respect and add an appropriately serious tone to the film. Ford Brody is my favorite as his strict code of Honor and morals was put to the test by malevolent creatures, which created some brilliant dilemmas and great duo scenes with his father (played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston). Themes were perfectly adapted from the original Gojira, which makes this 10x more dark and gritty!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Kinda ""Plan 9""ish... but still enjoyable.","I really would like to know why this flick is earning scads of IMDb ratings below 3! I guess I'll do a survey of the comments and look for a commonality.One thing for sure: There *is* a sort of ""Plan 9"" feel to the plot lead-up. It was beginning to look like we'd be left high/dry with respect to a binding mythos that lends credence to the concept. And then we finally get to the scene at Monarch where things sorta start to get explained; but it sounded a bit hollow, to me; like the alien fellow's speech in Plan 9 about why alien intelligence urgently needed to intervene in Earth matters. Yeah, it made a sort of sense, but... not really. They try to palm Cranston's character off as one of those crackpots-who-knew-all-along, but in the end it doesn't gel. You get the distinct feeling that Cranston's character was supposed to be tragic; but sadly, due to thematic mismanagement, he comes off as a bit pathetic.Now, I've never been a monster aficionado: As a kid, I tended to get scared easily, and wouldn't watch monster flicks, even while my buddies loved 'em. So I'm trying to play catch-up here. But I sense that the key to making a flick like this work is to skip the pretenses to high-toned theatrics and go for the gut: Create a visceral sense of power and primal, atavistic, animal angst. I really don't understand, in the least, all the commenter remonstrations to the effect that there's not enough monster action. There's plenty, plenty, plenty of very tastefully choreographed monster action in this flick; and it's powerful, primal, angry... all that!So, in the end, I give this guy a 7: It's not timeless art, but the producers, et.al. sought to paint a very big picture, and a big picture is delivered.

Met expectations,"It starts off medium paced with a tragic event that sort of gears the audience for what will be a roller coaster ride of events leading from one twist to another. I felt the movie met all my expectations of what a Godzilla movie should be. There weren't any WOW moments other than the moment when Godzilla shoots fire from his mouth. I felt most of the movie was aimed towards the other two monsters, rather than Godzilla himself. I believe the other two got more screen time. Overall, I am happy I got to see this Godzilla. The 1998 Godzilla had a better overall story line, and Godzilla was more involved in the 1998 film than this one. But I cannot say I am upset with the films production, and it's nice to see New York City make it through a city destruction film for a change.Godzilla was larger than life on the screen, and I was pleased with how amazing he looked, and especially the fire breathing attack he used. This film has me screaming ""Godzilla!!!"" Hope there is a sequel to follow.Met my expectation, didn't exceed a whole lot. I got what I paid for, good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Strangely refreshing implementation,"I'm not usually one to leave reviews under the circumstances I enjoy a film, as I would opine it makes more sense to leave them as a means of informing others of films that aren't worth their time, but, I feel compelled to make an exception for this film due to how overly stigmatized it is without sufficient criteria. I'll admit that I had prevised this to be another gimmicky, Michael Bay-esque train wreck upon viewing the trailers, yet, it seemed to maintain a reasonably engaging story along with convincing pseudo-science to explain the presence of the monsters in the first place.I would, however, opine that the character development was very lack-luster and the settings throughout the events of the film were void of any novelty whatsoever (I'm not quibbling about the fact that it takes place in Tokyo, I'm referring to the actual infrastructure and microcosmic settings throughout the film).So, in short, while it's nothing Kubrick and Spielberg would be groveling over, I would say that it's worth a view.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A one time watch movie, wouldn't buy a DVD","I love movies with good CGI and sci fi in general, so I was really looking forward to seeing Godzilla. I was somewhat disappointed for three reasons:1. Although the quality of visual effects was very high the monsters didn't look real, they were all black and some looked metallic. The movie would be more watchable if the monsters had more colours and texture.2. It is a good cast with good actors, but I blame the director for not pushing them to display emotions. Except Cranston all other main characters had the same plain facial expression even when they saw a monster for the first time. No change in facial expression to show astonishment and fear. Aaron and Elizabeth always had the same expression no matter what was happening to or around them, they looked like they were trying to read a restaurant menu.3. Overall it didn't feel like one-flow movie and lacked suspense. It felt like a patchwork.Im giving it 7/7 because of good quality special effects and that I watched in d-box, which made the experience more entertaining and less boring.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Half Effective Disaster Film, Half Monsters-fighting Nerds' Movie","Monster movies have been around since the dawn of Hollywood, but it's only now that they're gradually transforming into superhero movies as well because—as you all know—we're facing a drought of those. In this case, Godzilla starts off as a terrific tense disaster film that actually forced my mouth open at one point. The film cleverly keeps the first hour mysterious, refraining from showing too much of the monster or its background. Nerdy Godzilla fanboys might be complaining, but it's a very wise decision that definitely maximizes the impact of its first appearance. In fact, the movie started resembling 2005's King Kong and the Jurassic Park series with its initial reluctance to delve straight into the monster's destruction.Instead, we're introduced to the narrative's main characters and how they all tie into the big picture. Now, some might be underwhelmed by the ""dullness"" of these characters as some critics noted, but a 2-hour film that's predominantly focusing on a daunting creature can only do so much. It can stretch out to be 3 hours and both develop its characters and primary monster like King Kong (2005) did, but you all would still be whining. In my opinion, most of the actors do a good job with the material they're provided to work with—Bryan Cranston, as usual, showing his A-game and starting to separate himself from his famous role as Heisenberg. The film's concentration on its characters in the first half also allows for effective scenes that lead to the deaths of fairly significant individuals. As a result, the audiences are thus able to feel the danger of the whole situation with the establishment of greater suspense for the later acts on whether or not a certain character might die in a particular sequence.The tone, in large part, retains grittiness and a dark, hopeless aura sets in, which thankfully means moviegoers won't have to deal with forced humor throughout as we all know the mandate for summer blockbusters usually demands. With that being said, yes, this movie is an exceptional Godzilla film that intelligently builds the behemoth up for his first (chilling) appearance and from that moment on, all havoc is unleashed. Destruction befalls on every major city and millions of citizens perish underneath the rubble—everything that also makes for a fine disaster film at its foundation. Like I earlier mentioned, there are some highly tense, blood-curdling segments indeed, and in addition, a group of innocent kids are occasionally seen in the middle of it, thereby further fueling viewers' apprehension.On the other hand, no, Godzilla isn't perfect because it still suffers from its fair share of flaws as a film. First of all, Aaron Taylor Johnson, definitely the lead of the film, somehow persistently maintains his composure and remains reserved like a standard tough guy even when colossal monsters near to such a close distance that they can very well devour him in the split of a second. Seriously, I'd be screaming my lungs out, but of course, only the females in the movie are shrieking. For some reason, the kids in most films stereotypically gasp at some ""cool"" real-life action rather than crying for mommy and daddy. What?! I don't think that's how real adolescents behave. A lot of the kids in this film simply stare at all the horrific chaos with a demeanor of amazement, wowing at the sight of explosions in close proximity. It's a very superficial display of reality, as is usual with Hollywood blockbusters, in the midst of a story that's otherwise attempting to portray terror through reasonable realism.And then, I really have to ask: is Godzilla just King Kong 2.0? Herein, we're supposed to feel sympathy for the Brobdingnagian force because he's yet another superhero who breathes florescent fire and extricates humans from other scary monsters. Along the vein of popular superheroes like Batman and Spider-Man, he immediately comes to the rescue whenever there's any hint of a notable character in jeopardy. With or without the gargantuan monster's aid, some characters are still conveniently spared from immense danger even though everyone else around them is essentially doomed.See, what occurs in the movie that first posed as a despairing disaster film of monumental proportions is a noticeable tonal shift in its last act. It's decently realistic and gloomy at first only to suddenly reshape into a Pacific Rim 2.0, offering us a few grandiose Kaiju battles. Given the fact that I haven't seen the original Godzilla pictures, I entered the theater hoping that this would turn out to be a ""humans versus Godzilla"" movie, but that would ultimately mean unstoppable obliteration. The filmmakers basically took the easy route out and ensured the security of a happy ending. After all has been said and done, I believe a recommendation for this film would be fair as its first hour and a half is nicely constructed and depicted for it's as good of a Godzilla film as we could ever possibly get. Keep in mind, though, that its two hours, overall, do seem unusually lengthy for some odd reason.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla times 3,"Third time is a charm, right? Wrong! In this film everything that makes Godzilla is being turned upside down and transformed into a propaganda movie for the American way of life. How can a Japanese icon created as a metaphor for the nuclear threat become the symbol of the USA supremacy? Spin away!First the monsters are ancient predators from when the Earth was radioactive, so it is not the fault of humans for their existence and any such responsibility is voided. In fact, the Bikini atoll nuclear tests were purposeful in attempting to destroy one of these monsters. Also, the creatures don't spread radioactivity, in fact they feed off it. Just put a monster egg near Fukushima and the radioactivity will magically vanish. Godzilla is actually there to preserve balance, like some kind of ancient giant Avatar: when two monsters wake up from their slumber and decide to procreate in San Francisco, Godzilla comes to the rescue and fights them both, then goes back home.Second, the entire decision process rests solely in the hands of the American military, even when they were in Japan. They simply come and take control. The news are all American and the trek of two giant monsters moving from Japan to San Francisco is just an afterthought that happens in a few minutes. The hero is a US soldier, conveniently son of a scientist obsessed with these monsters and, almost naturally, married to a medical nurse and having a small child whose only purpose is to look cute and ask for his mommy.So other than the monster fights, which are kind of boring with some exceptions, and the rather silly quest of this one guy to get to San Francisco to his family instead of telling them to get out, you get epic music, military music, motivational music, military propaganda, derision of science, arrested Americans demanding things, even some Christian prayers and lots and lots of gung-ho soldiers firing ineffective weapons at skyscraper size monsters.Oh, and in the end, after entire cities are devastated, which involves hundreds of thousands dead, a lot of respiratory related diseases in the making, Godzilla is applauded for the service it performed to restore balance.Bottom line: a complete failure from multiple standpoints: storyline, script, actor charisma, acting quality, soundtrack, logic, even action scenes. I mean can you believe that the most noticeable character for me was Elizabeth Olsen, just because she was looking nice and that was her entire role anyway?

Godzilla has only had limited amount of screen time through out the movies by TOHO, the creators. The Godzilla from 1998 was a disgrace and wasn't even Godzilla, because TOHO made a movie after that, that kicked 1998's butt. TOHO watched 2014 Godzilla and said it was a fantastic movie, but that wasn't why I went to see it. The movie was great, it had beautiful camera work, and it was suspenseful.

"A magnificent, ambitious and often astonishing epic let down by minor clichés.","Since the awful disappointment of the 90's remake of Godzilla, the arrival of a new and more refined version stimulated a great deal of anticipation in me! The new trailer was expertly made, I was very, very excited. After months of speculation from my family, I finally got the chance to see it. What a clichéd, delightful surprise. In all honesty, Godzilla lived up to its expectations. Making a B-movie into a more realistic film is a hard job but director Gareth Edwards delivers a satisfying disaster movie that only some audiences, including myself, will fully appreciate. It's superior, reputable and full-out epic but it's greatness also turns into it's weakness. Clichés. Almost every film in the modern world accept clichés into it's script and this is one of them. Godzilla rightfully tries to avoid the garbage clichés but fails to contain them through it's love story between Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford and Elizabeth Olson's Elle. Their performances are respectable, they are fine but Bryan Cranston, who is famous for brilliantly portraying Walter White in television series Breaking Bad, steals the show as Joe Brody, the father figure who is shown obsessed with how mysterious signs of Godzilla's presence have appeared. Joe tries to study the signs along with the Japanese guy in Inception, and the story unfolds. In the story, astonishing surprises unfold and sadly I cannot continue to explain the story with spoiling it! To put it in words, it is unexpected and actually quite clever. Through it's surprises, Godzilla's power is unleashed and the film turns into an action- fest, without showing all the destruction it actually can. It avoids it, but the ending has plenty of it. Having said, I admired its ending because really the film is a guilty pleasure, like Pacific Rim. It was made for people's entertainment and it is easily recognisable in Edwards' direction. The devastating lizard / dinosaur / crocodile / dragon has plenty of astonishing action. Godzilla kicking butt is definitely a guilty pleasure to watch. I would, however, liked to have seen it in IMAX 3D. It think the experience would be even more admirable. This is because the visuals in Godzilla are incredible, Godzilla is a breathtaking beast! At times, you actually root for Godzilla to wreak havoc, you'll understand when you watch the film. The suspense is also really well executed.Pros and Cons:+ Fantastic Godzilla action + Unexpected, cleverly executed story elements + Bryan Cranston's bombshell performance + Great visuals + Brilliant suspense - An acquired taste for some audiences - Expected clichés - Human characterisation doesn't fully pay offIn all, Godzilla is both questionable and astonishing. For the full experience, go and see it in IMAX.Verdict = 8 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The year American cinema died,"2014 has been a woefully bad year for Hollywood. Producers are scraping the bottom of the barrel for franchises to reboot. Now here comes the latest remake of 'Godzilla', a pointless two-hour borefest during which the main character is barely even seen.I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan, and the initial positive reviews for this movie made me cautiously optimistic. Well, big mistake. There is nothing extraordinary about this Summer Blockbuster, and everything typical about it. Frankly, the whole film feels like a cheat, a ripoff designed to lure moviegoers with the most minimal plot possible. Lazy filmmaking to be sure. The mediocre 1998 version, and even last year's 'Pacific Rim' had more charm than 'Godzilla', which forces us to suffer through an hour of pointless human drama before we even see Godzilla.We have no emotional connection to these characters. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the entire movie is the actor cast in the lead. He's wooden, uncharismatic, and vanilla.The film itself looks very dark, with thick black smoke and red lights occasionally peeping through. It's actually hard to see what's going on. The soundtrack alternates between silence and blaring, to clue us in that there's a monster on screen.Yes, there's one very well made scene (which every other commenter has mentioned) when the paratroopers jump into the action with vivid red smoky flares. In fact they put this scene on the movie poster. Well, one nice scene doesn't compensate for the rest of 'Godzilla', which is a failure on every level.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

IMAX saved this movie,"First of all, this movie's target audience are the classic Godzilla fans, not the '98 Godzilla.

I'd watch those scenes again, maybe even on a flat screen, but nothing more of this movie. Yeah, the plot sucked hard, and yeah, the acting was pretty low, but if I wanted an overall good movie I would have watched one in the comfort of my home, or on a regular 2D cinema screen.

That's what the movie was made for.I give 4/10 to the whole movie, but given the visual and audio experience on a relatively reduced amount of movie time, I'd go for 6/10; could have rated more if at least the fight scenes were longer and not so teasing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Epic Godzilla,"It's hard to believe It's been 60 years since Godzilla first appeared on the big screen. Now after the awful attempt by Sony Pictures back in 1999 from Roland Emmerich, we final have Godzilla done right. A movie that will help G-Fans relieve their childhood. Director Gareth Edwards and writer Max Borenstein pull out all the stops in this CGI monster romp. Like many have said, the cgi in this film just blows my mind. Godzilla looks great and is a perfect mesh of old and new. Last Years Pacific Rim came close, but Godzilla is the perfect way to spend your time at the movies. Is the story perfect? no, but it hits the right notes and Edwards taking his play book from Spielberg and Jaws teases us just right until the big showdown at the end. Actor Bryan Cranston helps the material shine even more with his appearance at the beginning. I wished he had more screen time, but Ken Watanabe is also there to help out. Not a perfect film, but one filled with action, excitement, thrills and plenty of Godzilla screen time to release the inner kid in anyone. This is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Stealing Guillermo Del Toro's words for Pacific RIm, Godzilla is a great, great poem to one of the biggest movie icon.","If you have come looking for characters and development, there is not much to find here, unfortunately. It is kind of bummer when the movie does boast a very decent cast. Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame does have his few moments initially, but later he is reduced to conspiracy mumbling scientist. His rather wooden son, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson, is a military boy who returns home only to find the world under a far greater threat. Elizabeth Olsen plays the loving and caring wife, but don't go looking for emotional epiphany there either. Ken Watanabe is mostly found in one or two positions, either he is spewing deeper philosophical ramifications of Godzilla's presence or he is just stunned with the proceedings. But then the actors are not to be blamed, because the story does not provide much of an area for the actors to make the characters their own and the clunky story telling leaves much to be desired from the humans. Gareth Edwards tries to give a logical coherence to the movie that takes itself seriously, but as monster movies always tend to be, Godzilla is filled with plot holes and logic debridement. The story deliberately uses the human characters to be the vehicles to tell the story of the heroic adventure of Godzilla through their eyes, and also as a scale to measure the enormity of the monsters. Gareth Edwards has worked meticulously to build up an atmosphere with great construct of light and shadow that varies with each of the set pieces. The set pieces are huge and Edwards have tried to bring phenomenal outrageous craziness to these locations so that when the monsters hit, one could shudder at the reality of it if it did ever happen. But that does not work much towards infusing us with terror, since the human emotional context is entirely missing. But it does manage to fill us with awe. When the monsters break out onto the screen or leave mayhem in their path, we find ourselves watching a lyrical celluloid of mayhem, destruction and monstrosity with the realisation of the colossal nature of the beasts and our minute existence. In the last epic battle as the giants fight in the shadow of smokes and darkness in the middle of a city, the fight takes on the form of gigantic proportions on which the fate of the humanity is precariously balanced. Godzilla is not much of a movie with enough emotional resonance, but it is a monster movie through and through. You may lament for mere twenty minutes of Godzilla's presence, but then you would be entirely missing the point of movie if you couldn't find monsters on the screen in their absence. It is one of the few beauties of Godzilla. For many the build up of Godzilla may be intolerable and the brief final battle too short, but if one can look at the amount of technical and visual wizardry and Edwards' vision has gone to create a monster movie that is about atmosphere, build up and visual spectacle, and to what wonderful poetry those are translated on the screen, you would be able to appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Worst movie ever made, if you count the production cost.","Short told. I think twice before i give 1's and 10's.I never ever thought I'd give this movie a 1.

Using this recipe you just throw in recycled love stories, meaningless effects, a story written just so you can show off as much effects as possible, hire a bad director because he wont charge you that much, hire completely useless and inexperienced script writers because they don't dare to ask for a salary, and pay Bryan Cranston a million bucks to appear in a small role (so that in the trailer, they give you the impression the movie is really serious and great).Well..

It just didn't make sense that Godzilla swam all the way from japan to San Francisco to fight the MUTOs and then he just swam back after smiling for the cameras. And this movie is rated higher than the movie which came out in 1998. That movie was better off by miles. Some people might have liked it after watching all the CGI in theaters.

Great monster picture,"Gareth Edward's Godzilla is a good science fiction film and one most people will enjoy- provided they aren't fans of the Godzilla myth and history. Then perhaps they may feel the film is overlong, it doesn't show the giant lizard as much as it should or other trivialities. The setup is simple- We meet a research couple in Japan trying to figure out why the surrounding areas around a nuclear plant has strange activity going on. There is an accident and the wife is killed leaving the husband to go eccentric. We transport to the future where the couple's son- our hero has his young family. Soon a giant lizard appears on the fray and starts creating chaos in the American cities as we follow the young son's travails. The film is competently directed and features some nice scenes. The characters are also relatable. CGI is not over the top even though later on there are quite a few giant bugs and monsters onscreen. Edwards's first film Monster has a similar blueprint to Godzilla in that he prefers to show the characters with the monsters in the backdrop servicing more as an underlying theme.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A solid comeback for my childhood hero,"I have grown up with the classic Japanese Godzilla movies that I first discovered when I was around eight or nine years old. I liked so many things about these movies: the looks of the monsters, the epic battle scenes, the different technical gimmicks, the detailed and handmade special effects, the emotional soundtracks, the diversified side stories and many references to Japanese culture. When I saw the first American ""Godzilla"" adaption as a child, I was rather disappointed and thought of it as a missed attempt at putting a ""Jurassic Park"" monster in a metropolis. As a child, I was then asking my parents to find the first original Godzilla movie that I had heard and read about and when my father finally came home with a videotape of it, I preferred this dark, diversified, philosophical movie that explored at least four genres at the same time (being a detailed action movie, a philosophical drama, a bleak horror movie and an innovating science-fiction film) to any movie I had ever seen before. Until today, the original movie from 1954 is one of my all-time favourite films and a classic any cineaste must see.Until today, I have watched almost all Godzilla movies and while I adore most of them (my favourites being ""Godzilla"" (1954), ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"" (1964), ""Invasion of Astro-Monster"" (1965), ""Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla"" (1974), ""The Return Of Godzilla"" (1984), ""Godzilla versus King Ghidorah"" (1991) and ""Godzilla versus Destoroyah"" (1995) among others), I thought it was a good idea to end the series with the fiftieth anniversary and a last epic movie called ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" back in 2004 because the franchise started to run out of ideas. Ten years later, the world's most famous Kaiju is back. As a longtime fan I was excited that my childhood hero was back on screen but on the other side I felt that everything had been said about Godzilla and that the first American movie was of a low average quality at best.While the new movie is nothing revolutionary and not a far call from many classic Japanese movies without reaching the perfection of the unbeatable original, the new film is much better than the first American Godzilla movie.I liked the slow start of the movie including a scientific story that is slightly inspired by the original but also by current events as the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. The strongest acting parts of the movie can be seen in the first thirty minutes or so and immediately get you into the story. The idea of two new monsters that would compete with Godzilla took me a little bit by surprise and really goes back to the Japanese classics which is a positive fact for a longtime fan. The final battle scenes in San Francisco are entertaining and visually stunning. Most importantly, the looks of Godzilla are great and feature all trademarks fans like about him from his atomic breath to his unique roars. The king of monsters looks a little bit bigger and heavier than the original but I think it looks extremely beautiful. Maybe Godzilla almost looks too sympathetic which is reminding me of the movies of the sixties and seventies rather than the original film or the last Japanese films. In comparison to the last few movies of the franchise, Godzilla is actually playing a the role of a hero and not a villain again which was another positive surprise to me.Obviously, there are also a few minor negative elements in here. Apart of the great and touching first thirty minutes or so, the acting in this movie is a little bit wooden and stereotypical. I'm sorry to say this but child actor Carson Bolde is one of the worst of its kind. His character almost doesn't speak, has only one facial expression and looks like he had a severe Down syndrome. While watching the first thirty minutes, I thought it was going to be an extraordinary movie but a few lengths and the lack of high quality acting made the final result a very good film but not an absolute highlight. Another really negative element is that Godzilla almost only plays a secondary role in this movie apart of the last thirty minutes. The king of monsters doesn't have much screening time but once it is there, it really shines. The movie rather focuses on the two other monsters. I don't want to spoil anything but the two new monsters look somewhat artificial and have no unique charisma. The story around these two monsters had some potential but they are mostly unimpressive in the end and among the most boring opponents Godzilla ever had. On a side note, let's add that the soundtrack of this movie is unimpressive and never comes close to the emotional and epic Japanese soundtracks.In the end, the first thirty minutes of the movie are creative and intense while the final battle scenes in the last thirty minutes are entertaining and epic at some points. In between, the weak acting, the lack of screen time for Godzilla and the unimpressive new monsters slow the pace of the movie a little bit down. Fans of the franchise might analyze this film as a good and solid comeback but no extraordinary one. Enjoy and watch it without further hesitation if you are still undecided. After all, the new looks of Godzilla and its unique charisma (yes, a monster can have charisma and it's probably the best ""actor"" in this movie) left me wanting more by the end of the movie. This is a well done tribute to the classics with convincing settings from the Phillipines over Japan to Hawaii and San Francisco. The special effects are as stunning as you can expect. I would call this movie a solid success after all. I'm in love with my childhood hero again and really hope Godzilla will be back.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Amazing CGI and brawls, but","I had the highest expectations for this film, the trailers looked amazing and I couldn't wait to see it.Unfortunately the trailers were very misleading when it came to the lead rolls of the film.

Personally I didn't find myself caring for any of them.No one really had a prime role in the film apart from the son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) everyone appeared to be a kind of side show with far too much chatter going on and no real feeling.I didn't really get the feeling of fear, shock or any genuine reaction from anyone when the Monster first appears and starts causing chaos. It was all very underwhelming.However, when it came to the battles, explosions and CGI work it was quite something. Godzilla really had a darker tone to its design and it was nice to see him shown to have actual intelligence and not just be a mindless Monster bent on destroying everything and eating all the fish.

"See it Twice, it makes all the difference.","Originally when I went to this movie I gave it a score of 7 out of 10. It had excellent action and great CGI, but to me it felt kind of empty and that it was missing some things. While I don't think there was too little Godzilla, the emphasis is never solely on him; the MUTOs sorta steal the show this way.Unfortunately I was a victim of my expectations and hype the first time I saw this as it detracted from the experience. I saw it again last night, and let me tell you, man was I blown away! Even more so than the first time I saw it! How they use Godzilla in this movie is definitely different, but it is truly phenomenal and something special. I can see this movie only improving with time, and being added to the likes of Jaws, Jurassic Park and Alien as sorta classic monster movies.Additionally, this movie is just fresh. It stands out from all your other token blockbuster flicks like Spiderman and Xmen because of the way the story builds and feels.

An unsatisfying sci-fi thriller,"The storytelling is messy and the plot lacks credibility. The acting performances of some actors are questionable.

Godzilla returns triumphant!!,"First of all, we needed this reboot!! 10 years after the crazy and awesome Japanese flick Godzilla: Final Wars, we have a reboot that has the same urgency feel of the original, released in 1954 and directed by the kaiju master Ishiro Honda (Rodan, Mothra, Space Amoeba).The drama part feels kinda hurried and unsympathetic - Aaron Taylor- Johnson's fault - but the rest of the movie, counting the King of the Monsters, the new monsters called MUTOs and Bryan Cranston (with a little of Ken Watanabe in the mix), make the 123 minutes pass too fast.All in all, Godzilla is back and he wants his throne back!!Thank you Gareth Edwards!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
For the fans.,"If you are not into the Godzilla lore, then stay away from this film. You won't like it. If Godzilla mythology isn't your thing, and you simply want to see a good, visual action-flick, then skip this one. It's nothing you haven't seen before.The thing with Godzilla is that it differs from other monster films, which are mostly all style and no substance. Believe it or not, Godzilla at its core is film with a message--and a film that makes you wonder what scientists are doing behind the scenes...horrible things...that destroy the Earth.As a Godzilla fan, it's easy to give this film a 7/10 because I'm biased towards it. However, it is far from the best Godzilla film ever made. There was very little philosophy in the script, and only a few lines to provoke thought.The acting was atrocious...and yes, atrocious is the proper word here. The only exception is the role played by Brian Cranston, who absolutely stole every scene he was in. I was however, highly disappointed in the acting of almost everyone else in the film. There was no proper display of fear coming out of everyone from the main star, Taylor Johnson, to the extras, and to the military personnel. It was bad, really, really bad! Luckily, the film looked beautiful. Hauntingly beautiful. Godzilla fans will cheer in the end. Casual fans may not.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome!,Worth the wait and teaser trailers weren't even close to all the movie had to offer. Saw in three D and felt like cast fleeing for their lives. The creators got Godzilla as he should be. Toho shouldn't have much to complain about. Those of us that felt robbed by the 1998 version will come away quite satisfied after seeing this version. Hope they do a sequel because was worth price of admission and plenty of old nemesis's that could be dredged up. Only complaint could of had more daylight action sequences. Also felt fresh and not rehashed from original. Overall would see again in theater and will add to my DVD collection.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Now With 100% Less Matthew Broderick,"A nuclear meltdown 15 years ago bears striking resemblance to some current issues with the area now. What secrets are the government hiding away in the quarantined zone? When a freak of nature breaks lose from the cocoon it was encased in, another comes in to restore balance to the nature of things, while we try to get in his way....he is Godzilla.There's a lot going on in Godzilla, so I'll give it credit for trying to bring something to the table that the original Americanized version did not. The size and scope of this entry is bigger and better. Gareth Edwards, the guy behind the independent special effects heavy flick Monsters, has been given a monster size of a budget to direct this decades old creature and possible restart a franchise. His delivery of Godzilla is a mess, but it beautiful mess.The film is gorgeous to look at. Seeing the destruction of the world while these massive beasts tango is a marvellous achievement. Edwards teases the audience a lot here. Just when we are about to see the showdown, he cuts away and we only get glimpses of it on the television. A neat way to build up our anticipation for the destruction that is sure to ensue in the climax. He does this one too many times though and the teases become irritating. Show us what we want: Destruction, Mayhem, GODZILLA.The special effects are astounding, that's a given. Edwards fully develops these creatures in a life like environment and the destruction they cause feels real. The size and scope of these creatures are leaps and bounds over what Emmerich gave us in the late 90's. The fighting between the monsters is a little rough, Del Toro has more of a craft to it with Pacific Rim. Here it feels more like a brawl, rightfully so.Godzilla does the cardinal sin of false advertising. I can't really fault the film for this, but I do feel that it was a mistake creatively to kill off certain characters early in the film. There is no emotional catalyst for our lead hero here. It feels forced to try and make those connections it desperately wants the viewer to see and brings the film to sometimes boring sections. The human characters fill out their clichéd roles fine enough. Cranston is dynamite as the guy who is right about ominous things, but nobody believes him. Johnson is our lead, a good guy with father issues, trying to make it back home to his family and be the dad he never had. David Strathairn does his Jason Bourn military shtick and finally we have two actors who do absolutely nothing in the film. First is Ken Watanabe with very few lines, but serious looks here and there. He's our ""let's explain everything"" guy. The other is Elizabeth Olsen, who has done excellent work, as the wife of our lead. Her job is....I'm still confused here because she isn't even the damsel in distress. She is screen filler. Then last, but not least we have Godzilla, who is barely in the film.Cardboard characters are to be expected in a monster flick....but aren't monsters expected to be in monster flicks? The guy's name is on the poster and Godzilla has the least amount of screen time here. The other creatures are cool looking as well and I really got into the ""history"" of when they first showed up and stuff, I just wish they explored that a tad bit more. The film is insanely serious. No real moments of brevity.I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, in the hopes that they take this in some kind of direction and not chug out Godzilla VS whatever creature the fans want now....I have my hopes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pass the Popcorn! review,"The Godzilla (or, in Japanese, Gojira) franchise features a series of 28 original Japanese Kaiju (""monster"") movies. Inspired by the success of 'King Kong', the first 'Godzilla' was released in 1954 and was extremely influential, and it was adapted by Americans into 'Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'. Godzilla inspired many other movies, video games and comics. Four Godzilla movies have been produced in America and one in Italy (also known as Cozzilla),while North Korea released 'Pulgasari', which was similar to Godzilla. The monster was created as an allegory of the effects and consequences of the hydrogen bomb, and represented the Japanese fear of the Hiroshima disaster happening again. This 'Godzilla' is a reboot of the one from 1954, and not a remake of the badly received 1998 version.In 1999, a couple of researchers are investigating the finding of a massive skeleton under an excavation site in the Philippines, along with a strange cocoon attached to it, and one that has apparently hatched. In Japan, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is worried that the periodical 'earthquakes' occurring lately may cause damage unless the nuclear power plant he's working in is shut down. As his wife (Juliette Binoche) approaches the reactor to check it for damage, a strong tremor causes a breach in the reactor, Joe's wife's death, and the collapse of the building. Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) lives in the USA but is called to Japan to bail his father out, who's been trespassing in order to find out what really happened the day his wife died. At the 'abandoned' nuclear plant, that has been turned into a military-protected research center, what happened in 1999 starts happening again.Interestingly enough, the two characters that looked like main characters in the trailer – Godzilla and Joe (Bryan Cranston) – are the ones you'll see the least in the movie. I didn't find this characteristic to be that bad, in regards to Godzilla. It manages to build tension and expectation as you wait for the monster to appear, and it also gives you time to appreciate the monsters Godzilla's fighting – the so-called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms). But the fact that Aaron Taylor-Johnson was the 'human lead', instead of Bryan Cranston, was just bad. Because Mr Kick-Ass isn't a good actor, has no charisma, and the public doesn't get anything from the script that can help sympathize with him. He has a wife and small child, and I could really care less, because most of the (too many) actors in the movie are just expendable and forgettable. The dialogues don't help, either.On the bright side, like I said, the movie is tense. Many scenes occur at night, in silence – when all of a sudden a huge monster appears and destroys everything while shrieking maniacally, which is just beautiful. The CGI is great and the cinematography doesn't disappoint, just like the majestic soundtrack. There aren't as many action scenes as one would expect, and the MUTOs and Godzilla are gradually revealed, up until the final big fight. The fact that some serious effort has been put into creating an interesting story – and actually, the mere fact that there is a story, gives this movie an automatic thumbs up. All in all, this 'Godzilla' is an interesting, tense, fun monster movie to watch, that can be appreciated by newbies and long-term fans of the franchise equally.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla's resurrection,"We are facing one of the greatest threats that have been filmed Godzilla. We can appreciate the detailed environment surrounding this colossus as a tiny humanity comes to dealing with their appearance.

Moreover we will see in its glory this mythical reptile making mischief. However I would add that there is something that ends up not fit in this movie, maybe you can go to see it and realize for yourself.In conclusion I can say that is a good movie to watch this season and is suitable for the whole family.

Long Live the King of all Monsters!,"The movie has delivered to its original roots like it did from 1954. The monsters fighting scene, included the effects of CGI, were indeed outstanding - as if they were real! Our King's roar does shake the whole theater as it was like the whole building was about to collapse! I actually got scared TWICE - Once from the MUTO hatching scene, and the other was... I cannot even remember! GAH! But, those scenes actually got me good!The reason why I gave the score 8/10 is because the lack of human characteristics as it's rather dull - Bryan Cranston did a wonderful and excellent job, he's an awesome actor and I give credit for delivering a powerful feel about the movie; As for the rest, they need to add a bit more of 'Umph!' into the movie or even more screen time? Godzilla, on the other hand, has more feel and made me think He was a real creature - He is indeed The reborn and King of all Monsters as how he has shown and battled against the MUTOs. In the end, I actually felt quite sympathetic and empathetic to those the characters who were going through all the havoc causes by the forces of nature.Overall, the movie was both epic and awesome! I do hope it'll make a big hit in its home country this coming July.

Somewhat entertaining movie with a lousy script,"Why must Hollywood scriptwriters of some genres of movies, especially monster, superhero and horror movies, so often think that the audience are total idiots? Or maybe they themselves are severely lacking in brainpower and do not understand the level of trash in what they spew out. In Godzilla scriptwriter Dave (David) Callaham should have a special dishonorable mention for ruining a promising movie.The movie started of with the obligatory nuclear power plant scenes. When it started I first thought, oh no not the blame nuclear power scare again. However, as it turned out, this was not so. Unfortunately, this was pretty much the only good part in the entire script. The rest of the script is just a collection of illogical, unintelligent garbage.It starts quite quickly when Ford's father suddenly pulls of his mask, takes a sniff, and declares that there is no radioactivity in the air. Only a scientifically ignorant idiot writes something like that. Then we have the scene were the soldiers rush into The Nevada nuclear waste facility and checks the inspection hatch on every door until they find one where there is a light only to discover that the monster have broken free and left a gargantuan hole. A huge monster have broken through the walls of a nuclear waste facility leaving a whole big enough to drive a battleship through and no one would have noticed until some marines goes around and inspects the doors on the inside? Again, you have to be pretty unintelligent to write a scene like that.The entire plot is basically the same unintelligent mess. They follow the creatures around until they reach civilization. First then do they actually try and do something. That is just so nonsensical. In the case that a huge city-destroying creature would approach any large population center it would be blasted way before it reached it. Also, when they do attack they fire some light weaponry and maybe a tank gun or two against it. If millions of people were at risk I think it is not a very far fetched belief that the military would throw everything they had at the threat. And do not get me started on the hair-brained scheme of luring out the monsters to the sea with a nuke. What a load of bullocks! Okay, so with all this ranting, why did I give the movie as much as 6 out of 10 stars? Well, I am a fan of huge monster movies and the parts where the monsters rampage around destroying things or slugging it out against each others are great. Unfortunately this is pretty much the good that can be said about this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla As A Force Of Nature,"Gareth Edwards directed this serious and sober-minded modern remake of the memorable 1954 Japanese original that stars Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody, a former nuclear plant supervisor in Japan who lost his co-worker wife in a near-meltdown, who 15 years later becomes convinced that it was no accident, and after infiltrating the sealed-off area of the plant with his now grown son(played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) discovers to their horror that the situation was worse than they feared, with a gigantic mutated creature on the rampage, searching for an equally mutated mate, but not reckoning on the intervention by a force of nature to restore balance - Godzilla...Well-made film has outstanding CGI to bring Godzilla to realistic life like never before, with fine acting and an intelligent story balancing the impressive monster fighting and large-scale action scenes.

"""I bet he's here to restore balance. He can defeat them.""","I have mixed feelings on this movie. I liked it but felt it could have been so much better. The first hour drags on but I guess that's because it's taboo to do a movie under two hours these days if you want to be taken seriously as a filmmaker. The biggest gripe I have is one I'm sure is shared by many other viewers. Namely that Godzilla doesn't become a big part of the movie until late and so we basically have over an hour of a two-hour Godzilla movie devoted to humans and a new monster (with a terribly boring design). Once he does show up, the action and special effects are good but never so impressive as to make you forget the long wait. Of the humans, Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe are both good, as you might expect. Cranston is not the star, as the trailers would lead you to believe. The star is Aaron Taylor-Johnson and he does a fine job though nothing particularly noteworthy. Elizabeth Olsen, whom I adore, is largely wasted in a supported part where her only purpose is to survive the movie to be reunited with her husband. So is it worth seeing? Yes but temper your expectations. It's not as good as the original Godzilla (either version) or as much fun as the sequels. In many ways it has more in common with director Gareth Edwards' previous film, Monsters, than it does with Godzilla. If you liked Monsters (and I did) you'll probably like this.

Major Movie Review: Godzilla (2014),"I have this mental list that I'm pretty proud of, it's a list that I like to call the ""HOLY TITS LIST"".What kind of list is that?It's a list of movie scenes that blew my mind and made ME squeal in my seat, like a pig being speared in the ribs, because it was pure, awesome, movie magic. That happened while watching this movie and to my embarrassment, my girlfriend knows what that sounds like now.

An earthquake of sorts causes travesty at this plant and it triggers events that brings us to present day. Over the years Joe has become dedicated to find out what the hell really caused that seismic activity and ruined his life. Meanwhile, ""natural disasters"" have been happening all over the place and soon enough it's obvious that some giant, menacing monster could be walking around and that's no good for humanity.

Gareth Edwards fails to do justice to the monster's legacy.,"If you've seen the trailer for this Godzilla film you probably thought that it would be a more faithful yet serious take on Japan's most famous monster. In the trailer Godzilla looked like a real threat. It seemed frightening the way it was portrayed. In the film though this isn't the case. We're yet again in that summer movie territory where the trailer was more inspired than the film itself. Does The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) come to mind? I think that the big reason why many people were disappointed with this Godzilla film is its lack of originality. If you pause and look at what's happening you'll see that it's actually very similar to the 1998 Godzilla film directed by Roland Emmerich. Godzilla is portrayed as a monster with some intelligence. It becomes a sympathetic creature. The American military and navy get involved, something that we've seen many times in Hollywood films recently. And, to top it all off, there's more focus on the human characters than on Godzilla. In fact, much time passes before the Big G even makes an appearance. So, just as in the 1998 film, we're forced to watch a typical human drama before anything exciting happens. But at least the 1998 film was entertaining. And it was a film about Godzilla. This 2014 film is lacking both Godzilla and entertainment. It's a summer movie, so I expected to be entertained. Instead I was left wondering what happened when the film ended. It wasn't just me. Other people in the theater were criticizing it right after it ended. Director Gareth Edwards really didn't have enough experience to make a big budget summer movie. The monster fights lack excitement, the acting is wooden, and the clichéd script lacks intelligence. I don't think that Edwards is a bad filmmaker. I think that he's an inexperienced filmmaker. His 2010 low-budget feature Monsters is a technical triumph that showed some promise. Max Borenstein's lazy script and studio interference are the two things that really ruined this film in my opinion. In a monster movie one would at least expect some exciting action but this film fails even at that. In addition, it's obvious that Edwards took the Jaws (1975) approach of obscuring the creature for much of the film's running time. Jaws, however, features interesting human characters and terrific performances. It keeps on movin' when the big shark isn't around. The human characters and performances in Edwards' Godzilla are flat, resulting in a truly dull middle section. Only Bryan Cranston, playing Joe Brody, stands out. Cranston is definitely one of the best Hollywood actors working now. His performance alone made this film bearable at the beginning, but even then the story's shortcomings were already noticeable. I have to admit that I had doubts about this film. I usually read reviews on a certain website before I go to the cinema. This time I made the mistake of reading the early positive reviews on IMDb, so I didn't wait for the review on that favorite website of mine. As it turned out, that website was right yet again and this Godzilla film made for an unpleasant night at the cinema. Some Godzilla fans might like what Edwards did, but casual moviegoers should definitely not buy a ticket. Remember, as was the case with the 1998 film, there's no hiding that this is a Western production. It has none of the quirks and cultural aspects of the Japanese films.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The opening scene is really the only one that is pretty emotional and you actually care about the characters.

But the plot is not bad, in fact it is very interesting that there are other monsters around the planet fighting to rule our world.

"Great CGI, but too much filler material and not enough Godzilla","Godzilla fans like myself aren't here to watch Masterpiece Theater or a soap opera, but to watch the monsters battle it out. So why did Godzilla have such a small part in this movie? It took so long for the beasts to fight it out. Meanwhile, way too much time is devoted to Aaron Taylor-Johnson's family life. It wasn't acted or scripted badly, but it contributed little to the movie except for length. The film has an openly anti-nuclear power message, which is fine, but that was stated too many times. The result of a nuclear power accident is that it causes the creation of two monsters, which resemble locusts, and if they mate, it'll endanger the human race. As a result, Godzilla awakens and arises from the ocean to protect the earth.

It's not Epic it's wonderful and gorges,"this movie is not pacific rim (not mindless action) ,this movie is about the humans and one hero who fought for us, non Godzilla fans will never like this movie but Gareth Edwards did an spectacular job for the fans,letting animals be like animals , i hope they wont make a sequel because for me this movie was perfect and if the do they will kill Godzilla ,the movies teasing wasn't the best tho i wish they teased by showing the monster fights from a distance that would be great.I loved all the human characters ,Bryan Cranston,Aron Taylor's,Ken Watanabe, Every one i loved them. and Gareth showed something new about Godzilla , is that Godzilla's emotional side, of course he is an animal,he suppose to have one but when he was dying to protect Ford and the rest of the humans , I was crying for Godzilla, i have never done that before in the previous movies,i left the movie with tears of joy that's why i say this movie is of the hook.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A refreshing take on Godzilla..,"The king of monsters is back and better than ever! After the 1998 ""Godzilla"" movie I was worried we would never get another truly great ""Godzilla"" flick. But along comes Gareth Edwards, who made the indie movie ""Monsters"", to breathe new life into the giant lizard. Brief side note, ""Monsters"" was the 1st movie I ever wrote a review on for rotten tomatoes. It was about 2 sentences long:-p This movie is awesome and succeeds where ""Pacific Rim"" fails, but where that movie succeeds, is what holds this back. There is a some truly awesome monster fighting here, but I do wish there was more. I liked all the human actors, but I do wish there was more Godzilla. Having said that, what Godzilla there is, it's amazing. He looks phenomenal, and there's more than a couple times during the movie where you will want to cheer. The effects are amazing, and the overall story is pretty good. Heard there is a sequel on the way, and I cannot wait. The more Godzilla, the better! Great Summer movie to just sit down, chow on some popcorn and get lost in the carnage.watch movie Godzilla 2014 online stream visit http://gg.gg/kaiju2014Overall, Godzilla is not only a very good summer blockbuster, I think its the best movies I've seen this year so far. The action is fantastic, the effects are top notch, the acting is incredible, and it's entertaining as hell.

"An uneven, but entertaining film that suffers from lack of Godzilla.","Godzilla is one of the most well known and recognizable movie characters of all time. His name and image has been ingrained into our pop culture vocabulary for decades. Even people who have never seen a Godzilla film, know the name. That's the definition of an iconic character.With that being said, I fall into the category of people that has never actually seen a Godzilla film. Although I'm passionate about cinema, I've just never been particularly interested in the story. Sure, I've seen parts of the original 1954 Japanese film, but that's about it.Despite being an iconic figure, it wasn't a nuclear bomb that almost killed Godzilla, it was Hollywood. In 1998 Roland Emmerich's Godzilla was released starring Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. The film is now a Hollywood punchline and infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. The 1998 version of Godzilla is also known for possibly killing more careers than its titular star kills civilians.The good news is, nothing ever truly dies in Hollywood - it's just reborn. Boasting some of the best trailers you will ever see, Godzilla once again took a strong grip on pop culture. The trailer spread like wild fire through social media making Godzilla the must-see movie of the early summer. Godzilla is perfect blockbuster escapist fare and a perfect night out for anybody looking to turn their brain off for two hours. There's not a ton of great dialogue or character development. It's a Godzilla film, this is to be expected.The film starts out with a quick montage showing us what happened to Godzilla in 1954. We are soon introduced to Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston, in an effort to capitalize on his post Heisenberg high. Brody is a scientist working at a Japanese nuclear power plant. The film quickly fast forwards 15 years and Cranston's brilliant scientist has now been disgraced and reduced to a jittery wacko. Or so he seems to everybody else. Like with any disaster film, Cranston isn't crazy; in fact, he knows something is about to go horribly wrong but nobody will listen to him.As usual, Cranston is on top of his game. You can see the desperation in every wrinkle of his forehead and can hear it in every word he utters. Unfortunately, the focus soon shifts to Brody's son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Taylor-Johnson really hasn't done much. I enjoyed him in the Kick-Ass films, but he's never struck me as a particularly strong actor. When a gigantic CGI lizard has more facial expressions than your male lead, there's a problem.The more of the film Taylor-Johnson is asked to carry, the faster it starts to go downhill. Another unfortunate part of the film is how they waste Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Taylor-Johnson's wife. Like many female characters in films like this, Olsen's character is reduced to sitting at home wringing her hands waiting for news about her husband. Elizabeth Olsen is a great actress, but she's not going to break away from the shadow of her famous Full House siblings if she keeps choosing roles like this. Got it, dude?Maybe the biggest grievance I have with the film is the fact that Godzilla has his own film hijacked from him by two creatures most people have never heard of. While the two massive insect-like creatures are creating havoc, Godzilla is riding the pine. I paid money to watch Godzilla stomp on buildings, not to watch two over grown insects have sex.I know it sounds like I didn't like the film, but that's not the case. The first half of the film is especially strong. Godzilla also features some of the best music you will hear in a film all year, as well as some truly breathtaking special effects. The film also boasts a satisfying climax. It's so awesome, it made me wish there was more of that throughout the film.With Godzilla's success at the box office, it's safe to assume that he will stay in our current pop culture landscape for a little longer. I just hope Godzilla gets to flex his muscles more in the next film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not quite serious enough, not quite silly enough","Version I saw: UK cinema release (subtitled)Actors: 6/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10With 28 main sequence films, several spin-offs and numerous appearances in other media, the Godzilla franchise is formidable. In 1998, Hollywood tried to get in on the action under the helm of big, dumb blockbuster specialist Roland Emmerich, and while the result is routinely derided by one and all, it made a comfortable profit.Now, they have tried again, with inexperienced indie director Gareth Edwards. He has enjoyed a remarkable career trajectory since his micro-budget film Monsters won praise from a variety of sources. Before the dust had settled from Godzilla's landing, it was announced that he had been given charge of the first of several new stand-alone Star Wars films which will sit alongside JJ Abrams' main trilogy.The stars come from the indie world too. Aaron Taylor-Johnson broke through with British drama Nowhere Boy (which I thoroughly recommend), and continued the trend by starring as the unlikely hero Kick-Ass. Elizabeth Olsen's early success was trailer park drama Martha Marcy May Marlene. More recently, both have cemented their status as rising stars by appearing as super-powered brother and sister Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age of Ultron.There is something a bit... cynical, though, about the placement of their characters in Godzilla. ATJ is Ford Brody, a former soldier and war veteran, while Olsen is his wife Elle, a nurse. Both are, I gather, professions that are practically shortcuts to instant sympathy in large parts of the American audience. This is edging on being a problem for me, because in Britain at least, military people have no such rosy glow about them, and especially since what are widely regarded as massively misjudged campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyway, to top it all off, they also have photogenic child Sam (Carson Bolde).I don't know why it bothered me. It's certainly no more egregious than any number of other blockbusters. It doesn't feel any more blatant, either in the moment or looking back. It isn't even that big a problem: throughout most of the film, I was more amused than offended. ""Of course they are,"" I found myself thinking. ""It's almost as if they don't trust a skyscraper-sized lizard monster to cement audience sympathy.""Godzilla has always been as much a character in his movies as a plot device, though. He has personality, motivations, even emotions of a sort. Taken over the series as a whole, he has friends and allies too.This makes the character design extremely important, and Edwards and his team did a good job in this aspect. Yes, he is a bit wider around the waist than traditional portrayals, but calling him 'fat' is really a cheap shot, and not that important to the film either. And he looks fantastic. All the special effects work is excellent, in fact. Really top notch. It's not quite up there with Avatar, Gravity or Interstellar, but not far off, and putting such outlandish monsters firmly into an everyday context while still carrying the audience is quite a feat to pull off.The themes are the thing though. The best Godzilla films I have seen are either ridiculously daft, or deeply allegorical, and not that subtle about it either. This Godzilla film's themes are understated, and slightly troubling: it seems to say that nature can handle itself, and protect us as we heedlessly harm the planet. I wanted metaphors a lot more blatant than this, and preferably better thought out.By sacrificing the message, they move closer to the silly, spectacular model of Gojira films, but for my money, don't get close enough. It's a halfway house, and not successful enough at blending those two modes to raise it to the next level.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointed to say the least,"Being born back in the day, I was a fan of the original GODZILLA and looked forward to seeing this version. The Italian car company commercial further added to the hype - Godzilla crashing through a city, wrecking havoc on all who were in his way. GODZILLA (2014) was a let-down. While the basic story line was o.k., the main point of the movie seemed to be mans involvement in the plot, and the two prehistoric - yet alien looking - creatures that Godzilla did battle with. While the CGI work was outstanding, and Godzilla himself never looked better, he was in the movie only a fraction of the time I would have expected for something titled - GODZILLA. Yes, the scenes of his battles were epic in nature and I have to admit I felt like I was 50 years younger as I watched them but, it was too little, too late. Perhaps an edited version with 30 to 45 minutes less of all that was unnecessary and not 'Godzilla' might make this movie more of a classic in future days, but for me, as the movie stands, I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not so Mighty,"The review: I waited a few days to review this hopefully after it set for a bit, it would be better than I remembered. It seemed like it had so much potential. Darker, decent set up, but once the movie hit its so called stride and was supposed to be engaging, climactic, etc.it was not. Monsters were LAME, character performances were most likely given as written. Taylor-Johnson does what he is asked to here which is go from one unlikely scenario to the other, in an obscenely fast way and then goes from one impossible situation to another. People get lost with the odds of never being found again high, and then get found rather easily. My love for this movie however, I'm afraid will never be found. Effects were decent even though I didn't love the CGI monsters.The Good: Maybe the first half hour or so before the movies get there, when you think the characters and plot are being set up well and you don't know how bad it's going to get.The Bad: I hated the monsters, the animations, the weak plot, and the many unlikely events. Especially when the film started so gritty and real, it took many turns for the worst.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"For a truly satisfying experience, check out the 1954 original","Flicking the memory of Roland Emmerich's disastrous 1998 Godzilla movie away with it's mighty finger, Gareth Edwards' 2014 re-imagining is an altogether mightier and maturer beast. The biggest question stemming from message boards and critic reviews alike, is whether the colossal lizard is seen, or even glimpsed, enough. Anyone who saw 2013's incredibly dull monster/machine pile-up Pacific Rim will surely be aware that more is not necessarily better, and CGI is soulless without a heart. So my answer to that question would be a yes, as although Edwards teases us perhaps one time too many, when the beast finally roars, it's spine-tingling.The screenplay by Max Borenstein, based on a story by Dave Callaham, opts not to have the King of the Monsters the result of nuclear testing, but one of many ancient creatures laying low, feeding on the energy from the Earth's core. In 1999, scientists Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) discover the skeleton of a giant creature in a collapsed mine, and two pods. One pod has broken open and left a trail leading into the sea, and the other remains dormant. In Japan, unusual seismic activity causes a nuclear power plant to leak radioactive steam, killing the wife of plant supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston). Fifteen years later, Joe's son, bomb disposal expert Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), returns to Japan to find his father still obsessing over the unexplained events that led to his wife's death.This sounds like a lot of plot for a movie primarily about giant, rampaging creatures. The director previously made Monsters (2010), a low-budget, very human drama about a world facing an alien invasion, only the focus was on the romantic relationship between it's two leads. Edwards clearly isn't interested in simply blowing s**t up for our amusement, he wants us to care for the people dodging the flying cars and falling skyscrapers. It's an admirable approach, and is careful not to serve up stock chin-stroking villains or supporting characters you are waiting for to croak, but does make the mistake of offering one- dimensional archetypes as our protagonists. We have our square-jawed lead, our brilliant but possibly mad scientist, and even an expository ethnic character to make sure we're keeping up with the plot.There's also the problem of Taylor-Johnson, who although is a perfectly likable actor, does not have leading-man chops. This combined with his thinly-written character makes it incredibly difficult to get caught up in his long journey back to his loving wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and child (Carson Bolde). But while the film may often move at a snail's pace, it is never boring. Though the titular giant takes his time before popping his head up out of the water, there's two other bat-like creatures causing havoc, usually seen from the ground-up or on news reports, heightening the tension by creating a sense of realism. It's a very modern-day Gojira, developing it's own mythology yet appeasing fans of the beast's many incarnations, and no doubt frustrating those wanting to see an epic CGI smack-down. For a truly satisfying experience, just check out Ishiro Honda's 1954 original.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Finally, ""Godzilla"" done right.","It takes special talent to make a satisfying monster movie, and that's what director Gareth Edwards and a talented cast bring to the table in this all-new, very skillful take on Godzilla.Edwards and Co. take an entirely new approach to the standard Godzilla story: the above-ground atomic weapon tests of the 1950s weren't tests at all, but an attempt to kill Godzilla, whose species had roamed the earth during the time of the dinosaurs, when natural radiation was much stronger than it is now. The tests succeeded only in driving the King of All Monsters back into the ocean.But Godzilla is not the only one. There are the dangerous MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) who feed on radiation, and who are awakened, ready to breed. And they're hungry.The acting makes a great difference. If the cast doesn't care, then the audience won't. (That's not always a bad thing. DeForest Kelley trying not to laugh during ""Night of the Lepus"" is one of that movie's best bits.) But Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, and David Straithairn, among others, wisely take the approach that what's happening isn't a merry romp through the towers of San Francisco. These events are deadly serious business, and the cast treats the material as though it were Shakespeare. We care about these characters.Cranston, in particular, gives the film his all. I can truly say that this is the first monster film in which there is a genuinely human and tragic scene, one which could happen in real life and work in a more serious movie. Joe's anguish, agony and loss all come through in closeup, and that moves the audience. The scene does a great deal to erase the silliness of all this film's predecessors, and, more importantly, gives the audience an emotional investment in Joe and his family.I read one review in which the reviewer called the cast ""overqualified."" That may be, but it is certainly worth it in this case.The story really gets going 15 years later, when Joe's soldier son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, of the ""Kick-Ass"" films) is summoned to Japan, because Dad's been arrested. It seems as though Joe has become a crank conspiracy theorist, who knows the authorities are covering something up, that the reason for the disaster had to be something other than the official reason. Little do they know.Once the MUTOs arrive, just hold onto your seats and enjoy the ride. Edwards' adroit use of special effects, his skillful teasing before we see the full Godzilla, and the action scenes move along so well and so swiftly, that the most important problem of monster movies – certain logic holes, for instance – zoom by before anyone can notice them.At last, Godzilla has become something more than a sumo wrestler in a rubber suit kicking over obvious cardboard models. In the right hands, the King of All Monsters can be entertaining for the right reasons. I can only hope the studio doesn't start chintzing for the next one. It'll be worth spending the money.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointed,"I usually find user reviews a little harsh as they tend to be overcritical about a film, but, putting aside artistic value, I must say I was disappointed in Godzilla as entertainment. In fact, I found the much-criticized 1998 version much more entertaining. Some of the reviews here were spot on regarding plot and terror level. Too much of the film was made in the dark and there was nothing of special effects that raised my excitement level. I watched Godzilla on DVD, which came with a special features disc and watched some of that to gain some insight. After watching it, I still wondered why the movie was made the way it was, or even better, why bother making it in the first place. As far as monster movies goes, it falls well below the terror level of Jurassic Park and even the 2005 King Kong, which I found to be a beautiful love story. I judge how much I like a movie based on my desire to see it again. Alas, I have no such desire at this point, and don't see it coming in the near future.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Special credit to the director and team responsible of creating Godzilla and the two other monsters. They are so gigantic, so terrifying, I don't have words to put it. For once it reminded me those terrifying gigantic creatures from ""The Mist"", as well as the gigantic monsters from the director's previous film ""Monsters"".

"In all honesty, the 1998 film was better.","The 1998 film had a better director, writer, and special effects technician. I am taking about Ronald Emmerich, Dean Devlin and Patrick Tatopolous. This team has worked on hits like Universal Soldier, Stargate and Independence Day. This film had seasoned actors Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno who could carry any film by themselves.The 2014 film is directed by Gareth Edwards who is not seasoned enough to handle such a big project. The writer Dave Callaham writes a dull story and thus the screenplay written by Max Borenstein is ineffective. Bryan Cranston(of Breaking Bad TV series fame) is the only good actor in the film. But he has a short role in the film.The film does not continue from the 1997 film, but is a standalone film.The plot hinges around Project Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham investigate a colossal skeleton in a collapsed mine in the Philippines. They find two egg-shaped pods; one dormant, one broken open. The hatched creature burrows under Janjira Nuclear Power Plant and causes a seismic effect as it feeds on the reactor's radiation. Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), the plant's supervisor, sends his wife Sandra and a team of technicians into the reactor. While the team is inside, the reactor is breached, releasing radioactive steam. Sandra and her team are unable to escape and the plant collapses into ruin.Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford is a US Navy explosive ordinance disposal officer, living in San Francisco with his wife Elle and son Sam. After Joe is detained for trespassing in the Janjira quarantine zone, Ford returns to Japan. Convinced of a cover-up of the cause of the disaster, Joe convinces Ford to help him retrieve vital data at their old home.Watch film to find out what happens next.The core of this film hinges on the C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) special effects and no attention is given to the unbelievably ridiculous plot, which you have to see to believe. If the trio of Emmerich, Devlin and Tatopoulos had begin given this project, then the result would have been much better.Verdict: Just watch once and forget about it.

"Garguatuan delivery of monsters, lax drama","Gareth Edwards reinvigorates Godzilla on the American soil with his gargantuan portrayal of the famed post-nuclear monster, which retreads the origins of its fame and imprints them within this big-budget modern-day extravaganza. Even Godzilla itself diverts form the T-Rex blunder of the 1998 movie and captures the big-footed original monster of the Japanese series in CGI perfection. However Godzilla is not the sole malevolent creature to appear in this movie, as the famed mega-predator enters into a all-destructive chase for another humongous kaiju (or MUTO as it is defined in this movie) with a devastating EMP blast.In the midst of this epic battle humanity and the army struggle to contain the destruction, while Edwards, like in ""Monsters"", struggles to imprint human drama as a backdrop to events. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), a scientist at a nuclear power plant, loses his wife (a brief cameo by Juliette Binoche) to one early attack by the MUTO, thus becoming obsessed with the monster and the encompassing government cover-up brought in effect to hide the truth. As a character and as an actor Cranston is a short-lived emotional highlight in the story, which unfortunately soon loses traction with what feels like his premature death. This loss leaves us battling for interest in the lax son of Joe, demolitions expert soldier Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is a bland shell of a character, generic to the extreme, effectively keeping us disinterested in the story and leaving us hoping for a fast-forward to more massive destruction of metropolis. MUTO expert Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and the wife-nurse Elle Brody (Elizabeth Olsen) are equally unengaging, dull as a dishwater and forgettable. The overall lack of character imprint into the story coupled with audacious coincidences littering the movie, make the drama inert and feel like an important position on Edwards' checklist of blockbuster movies components.I did however immensely like as Edwards slowly builds tension, initially only showing massive bones of the leviathan creatures or just the aftereffects of their presence, then only sifting through bits and pieces of destruction through news reports, whilst avoiding showing the battles between Godzilla and the MUTOs, leaving space for total San Francisco annihilation for the final act. Nonetheless with the lack of emotional engagement ""Godzilla"" feels like but a mild success, a poor dramatic relative to the much more successful giant-bashing ""Pacific Rim"" feature of 2013, who has a superb mix of absurdity, pathos and general character formation that is vastly superior to Edwards effort.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A misunderstood movie with stunning cinematography,"The IMDB rating mislead me into thinking this was badNaturally, when you see a movie that is rated below 6.5, your expectations fly out of the window. However, this was a pleasant surprise and I understood that much of it was misunderstood and under appreciated simply because people went into this movie expecting Kaiju battles from start to bottom, but that simply does not work in a movie that is meant to be a reimagination of an iconic character, you need to establish the universe.First of all let's get the obvious praise out of the way , as someone who has gone and seen all the legendary produced Godzilla films, this one has by far the best acting. Bryan Cranston for the first half of the show absolutely carries everything, his iconic interrogation scene is in my opinion the best piece of acting we have seen in the legendary Monsterverse, obviously not including any of the Japanese films.Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a decent job, but he can be a bit unreactive at time, which I think is this movies biggest weak point, with better direction he might have been able to appear more sincere. Other then that the plot is solid, none of it seems that ridicules if you accept that monsters do exist in this universe and how nations would react to it.The cinematography however is a masterclass by Seamus McGarvey, who in my opinion gives up some of the best shots in the entire Monsterverse. The iconic drop scene is easily one of the most stunning scenes you will ever see. Godzilla is also presented in a very mysterious and almost god like way, seen through light flares, smoke, water and other elements for most of the movies. A LOT of people see this as a negative, NOT enough Godzilla they scream, but what other legendary movie manages to actually make the moments count for monsters to this degree? Compare this to King of the monsters, which while has a lot more screentime for the monsters, is nowhere near as good in presentation and completely fails to make you feel the impact and weight of these massive fictional creatures.In conclusion, Godzilla 2014 is incredibly underappreciated and you should not be persuaded by negative reviews, it is WORTH A WATCH.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Overall great movie, but it will leave you with mixed emotions","Spoiler free: I went in to this movie with high hopes of a visually fantastic movie, with great fights and a strong performance by one of my favorite actors: Bryan Cranston. With this expectation I will say that I left the theater with mixed emotions.On the upside, the movie is visually stunning, the animations and destruction looks amazing and really shows Godzilla in his pride. Bryan Cranston's performance is breathtaking and makes the movie entertaining in the parts where Godzilla is not present. And that final? F*cking awesome! On the downside, there are not as many fights as I had hoped and Bryan Cranston was not that much in the movie as everyone expected(They really promoted this movie as if he was the lead character). So if you were expecting Heisenberg Vs Godzilla you will not be pleased by this film. The lack of action in a action movie makes the 2 hour runtime feel a bit dragged out(all leading up to the end, which makes it totally worth the wait), especially when Aaron-Taylor Johnsons character isn't that interesting.Overall I will say this movie is worth watching, even if you aren't the biggest Godzilla fan.

Godzilla,"The world most famous monster is pitted against malevolent creatures who, bolstered by humanity's scientific arrogance, threaten our very existence.I knew nothing about the movie, even if I watched all of the trailers. All I could tell you back then, is that it was a new Godzilla movie which might include several other monsters in it. So I didn't really know what I was in for. This film focus a little bit more on human beings and character's back stories, It's not all about monsters and a lot more about humans. Godzilla is in it obviously, but it's not all about him. It's about humans who have to deal with the fact that there are big walking monsters in the world. The point is that we have to feel that those monsters exist and that they are a real threat for humanity. That's why this film is working so well. However I wished they show a little bit more of Godzilla fighting scenes, not those special report news telling us that the monsters are devastating cities etc. Since it's mostly about the characters, they are pretty good. Bryan Cranston for instance is awesome in the movie. He has a couple of really emotional scenes but he's not out there that much though, which is a little bit disappointing as well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is in the movie and he's good enough. Kind of statues as a military force, he just wants to get the job done which make sense in a way. ""Let's get it done!"" I can't help myself but to compare this Godzilla film with Pacific Rim which annoys me as Godzilla is so much more realistic - not that cooler though, but good nonetheless. It's directed extremely well and gives a kind of humans perspective regards to these creatures, it sold them. They're not monsters. Those creatures are animals who are trying to survive on this planet. Finally, the score by Alexandre Desplat is fantastic, I loved how it sounds.Overall, this movie was epic and looked epic. But don't expect Pacific Rim because you will be disappointed. This film is smarter displaying a mankind view of nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mess With Nature And Nature Will Always Mess Back,"Back in 1954, the original Godzilla taught us many things.Mess with nature and nature will always mess back. Give a monster a motive and the audience is yours. Get the atmosphere right and no one will notice the cracks in your budget. Or at least care.Created as a vehicle to sustain director Roland Emmerich's blockbusting momentum after Independence Day, the last Hollywood version of Godzilla taught us something else entirely: Special effects can't single-handedly carry a giant monster film and it can't simply rely on big named actors either. Which is why nobody's seen Mr. Emmerich since 1998.As the creator of 2010's acclaimed sci-fi-on-a-shoestring ""'Monsters""' and now the director of this hopeful franchise-reboot, Gareth Edwards has clearly learned from these lessons – for the most part.But while the blood of ""Monsters"" runs through it, it's pretty obvious where – or rather who – this 2014 Godzilla's greatest inspiration comes from.From the ""War of the Worlds"" plotting and inevitable nods to ""Jurassic Park"" to sundry small but ""Close Encounters"" (note the shape of those sonographs), it's got Spielberg's baseball cap all over it. The 2014 reboot of Godzilla is a hugely serious business starting in 1999 with a genuinely wrenching tragedy at a Japanese nuclear facility that leaves scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) torn from his wife (Juliette Binoche) and son Ford.Fifteen years later, army lieutenant Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is on leave with his own son and wife (Elizabeth Olsen) when he is summoned back to Japan to get his now-paranoid dad out of jail.Convinced that the events of 1999 were part of a massive cover-up, Joe has made a nuisance of himself ever since. But with the truth almost in his grasp, Joe drags Ford back to the abandoned city they once lived to retrieve the last pieces of the puzzle.They find all the evidence they need. Much more. As do the researchers at the heart of the conspiracy (Ken Watanabe and the spare part-like Sally Hawkins).And as if one hundred-story, radiation-absorbing, evolution-defying menace wasn't enough for the world to deal with, there are more.On top of that, like every other recent global threat film that doesn't take place in New York, they're all heading for San Francisco. Where Ford's family happens to live.Yes, Edwards even throws in the old 'packed schoolbus on a bridge' routine as everything between Hawaii and Vegas is caught in a devastating pincer movement that renders the US Armed Forces as impotent as a basket of neutered puppies.Like previously mentioned, a blockbuster shouldn't live and die by it's special effects, but in many ways that's often as much as Godzilla has going for it, alongside a number of exquisitely composed and atmospheric shots.The visuals are astonishing, whether it's the creatures tearing down entire cities or a tsunami devastating Honolulu.The first big sighting is just about worth the wait and the one thing Edwards certainly manages to get right are the reveals. As Godzilla or the M.U.T.O.'s appear from out of smoke or out of the sky to maul each other or a skyscraper, he's able to deliver a handful of truly jaw- dropping sequences. Godzilla is huge and really quite unsettling as a presence, and in one or two moments the film touches on being a proper intense film, posing genuine danger from these massive beasts.And how they love it, supplementing their smash-and-trash campaign with bursts of electromagnetic mayhem that leaves cities powerless and – in one eerily impactful scene – causes planes to drop out of the sky.And yet it's often to be found skimping on the action, cutting out early from the scraps and only showing us the aftermath rather than the main event. As a result the first two-thirds consist of an awful lot of teasing, which, in less capable hands, could have been a blockbusting mistake.Although it could be argued that an all-out assault would be exhausting in a Transformers or Pacific Rim sort of way.A little lightness of touch might have worked wonders too. It's an entirely humorless affair, which makes you question the point of having something as silly as two hours of monsters hitting each other when it doesn't try to make you smile once. Enjoy the thrill of the few times when Godzilla lets rip with all his might, but mayhem isn't really enough if you're not having fun with it.Godzilla, after all, is the reason you're here. But like most bill- topping acts, and with millions of years of pent-up, FX-fuelled frustration to release, he's worth the wait.If you enjoyed this review, please don't hesitate to check out my other ones at www.themoviecorner.net, thanks for reading!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Starts good, slowly declines","I'm going to start off by saying, don't expect to see much of Bryan Cranston (Walter White from breaking bad). He is WAY over advertised in the previews. Now with that being said I'll finish up my review.To be honest when it started out I was on the edge of my seat begging for more. As it progressed it only got better and more interesting until around 1/3 of the way through the film. After that 1/3 of the way through it becomes painfully apparent that this movie really isn't going to bring much to the table other than snappy visual effects and scary music. With such good storytelling in the beginning and such great acting and action sequences, I was pleasantly surprised only to be let down by the thinning of the plot, the pointlessness of the human actions and the overall focus on the ""all American soldier"" got old pretty fast. The irony is that if the beginning hadn't been so good, the ending wouldn't have seemed so bad.Conclusion: The action sequences really suck you in, the pure scale of the movie is incredible and the monsters look amazing, but the plot gets worse as time goes on and the American soldier focus gets old REALLY quick. I'm glad I saw it in theatres for the experience, but I'm not sure I'll be suggesting it to anyone, and I certainly won't be buying it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla cameo's in Hollywood's latest attempt!,"This visually stunning blockbuster is Hollywood's second attempt at cashing in on the success of the greatest film monster ever know... Godzilla!As we all know, the 90's version was hilarious for all the wrong reasons and should have actually black listed Hollywood from ever being allowed to do remakes ever again.Mind you, that should have happened with the 80's cartoon of Godzilla...So here we are again, with the finest in CGI and all in the hands of new director Gareth Edwards who shot to fame with his indie hit, Monsters.Personally, Monsters bored the sh*t out of me and it took me a number of years to get through it without turning it off after 20 minutes. The problem I found with that, seems to have drifted in to this, and that is where lies the failure.Focused more on the human side and drama of his stories, Edwards fails to recognise that Godzilla is the hero, the titular character, and above all, the star of any Godzilla movie.This in turn leaves us with a beautifully made film about the US army (yay) who take on alien creatures intent on destroying the planet (or the US at least).Oh yeah, and there is a cameo by Godzilla.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One Of The Absolute Worst IMHO,"The human characters are the worst in Goji series history and I strongly dislike the Godzilla design in this one.
The story never manages to grab me and Bryan Cranston is wasted in this.
The MUTOS are the lamest Goji villains since Godzilla's Revenge and the music is underwheming!
I really feel alienated from much of the Goji fandom when it comes to my opinions on this film.1 out of 10, very disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie!,"The movie was well done. I appreciate how snippets of the original Godzilla score/music was incorporated all through out this new film. For those who has seen the first Gojira, the sound aspect injected intermittently in G.Edward's version sort of sends out to the viewers a nostalgic feeling of the old film. The storyline though deviated sharply from the original which worked out well. I guess the film-makers felt the need for adjustments for the present era of moviegoers. Popular news sites have written about a sequel. Many commenters are all for another sequel. But for me personally, quality Godzilla movies such as this last one should only come out no less than 10 years at a time to keep the anticipation but mainly that Godzilla is a special gem. Or like a plant that flowers only every so often that stay hidden for a time but when it blooms, it blooms with spectacle. OK, flower and Godzilla doesn't match- I can't find a better comparison but you know what I mean. I had rather wait another 15 years of a really good Godzilla movie than see a B-quality every 2 or 3 years. Godzilla is a majestic and grand figure. In movie history, there's no monster (or whatever you call it) that commands such awe. It deserved every cent of its $160 million budget.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
an HONEST review by a lifelong Godzilla fan,"As a child of the 70s and 80s I grew up with the TOHO Godzilla movies, as a pre-teen Godzilla movies ( and dinosaurs) were my favorite type of movies, those of you from the east coast may remember the annual tradition of the Thanksgiving (and Friday after) Godzilla marathons on channel 9 in the late 70s early 80s. fast forward to 1998 and Roland Emmerich rapes my childhood memories,...nuff said about that debacle. Now fast forward again to 2014 and the Americans once again take on the legendary Big ""G"", can they finally get it right?.......well sort of. I'm not going to give you a play-by -play of the whole movie,too many other reviewers have already done that,..I'm going to tell you what you really need to know. Let's start with the good : Godzilla LOOKS pretty damn good (though the complaints of looking somewhat ""hefty"" have merit), and equally important they seem to have gotten the NATURE of the beast mostly correct, Godzilla is the anti-hero of the monster world, he is not evil,he is heroic, yet also indifferent to humankind. WHEN (and that's the key issue)you see Godzilla it is truly exhilarating and you really want to just stare in awe of this creature as long as possible. The monster fights are pretty good WHEN they are actually showing them, and let's face it ,that is what most of us really want in a Godzilla movie. This is definitely a ""movie theatre"" movie and should be seen on the biggest, loudest screen possible. Bryan Cranston is great for as long as you get to see him. That's about it for the good, it may not sound like much but it makes up for a lot of the bad and still justifies a ticket purchase.Now to the bad: Way ,way ,waaaay too much buildup and not nearly enough payoff. Bryan Cranston's character and acting talents are completely squandered. At first you are sympathetic to the human element, but after almost 90 minutes and over 20 ""cutaways"" to the human scenes you start becoming downright bored and even resentful, to the point that you wish the MUTOS and Godzilla would wipe them all out already so we can focus on the monsters. Stupid Military dialogue. Only one species of MUTO. ......and now to biggest gripe of all........ Godzilla, the movies' namesake, the big ""G"", Gojira, King of all Monsters gets a whopping 10 minutes of screen time of an entire 2 hour movie,..and if you think I am exaggerating don't take my word, I want you to bring an actual stopwatch with you, start it when ""G"" is on screen and stop it at each cutaway when he is offscreen ,then check the total time when the movie ends. He gets about 1 minute midway through the movie at his introduction and about 9 minutes at the end (not counting the interspersed cutaways).Bottom Line: as the saying goes ,you only get one chance to make a first impression, and director Gareth Edwards has somewhat squandered his by taking what could have been a ""Great"" movie and making it into a mere ""good"" one by being waaay too reserved with showing the monsters. It's still worthy of a viewing on the bigscreen, it's miles above the 98 version, it's fertile ground to make a much better sequel, but I really wish they could have gotten it right the first time around by giving us exactly what we came for......GODZILLA !!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Very Dark Movie,"I love monsters. I love sci-fi. I love horror. I love destruction movie. I love epic movie. And I love Godzilla, the monster itself. In those expectation, Godzilla was supposed to be my epic movie, second only to Superman-Batman.But, not going into spoiler, this movie is just way too dark. Not in the movie tone. Literally. Dark. Darker than Dark Knight. Darker than almost horror movie, bar The Blair Witch Project.So dark that I almost yelled. While I understand maybe the movie makers wanted it to be fearsome and maybe did not want to show some brutality in it, the movie was too dark for audiences. We almost could not tell what was going on. This is a movie, not a radio show.Also, when I was expecting an epic monster fight scene, it suddenly zoomed into a TV news showing a glimpse of that fight. Now I came to conclusion that they wanted to save budget in the visual effect department.This movie has the potential to be a great experience. Just if, the director did not shy in buying some lights or candles. Again, way too dark.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A visually impressive and enjoyable reboot but not the relentless carnage bringer many will be hoping for,"Those seeking summer action film wham-bam-thank-you-mam blockbuster carnage from start to finish in Godzilla are going to be sorely disappointed with this new king of the monsters, but for those with appreciation for finely paced and well-staged action, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is going to prove highly entertaining and thoughtfully constructed despite not being exactly the hotly anticipated creature feature classic that many perhaps hoped it would be.Quickly graduating from his debut made-for-under-a-million-dollars feature Monsters to a 160 million dollar large scale reboot of one of the most beloved cinema creations in history, Brit Gareth Edwards had a mighty large task in making a film that not only re-imagined Godzilla for modern audiences but provided heart and soul for the CGI wonderment to take place around and on that front he does a commendable job. Without wishing to spoil much of what occurs throughout the story, the film takes a pretty stock standard approach of distant family members pulling together in time of a world disaster and fills that out with some extremely basic supports from the grizzled military commander through to the token loyal wife and in the form of Ken Watanabe's scientist one of the most glazed over and gawking acting appearances of the year (seriously just count the times he stands around looking at something as though he has just been hit by a bad case of the stares). With a weak and underused support base Edwards does strike gold with the combo of Johnson and in particular Bryan Cranston who seems to be still on an acting high from his 5 season arc in Breaking Bad and here adds much needed gravitas to the human flavour of the piece, but in the end who really needs these humans when Godzilla is on the loose?With the CGI star of the piece Godzilla a startling and impressive incarnation (even though the big fella seems to have a penchant for the odd lizard cheeseburger) it's safe to say this is where Edwards film comes into its own and becomes a must-see big screen adventure. With the films ample and sparingly used set pieces Edwards has proved that while he can handle the human element he excels at the popcorn munching extravagance even more so. Unwilling to spoil many of the films unique set ups it's safe to say there is enough jaw dropping imagery on display here to safely call Godzilla one of the most visually impressive films your likely to witness this year and while the film's most stunning set piece in the form of a military drop has been seen countless times in the films trailers and adverts there are many other moments of true epic nature to allow us to call this a feast for eyes. In a stage in motion pictures where CGI has reached all new levels of over-saturation it's a real joy to behold a film that seems to use its wizardry to realistic and stunning effects.Godzilla is a finely crafted and immensely entertaining reboot of a franchise that perhaps many thought would now lay long dormant but thanks to Edwards deft touch you get the feeling once again that us mere mortals will be more than OK to see more of what is on display here and while Godzilla is in itself its own worst enemy, a film held back by a subject that can only take it so far there is little doubt that this big budget effort is about all you could ever want from a giant radiated lizard going about his business.3 and a half jungle submarines out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The King has arrived!,"I have seen a lot of awesome movies before this moviebut now that I have seen THIS movie, they all seem..waste!! THAT's how good this movie is!! This is not a movie, it's an experienceof a lifetime! And I'm very happy that I saw this movie first day, first show in an IMAX theatre! Any other (normal theatre) wouldn't do justice to the special effects. Though the theatre was housefull, throughout the movie, I didn't hear ONE word from anyone..not even from the kids in the audience. The only sound I heard was myself saying ""Awesome"" quite a lot during the show! I had seen the previous Godzilla movie released some years back. But the trailers for this movie is what prompted me to see it..and boy, I am one very happy person. I had expected the story to be the same as the one in previous Godzilla movie but (thankfully) it was quite different!! Luckily, the trailers didn't show ANY of the ""other elements"" of the movie. So, if you go to see this movie without knowing anything about the story, like me, then you will enjoy it MUCH more. I am not going to tell anything more about the story as I don't want to provide any spoilers. But sadly, IMDb has already provided a major spoiler in it's ""Storyline"" section. So , DON'T read that! One thing I did not like in the movie was that most of the main characters , especially Ford Broody and Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, weren't that appealing. They both seemed bit dull and passive, compared to Joe Brody , the only character that I liked. He was very convincing in his role. Anyway, the humans in this movie should be considered irrelevant. They do become irrelevant as the movie progresses and the focus directly and indirectly shifts to Godzilla. Another complaint that I have is that the movie suddenly seems to get over! I mean, it's not that the movie is incomplete or something. But once ""things get settled"", suddenly the movie gets over! I would have expected that at least they would have shown people talk about Godzilla and his actions. Anyway, not a big deal. The major appeal of the movie is it's special effects. Simply of the best ever. And the story is pretty good. And the direction amazing. Do watch this one. Doesn't get any bigger than this!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Save your money. Avoid this awful movie. No joke.,"Just got back from Godzilla. Wow, what an amazingly bad film. So mind numbingly boring, it's hard to even express it. If you go, just hang out in the lobby, eat some popcorn, chat with your friends and then head in to the theater for the last 20 minutes. You'll have a much better time. Truly one of the worst theater experiences I've had in recent history.Much of the CGI is darkened to hide its flaws. The green screen lines are easily visible (sometimes in scenes that are otherwise cinematically beautiful). The human characters are Completely one dimensional, uttering terrible dialogue the likes of which haven't been heard since Attack Of The Clones - and that includes Bryan Cranston who must have known that the lines coming out of his mouth were utter, nonsensical garbage.The new monsters are using the same trite design mode established in Cloverfield (to much better effect), while Godzilla (who lumbers around like an arthritic 108 year old man) is held back until the final act and criminally underused.Matthew Broderick must be dancing for joy knowing he won't be the Godzilla community's goat anymore.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"They put part of the ""God"" back in ""zilla.""","I have been a devoted Godzilla fan for years and have always been intrigued and entertained by the overall quality and fun (albeit sometimes campy) the original Japanese Godzilla film and its over-two-dozen sequels bring. They have a special charm to them and are definitely treasured classics. This second American version of the monster classic, I believe, somewhat does the monster justice but is better than the 1998 American version with Matthew Broderick.The trailer gives people the impression that this is a very dark film where Godzilla begins a spree of terror in the U.S. and throughout the world. However, it is really about Godzilla and two other malevolent creatures called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) being awaken and unleashed by the events of the nuclear bombing at Bikini Atoll in the 1940s. This leads to a battle between the monsters, with American cities caught in the middle.The film starts off with some intrigue, showing scientists Joe and Sandra Brody (Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche) getting caught in an accident at the Janjira Nuclear Plant near Tokyo, where an explosion and radiation leak lead to causalities, already giving the audience the impression that monsters are involved, since radiation is a trademark element in bringing Godzilla to life. However, the movie drags on a bit after that when we are taken 15 years later after the incident, to a lot of uninteresting human drama involving the character leads. The movie picks up again almost toward the middle of the movie when we see some action involving the MUTOs, military and citizen evacuations - all leading to a pretty spectacular monster battle.Writers Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham wrote a pretty interesting story. Director Gareth Edwards did a decent job directing the film, inserting enough drama, carnage, tension and thrills to make the film more believable and serious than the 1998 version. And, composer Alexandre Desplat wrote a very catchy and haunting music score, giving it a monster flavor and I thought the few first strands of his themes will remind you of Godzilla's classic theme from his original Japanese movie.I wasn't blown away by the acting, which I found to be pretty awful - Cranston was mediocre and a little overzealous; British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody was bland, boring and emotionless with a bad American accent; Elizabeth Olsen as Elle Brody was OK; and Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa looked too confused. However, Serizawa did bring the connection between radiation and the monsters, and seemed to be one of a very few in the movie who has sympathy for them (echoing elements from the original Japanese series). Therefore, I felt Serizawa contributed the most to the plot.Lastly, the visual and special effects were pretty awesome. I'm not a big fan of CGI, however, the effects team did capture the somberness and carnage of fallen cities, and the mayhem and terror of the monsters' presence.Although Godzilla himself is given limited screen time, the monster is the real star of the movie as the drama and talks concentrate on him and his presence is felt throughout the movie. It's a pretty good way to celebrate Godzilla's 60th anniversary and, as the audience in the theater was left applauding after the credits started to role, this is actually a pretty satisfying film that somewhat puts the ""God"" back in ""zilla."" I just wished that there was more monster action and wished the acting was better; I wouldn't mind if the producers had selected an entire new crop of actors over the ones employed.Grade C+",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Saviour Monster,"Godzilla, the King of Monsters returns to the silver screen. Surprisingly , he himself didn't had much screen time to woo the audience. Even when he appears they cut to humans and other things leaving the viewers disappointing. This has been done many times in the film and it had an advantage of creating the tense but a regular fan boy might get disappointed of this style. The final battle was good and the film concluded in a good fashion though.Gareth Edwards tried to balance the human aspect and the monster-action but he was partly successful. He had put more efforts on the humans but they didn't have much to perform but only there to felt shocked and panicked. He teased the viewers and created the tension till the Big G's arrival which paid well for the initial half. He should have focused more on a compelling narration but he insisted more on creating the environment.Bryan Cranston performed well as Joe Brody and he carries the first part of the movie on his shoulders. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was good as Naval technician Ford and he performed well. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's Wife didn't had much screen time. A good actor like Ken Watanabe was there only to stare at the consequences happening let alone performing. It's hard to have compelling characters when the film is based on a Monster but a even in a film like this has to have good characters for the viewers to connect.The film was good at parts with more tension than action catching some viewers in this aspect but at the same time it leaves others who expect popcorn entertainment.

King of the Monsters,"*****SPOILER ALERT!!! As a die-hard fan of the old, exclusively Toho Godzilla, I felt the need to write an honest review which would voice my opinions of this new (and improved) entry into the Godzilla franchise.Let me start by saying, I was not let down, far from it, however, there were some aspects of the movie which I think fell short. While the visuals were stunning and the fights, (when you got to them) breathtaking, I can't help but feel the plot focused too much on the human aspects of the story and led more to be desired of a Pacific Rim style face off between the monsters. This was a major issue with the slated American attempt at Godzilla in 1998 and I felt the issue beginning to resurface with this movie. I found that I didn't really care much for any of the human characters despite a few sob stories and I constantly wanted to see more of the monsters. I got more emotion out of the two M.U.T.O monsters than any of the human characters. Despite this, the humans hardships were at least somewhat realistic (unlike Pacific Rim) and helped maintain a gritty tone to the movie reminiscent of Gojira (1954).Luckily, when the action did kick in towards the second half, we got to see the real goods. There were some scenes where I questioned the direction, but after some surprising twists and a riveting final showdown with some unexpected empathy towards Godzilla himself, I became totally immersed. If you're a fan of CGI, please go and see this movie! While the acting overall wasn't bad, there was some awkward dialogue and a distinct lack of Bryan Cranston. It becomes rather apparent, considering his role in a majority of the trailers, that he becomes no more than a reason for a lot of Breaking Bad fans to see the movie. There was an audible sigh/gasp from the audience upon realising our favourite actor won't be with us any longer. Focus then switches to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays Cranston's son. From here on we continue on a slightly bumpy ride featuring a few unnecessary additions to the plot in order to try and develop Johnson's character. Despite this, performances were solid, with some minor exceptions (Ken Watanabe's single facial expression and Cranston's questionable grasp of Japanese to name a couple), though I can't complain overall.Godzilla himself was perfection. They got his characteristics spot on, even down to his famous atomic breath. If the movie had included or even hinted at a new version of the Gojira (1954) theme I would have died happy, but it was not to be. It is clear that the movie was made by and for Godzilla fans and stays true to a traditional Godzilla classic. It left me feeling extremely satisfied and whether you're a Godzilla fan or not, I'm sure you will enjoy it too!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Revived My Interest In Godzilla,"This movie is easily the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. Gareth Edwards did such a good job at remaking the classic I had a hard time getting up when I had to go to the bathroom. :) I knew as soon as I saw the opening credits that this was going to be an absolutely awesome movie. After seeing the inferior 1998 version that for some reason I watched several times, I was anxiously waiting for a good remake. This 123 minute slice of awesome completely made up for my long time of waiting. There were two things I was looking for that this movie did not have, however. The original theme from 1954 and the original roar. I was not dissatisfied with the new roar, though, and it was so cool it gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it. I did still miss the original music, but I do understand copyright laws. People keep ripping on this awesome movie because it didn't offer anything new. I think it offered some new material, like the look of Godzilla and his roar and the monsters he fights. The makers of the movie changed a lot of the small things about the appearance of Godzilla, but kept the main things. For example, they kept his menacing behavior, his sky scraping height, and his incomprehensible strength. I think Edwards did an awesome job making this movie. He made sure not to completely copy off of Japan's Gojira, but made sure to keep it similar enough so the die-hard Godzilla fans were not unhappy. One of the reasons the 1998 Godzilla was not very successful was because Roland Emmerich completely changed the appearance of the so-called Godzilla to where it just looked like a giant T-Rex. Sort of. But Edwards kept the main shape of Godzilla so that was good. I guess I should actually review the general aspects of the movie. The actors were mostly A+ stars talking B+ dialogue, but it didn't bother me that much at all, because I'm not a huge stickler. Although there were some really good quotes throughout, and that kind of made up for it. The special effects were mind blowing. I'm surprised the budget was still only $160,000,000 with how good the special effects were. With three monsters, I would have expected it to be over $200,000,000 easily. The story was moderately original, and offered some new ideas and some already used ideas. However, if you just want to see a movie on a Saturday night, this will not bother you at all, and you should enjoy the movie as it is. Edwards' directing style is great, and makes you feel like you might be in a nearby helicopter or plane watching all of the action unfold, which is a lot better than just a completely still camera sitting on a bridge. He (Edwards) also did a good job putting in some minor characters to emphasize the importance of people during some of the fight scenes, like a bus driver. Overall, this is a solid installment in the Godzilla franchise, and will be much more successful, remembered, and liked than the 1998 Godzilla ever was. Thanks for reading. See ya!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Inspired by the original ...,"Overall I would say it's a solid movie - not epic or as good as it could be, but enjoyable if you don't dislike disaster movies on principle. The part I liked most was that it leans quite a bit on the early movies by giving Godzilla a character and depicting him as something with purpose. This allowed them also to play a bit with the question of who is in charge, man or nature and use it as a subtle theme that is driven to the obvious conclusion. What I didn't like about it was the overall pacing and the special effects. The first half is really good and had a good mixture of story, Godzilla and top-notch acting. But the 2nd half contains too many elements of the usual disaster movies with a dragged out climax that failed to deliver because of rather poor CGI work. It could be that I'm spoiled from other productions but too much of the scenes were put during night time and you had a hard time to see what's going on, also the CGI during daylight lacked depth in texture and integration into the environment. With a bit more story and utilizing the actors more in the second half, it would have distracted me from the shortcomings and made them less obvious - that's why I think it could have been better but it is still an entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
what a terrible film!,"I'm won't go into detail at all about this film because it was awful.

Slow Burn to Explosion,"I know about Godzilla, but I am not by any means a die-hard fan of this Japanese nuclear monster. I did not even get to watch the much-maligned 1998 Hollywood Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick. But definitely the pulse-pounding and very intriguing trailer made really want to catch this present-day homage to the classic film monster.From vintage-style scenes showing nuclear experiments in the 1950s, the story jumps to 1999 in the Philippines, where a big earthquake unearths evidence of a giant fossilized monster. Following this, another massive but unnatural tremor occurs in Japan causing the destruction of a nuclear facility where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife and destroying the once good life he lived.The story jumps 15 years to the future when Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) returns home after years his military service. An emergency call brings him back to Tokyo to help his dad who seemed to have never moved on since the tragedy of 1999. Unusual seismic activity similar to 1999 are happening again, but this time it unleashes three destructive monsters, two huge flying mantis-like creatures, and one gigantic dinosaur-like beast, whom they called Godzilla. They wreak havoc not only in Japan, but across the globe, reaching a climactic battle-royale in San Francisco.Bryan Cranston is really a very sensitive actor. I know him because of his award-winning performances on the TV show ""Breaking Bad"", though I have not really watched that show beyond the first episode. He is the true human heart of this film.Aaron Taylor-Johnson has really evolved from the nerdy pseudo-hero Kick- Ass to how he looks in this film. I did not recognize him. Oddly, he feels generic here, little star presence, giving a serviceable but ultimately forgettable lead performance.Ken Watanabe is really the go-to Japanese lead actor. In this film he plays the Japanese scientist who was studying these monsters. Mr. Watanabe was very good in conveying distress with his intense face. However, I felt he sounded very garbled when he talked. I think I lost a lot of details because of his unclear pronunciation of words.Technically, the sound was so massive. It reverberated through the whole theater causing us to shake. The computer-generated visual effects were similarly top-notch, especially the monsters and the destruction they were causing. We watched this in 3D which for me while nice to see, did not really add much to the enjoyment of the film. The film had a rather dark and muddy color palette, I believe the 3D made it even more murky-looking.I felt the build up to the last hour when Godzilla was finally being revealed was very slow. It was only Bryan Cranston's presence that kept these scenes from being boring. The story-telling felt turgid, and repetitive. However, whenever the titular character Godzilla was on screen, up to his very last scene, it was truly awesome indeed. The final battle in San Francisco was epic and emotional, the best parts of the film as a whole, particularly that moment when he first unleashes his nuclear laser-like breath.Director Gareth Edwards, in his desire to remain faithful to the story's Japanese roots, took a very slow burn approach indeed. But hang on, and the film culminates in one glorious explosion of action and heart toward the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It was good, but could have been great","If you want to see beautifully crafted monsters battling it out for dominance, well this movie will be for you. The actions sequences are not fast paced, but are very captivating, and I think that is what saved it for me. I was dreading that I would walk away feeling like I had watched another Pacific Rim, and Transformer film. The CGI is impeccable! This is coming from a guy who finds that cgi leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. Godzilla itself resembles the beast that we can remember from yesteryear, thankfully!As far as acting and character development goes, well there just isn't any. Cranston delivers a fine performance, though his appearance in the film is all to brief, and that frustrated me. The majority of the characters were painfully dull, and some... why are the even there??.. I don't know.For a no brainer, visual extravaganza go and see it, there were fist pumps galore during the battles, and some clever little details to get you excited. Though don't go in feeling like you will be getting an insight into anything you don't already know about the beast.. it is ambiguous at best.

Love Godzilla,I'm tired of reading all these reviews about how this movie sucked. I bet half of you have never even seen the original movies. Otherwise you'd know what you're talking about. But love and thanks for the true fans of Godzilla. Who know what they're talking about. This movie is awesome and so is Godzilla. Godzilla is a horror movie classic.and has been for years before some of you were even born. Just like king kong and other famous movie monsters Godzilla is a legend.

Irrelevant drama & dialogue = fillers,"Too much irrelevant dialogue/drama. There are shows/movies that have good dialogue & drama, but those are actually relevant to the theme of those shows/movies. Irrelevant drama = fillers. Some of them could have been cut shorter.. for example, the scene where the main character's mom died could have been 1 or 2 minutes shorter, or better yet, it should have just been left out and instead just present it as a short anecdote. They tried to make it look so dramatic how she died, even though it was just a few minutes into the movie... that's just unnecessary and silly.As for the action scenes... Too few & too brief. The only memorable scene was the atomic breath scene. Without that scene, I would have probably given this movie a 2/10 or maybe even a 1.This movie has a 7.1 IMDb rating because of the atomic breath scene and the hype from all the fans. If the Godzilla franchise didn't exist prior to this movie, then the ratings would have been much lower.This is just one of many movies that's mediocre but has 1 memorable scene.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Waiting for Godotzilla,"Sometimes the very best films are unintentionally funny, however it is with a heavy heart I inform you that the only unintentionally funny thing about this film is the cavalcade of comedic wigs donned by Bryan Cranston's character. I have seen more convincing hairpieces at a pensioner's pool party in Boca Raton. The only thing that was missing was a Hawaiian shirt, short shorts and a pick up line that begins with ""Hey baby...."".The movie has a stellar cast, with two Oscar winners and three Oscar nominees but you would never know it. Juliette Binoche was clearly taking the money and running, gone in 60 seconds (literally) and Ken Watanabe is as lifelike as the Oscar he won. Watanabe stomps leaden footed through most of his scenes garbling his lines but when it comes to stomping, who does it better than Godzilla? Sure the film is called Godzilla but...where IS GODZILLA? It's like some sort of absurdist piece. The titular head of the movie appears only sometimes, and we are first forced to endure a good thirty minutes of scene-setting and bad wigs. Godzilla appears more like the original Japanese version and there is some hat-tipping to the origins of the film franchise, but apart from that...we are still waiting for Godzilla. Not only is Godzilla hard to find in this hard slog of a film, but when Godzilla isn't just stomping over landmarks he is noshing on some sort of angry flying leftover from the film Starship Troopers. He isn't an angry refugee from atomic testing, he is a hungry behemoth who unintentionally saves the world. It's a good thing too...because NOTHING saves this film.Elizabeth Olsen runs the gamut of emotions from A to...well A. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, MUST be better in other films, because he makes Godzilla look life-like and believable. It is for Sally Hawkins that my heart breaks. She is an outstanding actress, and just this year was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for Blue Jasmine. What was she doing here? What was she doing signing on for this film? She was virtually invisible as the handmaiden to Watanabe, and although she is the only one who it can be said of, was actually acting, she was wasted and lost in the carnage and close ups of Cranston and Watanabe. My final sorrowful song is sung to David Strathairn who is also an Oscar nominated actor, and is deservedly considered one of America's finest character actors. However, therein, lies the problem. In order for one to be a character, one must have a character to inhabit. Strathairn blinks his way through this film seemingly oblivious to the mess around him. It must make it easier when your resume includes, ""Lincoln"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" to simply not move and hope no one notices you.Most good stories start with a fundamental list of ingredients: the initial situation, conflict, complication, climax, suspense, denouement, and conclusion. None of these ingredients will be found in Godzilla. They are simply not applicable. In ""Waiting for Godot"" Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes. As scholar David Bradby says in his criticism of Godot, this is an understatement: ""less than nothing happens.""That same criticism can be made of Godzilla, or as I have called it, ""Waiting for Godotzilla.""",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apt Godzilla for serious fans,"Godzilla comes out of monster retirement to dispose of some unearthed nasty MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms), and an officer in the United States Navy must get to his family after aiding his work obsessed father.There are no one liners and gags, this appears to have been made for Godzilla fans and fans of film as the tone isn't that of the usual mainstream popcorn flick, with this take on Godzilla being reminiscent of the original films. There are some fantastic visuals on show,the special effects are exceptional and the music and sound design are excellent. Director Gareth Edwards creates some tension and atmosphere and successfully gives the much needed scope and scale to battle scared Godzilla when he is finally revealed midway through.The MUTO designs appear to unavoidably borrow elements from Starship Troopers; Star Wars Episode 2; Pacific Rim to name a few and the influx of creature films over the years slightly takes the edge off the spectacle. In addition, Godzilla's emotional functional storyline borrows a pivotal plot point from Gareth Edwards' own film Monsters (2010), which is odd considering Dave Callaham wrote this offering.All the actors are on fine form, Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston are notable. Effects aside the everyday detail is unprecedented, the Las Vegas, tsunami and battleship helm segments to name a few are meticulously created, the film feels very real at times in terms of look and background activity aided by the excellent sets and locations. The designed sequences of movements between the MUTOs and Godzilla in the showdown fights are choreographed and executed finely giving mass and character to the unidentified terrestrial organisms.Overall, a visual treat and apt Godzilla entertainment.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
All you want from a summer blockbuster...and more,"The anticipation for this movie has been huge, as shown by the estimated $80 million box office for it's first weekend.It is all you want from your generic summer blockbuster. Giant destructive monsters, shouting US military/navy soldiers, the annoying crying/screaming wife, a separated husband and wife due to a colossal event, a straight talking admiral/commander, and a nerd scientist who has many sudden realisations.And yet, this movie just happened to be much more. It had a followable plot, it had surprises, it had twists and it had turns, there was no unnecessary humour. It had Heisenberg. It was a hugely enjoyable film, despite it's flaws.Do I really need to comment on the visuals? Everyone who's seen the trailer knows that this is a spectacular film, and it really delivers on it's promise. I saw it in 3D and despite my worries beforehand I did not get motion sickness at all.My main complaint would be the build up to that first shot of Godzilla. It took way too long, I was sitting there listening to all this back story while constantly thinking ""Where's Godzilla? Where's Godzilla?"" I was starting to worry that Godzilla did not make an appearance in this Godzilla film. A minor problem though, once the film got going, it really got goingTo end on a positive, the film is great if you like this sort of inconceivable destructive monster thing. I'd give it 7.5/10 if you could do that here. But I have one last thing to say to the creators of this film, don't make a sequel. Leave it is it is.

Fantastic CGI,"I grew up watching the old Godzilla movies, loved them. Still do. But obviously this is a far cry from the Toho productions.

Godzilla doesn't actually spend much time on screen, as others have complained, but sometimes less is more. Wish I'd seen it on the big screen instead of my 28"" TV.

While some of the story was done well, for god sakes they made a movie about a giant monster semi-believable the big problem is the cast, the film felt as if they they really missed the make with the cast, maybe if there are missing scenes that will fill in why everything felt so flat.Fun popcorn movie but not much more, might want to wait for it to hit DVD or catch a daytime show for cheap.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

However, way too much time is spent following a lot of generic action movie types of human characters, yet none of them manage to exude much empathy due to their lack of depth.

A giant improvement on the last outing,"Clearly one cannot keep down a monster the size of Godzilla (the name is a combination of two Japanese words meaning 'gorilla' and 'whale'). Since his first appearance in a Japanese movie in 1954, there have been no less than 28 offerings from Toho Studios, while there have now been four American productions: two (1956 and 1985) re-packagings of a Japanese film, the ill-fated 1998 version (which was supposed to have been the first of a trilogy), and now this Legendary/Warner Brothers outing.Let it be said immediately that British director Gareth Edwards has produced a superior film to the mess than we had in 1998 - a well-paced and entertaining thriller. He is helped by advances in technology (the end credits name a vast army of special effects artists) and the co-operation of the US military (the same end credits acknowledge the use of an arsenal of ships and weaponry), but also we have a vaguely understandable plot this time, as San Franscisco rather than New York City is pummelled into the ground. Godzilla looks the part (congratulations to the casting director), but the two MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) look as if they were rejects from the 1997 movie ""Starship Troopers"".As two of those in charge of the monster hunt, Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn fit their roles well; and, as a romantic couple in peril, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are pretty enough; but Sally Hawkins is miscast for a blockbuster movie (and I mean that as a compliment) and there is a criminal under use of the wonderful French actress Juliette Binoche (as with Jean Reno in the 1998 film, it seems that the producers just wanted to pull in a Gallic audience). For once in a movie, the ending comes at exactly the right point (with no silly coda) and makes it clear that a sequel is likely.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I don't really care about the uninteresting human characters that take up most of the screen time, I want to see GODZILLA.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Mixed-Bag,"Godzilla is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is the second attempt at a Hollywood reboot of the Godzilla film franchise, following the disastrous attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998. The film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Cranston, alongside Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn.Mostly identifiable from his successful low budget film 'Monsters', Edwards attempts to take some of the concentrated interior conflicts from the characters in this previous film, and apply them to this film, set to the backdrop of the destruction of America at the hands of the King of the Monsters. Whilst an initial lengthy and thorough exploration into the characters themselves does provide the basis for the following chaos and destruction to have some substance behind it, it results in an opening act which feels sluggish. Additionally, whether it is through his roaring screech or enormous shadow, Godzilla is consistently teased to the audience in an attempt to increase anticipation for his first appearance. The persistent and over-implementation of this technique however simply builds frustration rather than excitement.Nevertheless, Godzilla's initial appearance is undoubtedly powerful. Never has his vast scaly body looked so beautiful, and never has his ear-piercing roar sounded so authentic and frightening. The CGI as a matter of fact is almost faultlessly immersive throughout the entirety of the film, as is the sound design and hypnotic soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat. Greatly to the director's credit, the film from this point does manage to maintain a feeling of panic and horror, and does manage to hit many of the emotional beats that felt lacking during the film's first half.Fascinatingly, this is both the film's greatest asset yet also its biggest hindrance. The film excels so marvelously in its final acts that it leaves its opening feeling dry and even somewhat mechanical. All things considered, the film is clearly a mixed-bag, but a worthwhile watch nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nowhere near its potential, yet enjoyable","Perhaps the most highly anticipated film of the 2014 summer season that masterfully built up suspense in the trailers leading up to it, Godzilla adds new life and excitement to the long-lasting franchise, yet one is left feeling slightly dissatisfied with the finished product. Surprisingly enough, the film places humans in the forefront, mainly focusing on character development rather than the exploits of the notorious monster. Although this approach is successfully executed, with Bryan Cranston being particularly deserving of praise and Aaron-Tyler Johnson also giving a solid performance, it does result in Godzilla becoming a character driven film, which ultimately hurts its essence. However, despite the fact that it presents the audience with an unexpected and uncharacteristic framework, the film does manage to maintain its trademark thrilling style. Godzilla is undoubtedly an enjoyable cinematic experience, and even though it offers far less action than one would anticipate, it is worth watching for the gripping visual and sound effects alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finally a movie does Godzilla justice,"Firstly, to those who complain about the movie making Godzilla a hero, you certainly know nothing about the history of this creature.

Secondly, I applaud the director for making the Godzilla from the 1998 film look like a joke. The 2014 version is a movie created for Godzilla fans and that's why it gets the praise.

Godzilla rocks!,"I saw this with a friend, who liked it a little better than I did. He's just a hound for Godzilla films, and he loved it. I like old monster films, but this is the 21st Century, and everything is different now. But I admit I was impressed. We can't believe in floppy rubber suit monsters anymore; but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy some good old monster bashing when it's done well. And I think it is here.The FX are very good - but this is not just another comic book FX romp. I actually came to feel for the Big Green guy here. And while I didn't quite feel so deeply for the humans, I think they (both the characters and actors portraying them) did what they had to do under the circumstances - they were all quite believable to me.As for the action - I can't believe anyone found the first part dull; it isn't monster-ridden, but it segues into the monster action quite well. And there's more to Godzilla himself here than some critics are reporting.There are lots of memorable moments through-out the film. The moment when the MUTO walks by the while the soldiers are lying on the bridge trying not to be noticed really had me on edge. And I won't spoil the final battle, but it's a keeper.I found the whole very riveting and entertaining. It moves well and is well made. That the heaviest action moments are played out between the monsters but seen through the eyes of human observers worked well for me. I really felt like I was there, I saw as much as I needed to, to be thrilled and entertained.And that's the word for it - entertainment. ""Citizen Kane"" this ain't, but it's a great movie for chills and thrills (and frankly there ain't many of those these days).

Fun if Flawed Hollywood Take on the Japanese Icon,"Being a huge fan of Godzilla movies, I was highly anticipating the release of Gareth Edwards' 2014 American Legendary Films reimagining. I'd heard that Toho was involved more with the production, I thought Edwards' Monsters (2010) was an intriguing take on a giant monster movie, and Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame was in it, promising strong performances and drama to support the monster action. Leaning back in my theater chair with a tub of popcorn, a big smile on my face, and surrounded by friends, I was so ready for this to be amazing. Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling a bit underwhelmed, and a friend's constant complaining about every possible nitpick tarnished my experience even further. Forward to 2019, when I finally decided I wanted to revisit it, feeling hyped again for the sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, coming out in May this year. Got the Blu Ray to add to my growing Godzilla collection-I've got most of them, though there are so many! It's loaded with extras that I'll have to get to at some point before May.My appreciation for it has slightly increased, and I think it's enjoyable as a ""dumb action/sci-fi movie,"" which is what most of the Godzilla films are, aside from the 1954 original and a few later gems like Godzilla vs. Mothra (1964) and Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant All-Out Monsters Attack (2001), which actually have good acting, human storylines, and capture some of the social heft of the original. So it's a bit unfair to judge this movie for what it isn't, though it's hard to judge the film on its own terms since it seemed like it was trying to meld suspenseful/fun creature rampage flick with a serious human survival/family action/melodrama story.The strongest aspect is how the monsters are handled. Despite the short amount of screentime Godzilla gets, the restraint does build up anticipation for the reveals. And the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) do get shown off a lot destroying stuff early on. The first half hour does a solid job of setting up the threat, so we understand how dangerous they are when they start wreaking havoc. Their appearance is sinister and unique; describing them as ""insect-like"" is probably the easiest comparison. Godzilla thankfully looks akin to the original Toho designs, a lumbering, spiky giant rather than the sleek giant iguana of the 1999 Tri-Star incarnation. There's great carnage action of city destruction and monster fights with the MUTOs, and the news footage of the monsters' conflict played casually on television sets adds a bit of campy levity to an otherwise too-serious tone. Finally, there's that one scene of Godzilla using his radioactive beam in an ""oh yes!"" moment that every decent Godzilla movie has.As for the mix of monster and human stories, the problem is that these elements are uneven, the human drama pushed to the forefront, focusing on Cranston's character, Joe Brodie (an engineer at a nuclear power plant) and later his son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), an army bomb disposal expert. This isn't inherently bad, as I thought it was what made Monsters unique, leaving me with the impression of a giant monster movie ""elevated"" to dramatic heights. What's unfulfilling is that it lacks emotional weight, suspense, or originality. We spend so much time with Ford yet learn little about or see little emotion from him (it's hard to decide whether this is due to Taylor-Johnson's limitations or the writing or a combination). And a soldier, we are meant to see him as a kind of military hero, and also as a loving family man, searching for his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde). It's all a bit cliché.The role of MONARCH, the secret government agency studying giant creatures, which also plays a role in Kong: Skull Island (2017) and will feature in the next installments in the Legendary ""Monsterverse,"" adds a bit of intrigue, with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) a clear nod to director Ishiro Honda (who helmed the original as well as several sequels) and the tragic Dr. Serizawa from the first film, and Dr. Vivenne Graham (Sally Hawkins, now famous as the protagonist of The Shape of Water). While neither have much to do during the film, they are strong actors who bring a presence and a gravitas to the situation-understanding that all they can really do is study the monsters, because the military is not equipped to defeat them.Definitely worth a watch for even a casual kaiju (giant monster) fan, as long as you have tempered expectations. Despite its flaws, it's entertaining enough as a set up the Monsterverse and to see Hollywood put forward a more respectful take on Godzilla than the 1999 movie. While the Tri-Star Godzilla, I would argue, is actually not a bad giant monster movie, it fails miserably as a Godzilla movie, with few similarities to the Japanese franchise and the military winning the day. Legendary's take resembles the original series in that humans are struggling for survival rather than triumphing over creatures who are clearly beyond human power to control. Kong: Skull Island was more fun than this film in terms of campiness and more monster action, and the trailers for Godzilla: King of the Monsters look amazing, so I am exciting for the future of this franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Godzilla the Monster Ruled. Godzilla the Movie Didn't.,"After the disaster that was Roland Emmerich's version of Godzilla, for which the son of a bitch isn't even sorry, this 60th anniversary feature is the 2nd coming of the giant monster & is supposedly the reboot of Godzilla film franchise. Set in contemporary timeline, it depicts Godzilla as ""a terrifying force of nature"" who is pitted against malevolent creatures who for years have been feeding on nuclear radiations but now threaten the very existence of humanity. But the bigger question is whether it resurrects the legacy of the King of the Monsters and the answer to it is both yes & no.Director Gareth Edwards uses the same formula that he applied in his debut feature, Monsters, only for it to not work in the end. Too much time is devoted to the human drama which really wouldn't have been a problem if by any means it was interesting or properly executed. Also, he's able to build up the tension but then cuts it just when it's getting more exciting, leading to frustration on the part of viewers. And the humour is absent to give an impression of a serious film but the script adds nothing to that aspired seriousness, thus leaving the drama pretty hollow.Still, barring one aspect, the technical filmmaking is worthy of all the praise. Art direction meticulously designs, details & renders the creatures on the screen. Cinematography expertly manages to create an aura of impending doom. VFX is as spectacular as the titular character itself while sound is easily the movie's most impressive aspect. Editing, however, isn't up to the mark but the background score by Alexandre Desplat is just the way it should be in this movie; majestic, imposing & grandeur.Coming to the performances, Godzilla features an unusual cast in Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins & others. And I've no idea what the hell they signed up for because acting certainly isn't what they do here. For the majority of its runtime, all they do is simply stare with their blank faces & dropped jaws and are completely clueless about what's expected from their characters. The only exception is Bryan Cranston who delivers an energetic performance but then his role is short-lived.This movie promised to bring the 'King of the Monsters' right from its origins while also keeping its look & style faithful to its depiction in the original Japanese film. And to that, it delivers. Apart from few modifications, the overall appearance of Godzilla is mostly in tune with its iconic look plus its distinctive roar & signature weapon are also in tact. Still, its role is reduced to an extended cameo as the 1st half doesn't tease us with Godzilla's presence but this giant monster is virtually absent from the scene. And when it finally shows up, it happens simply out of nowhere.On an overall scale, Gareth Edwards' Godzilla had the potential to be 'The Movie of the Summer' but thanks to its mediocre direction, uninspired screenplay, terrible characterization, dull performances, messed-up editing & lack of substance, it doesn't live up to its hype. Still, what works ends up working pretty well in here & considering today's mainstream audience's taste in films, most of them are gonna come out pretty satisfied in the end anyway. To summarize the movie in a sentence, Godzilla did rise but it didn't rise enough.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Cloudy Echo of the Monster's Youth, Filtered to Match the Modern Style","In a lot of ways the Roland Emmerich Godzilla is an exhibit of '90s popular cinema, for better and for worse, and I think we'll feel the same about this one in about ten years' time. It's dark, gritty and menacing, often to a fault. The screen is awash with grays and browns. The important CG moments are impressive and generally perform well, but they're still quite obviously digital set pieces and feel unnatural. I did find a lot more to appreciate in the tone of this one than in its 1998 cousin, which wears a strong admiration of the Toho source material on its sleeve. In terms of focus, this could've passed for one of Japan's own: the screen spends far more time hovering around the human components than the monster himself, who's largely relegated to a cameo role. Those civilians are universal retreads, though, only vaguely interesting at their best moments. For the most part it's a very bland movie, slogging through a repetitive plot that had me checking my watch on the regular. The monster fisticuffs are cool, even if the impact of familiar skylines being toppled has lost some edge in the wake of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim and The Avengers, but even those are often tossed aside as afterthoughts. I lost count of how many times the screen cut away just as the king of monsters got his paws on an equally-oversized freak. Clearly it was a conscious decision to keep our perspective with the huddled masses, but that makes for a tough contradiction; artistic, yes; rewarding, no. The HALO jump seen in an early teaser trailer is probably the only thing I'll remember in a few months. Much less enthusiastic a revival than I was hoping for.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Godzilla looks great, but the films has its faults.","I don't know a lot about the Godzilla films. I've only watched the disappointing Roland Emmerich 1998 film and only small bits of the old ones. I watched the trailer for Gareth Edward's ""Godzilla"" and became very interested in this adaptation. From the trailer, it looked visually stunning and intense. I have to say, though, I was a let down by this film.The story is mostly about Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his encounters with Godzilla. They conveniently meet from Japan to Hawaii to California as Godzilla tries to find and destroy two new monsters who were released (the trailer made no mention of these two creatures). There is another storyline with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who gives us background information about the new Godzilla.Godzilla looks great in this film. He is huge and looks very realistic. Every time he comes on the screen it's really good. However, Edwards makes this film like Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" so we don't get to see Godzilla as much. The film decides to follow the humans more and tries to be a character drama. I don't think this worked out though.I felt like the characters were thinly scripted. We've seen these kind of characters before. The performances aren't bad, but I never felt emotionally engaged with any of them. The cast is great with Oscar winner Juliette Binoche and Oscar nominees Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. It even has Bryan Cranston who seems to have won everything except an Oscar, but I just didn't feel connected to them. I didn't really care for them.The story is forced and has a few plot holes. Many people just happen to be in the right place at the right time. It can be kind of repetitive. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography really saves this film. It looks great and really captures the grand scale of Godzilla. He makes great use of blacks and reds throughout the film.Edward's ""Godzilla"" is a blockbuster reboot that looks great, but has a weak story. The film is at its best when Godzilla holds the screen. It'll wow you.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good film, great monsters, stupid humans","The monster action is some of the best in the Godzilla franchise, when you get to see it.The family; bland soldier, blonde nurse and annoying kid, get in the way of a story that should be about giant monsters fighting.Scientist Father steals the emotional scenes and Japanese scientist adds a good depth to the movie when explaining about the monsters.The monsters are the best that they've ever looked, destruction is great and the monsters' back story is very very good.Recommend this movie to fans of the franchise, not for BIG fans of Pacific Rim though, as the monster action scenes are few compared to that film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great addition to the Godzilla legacy,"A great Hollywood adaption to the Godzilla legacy, and the only one we will speak of from now on *cough* 1998 *cough*.i would first like to get one thing straight this is not PACIFIC RIM this would fall more under a category like suspense,drama,monster instead of the non-stop action of pacific rim. the action is closer to something like MAN OF STEEL or KING KONG with much more focus on the human storyline. though sometimes this doesn't work as well as intendedthe director(Gareth Edwards) stated that he didn't want to over-saturate the audience with Godzilla(though there is still plenty of Godzilla/monster screen time) but instead build to a big finale. while the focus on the human character's works well in the first third because of good acting and the inclusion an interesting situation, it does cause it to slow a bit around the middle, this is because of a change in focus(the wait for Godzilla doesn't help)but doesn't completely die down with the occasional teases and building to the final third which is glorious.also before seeing this, i thought the trailer had ruined it by showing the best bit's. instead nearly all of it turned out to be from the first 60mins and left plenty of surprises in the last halfi really liked this movie and how it stayed true to the Godzilla legacy, i would strongly recommend it to any one who like's the classics and is fine movie for any movie fan no matter what genre. just know going in that while some of the fight's may remind you of pacific rim it's pacing is more similar to king kong or man of steel but in the best possible way",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Watch it in cinema,"Big gigantic monsters fighting among humans, hell yeah!Godzilla is a excellent movie, but theres a problem.
It isnt made for home viewing, if you happened to watch it in cinema and later on home then you understand.
In cinema everything is bigger, louder and gives more chills.
In home if you dont have a home theater system and turn up the volume, you wouldnt still get that exact feeling, its just made for cinema watching.Story is good, specially i like how Ford Brody moves around in the movie, how he isnt lingering in one place, he has a goal, but he does everything that it takes to reach that goal.CGI is on point with the sound effects, hearing how the Godzilla charges up to shoot out the flames, just gives you the chills...Super movie, if you watch it in cinema",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So disappointing!,I wanted to like this but the script was pathetic. I have to say that the monster action was great. Seeing the battles on the big screen was very satisfying. Unfortunately the story line for the humans was horrible. What army blocks a bridge so school buses can't escape? Also why would they send school buses across the golden gate to get out of the city? It seems like they put people in peril only to fill the monster moments.I really wanted to like this but the only fun I had was yelling at the screen at the disastrous plot points.

Where's Godzilla in this Movie?,"When you have movie named ""Godzilla"" you expect to see a movie in which Godzilla would be prominent throughout the adventure. Instead, we get a 2-hour movie in which we get 15-20 minutes of Godzilla and 2 hours of filler.Won't bore you with the script, only to say it's a bit sappy and hackneyed. The parts with Godzilla are understated, fleeting and uninspired. No epic or memorable moments. No exciting battles.The production value of the film was good and the graphics were fairly well done. Parts of the storyline were also well written. So, overall I will give this mercy rating of a 6. This will not be added to my Blu-ray collection until it reaches the sub $3 range.

"Very entertaining, great cinematography and effects.","I'm a 60 year old guy with very fond memories of the Godzilla franchise from my youth. I recently watched ""Godzilla: King of Monsters"" with Raymond Burr and was really impressed how well it's held up. This remake is oddly true to the spirit of weird heritage of this series. Usually, disaster films heavy in CGI don't do anything for me but this one is oddly affecting. Yeah, humans in it are kind of superfluous to the plot but it's a GODZILLA MOVIE, not Citizen Kane. You go to see kaiju battling it out and cities being destroyed with a few lines of dialog about man and nature. On that level, it's something of a masterpiece. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprised,"Godzilla(2014) was a surprise for me-a pleasant one,if nothing else. I do not usually go in for monster movies as I felt they all had the same basic formula- the world isn't ready for the monster, it comes out of nowhere, terrorizes a city or two,etc. But Gareth Edwards took that formula and changed it and made it his own,for the better,I think. The special effects are amazing and when Godzilla made his grand entrance it took my breath away. It also helped that I saw The King of the Monsters in all his glory, in 3D.(Trust me,it's worth it.)This new reboot certainly has it's flaws,however, with an underwhelming performance from Aaron Taylor Johnson,and a misused performance from the phenomenal Bryan Cranston.I also felt that this version did not show enough of the big green guy, and focused too much on characters whose names you probably won't remember after coming out of the theatre.But Godzilla (2014) is quite an enjoyable summer blockbuster that puts it's own spin on the monster movie formula.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Anti-climatic,"I went to this movie to see Godzilla, and I hardly ever saw him. When I did see him, he looked clumsy and facially not as attractive as previous incarnations. That and an anti- climax spoiled the movie for me, in spite of some good 3D effects.I was annoyed by several cuts of scenes that caused me to wonder, ""what just happened??"" Also, the spoof of 1950's flicks doesn't quite come off.What will stand out in my mind will be the 3 forces of nature battling it out (briefly) oblivious to the smashed city under their feet. Maybe that will be worth it to you.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gareth Edwards captures the magic of the original film.,"Of all 2014's films, Godzilla was my most anticipated. In some ways, it let me down. In most, it satisfied me.Let me first speak of the cons. For all this film's darkness, its ""infant immortality"" shows it's not quite as gritty as the classic film. I also was disappointed Godzilla did not return to his villainous roots. Finally, the characters and their stories were not as interesting as they ought to have been.The pros far outweigh the cons though. Gareth Edwards loves his monsters and it shows. He treats the kaiju with respect. Godzilla and the MUTO are well-designed, have great roars, behaviors, and flawless CGI. The movie utilizes buildup and suspense to bring a climax that pays off massively. The film also has a constant dark atmosphere, that never once crosses into cheese. Every angle in this film is masterfully shot, end of story. Bryan Cranston's performance was breathtaking and scenes with him have the most emotion and heart. While the character stories did not pay off, the characters (and the acting) all sufficed. While short of a masterpiece, this is one of the best monster movies you will ever see.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is the Godzilla movie we should have gotten in 1998,"Though this is in no way a really good movie, I enjoyed it. Godzilla 14' entertained me until the end. I have seen every single Godzilla movie and this isn't even close to the worst ones.The story is kinda bad. This movie focuses more on the humans than Godzilla, which I don't have a problem with, since they have done it in past Godzilla movies that were good. The problem with it focusing on the humans though it that the characters are plain and generic. They never fleshed out the humans enough for me to care about them and they made stupid choices turn after turn. Not to mention dialogue have continuity errors. Again they have done this in past Godzilla movies.The acting was meh. Bryan Cranston gave the best performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson was not that great, he just kinda stared and said things that furthered the plot. Elizabeth Olsen was just there as a plot device, she didn't have many lines. Ken Watanabe was just there to stare, talk about Godzilla, and correctly pronounce Gojira. Sally Hawkins was there for like 5 scenes and in every one she was annoying.The camera work was good though. There were some nice shots that showed chaos throughout the city, the soldiers, the monsters, and hat HALO jump. One thing is for sure, it didn't look bad at all.The soundtrack is great too. The music makes you feel like you're in every situation and lends great to the Godzilla theme.Godzilla 14' was OK, but the dark and gritty feel won me over to give it a 7/10. The movie wasn't horrible like people say it is, but it isn't a masterpiece. It is just a cool monster movie that is entertaining. If we would have gotten this in 98' no one would have complained. I really hope they improve upon this to make a great sequel, I can't wait to see Ghidorah in action again.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Impressive effects and a cool monster, but not enough of them","Once again Godzilla roars his way on to our screens, with a big epic path of destruction lying in his wake. Obviously after the failure of the 90's Godzilla, then the director Gareth Edwards had a lot to make up for. Unlike the 90's Godzilla, the film is far more loyal to the original films. For example, it's the military's mistakes that awake an ancient monster who has been dormant for years. As they awaken, mankind's only hope lies in Godzilla to protect them. In one of several nice callbacks in the film, Godzilla and the other monsters are influenced by the use of nuclear warfare, demonstrating the film does have respect for it's roots.But obviously whilst the story remains like the original, the effects have improved vastly over the past 60 years. The monsters definitely look epic and just like the monkeys in Planet of the Apes, Godzilla has been brought to the modern age and gone from a guy in a suit to brilliant special effects. Obviously the effects go towards not only making the epic scale of monsters real, but also their vast destruction with the sight of entire buildings falling as we get to witness our monster pretty much obliterate entire cities.Though, it has to be said the special effects alone are not the only thing that make this film impressive. Whilst the effects are probably the main selling point of the film, the director is not afraid to build up the monster over time, for a large part of the film showing glimpses of the monsters before their ultimate reveal. This is far more effective at emphasising the scale of the beasts in the film and also building up anticipation to get a full view of the monster. He also often shows the camera at the perspective of the citizens looking up at these monsters, placing us in the position of the victim of these attacks.But unfortunately, just like Pacific Rim last year, a majority of the characters in the film feel either redundant or underdeveloped. For example, Brody's family are probably in the film for about 15 minutes and have little character and absolutely no impact on the plot other than being a reason for him to get home. They're an incredibly weak plot device and the film would have been much more successful had they simply been removed from the film to allow for more time towards stronger elements in the film. Similarly, Sally Hawkins character does nothing in the entire 2 hours of the film apart from possibly some exposition that could have easily been done by Ken Watanabe's character. Then there's the lead Brody, who is a very bland hero. This isn't due to the acting, but because we never learn anything about him as a character after the first 20 minutes of the film. It becomes harder to invest in the film because of this due to a lack of empathy towards the character and less tension when he is placed in danger.It's also strange because they were effective at creating a great character in Bryan Cranston who would've been far better as the lead for the film, but instead gets barely any screen time overall. His character actually gets a lot of emotional investment in the first act of the film, becoming obsessed with finding out what had been hidden from him and becoming a crazed conspiracy theorist. But then the focus of the film shifts to his son who was less built up than Cranston was and didn't get any development over the rest of the film. It was also Cranston's great acting as well, being that great mixture of emotional agony and sheer awesomeness, making it a real shame we couldn't see more of him in the film.There's also one other great character that the film has. Godzilla himself. Yes, finally instead of Hollywood treating him as some mindless monster, Godzilla has a personality! He's awesome with the best cheers in the cinema coming from his tail whips and atomic breath making him into one heck of a bad-ass. Along with this also comes his epic roar that remains as timeless now as it ever was. But Godzilla does have one disadvantage. Whilst the character of Godzilla dominates everything when he is on screen and has a very impressive build up, just like Cranston's character he doesn't get enough screen time with a feeling that there were some missed scenes of destruction in the film.This can be said to partly being focused to build up suspense of character, but it's also because the film spends far too much time focused on the other monsters called the MUTO's. This is a shame, seeing as they are not particularly impressive and are fairly generic monsters that you can never really get particularly interested in. What I don't get is why not just use one of the many already existing monsters for the film like Mothra or King Ghidorah who would have made more interesting enemies? Though I guess we can hope to see them in the sequels.Besides, Godzilla is still a good film. It's not as great as it could be, but still has some good elements such as the fights and the character of Godzilla. It's just a shame the film is let down by weaker elements such as spending too much time on characters who serve no purpose. But the film is certain to be a hit at the box office, largely due to the special effects and the name Godzilla which is something of an icon. Also I do feel that in some part the star power of Bryan Cranston will also play a role in it's box office glory due to his strong presence in the trailer and riding off his success from Breaking Bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The arrogance of men is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around.,"In 1999 Joe Brody, his wife Sandra, and their son Ford were living in Japan, where both Joe & Sandra work at a nuclear plant.

Still One of The Best Godzilla Films,"Seeing the original trailers for the film, I was convinced it was going to be the best movie this year. They emphasized not on the colossal action of Godzilla vs other monsters, but on the pure devastation such a creature would leave in its wake. Like the 1954 one, but using the latest technology to fully enhance its vision.Sadly, we got a monster vs monster film. Not a bad one, necessarily. But instead of the scourge of humanity, Godzilla's our uncontrollable hero. I'd preferred a darker Godzilla film, to bring some fresh air to Hollywood blockbusters and the franchise.Some people complain about the pacing of the film. On paper, I think it's done perfectly. There's a lot of buildup, yet things are always happening. The damage by these creatures is devastating, yet controlled enough so you aren't desensitized. Some shots are done very well, truly emphasizing the creatures' titanic size. The CGI blows the costumed men out of the water, and even does a good job on the destruction. The final battle is climactic, and earned cheers in our theater.Unfortunately, the characters are pretty weak. Godzilla films aren't know for their personalities, but by this era, we should have some relateable characters. I literally cannot say a single defining trait about our main character. He's just a typical, handsome action lead who isn't even particularly handsome. More is known about the surface of Mars than his relationship between his wife and kid. They're obviously included as a cheap attempt to pull heartstrings. Bryan Cranston's and Ken Watanabe's characters are better, but ultimately have too little time and too little depth. The weakness of the characters makes the Jaws-esq pacing a bit disappointing.I still had a good time. The ending fight scene was totally worth it, and the action and destruction beforehand impressed me. It should have been better, though. Hopefully the sequel will correct its problems and tread new ground while pleasing fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty good.,"-So Godzilla is the movie I really don't need to explain. I will say that its only really comparisons are the original movies, the 1998 ""movie"" (sigh), and Pacific Rim. Aaaand it was pretty good! It played it safe and kinda shows, but that was good for the formula they had.-The story was a good update of one of the originals (and I won't tell you guys which one) and I really liked the new looks. I also loved how much they honored the original in the look of the monster, characters, story, and movie overall.-Its 2 hours and has an origin story pace. I did wish Godzilla was in it a little more earlier on, but the Pacific Rim good fights at the end proved worthwhile.-The cast was good. Bryan Cranston was great! Ken Watanabe is also one of my favorite actors now! He was so good in it! Yup. I did not really like the lead that much. I don't know his name and his character is not supposed to be all actor, but he still could have used a little range.-Music was great! Exciting and honored the originals a lot! -Cg was great. Could potentially be an Oscar contender. Also fights rocked.-Cinematography and look was pretty good too! I was impressed a few times.-So overall it was infinitely better than the first American attempt/failure in 1998! It was on par with Godzilla as a remake and I enjoyed it. It was not as ""cool"" as Pacific Rim, but it was deeper and had an actual story. Lol.-I would give Godzilla a high 7.5. Almost an 8. I liked it more than my 7,5s so far (Amazing Spider-Man 2, Muppets Most Wanted, Non-Stop) but not as much as my 8s (Jack Ryan, Lone Survivor, Saving Mr. Banks, God's Not Dead) I want to give it an 8, but I would not buy it.-I would however totally recommend it!

Tragically awful,"This movie could have been really fun. The first 25 minutes were wonderful to behold and throughout there were many instances of eerily beautiful imagery. The fundamental ridiculousness of Godzilla is the main issue. A warder of the planet destroying ancient entities that harm the planet...needs another form. The film was so full of pretentious cinematic clichés, over indulgent militarism (are you really going to semi-auto weapons to hurt a monster 10 stories tall?), and battle scenes so poorly designed (one would think of an old sci-fi flick 'The Deadly Mantis'), that the start may have been the best part of this ride. The absurdity is in why these creatures exist and how their interaction with us mortals takes place. Nothing makes much rational sense after the first 25 minutes.Bottom Line.

The special effects were amazing as it demonstrates the passion and enthusiasm of Godzilla and also his strength, as I feel as though it could have completely ruined the whole film if they had shocking special effects. Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to see the movie in 3D so I wouldn't know if it was any better.

"Went in with expectations, Left still expecting.","After watching the trailer and TV commercials for Godzilla, My first reactions were 'i have to see this', so i did and if I'm 100% honest, i was left expecting a lot more.

The special effects and CGI are impeccable Godzilla is scary in his own right but sad to say this was where i lost interest as after seeing Godzilla the story line was bland and predictable, i hoped Bryan Cranston would have a much larger role as he has produced some amazing work as of late and i hoped this would follow suit.

Godzilla?

Edwards seems to be trying to mimic Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws', where the great white shark remains mostly unseen for the bulk of the movie. The problem with trying that here is, it's a monster movie, and people want to see a throw-down. What we get instead are several almost rumbles before *finally* getting the monster mash we came for.

"Cinematically great, decent storytelling","When going in to see this film, you need to realize one thing: Godzilla is just one character of several in this film and he has a supporting role. If you realize this -- and thus that it's not a monster movie -- you will enjoy this film much more.The key strengths of this film are that the cinematography is great (the halo jump especially). From the opening credits to the end, my eyes -- and ears -- were never bored. This does help make up for the decent story. It's not magical and various characters come and go faster than you will like, making the continuity a little annoying by constantly shifting your focus. But it isn't blatantly horrible like typical big budget monster films.Because of this I gave the film an 8 (willing to watch it again, but don't feel the need to own it).",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I want a Godzilla origin story lol... that's all I want,"After waiting for a couple of the newer movies to come out, it makes sense that they did not make this an origin story for Godzilla. But, in my opinion, they should have made it one.I'm not really interested in getting an origin story for humans that won't even be in the next movies lol. I want an origin story about the mythology of Godzilla and the titans. I think it would have been really cool to go into all the different mythologies of the titans and set up this crazy monster universe...While this was disappointing, the action and acting were pretty good. The visuals were amazing and so was the music.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Just, just.......just awful","I rarely leave any reviews. Mainly because I don't usually feel the need to as I normally find something good, something likable, something to grasp onto and enjoy in most movies.I'm the kind of guy who'll see any movie for what it is; give it some cheesy, low-budge horror, or sickly sweet romcom, I'm good with most things - but this...This to me is the worst. This American, blockbuster'esqe, CGI enriched, hoo-rah, 'more visual than story' nonsense is just too much.I'm starting to wonder what it is that drives the Hollywood execs to consider this as an 'OK' film to release. Has it got to the point where it's OK just to plough nonsensical amounts of money into CGI and just forget about any kind of storyline? Is it that they forget that there's more than just the people that enjoy movies that live outside of America? No offense to my American brethren, but is this what you guys consider to be a good movie these days??I'm not sure what's going on in the world of American movies these days, especially where Hollywood's concerned. When you guys can produce the likes of Inception, The Dark Knight..........and then you let out this mindless drivel....TLDR - Don't, just don't.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It Could Done Better (Spoilers),"i enjoyed this movie i think it was fun for me i just like to watch Godzilla the thing is the movie goes for 2 hours long not fast placed but everyone hated the Godzilla (1998) overall the storyline story line. but a bit boring and too serious story and we don't see Godzilla much... just him fighting with Muto was good Godzilla in the best way i liked he blows the lighting blue lighting or blue fire was amazing thing i liked, but this didn't make any sense how does it make sense for the female MUTO to remain dormant without showing any sigh of life when it was examined by the scientists ? how the hell is the male MUTO still be smaller than the female after it has matured ? and why doesn't any of those nuclear bombs explode when the MUTOs ate them ? why wouldn't they launch a nuclear missile on some remote area to draw them out but instead have to transport a bomb by land ? i watched movie i said that in my mind without listing to another people oh best movie ever it is realistic that's why people don't know care for what makes sense or what story is just make it realistic and make it better come on you got to put what makes sense in movie.Aaron Taylor Johnson come on really ? that actor Kick Ass (2010) Savages (2012)wasn't guy who suit for main role in movie everyone said he was boring i can tell come on they were going to choose Joseph Gordon Levitt, Henry Cavill these guys could been better then Aaron Taylor Joesph Gordon and Henry were going to be main they were going to get these actors to be main but comprised the shortlist for the role before Legendary took interest in Taylor-Johnson WTF that is big problem why could of Byran Cranston could been main role in film why could old people be main role why ? Byran Cranston was the greatest Performance ever then Aaron Taylor Johnson no Performance for that guy i say he was just boring no acting his acting is not very series in movie he's acting is more like kick ass Byran Cranston was a fan of Godzilla he has been fan of Godzilla in His Childhood but why could Byran could been Main Role if he was main it could been better like Breaking Bad. it was always hes favorite monster movie That f**king pisses me off how they killed off the best actor within the first 30 minutes! I always liked Bryan Cranston as an actor because of Breaking Bad, Drive but i know this is clichéd but after Breaking Bad he became one of my favorite actors because he can make you sympathize, fear and laugh with a character and he is always believable in every role no matter how shitty a movie is! he is usually the best part. f**k why couldn't he have been the lead! oh here's why because hes a 58 year old man not a 22 year old straight out of the CW actor. well that's bull crap! when did men stop being the leads in movies and boys became it! f**k if i was a movie director which i really want to be and i had Bryan Cranston in my cast i would make him the f**king lead because he has the most talent. F**king hell give the older guys a chance instead of these untalented CW/Abercrombe runway model types! ﻿there is good shots in movie when Aaron Jumps off the plane with the red flares flying around jumping down wow Godzilla there is good CGI but to much, This movie was awesome, this ending was funny too. But people complaining about it so much were expecting the whole movie to be literally nothing but action and a bunch of cgi. Most people don't even know what they want in movies anymore. But this movie stayed true to the old Godzilla movies, and the other monsters being on screen more than Godzilla has happened plenty of times in movies like Godzilla vs Destroy. The build up for Godzilla is what made it so epic, and the atomic breath really made the movie there is less Godzilla just more Characters not really slow burn but there is not many great characters i enjoy this movie but i give it 6/10 it could done better because it is 2 hour movie 5 or 7 minutes Godzilla was in it he less in it he needs to be more in movie Main Role wasn't great or good just lame it would better if Byran Cranston as main role it doesn't matter if he is old or not old give it shot they could got Josh Brolin or Aaron Paul it doesn't matter if character is got to be 22 year old it is the performance of acting Aaron Taylor is more Comedy not in Series movies he didn't suit in role very well Byran Cranston will suit better for main role this movie needs more Godzilla",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Our Hero?,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sixty years after Godzilla made his initial screen appearance, we get a full blown Hollywood special effects blockbuster version that will eclipse the $100 million mark in its first weekend. This is director Gareth Edwards second feature film (Monsters, 2010) and he juggles the modern day re-imagining with the Japanese roots and a hand full of other tributes throughout.The cast seems impressive: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn. Unfortunately, most of these fine actors have little to do, and instead the dominant human presence (most every scene) is Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) who somehow keeps getting gigs despite lacking even a dollop of screen presence or acting ability. Of course, this movie is supposed to belong to Godzilla, and even he is usurped on screen time by two nuclear-feasting praying mantis creatures that share some attributes with the classic Alien. These screen hogs are called MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) and are quite substantial ... crushing skyscrapers by landing.The 1954 original film was an anti-nuclear statement, though the re-edited U.S. version replaced the political statement with Raymond Burr. Mr. Burr also appeared in the 1984 sequel which included a storyline of feeding off a nuclear plant (borrowed in this year's version). This film's prologue featuring Bryan Cranston working at a 1999 nuclear plant is an unmistakable nod to the recent Fukushima disaster, and sets the stage for the collision of science (Watanabe) and military (Strathairn). Director Edwards clearly enjoys his Jaws-like teasing of Godzilla, who finally shows up after almost an hour. And despite the Jurassic Park roar by our titular monster, this doesn't hold a candle to Spielberg's 1993 classic. We do get the quite familiar shots of bystanders running down the street, glancing back in fear - a must for any monster movie.Having seen this one in 3D, I'll mention again that the enhanced effects offered by this technology do not offset the darkened, dulled look. Add that to the almost total lack of color - it's borderline Black and White - and there are simply too few breathtaking visual moments to consider this a monster classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Monster is Attacking the City!,"A fun ride through and through. A clear improvement on the American franchise of Godzilla. The plot is very well outlined with not only our giant lizard friend, but also tell the story of a Naval Bomb Disposer, and his journey to get back to his family. The acting, while not the greatest ever seen, was well portrayed.It was quite the wait through the first thirty minutes of the movie. It was very well worth the wait. The suspense is built up until the bursting point, and it was paid off with a show that could only be described as devastating in a wonderful way. Godzilla is a commanding presence as he should be. This time, they got his character design correct, as well as his character as a whole.While their sequencing can lack here and there, the movie does very well in its payoff. The human tale is very gripping entertainment, but it is augmented by the presence of a true King of the Monsters. Definitely a great start, now on to the next!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining; One-Dimensional Characters,"Review:
'Godzilla' is an American monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is a reboot of Toho's Godzilla franchise and is the first film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. Most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion, it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The action in this this movie is really well done, and they don't over do it with explosions or unnecessary violence, which is shocking.
In the film, a soldier (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) attempts to return to his family while caught in the crossfire of an ancient rivalry between Godzilla and two monsters known as MUTOs.
Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are all one-dimensional, and nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspiring dialogue. They can't create good chemistry between them either, because the only have two scenes together and are apart for the rest of the film. I didn't like that the story is still very Americanised in the fact that it is a very white cast even though the bulk of the film is in Japan.
Say what you will about the shake cam, or the fact that you don't see the God of Monsters that much. This film is balls to the wall entertaining as it should be being a Summer Blockbuster. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is kidding themselves.
Overall, this movie has a good story with very entertaining action scenes. The characters are unfortunately not fleshed out enough to care about what happens to them. The only character in the movie you are rooting for is Godzilla himself.

Godzilla's back!!!,"The movie starts out with an interesting opening credits and Godzilla theme. Already, my Godzilla hype had begun. The heartbreaking opening was an interesting direction for a movie that had seemed to ignore that storyline completely, and a little waste of Cranston if you ask me. However the movie picked up quickly, and boy was it a fun ride! The visuals were just amazing to watch. The 3D isn't necessary but if you have a few bucks, go ahead. The human element as read by previous reviews, did indeed lack. The biggest peeve I had about the movie was that the big man himself (Godzilla) didn't show up until the last about half an hour and the teasings of him only made it excruciating to wait. When Godzilla came, my mind was blown by awesomeness. It made my insides into that of a 5-year old. Anyway in the end I give it a 8/10 and I would recommend you to watch it and if you can, in Imax 3D.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Mother Nature cares, but never take her for Granted!","A monster is created. How does that happen? Nuclear traces falling on some creature making it stronger by being its food.Is there need to worry? The answer is maybe not. Mother Nature takes care of everything.But one should notice not to take Mother Nature for granted. For she may require the time, that would happen to be enough to wipe entire human race.This is one such movie where Godzilla is shown as positive entity.Awesome movie!

Makes the 1998 version look like Citizen Kane,"Boy looking at the other IMDb reviews, this seems to have really annoyed an awful lot of people.Two comments: * I have argued here in the IMDb that the 1998 version with Broderick was under-rated. Vindication at last. As you slog through this version, you cannot help but recall how the 1998 film actually held interest from scene to scene, and seemed to want to go somewhere.* a cautionary tale on the importance of -- who knew? -- a script. The really strange thing is that the production standards, the effects, the cinematography, are all pretty solid. All dressed up and nowhere to go. The exec who greenlighted this script clearly did not have English as a first language. It was beyond terrible, it was strange and odd and seemed to be missing pages.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla is just OK,7/10 For me looks great saw early preview thanks to sun perks on a giant IMAX screen in 3D CGI is fantastic and I'm not a big fan of 3D so i had to suffer headache but did look good.... But feel you need more story and comedy in these movies now.....WHERES THE COMEDY??? It's a big popcorn of a movie but I just wanted a little bit more... Some parts are boring some things would just not happen and don't work.... I love a good monster movie King Kong both the old one and the new are great as was the brilliant Cloverfeild and Monsters was also good Again it looks great but just OK Save you money for Xmen in a couple of weeks and watch it this on DVD,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't watch/read anything about the movie before going in.,"I was forced to go to the cinema with the guys, expecting this to be a flick where Godzilla shows up and destroys everything, then they kill it. Lots of explosions and special effects, pretty standard story, blah. Nope. I was actually surprised, and I enjoyed the whole thing.The story was more intricate than I expected, and it kept bringing up surprises, the visuals were pretty on point, and it did give me quite a thrill.Watched this in 3D, which was good, but nothing overly spectacular, it didn't add too much for me.Don't read anything about this, keep an open mind. This isn't a movie about a monster that comes out of nowhere, destroys a city then gets killed. Lots of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Destructive action with monsters that have weight,"Godzilla is clearly the main character of this movie, which is a welcome change from 1990s Godzilla version. Although you don't see much of Godzilla, there is a big payoff with the climax. The movie had a much darker atmosphere that was reminiscent of War of the Worlds with a lot of ash and grey skies. The Halo jump scene had a gritty sense of realism that was one of the standout scenes. I also liked how the movie didn't mimic King Kong in one of the major scenes, when it could have easily done so. Rather it handled that scene in a much more enjoyable manner. A minor criticism of this movie was that the rest of the acting was not up to par of Cranston. Other parts of it, like the train scene, felt very reminiscent of Battle LA.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
CGI Combines WIth a 50s Feel,"Godzilla boasts some very impressive CGI effects and panoramic views. But to really enjoy this film it requires that you sit back, suspend your disbelief totally, immerse yourself in a mindset that people in the 50s had. Have some popcorn and imagine you are there. And the film sports some first person perspectives that really get there. Atomic science was a new and mysterious thing and the film tries to portray that with a foggy atmosphere in the opening stages. And those opening stages are slow to develop building suspense. As the nature of Godzilla and his purposes are revealed the film also becomes brighter in lighting. Imagine the fear of an audience afraid of what might become of the world in the nuclear age, and Godzilla will seem all that much more fearsome for it. It is very much in the style of 50s monster movies too and as such it is much of a time warp as an impressive display of modern CGI technology.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mixed bag of good and bad that ultimately lands somewhere in the middle.,"If ever a movie could be labelled a bag of liquorice allsorts, this is it. With nonsensical plot points, lifeless acting and a tone so earnest it makes Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy look like a Disney series, there's plenty to gripe about. Winning the directing gig solely on the back of his phenomenal debut film Monsters, Gareth Edwards appeared to be a rock solid choice for the job, but his approach is so heavy handed it all but drains the film of it's energy in the first hour. He also has a tendency to sideline logic or narrative cohesiveness – which is expected in a film that asks to be taken so seriously – in the name of crafting a visually splendid shot. Not helping is a ridiculously wooden central turn from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is boring and unconvincing as the Navy EOD technician who inexplicably becomes the key to fighting the monsters. Also disappointing is the short shrift given to the extremely talented Elizabeth Olsen (see Martha Marcy May Marlene) with a one-dimensional role as Taylor-Johnson's wife and the overcooked performance from the otherwise amazing Bryan 'Breaking Bad' Cranston. Yet for all of its downfalls, when the final hour hits and Edwards lets loose with some cracking sequences all is almost forgiven. From a tense scene atop a railway bridge to a thrilling special ops HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) jump and finally to the concluding beasty showdown in metropolitan Oakland, Edwards demonstrates just how memorable this picture could have been had he got it right from the opening credits instead of halfway through. Pacific Rim without the tongue-in-cheek vibe, Godzilla is at first a tough slog but finishes strong to place this squarely in the middle of the road.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla in a supporting role? Why?,"The trailer made me think this is a movie half-between Cloverfield and King Kong pushed to the limits to meet the known giant, the king of Monsters. The biggest creature ever in a movie.Well... while Godzilla is incredibly amazing when HE is in action, it lacks something that Cloverfield had. That feeling of being afraid of being ripped in a second, no matter how much you're trying to escape. The suspense is lacking somehow except in the beginning of the movie.The scenes of people being in panic are close compared to Transformers 1, 2012 or World War Z. It's a replay of chaos in the streets that nowadays gets a bit un- touching.The scenario? The ""Clichés"" are there. So if you dislike the American blockbusters, don't take it bad.Despite these negative feelings, Kudos to the FX team who made Godzilla proud of its name. When he is on the screen, you're blown up by the immensity of the GOD- like reptile being a fearless beast.But the creature is not so present on the screen. Poor Godzilla, he will eventually get an award for the best supporting role in a movie that bears his name. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Godzilla definitely roars,"The neat opening credits set the tone for the movie really well combining old military footage and redacted documents for great effect. This movie's approach is more serious than Pacific Rim's for example but not too much so. Visually the movie is absolutely tremendous. The beautiful cinematography conjures up some jaw dropping scenes and the CGI monsters and the destruction they cause are quite awe-inspiring. The way they dealt with the fighting between the monsters and the soldiers also made sense and really highlighted the enormity of these creatures. I'm glad they set a good part of the monster action at night so the monsters aren't always blasted front and center on the screen so we can use our imaginations to fill in the gaps. When the monsters are truly revealed, it's hard not to get chills at that point. I thought there was just the right amount of Godzilla in the film but for those who expect this to be another Pacific Rim there might be too little of the big guy.I perhaps wanted more heart from Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford Brody who was a bit generic as the movie's protagonist (though I think that's due to the script because Johnson put in a great performance in Kick-Ass). Bryan Cranston delivered the best performance in this film with great emotion as the nuclear engineer and Ford's dad Joe Brody. They also play well off each other. Elizabeth Olsen plays Ford's wife who is also a nurse but we don't really see much of her in that role despite all of the destruction around them. I have no doubt some of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor but I guess something has to give when you try to get this many characters in and keep the movie at two hours. I also wanted to see more Ken Watanabe, I thought his character was a tad under used. Then again this movie is more about how humanity overall would deal with a situation like this so it's understandable that all of the characters don't quite have the depth we might hope.Despite some of the underdeveloped characters, I did get really immersed in the movie and had chills in many places. The great sound design and rousing score together with the truly awesome visuals definitely helped there. I was gripped by the movie throughout and the buildup to the showdown in the end was expertly crafted by director Gareth Edwards. If you're looking to have a good time at the movies, Godzilla definitely fits the bill.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
