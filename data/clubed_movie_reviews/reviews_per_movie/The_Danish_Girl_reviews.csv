Alicia Vikander is superb,Because of the subject matter in The Danish Girl I wasn't sure this was going to be a film that I would particularly like but I need not have have worried because I thought this was a fascinating movie that justified it's plaudits. This is the story of Danish artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who realised that despite being born a man he is really a woman and that woman is called Lile. Although Redmayne will quite obviously get all the praise for his role as Lile but I think the outstanding performance of this film comes from Alicia Vikander who plays his wife. As an actor she is exposed unlike Redmayne who has the make up to hide behind. Instead of being about Lile this film for me is more about the love of his wife who will do anything to make her husband happy. Even if that means losing him. in the process.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brave beauty,"Finally got round to seeing 'The Danish Girl' last night, having been intrigued by it (thanks to its subject, the way it was advertised and the talent involved) for a long time but not having the time due to heavy music and music college work commitments and being behind with my ""must-see"" list.My thoughts were that it is a beautiful and courageous film that won't be, and clearly isn't judging from the polarising user review opinions here, everybody's cup of tea, but is a sensitive and emotionally powerful portrayal of a subject matter that's important, very much relevant (even more so now) and controversial. It takes a lot of guts to portray this subject in any form and 'The Danish Girl' acquits itself beautifully if not perfectly.'The Danish Girl' to me is not without its imperfections. It does drag a little at times and trimming 10-15 minutes off the running time would have helped it perhaps. The script, while mostly thought-provoking and sensitive, has instances where it's too lightweight and needed a tightening up and could have been bolder and take more risks.So much works though. 'The Danish Girl' looks gorgeous, like an art painting come to life, especially the landscapes and sumptuous period detail. The costumes are evocative and pleasing on the eyes and the whole film is beautifully photographed. Alexandre Desplat's score is one of his most hypnotic and enchanting and Tom Hooper's direction is perhaps him at his most subtle and understated.It, in terms of writing and story, is mostly thought-provoking and treats the subject matter with an honesty, sensitivity and a big emotional wallop. There are instances such as the ending where the film did bring tears to my eyes.Can't say anything bad about the performances. Eddie Redmayne is the top-billed star and he does give a very deeply felt and courageous turn. Oddly enough though Gerda is actually the focus, where her complex feelings are ones that anybody in her position would relate to. Alicia Vikander's performance is truly sensational and her chemistry with Redmayne is also one where it is clear they're in love with each other. All the supporting cast are strong, my favourite being the sympathetic one of Matthias Schoenaerts.All in all, beautiful and brave film but not for all. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vikander shines but overall it didn't connect with me as expected,"The new cinema year has got off to a robust start with the new movie from Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"", ""Les Misérables"").We have seen many depictions of physical torture on the screen over the years, from the interminable teen-slasher pics, through 'that chair scene' in ""Casino Royale"" to the stylized presentations of Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese in films like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Casino"". ""The Danish Girl"" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like ""Buried"" or ""Flightpath"". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.Based on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne (""The Theory of Everything"") and Alicia Vikander (""Ex Machina"") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego ""Lili"" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.Eddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double.Far more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema.Also turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts (""Far from the Madding Crowd"") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read ""hard-working"") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of ""Homeland"") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.Another star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.Another Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.While the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to ""The King's Speech"". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say ""my wife"", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

Excellent Performances from the Two Leads,"The Danish Girl (2015)*** (out of 4)The semi true-story of painters Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), a married couple who find their lives changing when Einar dresses as a woman so Gerda can have someone to paint but it brings something out in him. Soon Einar is going around as the Lili character and soon decides that he's a woman on the inside.THE DANISH GIRL is another beautiful looking film from Tom Hooper, the director best known for his Oscar-winner THE KING'S SPEECH. Like that film the director has no problem with the visual look of the film and Hooper certainly knows how to put you in the period setting. It also doesn't hurt that we've got some excellent performances and a rather interesting and conflicted love story.I think the real draw here are the performances with Redmayne once again delivering a remarkable piece of work just a year after his Oscar win for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. A lot of actors have played male/female characters to perfection. In my mind the greatest was Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE but that there was a comedy whereas this here certainly isn't. It was really remarkable seeing how well Redmayne played both the male and female character and he was certainly believable as both. Whenever the Lili character was on screen you really did feel as if you were watching an actress and not just a man playing a female. Vikander is also excellent as the woman who finds the man she love slowly turning into someone else.The film features some beautiful cinematography, a great music score and I also thought the screenplay was very good. The story itself drags a tad bit during the first portion but I think it asks a lot of really good questions about what love is and of course what one feels about who they really are. I thought the flow of the film was quite good and there's no question that it nails the costume design and sets. THE DANISH GIRL isn't a masterpiece but it's certainly a very good movie with some excellent performances.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Very Well-Acted, Although Flawed!","Tom Hooper's 'The Danish Girl' is a brave story, about brave people, in a time where their bravery must've been counted as mental illness. Hooper chooses the correct actors to portray the parts & directs the film with dignity. However, The Writing doesn't always engage & is flawed in places.'The Danish Girl' is A fictitious love story inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer.'The Danish Girl' salutes the courageous lives of Lili Elbe & Gerda Wegener. Both of whom who died too early, had the courage to be themselves, especially Lilli, who chose to express rather than being repressed. And Gerda, a women who had to face the reality, was a women who respected her husband's truth. That was True Romance!But, 'The Danish Girl' isn't as tightly Written it should have been. Lucinda Coxon's Screenplay, which is based on the 2000 novel of the same name by David Ebershoff, is powerful, but in doses. The first-hour works wonders, but the second-hour slows down & the flaws in the Writing show up. The final-act, to put it bluntly, isn't half as emotionally moving as it deserved to be. In short, the Writing lets 'The Danish Girl' down, at some parts.Tom Hooper's Direction is dignified. He has handled some of the most dramatic scenes, with great conviction. Danny Cohen's Cinematography is nicely done. Melanie Ann Oliver's Editing is perfectly sized. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Alexandre Desplat's Score is enchanting. A Special Mention for the nearly done Make-Up.Performance-Wise: Eddie Redmayne as Lili Elbe & Alicia Vikander as Gerda Wegener, deliver brilliant performances. Eddie, fresh from his Oscar-Win this year, strikes back with a yet another winning performance, thats both, brave & heartbreaking. Vikander is splendid as his wife, who conveys her pain, with concern & sensitivity. And the on-screen chemistry between the two, is wonderful. Ben Whishaw & Amber Heard are terrific in supporting roles.On the whole, 'The Danish Girl' isn't as good as one expects it to be, but its well-directed & very well-acted nonetheless!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Touching and destabilizing,"I honestly found this movie very touching and delicate. It is delicate in the way it treats difficult subjects as sexuality and the discovery of one's identity in an hostile period. The fact that it is a true story makes the whole movie even more involving.I don't think the film is perfect - but the acting, cinematography, the screenplay are absolutely amazing. I especially loved the middle part - where all the characters try to find a way out of the problem and when for the first time they seem to be facing a fracture between them.I thought it had a great power on people even though it doesn't seem to have had the effect I was expecting (at least during the premiere in Venice).Eddie Redmayne hasn't had enough of his Oscar and I wish him all the best for 2016!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""The Danish Girl"" is a very touching, but controversial and oversimplified story.","""He's comfortable in his own skin,"" is usually seen as a compliment. It means that the person in question knows who he (or she) is and is content with that sense of identity. I dare speculate that it's a condition to which we all aspire. Unfortunately, many people around the world lack that inner peace because of a question of gender identity. Regardless of what others think about such an existential situation, people who feel uncomfortable with the biology with which they were born often suffer greatly over this conflict within their hearts and minds. They cannot be comfortable in their own skin, because they don't feel that their skin is really theirs. Before the somewhat more enlightened times of the 21st century, people who identified with a gender other than that to which biology assigned them suffered even more than some do today. In ages past, those people had little opportunity to make changes that would make themselves look on the outside as they felt on the inside. ""The Danish Girl"" (R, 2:00) is one such story.Inspired by the true story of early 20th century married Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, like David Ebershoff's 2000 book on which it's based, ""The Danish Girl"" is a fictionalized account of Einar's physical transition to Lili Elbe. Neither the book nor Lucinda Coxon's screenplay makes any claim to absolute historical accuracy. This story changes many of the facts for dramatic purposes. The real-life situation of Lili and Gerda's life was much more complicated than we see on screen. The result is a film that tells a simple story in a way that elicits empathy for the protagonists and enlightens the audience.Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, and Alicia Vikander, his wife, Gerda. The couple lives in a large apartment in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they both make a living painting. At first, Einar's landscapes are more in demand and more respected than Gerda's portraits. One day when Gerda was in a hurry to finish a portrait of their mutual friend and ballerina, Oola (Amber Heard), Gerda asks Einar to stand in as a model by putting on Oola's stockings and heels and holding up Oola's dress in front of him. Although the scene is played with a combination of humor and awkwardness, it's obvious that Einar likes the clothes. He starts trying on his wife's clothes which gives birth to an idea. Gerda is a bit conflicted, but being the open-minded person she is, she suggests that her husband dress up as a woman to attend an art world function that he had been trying to avoid. And just like that, Lili is born.The thing is that Einar had always felt like a female and being Lili was the first opportunity that he had really had to express what he felt was his true gender. Einar wears women's clothes and make-up more and more often, both at home and out in public. Lili even begins secretly seeing a local man named Henrik (Ben Whishaw). Gerda is understandably upset by all this, but she never criticizes her husband's inner turmoil or its outward manifestations. She wants to understand, and the more she does, the more she mourns her marriage, which she sees as slipping away. However, as all this is happening, her art career begins to take off. She paints Lili more and more, in fashionable clothes and in little or no clothes. As Gerda's style develops, increasing demand for her paintings soon leads the couple to move to Paris.In Paris, Lili blossoms as a person, even as she seeks a more permanent solution to her feeling that her biology doesn't match her identity. She sees doctors whose diagnoses are wide-ranging, but are mainly focused on Einar/Lili having some sort of mental deficiency. Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenarts), a childhood friend of Einar, tries to help, but he can do little more than offer moral support to the couple. Finally, Lili and Gerda find a possible solution in the person of German doctor Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch). Dr. Warnekros offers to perform practically unprecedented sex reassignment surgery on Lili.""The Danish Girl"" is a very sensitive portrayal of a very tumultuous experience in the lives of two real people. Whether you sympathize with the situation of the two main characters or not, you're likely to empathize with them as people. While presenting a story about the controversial topic of gender identity, Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper also tells a very human story within the framework of the movie's plot. At its core, this is a tale of love and loss, of tolerance and devotion, of feeling comfortable in one's own skin. Although some Movie Fans may find some of the situations, images and the brief but graphic nudity (both female and male) to be disturbing, and the plot does drag at times, one of the main reasons to see this movie is for the award-worthy performances by the two leads. With impressive emotional range and depth, both Redmayne and Vikander make this story surprisingly rich and relatable. Hooper draws even more focus (literally) to the characters' feelings by choosing especially significant moments to bring his camera in very close for a tight focus on the characters' faces, while allowing everything beyond their necks to go out of focus. ""The Danish Girl"" deserves credit for its honesty, its emotional power and its succinct presentation of a very complicated story. However, some of the changes in the story seem designed to increase the impact of the story, a move I would call emotionally manipulative. For that and other reasons, I just wish that this otherwise excellent film had been more historically accurate. ""B""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Everything about the film has a sophisticated, elegant feel, from the constume design to the atmosphere and cinematography. This is a classy film.Although, in a way, this is to the film's detriment. The story is almost told with a mask on, it's difficult to see beyond the flawless surface and connect emotionally with the film.

A heartbreaking love story.,"The Danish Girl is a movie loosely based on the life of Danish artists, Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe(Eddie Redmayne) & Gerda Wegener(Alicia Vikander). Einar & Gerda are a happily married couple. Einar is the more accomplished artist, between the two of them. Gerda paints portraits & Einar paints landscapes. Gerda is frustrated because her portraits don't get sold, quite as often as she would like them to. One day, she makes Einar dress up like a woman. Gerda does this because, she wants to paint a portrait of Einar as a woman. Gerda & Einar come up with the name Lili Elbe, for Einar's alter ego. Gerda's Lili portraits are a huge success. What Gerda did not expect is, Einar feels extremely drawn to Lili & sinks more & more into Lili's personality as the days go by.The Danish Girl is a fantastic film! The love shared between Gerda & Einar has been depicted beautifully, by director Tom Hooper. It is gut wrenching to see Gerda slowly lose her husband, as Einar soon realizes that Lili Elbe is, who he was always meant to be. Apart from the flawless & poignant story, this film has showcased exotic locales. Copenhagen & Paris, where the majority of the movie takes place, have been showcased beautifully. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Alicia Vikander is spectacular as Gerda Wegener. Vikander's multifaceted portrayal of her character, is the best part of the film. Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe. Redmayne emulates the gait & mannerisms of a woman, to the T. Redmayne gives another memorable performance after The Theory of Everything(2014). However, Alicia Vikander outshines Eddie Redmayne, in every way possible. She carries the emotional weight of the film, on her shoulders. Amber Heard is impressive as Ulla. Ben Whishaw is great as Henrik. Matthias Schoenaerts is superb as Hans Axgil. Sebastian Koch is awesome as Warnekros. The supporting cast is good too. The Danish Girl is a must watch. It's an inspiration to transgender people, all over the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Solid acting and great cinematography,"Though it is nominated for 4 Oscars I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. The Danish Girl seemed like the typical arty-farty Oscar fare on paper but fortunately it was better than that. The best part of the film is the acting. Eddy Redmane does a great job but I was most surprised by Alicia Vikander. She almost steals the movie though she only has a supporting role. Mattias Schoenaerts is also in it with a supporting role and I must say: that man can do just about any language and accent and make it sound completely natural. The story was not that interesting to me and is somewhat of a typical subject matter for Oscar movies (that is movies about some sort of misunderstood minority and who was the first to start the revolution if you will). That being said, it is a very good movie, superb acting but on the other hand I don't consider this a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great story, good effort, but poor result","The story could have been very dramatic and deeply touching, as it is a true story of both the internal conflicts of a man and the deep love of a woman to her partner. Unfortunately the meticulous attention to image rather than screenplay (to me) resulted in a quite cold and un- engaging movie, where beautiful costumes, interiors and landscapes are the only highlights. I found that even the acting of the brilliant young Eddie Redmayne was not that good, as his constant smiles and shy blinking eyes after a while seem to be the only stratagem he has to portray such a complex character (and after the first dozen of them I couldn't stand it anymore). A more sophisticated psychological portrait of the main character and a more dramatic rendition of his/her troubled soul would have given more solidity to a movie which seems too superficial.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

When I was watching, I always kept what they wore in mind and determined to shop some vintages store.While on the other hand, the story itself became even boring. I don't know why Lily is always crying and how she wants to be a woman. Becoming a woman is not just about wearing pretty dresses and making up herself and flirting good looking men. Self-consciousness, why I must become a women, should be explore in a more deep way.To be honest, I am quiet disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If You See This Film, You'll Never Be the Same.","Very few films would I say are pretty much perfect. But this one is. I don't want to belabor all of the extraordinary aspects of the film, so I'll mention what I think are the salient ones.For anyone interested in understanding viscerally what it means emotionally to be transgender, this film provides an extraordinary pathway. The process of Lili's awakening realization that she is transgender is, simply, how it happens. From a touch, to an interest, to an attraction, to a gravitational pull and then compulsion borne from the powerful force of Lili's authentic self exploding from her unconscious to the surface.The tidal waves that this unleashes are extraordinarily accurately portrayed. From the creative block this causes in Lili's painting, to the tension and near-destruction of her marriage, to destructive social forces: thug violence, the law that would incarcerate her, medicine that pathologizes her, all of these are frighteningly accurate and are still ever-present today.Probably the most profound aspect of the film is the love that evolves and deepens between Lili and Lili's wife, Gerda, not just in spite of, but because of her recognition of Lili's need to transition. Most spouses abandon their transgender loved ones when they come-out or transition. Gerda doesn't and this enables them both to discover and create a love that is beyond what most of us will ever experience.I could go on about the virtually perfect performances, story structure, character development, cinematography and direction, but you just have to see the film because no words do it justice. I don't think I've ever been brought to tears during most of a film. But this one did. If you see it, you'll never be the same.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bravo to Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander! Oscars are Coming!,"With the transgender movement heavily in the media with figures like Caitlyn Jenner, and countless others heading the conversation, a film like Tom Hooper's ""The Danish Girl"" feels vibrantly relevant in today's cinematic climate. Spearheaded by two powerhouse performances from Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, ""The Danish Girl"" is a luscious and gorgeously crafted piece, invigorating the soul with its conveying message of freedom and love.As polarizing as Tom Hooper has been in his choices to shoot and frame his films like ""The King's Speech"" and ""Les Miserables,"" two films that are still delightfully poignant years after, ""The Danish Girl"" is by far his most alluring film to date. Cinematographer Danny Cohen truly hits his stride from the opening frames, as he calls back to Dick Pope's work in last year's ""Mr. Turner,"" but allows a story fragrantly moving to become his blank canvas in which to respectfully capture the film's most sentimental moments. If you're searching for the ""Hooper-isms"" like people shoved into the corner of a scene or extreme close-ups, you'll find them, but there's a resourceful way in which he's utilizing his tactics that feel genuine and necessary.Last year Eddie Redmayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in James Marsh's ""The Theory of Everything,"" beating out some big names. A performance I quite liked but didn't fully understand the gravitation over other names throughout the year. As Lili Elbe, Redmayne ignites his most daring and captivating turn of his career. Visually married to the woman in dedication to the role, he allows 'Lili' to wash over him both with aggression and delicacy. It's a near masterpiece performance that I'll remember for years to come.Equally compelling, and even more magnificent in her turn is Alicia Vikander, who in just under two hours, solidifies herself as one of the most breathtaking and exciting actresses working today. Vikander's subtlety and interpretation of 'Gerda', is a sensational vessel of complexity and honesty, as she runs the gauntlet of a woman desperate to understand and struggling to hold it together. As the tears well up in her eyes, and she desperately asks Lili to have 'Einar' hold her, it's the single most heart wrenching scene this year. It's the strongest and most compulsory turn by an actress this year, and one that will have the Academy Awards running to check off for a nomination.The rest of the cast, in particular Amber Heard and Ben Whishaw is staggeringly good. Matthias Schoenaerts' massive and stoic persona adds to the mystery and complicated nature of Lili's existence.Where ""The Danish Girl"" faults itself is with the script by Lucinda Coxen. While she successfully captures the spirit and tone of Lili's struggle through her life, her inserted beats of on-the-nose dialogue can be trying at times. Having Gerda say things like ""I felt like I was kissing myself"" when recalling her and her husband's first kiss, was a little over-the-top in an attempt at foreshadowing. However, she delightfully captures the humble beginnings of their marriage, with the secret that plagues their union with accuracy.Just one year after winning his long overdue Oscar for scoring ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" composer Alexandre Desplat synchronizes fervor and empathy with his brilliant orchestra. I believe its one of his most profound works to date. Same can be said for Production Designer Eve Stewart and Costume Designer Paco Delgado, who both capture the essence of European history with accuracy and vitality.""The Danish Girl"" is a seducing feature with fortitude and grace, all of which measures up to heroic story of being yourself, no matter what the circumstances. Tom Hooper's direction, along with Redmayne and Vikander's work will likely be at the top of Oscar's to-do list for the awards season.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Redmaine shines once again.,"I wasn't sure this would be a film I'd engage with, but having watched it, I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know it's received criticism for being historically inaccurate, I would remind those naysayers that it is a film, not a piece of real life. It is a dazzling looking film, it looks absolutely sensational, the visuals are beautiful, if ever an Oscar should have been won for design, costumes etc, this is it. Alicia Vikander is of course phenomenal, and worthy of her Oscar, but I have to say Eddie Redmayne is the catalyst that made the film for me, as he so often does, a truly outstanding actor, who's career rightly so is taking off. It's quite a sombre film, not one I'd particularly revisit anytime soon, but I'm certainly glad I've seen it, and I certainly would recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Memorable performances,"Going in I only new three things about the cast and crew, Les Miserables and The King's Speech Tom Hooper directed it, and that Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander starred in it. So imagine my surprise when I saw the supporting cast, Ben Whishaw that I've loved for a decade now, and crazy talented Matthias Schoenaerts.The Danish Girl is in the Zeitgeist. The transgender community have been making the news these days and this film tackling this subject matter at a time - the 1930s - when it was even less accepted.The film got to me, it made me incredibly uncomfortable, I shuddered and even put my sweater's hoodie on, because I couldn't imagine that a man would even consider or dare to go out dressed as woman in the late 1930s no less. It took courage, and for two hours I was scared for Lili's life. It goes to show the realism that exudes from the screen. Like I've also said in my trailer review the movie has a weight to it, it's emotionally charged, and is a great journey to embark on. Tom Hooper tackled the story brilliantly by infusing an elusive shift to the way he filmed Einar and Lili. Some of the shots and cinematography were beautiful and felt very intimate.The intimacy and bubble like atmosphere of the film is accentuated by the chemistry Vikander and Redmayne have. I never had a doubt that Redmayne could do it, his performances are usually intricate and riddled with subtleties, so it was a pleasure to see in The Danish Girl. But The reel surprise for me was Alicia Vikander, who completely stole the show. She one upped Redmayne's incredible performance and made the story her own. It's Gerda's story and it's a beautiful one. The performances are completed with memorable appearances by Ben Whishaw and Matthias Schoenaerts, who are great, and also Amber Heard who I didn't recognize but liked in this role.The Danish Girl is a threat, solid performances, nicely directed but it might not be for everybody.By @garcwrites",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I went to the cinema very excited like I should have been, wondering if the new Eddie Redmayne movie will be better than his previous one(The Theory of Everything), which was a great masterpiece!

He said/She said,"Greetings again from the darkness. There was a time when movies were cultural trendsetters in such areas as speech, style and behavior. Somewhere along the way, a transition occurred, and these days movies are more a reflection of the times – showing us who we are and focusing mostly on what society focuses on. Oscar winning director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) capitalizes on the current movement to mainstream the LGBT community by telling the story of Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe, a transgender from more than 40 years before Dr. Renee Richards, and 75 years before Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner.Lucida Coxon has adapted the 2000 novel from David Ebershoff, which is a fictionalized version of the 1933 ""Man Into Woman""  the personal letters and diaries of Einar/Lili (edited by Niels Hoyer). The film opens in 1926 Copenhagen as successful landscape artist Einar Wegener and his struggling-to-gain-respect portrait artist wife Gerda appear to be happily married and quite attracted to each other. During this segment, Hooper and cinematographer Danny Cohen utilize a somewhat distracting quasi-fisheye lens that distorts most every shot  presumably making the point that this couple's life is itself distorted. There is no shortage of foreshadowing despite the bohemian artist lifestyle. Einar doesn't miss a chance to caress the silks and frills as he visits his ballet dancing friend Ulla (Amber Heard), and things escalate quickly once he poses in stockings for one of Gerda's portraits.The best and most interesting segment of the film is the middle as Einar begins to explore his Lili persona, and Gerda is diligent in her support  going as far as to encourage her husband to attend a party as Lili (introduced as Einar's visiting cousin). The public interactions with their friends and acquaintances are a little difficult to accept, though the scenes with her initial male suitor Henrik (Ben Whishaw) make it clear this is a point of no return. Despite this, the times are such that Einar willingly attempts to repress the Lili side, and even visits multiple medical and psychological specialists. It's this segment that reminds us how quickly the medical profession of the era overreacted by prescribing radiation, electrotherapy, and even by institutionalizing those who were so inclined.Gerda and Einar/Lili ""escape"" to Paris, where it becomes obvious that it's Lily who has been masquerading as Einar, rather than the other way. The duality of Einar/Lily soon dissolves and daily life is filled with lessons  such as a Paris peep show where hand and body movements become part of the transition. Eddie Redmayne (last year's Oscar winner for The Theory of Everything) gives an extraordinary performance, and is at his best when exploring the subtle nuances of Lili. It's crucial to note that while Redmayne's performance is a physical marvel, it's Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair, Ex Machina) as Gerda who provides the real heart and soul of the story. Though the film glosses over some traits of the real life Gerda, Ms. Vikander is stunning in more than a few scenes, which in the hands of a lesser actress, could have proved cringe-inducing.Adding some depth in limited roles are Matthias Schoenaerts (Rust and Bone) as Hans, Einar's childhood friend all grown up, and Sebastian Koch (The Lives of Others) as the pioneering doctor who performs the sex reassignment surgeries that physically transition Einar into Lili. Even with the strong supporting cast, there is no mistaking this as anything other than a film that belongs to Mr. Redmayne and Ms. Vikander.Director Hooper takes a very conventional approach to an unconventional story, and this ""safe"" direction seems designed to make the uncomfortable story more palatable for mainstream audiences (similar to how Brokeback Mountain handled homosexuality). However, don't mistake this for Tootsie or Mrs. Doubtfire. There are two serious stories here: the struggles of one person's identity, and the corresponding challenges of a married couple. Hooper's style is by no means cutting edge, but does feature one of the best lines of the year  ""I've only liked a handful of people in my life, and you've been two of them."" This story has bounced around the movie world for awhile, and for many years was rumored to have Nicole Kidman in the Einar/Lili role. Your imagination can determine if that would have made for a better fit.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Overwrought, overdone, overly dramatic performances...","This was basically a PBS/BBC/Lifetime Network TV movie, but due to it's content and budget it became an independent feature film.The cinematography was not good, out of touch with the story and moments, and basically seemed a little self-indulgent. Many of the shots seemed like they were chosen because of how cool they looked, and not because it was a reflection of the moment, nor furthered the story. The wide angle lens was the worst choice out of all the lenses...were they saying it was warped?This movie would have made a better stage play, in story, but mainly due to the over-dramatic nature of the performances that suits the theater and not the cinema.There was no real sense of drama, and the stakes were very low. Society doesn't accept you...we get it. Most doctors think you're nuts...we get it. You aren't happy with yourself...we get it. Any conflict that was in this story was easily stepped over, and we never, not for one second, thought this guy wasn't going to go through with it. By the way, Eddie Redmayne played this character as more of an effeminate homosexual, than a trapped woman. Alicia VIkander had more balls, sexuality and femininity than Redmayne. There were a lot of woman in this movie, and Redmayne wasn't like any of them.The more I think about this movie, the worse it seems to get. Too on the nose with every moment, too much Lifetime Network styling, too much theater sensibility. And too much piano. The Kings Speech was better, but still like a stage play.It's no coincidence that Tom Hopper has a background in both Theater and Television...that's were he should stay. These films aren't cinema, they are filmed TV Plays, and they are better suited for those mediums.Come to think of it, this movie seems like a parody. The ending was just plan silly (insert introspective piano melody).",,Anonymous,Biography
"Remarkable, but not a masterpiece.","The Danish Girl is directed by Tom Hooper and stars Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, Ben Whishaw and Matthias Schoenaerts.Loosely inspired by Danish artists Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe, The Danish Girl explores the marriage of Lili & Gerda as they experience Lili's ambitious journey as a transgender pioneer.Eddie Redmayne returns to the screen with admirable strength and skill, with such a diverse character to play. He is as convincing as Lili Elbe as he was Stephen Hawking. With his incredible portrayal in The Theory Of Everything, capturing everyone and gaining major attention from critics and the Academy, Redmayne is an actor who has stepped into the spotlight for filmmakers. And respectfully so. His portrayal of Lili in this film is remarkable, well handled and instantly worthy of the recognition. He gives off an electrifying performance and very emotionally attaches himself to the personality of this character. A truly brilliant performance. Alicia Vikander is magnetic as Gerda, she just clicks. Again, a very emotional performance throughout. I do believe she deserves more attention from the critics than she's getting at the moment. These are two of the four outstanding factors of this film.The third is the music by Alexandre Desplat. Absolutely beautiful piano melodies and string motifs as usual. He always writes with impeccable focus on the visuals and the touching performances on-screen. This is yet another score by Desplat that I will be happily purchasing.The final pillar holding this film up is the visuals. The camera work is stunningly supportive of the story and screenplay. Slow, intimate and colourful.Apart from these four points, I couldn't really attach myself to the film or its story. I felt it outstayed it's welcome after the 90 minute mark. If it were shorter by around 20-30 minutes I believe it would have flowed easier with less moments that felt out of place or less meaningful. Which is a bit sad when this is a story about such a compelling and controversial subject. It was handled with love and care but I didn't find myself feeling enthralled by anything particular. Don't get me wrong, it's very nicely written. But I wasn't deeply engaged as much as I should have been. It's a shame. I do, however, believe that it's a film that should be seen by everyone, and discussed beyond the award ceremonies.My verdict; The Danish Girl is a piece of art in itself for its wonderful visuals, music and performances by Redmayne and Vikander. If a little more care and attention was applied then this could have been a modern masterpiece. But don't let that turn you away, there's still something deeply planted in this film.""I think Lily's thoughts, I dream her dreams.

Thoroughly enjoyable,"Watched it at TIFF this year and I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, the director took a more artistic play on character and scenes.I personally really liked the music, it gave me goosebumps in all the right ways, and definitely helped create that mood of confusion and frustration and just a heavy flow of emotions.The actors were awesome, of course, I was extremely impressed with Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of the transition and transcendence. There was a really emotional scene in the movie (not gonna spoil anything) where I was absolutely blown away by Ms Vikander's acting, it was incredible to see all the raw emotions.Touching, moving, and a much needed drop of new blood in the mainstream cookie-cutting film industry indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
beautifully shot with good performances,"Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is a well received Danish painter in the early 20th century. His wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) is less well received. Gerda uses Einar's feminine side Lili as the subject of her paintings. Gerda starts to gain recognition while Lili starts going out dressed up. It's a struggle for both partners. Eventually, Lili seeks a full sex reassignment surgery.This is beautifully shot and Redmayne delivers a solid performance. Alicia Vikander is the acting power behind the throne. In the end, the movie lacks drama. Einar never faces insurmountable hurdles. Gerda is utterly supportive. There is limited tension. The plot doesn't have any surprises considering the subject matter. Also I never get the sense of Lili's point of view. It is so far from what most people experiences. More than any other subject, director Tom Hooper needs to put the audience into the shoes of the protagonist. The movie fails to do that. It's still beautiful and the two actors are terrific but it is very much like one of Einar's landscapes. It is expertly made but I don't really feel it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply stunning,"I understand why the casting is problematic , and I was hesitant about watching it for a long time, but after reading a lot about Lily's story and watching interviews with the cast I decided to give it a chance today.I was overwhelmed by emotions for the whole time.Eddie Redmayne is amazing in this movie, seriously.Phenomenal.Alicia Vikander really deserves that Oscar, her performance is also remarkable.It's visually stunning.The whole movie had this very special atmosphere that sent chills down my spine , in a good way.I could see that Eddie really put all of his heart into this.

Most impressive movie I have ever seen,"Amazing true story about turn Einar Wegener into Lilly Elbe. In this film everything passed together, just like puzzle. The novel was little bit colored for American readers. However screenplay turned the storyline more to the reality. Moreover, the emotionally flat book was turned into emotional roller coaster on the screen. Music colored all emotions, dialogues and scenes gently, it supported everything in the best way. But the top were performances of Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, guided by excellent Tom Hooper. While Alicia is fighting against the change of her husband defeating and admitting what's happened, Eddie portrayed complete transformation from Einar to Lilly. Dialogues between main characters have so much energy and emotions. Sometimes I didn't believe someone could act in that way. I can not say, this is what I am going to the cinema for. I have never enjoyed film so much. Seen at Venezia festival. P.S.: Sorry for English, it is not my native language...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This Film Is Not For Everybody. Watch At Your Own Risk.,"I was angry while watching this film. By the end, I had calmed down. I found the end very predictable (as I had actually predicted the ending about halfway through the film). In retrospect, the reason I was angry was because I knew I had been tricked into watching one of those films that, in 2019, we are not allowed to criticize for fear of not being politically correct. And, I had criticisms.My original title for this review was ""The Story Of A Selfish Tranny"", because that IS this story. This is a tale about one person's journey to a new identity and the cost to be paid by his wife. To any free-thinking person, not clouded by self-interest or political agendas, Alicia Vikander ('Gerda') is the sympathetic character that drives the narrative of this film - not her transsexual husband/wife. Gerda's struggle of losing her husband is the theme of this film - not the theme of gender identification.Vikander is great in everything she does and this film is no exception. In fact, she is so good that I hated watching this story. The camera work is top-notch and the settings in old European buildings were fun to watch. Of coarse, James Bond films have good camera work in old European buildings too, and the Bond girls actually have all of their lady parts from birth...If you choose to watch this, have a better reason than I did; I only watched this because I wanted to earn the IMDB badge for reviewing all of the 2016 Academy Award Nominees. This is a good film but not a great film, and there are better films that will leave you happier for having watched them.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Incredibly well acted and highlights a very emotional transformation,"'The Danish Girl' is a Romance/Drama Biopic that highlights the story of Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener and how their relationship evolves during Lili's transgender transformation. This movie was very emotional, incredibly well acted, fantastically shot and told a very interesting and dramatic story that had me fully engaged pretty much the whole way through. The biggest draw to this film was the inclusion of two of my favourite actors right now, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. Put one of them in a film and i am most likely going to see it, put both of them in a film and there is no way i'm gonna miss it. Their performances are the real highlights of the film, i feel that Alicia's performance isn't going to be as recognised as Eddie's because he did have a much more complex role and did it amazingly. Redmayne managed to transform into this person to the point where you only saw Lili, it was fantastic to see not only Eddie transform into the character but to also watch Lili's transformation from Einar into her true self. Will Eddie follow up his Oscar win last year with another one? Probably not. But i do see a nomination on the horizon.The big focus of the film was Lili's emotional journey, and her transformation from a Danish painter to the Danish girl. The topics and themes surrounding transgender people are not so widely talked about or represented today, so it was incredibly interesting to see this film represent those themes and how the idea of being transgender differed in the 1930's from the way it is today. I would have liked the film to go a little more into those complications than it did, but seeing some of it play out was somewhat eye-opening and does raise many questions that are still fairly relevant today. I found this journey very engaging and knowing nothing about the story it is based on made for a very unpredictable plot that surprised me on more than one occasion. Where i would say the film was a bit of a let down was where there were times where i felt like i had already seen similar emotional scenes a few times throughout the film. There were a few moments where it didn't feel like the film was going anywhere, and i think all of that was due to the second act being so long. The first act ends rather early and the third act begins fairly late and the second act was pretty long and did have a few repetitive moments. But when you are very invested in the journey of Lili's character, it didn't matter so much in the film overall.So in the end this is a very engaging film with a lot of emotion, great performances, is very well shot, and covers many themes related to being transgender that raises a lot of questions for the viewer. This is a vey 'Oscar Bait' film, it is clearly made to hopefully be a contender at the Oscars, and i feel like it may have tried a little too hard to appeal to that audience and it may have suffered in some other areas. But it is still a film i would recommend if romantic dramas are your thing. - 7.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Danish GirlMost men only want to be female so that they can cry their way out of speeding tickets.However, the dude in this drama actually identifies with the feminine gender.When asked by his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) to model nylons for a portrait, Einar Wegener's (Eddie Redmayne) secret desire to cross-dress is finally sated.Encouraged by Gerda to go a gala as his alter ego Lilli, Einer attends the event in drag and attracts the eye of a bachelor Henrik (Ben Whishaw).Later, Gerda's paintings of Lilli begin to sell, while Lilli herself undergoes a procedure to become a permanent woman so she can marry Henrik.Although its transgendered subject matter is certainly timely and Redmayne's performance is utterly transcending, most of the facts of this fact-based biography are bent to better its provocative love story.Incidentally, a telltale sign if a woman was once a man is their level of flatulence.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A love which means to recognize ourselves, our true I because of the other person, who love us so much that changes us in ourselves, who undress us and falls short because there is so much more behind. Alicia and Eddie are impeccable. A couple who goes beyond the boundaries of acceptance and love.

An emotional tribute to a true love story of not only loving your partner, but loving yourself. Redmayne channels his femininity so well and transforms into Lili perfectly. I really can't say enough about this film. From the cinematography to the wardrobe, I was completely transported to this beautiful time period.

"Picture Perfect, Story Sketchy","Visually stunning, with excellent cinematography and a fitting score that both capture and support the time period and setting, the film features a strong performance by Alicia Vikander as Gerda. However, it falls short in its portrayal of Lili Elbe, both through Eddie Redmayne's acting and the writers' approach. Lili is depicted almost as if she were a separate persona from Einar, who is portrayed more as a crossdresser, especially in the first half of the movie. Despite this depiction, the people close to Lili are portrayed more sympathetically than they were in real life. This choice makes the movie feel more like a performance piece than a story about a fascinating historical figure.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The film equivalent of a coffee table book about Lili Elbe,"First the good: Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance in a poorly written role. The music, when it's not loudly substituting for a decent script, is often lovely. And the historical context is illuminating, especially the very real danger of institutionalization. Other than that, what a mass of prestige picture clichés, laughably symmetrical camera set-ups and gorgeous landscape cinematography. And poor Eddie Redmayne. Completely out of his depth in the central role. Obviously, no one knows how well Lili Elbe passed for a woman, but no one, and I mean absolutely no one, would mistake Redmayne's Lili for anything else but an awkward, clumsy male in a bad wig. Granted, that would make an interesting take on this story: someone who believes they look like a woman but who doesn't. But that's not what this film proposes. Quite the opposite, which is why the audience consistently laughed every time the film suggested that Elbe herself, or other characters believed in the success of the transformation. The script is so cliché ridden and repetitious that even an actor as fine as Matthias Schoenaerts can't liven it up. And for some reason he is made up to look like a sweaty cadaver. And again,I felt bad for Mr. Redmayne, that he didn't get the directorial help he needed in the role and a better script that left him more to say than the trite and predictable lines in this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Oscar Bait From The Director Of The King's Speech & Les Misérables,"Advertised as a ""true story"" in spite of being adapted from the fiction novel of the same name, The Danish Girl is an awfully constructed, historically inaccurate & thoroughly lifeless feature film from the director of The King's Speech & Les Misérables and, just like those two period pieces, qualifies as yet another Oscar bait from Tom Hooper.Loosely inspired by the lives of Danish painters Lili Elbe & Gerda Wegener, The Danish Girl narrates a fictionalised account of the two and focuses on their relationship as their marriage & professional lives undergo a complete transformation when Lili accepts herself for who she is and opts for a sex reassignment surgery, thus becoming one of the first recipients of the procedure.Directed by Tom Hooper, The Danish Girl masks itself as a biopic of Lili Elbe yet is more concerned with Gerda's difficulty in coming to terms with her partner's identity. The novel itself discards many known facts about its real-life figures thus rendering them purely fictional characters and yet, the filmmakers choose to not correct the mistakes and still have the audacity to sell it as a true story.The set pieces & costumes are in sync with its timeline, the camera hovers through some beautiful landscapes yet fails to penetrate the hollow people inhabiting this picture, the plot is unnecessarily stretched and while Alexandre Desplat's score is mesmerising, it is more focused on Gerda instead of Lili. Eddie Redmayne does well with what he's asked to play but the finest performance belongs to Alicia Vikander.On an overall scale, The Danish Girl is so full of Oscar bait characteristics that it doesn't even care about getting its facts right and leaves out the elements that may have hurt its chances of winning a few awards. Being advertised as a bold journey of a transgender pioneer, it's a film about straight people despite what it claims to be. A dull, overlong & horribly misguided cinema that's as insulting to the transgender community as it is to the legacy of Lili Elbe, The Danish Girl is worth skipping.",,Anonymous,Biography
I am a transsexual,"I saw this movie last night, and wanted to comment on it. In reading through the more constructive reviews of others here (I do not include in that group transphobes that despise the subject matter), it's clear that both the good and the bad of this movie have already been identified.I found the acting crisp throughout. I had no trouble believing that Eddie Redmayne playing a transgendered role; his naturally rather androgynous looks helps in that regard. Alicia Vikander was absolutely spectacular working with a script that gave her very little. The rest of the cast provided memorable scene stealing moments.Others here have already commented on the cinematography; it was spectacular. I felt like I was seeing two hours of fine paintings.The biggest problem was with the script that didn't explore the souls of Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. You see the turmoil in Lili, but there is no effort to give it context. You see Gerda responding rather nobly to her husband's pain, but there is no attempt to understand the motivation behind her sacrifice. You are presented with sympathetic peripheral characters throughout, but they are all one dimensional.I went to this movie hoping to connect and cry, and I only came close to that in a couple of scenes near the end. Yet I do regard this as a very important movie. It does say a lot about how far we have come, as well as how far we need to go. The intellectual roots of both today's transgender community, and today's transphobes are on display here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Natural Woman,"(Rating: ☆☆½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: Two fine performances are lost in a wearisome biopic.GRADE: B-Back in the 1920's, Gerda Wegener created erotic female portraits. Asking her artist husband, Einar to don women's clothes and pose for these paintings paved the way for his sexual liberation and freed his inner identity as Lili Erbe in Tom Hooper's uneven biopic, The Danish Girl. The film tells the story of the makings of one of the first transgenders, even though some of the actual facts are glossed over and never accurately presented.￼The film depicts the balancing act that this married couple faced with the proper degree of poignancy as they both come to terms with Einar's vibrant counterpart. Lili's persona starts to overshadow him. Naturally these changes affect their relationship as the gender issue becomes irreversible. While Einar opts for sex reassignment surgery, Gerda must deal with her own emotions through this turmoil and decide her rightful place in Einar's / Lili's life. That the roles are played by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander only enhances the film's impact.Hopper does craft his film well and give his talented leads enough leeway to create indelible characters, due more to the credit of the actors' prowess than the actual writing. In fact, the dull screenplay by Lucinda Coxon never allows them to act realistically to their life-changing situation. Yes, they are both free spirits and eccentric artist types but these major events would certainly test any Bohemian lifestyle to the max. (This is especially true in the pivotal first scene when Greta under-reacts when discovering her husband's secret penchant for wearing women's clothing. Her response rings false.)￼One can readily admire the filmmakers' sincerity and earnestness with this project. But this important subject deserves a more realistic spin than the lyrical approach that Hooper decides to take as the director. He downplays the serious nature of the film with too many lingering travelogue shots of Copenhagen and other period details. The pacing of the film becomes tedious and slower than Einar's own physical change. Beside the script by being problematic, so is the actual physical transformation by Redmayne from Einer to Lili. One never quite believes that he is a she. (It is most jarring in a scene where he dons the female garb to be ""my fair lady"" at the ball when everyone is all eyes at this ravishing ""non-beauty"". Yet another flawed moment.) The actor, while displaying enough feminine mannerisms, cannot convincingly transcend the transgender role due to the hair and make-up design of his character.￼Still, Eddie Redmayne makes some bold choices in the title role and lets his character underplay the uncertainty in the outset and become more selfish and determined toward the end. (In fact, there is one nicely structured scene when the actor starts to mimic the sexual movements of a prostitute that shows the inner struggle that tore at Einar. This inspired moment tells more beyond mere words.) Even making the situation more effecting is Alicia Vikander as his loving spouse. Her character is torn between the man she married and the woman she admires. Ms. Vikander is a revelation, giving a nicely modulated performance by showing her subtle range in her emotional highs and lows. Amber Head as their friend, Ulla, brings some sparks to her lifeless role. Other supporting turns by Matthias Schoenaerts and Ben Whishaw never rise to that level of excellence due to the sketchy nature of the characters they play.Alas, despite the superior acting by the two leads, The Danish Girl is in need of some personal realignment as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Two Talents converge for a Mediocre Movie,"Thus far Eddie Redmayne has made quite a niche for himself as the go-to actor for physically challenging roles. Not only has he made the on screen transition from a shy, bright and love struck student to brilliant wheelchair-bound ALS sufferer in The Theory of Everything (2014), he's also had to hold down constant convulsions of laughter while playing a space Dracula with spasmodic dysphonia in Jupiter Ascending (2014). Now he plays Lili Elbe, the first woman to ever experience gender re-assignment surgery.Einar Wegener (also Redmayne) is a fairly renowned artist living in Copenhagen with his wife Gerda (Vikander). Always more at home in more feminine accouterments, Einar slowly becomes more open with his wife about modeling for her and her paintings as a woman. Gerda becomes convinced that he can indeed pass as a woman so as a ruse they arrive at a party with Einar as Lili. Beyond that point the two slowly realize that there's more to Lili than just an occasional model for Gerda's inspiration. Thus the two enter an odyssey for self-actualization and enduring love.The true story is not quite as romantic as the movie would suggest though it's hardly proper to fault a movie for making fiction out of truth. The relationship between Gerda and Einar/Lili serves as the rock-steady center of the film and it's easy to see why. Everything they say and do is believable and organic to the characters they have created and Vikander deserves special mention and praise for every tiny authenticity. Is it any wonder that both are nominated for Golden Globes and are poised to receive Oscar nods?Though if there is an undisputed star of the picture it is production designer Eve Stewart. The woman has been working with director Tom Hooper since The Damned United (2009) and it's easy to see why. Her beautiful, painstakingly researched period detail and impassioned decor gives the movie the believably and artistry it needs to pull off such a unique story. With three Oscar nominations under her belt, I dare say this is her year to finally take away the golden statuette.There is however one very large problem that relegates The Danish Girl firmly in the Rent-It category and that is the editing. Much like Tom Hooper's last Oscar season gambit Les Miserables (2012), the film feels long; far too long. Hooper seems to want to take you to a moment in time and won't move the story along until you're sobbing with the characters. The camera lingers as everyone's dirty laundry tumbles out and everyone on-screen blubbers in a ""Dreamed a Dream,"" booger-sliding-out-the nostril, overwrought-to-the-point-of- hilarity-type way. This happens far too many times leaving susceptible audience members overwhelmed and cynical viewers checking their watches.Despite two stellar performances, awe-inspiring set design and a harrowing true story rich with possibility, The Danish Girl succumbs to the same problems that plague similar biographical period pieces. It's overwrought and occasionally boring while pandering to an audience that will surely overvalue it's cultural cache in years to come. That said, the performances really are that good.

The Danish Girl,"A fictitious love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolves as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer.The Danish Girl is adapted from David Ebershoff's novel by Tom Hooper, retelling a true-life-story. The point about the film, of course, is that it has two Danish heroines and that one of them started life as a Danish boy. Well-meaning and polished as it is, this film is determinedly mainstream melodrama that doesn't really offer new perspectives in theme; in the year of Caitlin Jenner, it's a theme on which mainstream audiences are ready for more trenchant insight. In fact, some might have wished for a more adventurous approach to this moving story, particularly at a time when transgender representation has taken over from gay rights as the next equality frontier. If the movie remains safe, there's no questioning its integrity or the balance of porcelain vulnerability that Eddie Redmayne brings to the lead role.For an actor, there can be few more challenging roles than this, in which the nature of identity, performance and transformation are all wrapped up in the very DNA of the character itself. Redmayne gives an infinitely more intimate performance and far less technical than the already stunning character he played in The Theory of Everything, that so recently won him an Oscar. He's once again certain to reap plentiful laurels in this awards season; with another role about a slow process of physical and psychological transformation. Einar's dawning discovery of his inner woman is treated somewhat like a superhero origin story. Offering more light and shade this character becomes undeniably affecting. There's an understated emotional surge in seeing Lili go to work behind a chic department store perfume counter, radiating happiness at being a woman among other women and timidly studying sensual female body language in a Paris peepshow, is one of the film's most exquisite and indelible scenes. Here, Alicia Vikander sports the same archly knowing English accent as in Testament of Youth.Tom Hopper and writer Lucinda Dixon take a deeply conventional approach by framing their story as a portrait of a loving marriage with an awkward flaw. The cinematography sets up the exquisite visual tone at the start with a series of atmospheric, deeply painterly landscape shots. There are hints of a more interesting film.Overall, this film is an impeccably made period piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting by Vikander and Eddie Redmayne.,"This movie was a bit slow, but was OK over all. The lead actors did a great job and put in a lot of effort to pull off their parts. I would have liked to see more body contact, nudity and more drama. The background and scenes were very reminiscent of an old Denmark.Anyway, for a project that took so long to take off it, the script could have had a lot more seductive and dramatic scenes to keep the audience engaged at all times. I had to pause a few times to get through movie. The supporting cast could have been involved a bit more as well. I think they could have played bigger roles in the money. I would have liked to see more of Lili's secret meetings with the guy she was seeing discreetly.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A surprisingly beautiful and heart-warming true story,"As with all true stories, this film is fictionalized but it is based on real events of a century ago. The story of one of the first people to ever attempt to change genders, it is a reminder of how far we have come in understanding those who feel they were born the wrong gender.Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander both deserve Oscars for the heart-rending, real performances they give here. I felt like I was in their real home with them, coming to grips with situations with them. I already knew Redmayne was an extraordinary actor, but I did not know Vikander. She has a quality much like Jennifer Lawrence which makes you just fall in love with her as she lovingly grapples with her husband's dilemma, realizing that she must support him.The story is presented in such a beautiful manner, it is a joy to watch. That was surprising. Perhaps it is the sign of a superbly-made movie. Everything about this movie is top-notch, and the entire supporting cast is remarkable. I had no idea I would love this movie as much as I do.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Forgettable period piece, but strong lead performances","""I love you, because you are the only person who made sense of me. And made me, possible.""Tom Hooper's latest film is a fictionalized portrayal of real life Danish artists Einar and Gerda Wegener. It is a period piece that re-imagines the love story between these two artists. Einar who later becomes Lili is recognized as one of the pioneers in trans-gender, but the film takes many liberties and is far from representing the true relationship between the artists. Alicia Vikander plays Gerda, the artist who painted her husband as a lady. Eddie Redmayne is Einar Wegener, who after enjoying the transformation in his wife's painting discovers himself as Lili. The film focuses on the couple's struggle to accept these changes, although history proves that this depicted love story is far from true. David Ebershoff's novel takes several liberties, ignoring the fact that Gerda herself was a lesbian.Now that I got that settled and out of the way, I can focus on the film itself. It is a formulaic biopic that does little to stand out from other period pieces. This is my fourth Tom Hooper film and despite being gorgeously filmed, I found it to be one of his weakest efforts. My favorite from him continues to be The Damned Untied, which ironically was the first film from him I've seen. The King's Speech and Les Miserables were also movies I enjoyed, but to a lesser degree. The Danish Girl has a fantastic production design, but it stands out exclusively for its two lead performances. Both Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander are superb and worthy of their Oscar nominations. Redmayne comes fresh out of his Oscar win for portraying Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, but I think his performance here is even better and just as physically demanding as his previous one. He probably won't win, but I think this performance is stronger. Vikander has had a wonderful year after her stunning performance in Ex Machina. Here she gets to shine along Redmayne and even steals several scenes from him. Ever since I first saw her in the Danish film, A Royal Affair, I've always been a fan of Vikander's work. This might be her best performance to date, but competing against Kate Winslet in the supporting category for this year's Oscar will make it hard for her to stand a chance. The Danish Girl is worth the watch for the strong performances alone, but there isn't much more to the story. I found the pacing a bit dull and lost interest in the story halfway through. The Danish Girl is a forgettable formulaic biopic, but it's worth the watch for the fantastic performances.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I couldn't feel empathy toward Lily...,Most of the time I found myself feeling sorry for Einar's wife which made me think maybe I missed the point of this movie. I perceived Lilly as a very selfish person. The acting is good but I just couldn't relate to Lily's character or feel empathetic toward her. Also I felt this subject could have been very touching or moving and for me it wasn't. It was mostly me feeling sorry for Gerda and looking through her view.,4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great choice of lead actors,A great film with 2 fantastic leads Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. Very touching heartfelt story. Can't believe it has taken me so long to come across and see. The only thing wrong is the casting of Amber Heard. A terrible actress who didn't bring anything to the film. So many more actresses who could have made that part perfect. Luckily she was only in it for about 10 minutes so didn't get to ruin it much. Why she is an actress is beyond me. Anyway Eddie and Alicia were fantastic and deserve all the praise and rave reviews they are getting.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sexuality and the City,"In his 2000 book, David Ebershoff never set out to write the definitive biography of Lili Elbe (born Einar Wegener) and likewise this film doesn't parade a ""True Story"" claim at the start. What we get is a fictionalised account of one of the first individuals to receive gender reassignment surgery, in 1930.The story focuses on Einar's transition and its effects on his marriage to the portrait painter Gerda Gottlieb (Alicia Vikander). The woman Einar wants to be, named Lili, is the third person in the relationship, causing complex jealousy and resentment. Surgery seems like the only option to remove the ambiguity and confusion in their relationship – although Lili also risks losing her life.It might have awards-bait written all over it but it's not the ""issue"" movie the trailer would have us believe. Or, at least the issue isn't political or sociological, it's psychological and philosophical. In its strongest moments The Danish Girl –explores identity in unusual depth and with unusual conviction. Fiction, here, liberates a greater truth.Redmayne's performance occasionally strays into the realm of mannered and affected but it also shows us a complex vulnerability which confidently elicits as much frustration as sympathy. It's another physical transformation, arguably more challenging than his Stephen Hawking. Redmayne is portraying a person who's man in body and woman in spirit. In The Theory of Everything the actor's challenge was to portray disability; here, the challenge is on the audience, to empathise with someone who believes their perfectly able body is wrong.For me, Vikander is the real star here. She's strong yet heartbreaking in the impossible role of Einar's wife. What will she ultimately become when Einar is replaced by Lili? I'm not sure she even knows. As with Ex Machina, Vikander has a rare poise: an ability to command the screen with silence and stillness. It's the opposite of Redmayne's restless turn.The script mostly lands. Some lines sound like they were written to be quoted rather than to be spoken – ""You made me possible"" – but these spare words do get to the heart of things. And what heart this film has. Its triumph isn't only in putting a transgender person front-and-centre without pathologising their condition; it is in allowing us to see sensitivity and gentleness in men without assuming homosexuality.Alexandre Desplat's score is a bit soppy, its rolling river piano mimicking Michael Nyman in the blandest way, but it can't spoil the craft within the frame. Director Tom Hooper throws in some familiar elements: that hyper-real theatre set aesthetic we've seen in John Adams and Les Miserables, and those extreme close-ups which would be warts-and-all were we not looking at exquisite movie stars.As Lili moves closer to her actualisation, her world is bedecked in the light and colour of Paris, before moving into nature, into truth. In the end we get an outrageous Movie Moment but against the odds it works, and you're weeping. And you reflect and realise that you've just seen a quiet landmark of a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A delicate subject handled well,"I came to this movie with no expectations, as my husband asked that we watch it. I was moved and thought the subject was treated with as much sensitivity as the time afforded.Einer/Lili's struggle was portrayed with honesty during a time in our past where gender dysphoria was not understood and considered to be a form of madness. Thank goodness science and medicine have progressed since this time.Eddy Redmayne played this role so well. He may not have looked such that he could be mistaken as a woman, but Einer's transition to Lili was honest and realistic. Alicia Vikander played the role of Einer's wife beautifully, supporting the love of her life through such a struggle, in spite of her own feelings.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
disappointing on many counts,"I can't pretend to know all the particulars of the actual story this is based upon - the Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe (in the first part of the story Elinar) - and even as I can look up the real life facts and those that were in the book the movie's based on (and some of them are startling and could've made the more more compelling, but I'll get to that later), I have to take the movie on its own terms. And by itself, as a story telling about one of the first known cases of a man becoming a woman in the 20th century, it sucks.I don't mean this as any affront to anyone who wants to look for the messages of acceptance of others and considering the politics of the moment it's a touchy subject. But a movie can not be good despite being about something important, and actually that importance can sink a movie even further. In the case of The Danish Girl, it's art-house, Oscar-bait trash, and it's borderline (or simply just) dangerous as far as showing images of what it's like to go through what Elinar/Lili does in this story.Where to begin? I think this is a story that, if the filmmakers (namely the director and screenwriter, I'm looking at you Hooper), had gone to the actual true life material it could have made for some strong stuff, or at least some interesting contrasts. Take Gerda (who by the way with Vikander in a very good performance for what she's given has more screen time it seems than Redmayne, why she has Best supporting actress who knows whatever); she is shown as a talented, capable artist and she gets more offers and perhaps, arguably, gets better and deeper as an artist once she draws Lili - in his/her ambiguous form in art - and that's fine. But the real life Gerda, if one reads about it, was lesbian or at least bi-sexual.Imagine how this would've deepened the material, how there would be some tougher question to ask: a woman married to a man, which is not her exact sexual preference, then married to a woman and... what if she found *Lili attractive*? Forget the book for a moment and look at that original story and what potential is there for exploring sexual ambiguity and doubt on multiple fronts, maybe even being a little more daring with how sex and bodies are depicted (there is nudity here but it's mostly chaste)? Nope, can't go there, we've already got the Hot-Button-Topic of trans so can't let in the bi or lesb part of it, right?Vikander does what she can with the role, but so much of the dialog is trite, ridiculous, and flowery when it really should not be at all. And perhaps real transgender people can correct me, but it seems stupid the way the story takes certain turns. The first time that Lili meets in private with another man (Ben Wishaw's character, who is mentioned to be homosexual so there's, uh, no problem I guess as far as fidelity goes) her nose bleeds. Then when Elinar goes to the doctor and talks about his problems he describes (the doctor reads this) as bleeding out the nose, stomach cramps, and it happening once a month. Really? If psychosomatic things happen as far as men getting the same ""time of the month"" bodily functions in the scope of becoming a woman, then fine, but in the scope of how it's presented in the film it's meant to be taken seriously and it feels laughable. So much of this film can be described as laughable, insipid, and frankly insulting to people who go sometimes their whole life feeling this way. From the way the film, not talking about real life or the book I mean the film here, presents it a man suddenly feels womanly as soon as he puts on stockings and a dress and some make-up and a wig.If the script had given just some minor indication about how Elinar felt beforehand then it might be more believable in the dramatic context of what comes after. But it never does that. In fact it goes further - Lili doesn't paint anymore once she is fully herself, and I didn't buy this either; does one really change all that much that artistic talent goes away too? But on top of all of the bad decisions and poor dialog from the script is Redmayne's performance, among the worst I can think of that's has the AMPAS seal of approval in nomination form. He is both so mannered and yet so affected, so over the top and obvious with every move that he/she makes, and it's to the point where his 'immersion' into the role seems more like a stunt. I can't decide if he may just be an actor who isn't particularly believable in general or if it's just here (in Hawking at least his immersion was more physical as far as a full-bodied thing). Here it's... lots of tics and stares and hand motions and a lot of nonsense that is sickening in its excessive nature.Bottom line, this is a poor attempt at making something grandiose, and Hooper's direction, which in his past work was sometimes distracting, is more noticeably bad here (we get it, you like wonky frames) I'm sure there are other films that depict transgender themes and characters better - I haven't seen it but have heard wonderful things about Tangerine from 2015 - but this is both watered down and preposterous, and it leaves its characters stripped down to where Lili is an unlikeable B-word and Gerda is the mostly accepting, all-too-loving wife.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Eddie Redmayne, this is one actor you should follow!","Never have I watched a movie which there was this much to comment on. The cinematographer responsible for the film gave us some amazing images from the area the story took place. Reflections on the water from the shore, structures each painted a different color could be seen. The period of time was also reflected in this film work.But there is so much more to be seen in this movie, such as the acting of Alicia Vikander, and Eddie Redmayne. Surprised to see a modern made film which had such superb acting leaving you believing that neither of these actors were actually pretending to play a role. I find this fascinating because usually a person sees a movie actor which leaves you feeling that they were hired to be themselves in the movie, hence there is no such thing as acting. My hat is off especially for Eddie Redmayne, this is one actor you should follow in what is obvious future in his acting career.Looking deeper, there is something else to comment about. The story line although one may think it is obvious, another look at this film you may see what the actors try to tell us. The story is way more than it's theme about Einar in the movie. Gerda says out loud her complaint, when you watch this film try not to miss her message. Yet all the time she stands by her husband knowing she has no place here, and feels terribly left out.

"Redmayne and Vikander, the Oscar contenders.","Tom Hooper is the master at covering either very grand or very taboo subjects. The Danish Girl is his most daring project yet. I'll admit I went in to this screening mildly narrow minded, and left more open to a matter I clearly know nothing about. Eddie Redmayne, who won the Oscar for The Theory of Everything last year, looks like a contender again this year for his transitional role. At first it's the mere touch of women's clothing that alerts his feelings, but that soon turns to dressing up and being someone, that in his mind, he knows he is: a woman named Lili. Although Redmayne's acting is tremendous, an award is more deserving of Alicia Vikander, who plays Redmayne's wife. The Danish Girl shows just as much her anguish, and acceptance, and the effect it has on their marriage, as it does Einar's/Lily's.

I also feel that Gerda Wegener does not receive enough credit for the role she plays in Lilli's life. The introduction of the character Hans was completely unnecessary and contributed nothing to any character development what so ever. This was an opportunity to tell the inspiring story of Lili Elbe, and her profound relationship with Gerda, but all we got was petty squabbles every 5 minutes.

I think some of the proceedings and dilemmas are a bit problematic in how they are presented, but overall it was a story I bought. I thought Redmayne was pretty good in the role, he did all it required him to do. The problem is that I don't think the screenplay really went any deeper into a psychologically complex character. I know it's easy to hate him, but he's a very good actor and while I don't think he deserved an Oscar, he still is rather underrated around here. Alicia Vikander also gives so much to her role. In many ways she's the true heart of the film. The fact that she was campaigned as supporting is ridiculous (although not nearly as ridiculous as Jacob Tremblay and Rooney Mara's frauds).

Its like watching a newborn chick push its way through the shell of an egg,"This extraordinary film is a two-headed hydra that swings between an exquisitely beautiful study of how little separates the genders, and a dark biopic of social prejudice against those who want release from their birth gender. Based loosely on the first recorded case of gender reassignment surgery, it's a story of married Danish artists Einar and Gerda Wegener whose relationship is transformed when Einar is encouraged by his wife to express the feminine self trapped within him.The acting virtuosity of Eddie Redmayne as Einer is the beating heart of this film, just as he was the very soul of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything (2015). Starting as a playful game between two creative aesthetes, Einer incrementally explores coming out as a woman in a society not ready to even name people like him. At times melodramatic, the film is like watching a newborn chick push its way through the shell of an egg: one faint crack becomes several and suddenly a new life form emerges, bewildered by the public gaze and nowhere to hide.The cinematography is lush and painterly. Several scenes incorporate original Wegener portraits and landscapes to create a living art gallery where Einar metaphorically paints himself into herself as Lili, the camera dwelling on feminine rituals that show the transformational power of cosmetic and fashion adornments. Some of the multi-depth close-up shots are themselves masterpieces that frame original paintings with their live subject in sets that resemble an artist's canvas. As Lili experiences the sexual advances of males, she yearns for a cure for the ""sickness"" of wrong genitalia. It's a sensitive portrayal of a complex issue for many who, like Lili, were prepared to risk their lives with pre-modern surgery to be who they wanted to be. Not all viewers will want to share that journey, but those who respect it will have much to admire in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

In a case scenario like this, Alicia Vikander acts courageously in useful way that helps her partner. Interestingly enough, she allowed him to become what he transforms later on in the movie and it was her who added more weight to his skeptical decision. Decision which changed her life completely and made her realize how things changed up. She had to impose her disagreement into her husband. After six years of marriage, we did not see any fight nor huge argument. How can you permit something that you foresee and know it will demolish your life? For the happiness to your beloved? She should has been more egoist and push her partner against it. This couples did not fight by that time? How come? Only mellifluous voices and sudden vanishings. Do not you realize your life is going to change in a disastrous way? Well, do something about it, do not let it go nor support it!

It is wonderful that they made this film, because I did not know transgender history and hardship way back then. This film is biographical and is set in mid-1920s Copenhagen. The portrait artist Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) asks her husband, popular landscape artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), to stand in for a female model that was late to pose for a painting she is working on. In addition, the act of Einar posing as a female figure reveals his hidden gender identity as a female, named Lili Elbe, when he feels the softness of the garment, stockings and shoes. Ms. Vikander's performance is amazing as a supportive wife. I like her in Ex Machina and she does not disappoint in this film.

Hugely Overrated,"I was expecting greatness, I must admit, and that's too much of a burden for most films. Director, source material, actors, designer, all looked like a great fit, so I settled down for a great night of cinema, and for the first twenty minutes or so thought I might get it. Every shot seemed like a Dutch painting, which I'm sure were the inspirations, but none of it felt real. And let's be honest a lot of filmmakers base the look on paintings, but you then need to make it breathe and live. This didn't, it just continued to look like nicely composed paintings. But Alicia Vikander was a joy right from the beginning, bringing depth, clarity and humanity to the role.Unlike Eddie Redmayne who proceeded to play one note for the whole film. He seemed to have decided that if he looks down and then up again through his eyelids he was now a woman. It was a performance of tricks, and lazy tricks really, which were skin deep at best, which is ironic since the whole point of his character is about finding what's beneath the skin. I like some of his performances but I think with this he bit off more than he can chew and the director was not skilled enough to get the performance he needed out of Redmayne.It's a huge shame as it is a very interesting story; the true one that is. The real story spanned 20 years and when you look at the time-frame of what really happened it all makes much more sense. The film feels rushed, and yet at the same time painfully slow at times, and it just doesn't work trying to squeeze 20 years of story into a couple.A lot of noise about nothing, is my verdict.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A unique message conveyed from The Danish Girl,"The Danish Girl surely leaves a lot of thinking to the audience, out of all what attracted my mind the most is the brilliant delineation of inner dynamics of a person who is embarked on a journey realising himself. The way how inner conflictions and battles against one's own feelings and emotions are beautifully depicted throughout the movie is remarkable. Einar is one of the rare humans who tried to analyse his inner self constantly listening to his conscience. He wasn't interested in what other people did, nor did he let their opinions to obliterate his own journey. As an artist he was already very open minded, so was Gerda. That is the unique beauty of art, the imagination of an artist is like a bird flying in the vast blue sky, it doesn't know any boundaries. Though artists possess such a powerful imagination, it's very rare that they would see their own life as an artwork like Einar.Looking at his usual landscapes he painted, the array of poplars in a marshy land and the foggy weather suggest the dullness of his life as Einar. But Lili's gorgeous dresses and her alluring, lively smile show his feminine half is much brighter and happier. Lili's diaries defines herself as a woman trapped in a man's body. Einar's very much formal looking attire with high neck tight collars and his guarded behaviour in public suggests she was trying hard not to let the character slip away, but eventually she gets too exhausted to go on playing this role anymore that she thinks of killing Einar. But ironically Einar is one half of her, she can't kill him without killing herself.In the movie not only infront of strangers but also infront of his own wife, Einar acts like he and Lili are totally different two persons. For instance after the party he asks Gerda ""Did Lili enjoy the party?"" He acts like this because of the genuine confusion going on inside him. Because of this baffled state of his mind, Einar goes to seek help of psychologists not sure himself about his own sanity. The helplessness and despair he undergoes when no doctor even tries to understand his case was too overwhelming for him. If not for Gerda's love and firm support he would have lost his mind for real. This period of transition is very critical in transgender individuals, it is actually a roller-coaster of emotions and the continuous support of their loved ones is crucial to them.We all know that it's natural for people to hate new changes, which they define as deviation from the norm and anyone trying to break this boundary of normality is considered as insane. Thus everyone prefers to stay in this safe zone called normality in fear of rejection from the society. It's admirable how Einar boldly walks away from this safe zone to follow his heart, sacrificing his career and the recognition he has earned in the society. For us her decision may look unrealistic but for Lili it was her only hope, because she didn't want to live in a lie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tighter editing and a different male lead could have helped,"Loosely based on a ""real"" story, the plot is about Einar Wegener/Lili, one of the first transgender people to undergo surgery. The story starts in 1926, with Einar happily married to Gerda. Both are painters, enjoying some fame in Copenhagen. One day Gerda asks Einer to wear silk stockings to pose for an unfinished portrait of a ballerina and from then on Einar starts discovering Lili, his ""female"" side, which will end up ""killing"" Einar.Gerda pursues her career and finds success with Einar's portraits as his female counterpart Lili. The couple moves to Paris, where Einar can leave more openly as Lili in the bohemian artist society. Also, Gerda meets a former friend of Einar, the brooding and all-male Hans, who stirs feelings presumably more pleasant than dealing with your husband's trans-sexuality.After several disastrous meetings with different doctors, all of whom think Einar is insane, a German surgeon finally announces he will try to help Einar getting rid of his male parts and start living fully as Lili. Gerda, supported by Hans, decides to stick to Lili's decision and stays with her ""husband"" during his medical treatment. However, surgery is a risky business, even more so a hundred years ago.The movie created - predictably - some controversy. Some criticized the fictional character of Hans, but I think he provided a much needed masculine but discreet performance, to balance the Einar/Lili character. Vikander is really good in showing the strong mix of emotions Gerda felt during Einar's journey: from amusement to worry, from horror, desperation and rage and finally to support.I did not like much Redmayne as Einar/Lili. Granted it was a difficult part to play, but Redmayne drove me to distraction with his hands movements and his fluttering of eyelashes. Besides, he was not even remotely believable as a woman, just a guy in wig and drags. I am surprised he did not ""attract"" more bewildered reactions, especially during the first outing at the big ball in Copenhagen. That anybody there mistook him for a girl is ludicrous.Photography and costumes are very good, especially the choice of the cold, Nordic light and minimalist interiors. However, after the move to Paris, the story does slow down considerably and even more so after the first surgery, when I thought the movie should finish, but there was still a bit to go. A tighter editing and a different male lead would have helped.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hauntingly Beautiful,"2 January 2016 First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester for this year - Eddie Redmayne delivered a hauntingly beautiful and powerful performance as both Einer and Lili, two people of opposite sex essentially sharing the same body. Artist Einer was painted by his wife as a woman and this brought suppressed feelings to the surface and he became increasingly ill at ease living his life as a man. This is a tale of fiction based on the real lives of a Danish couple who took part in the first male to female sex change operation, and we follow their emotional turbulent journey as Einer takes on the life of Lili, and how Gerda his wife, alternates between supporting and rejecting her husband. A childhood friend of Einer's becomes an unlikely ally offering support to all three members of the marriage. A sympathetically written script and beautifully filmed, Eddie Redmayne is is outstanding in these roles, together with very capable supporting actress Alicia Vikander and actor Matthias Schoenaerts. I await the awards season with interest.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Danish Girl,"The Danish Girl"" is yet another politically correct movie by Tom Hooper. No doubt that the topic – the story of the first transgender patient was chosen by him not by accident.To criticize the film is a hard task when critics can be interpreted as intolerant and so on. However the director was not able to reflect the complexity and dramatism of the real story of Lili Elbe, born as Einar Wegener who died as a result of an unsuccessful sex reassignment operation.The film is too superficial, too shallow and it seems that the director does not know what the story is about. The film Glen or Glenda by Ed Wood was more convincing. The depiction of Gerda Wegener – the wife of Lili is not believable either.In the end of the film we see the text praising Lili Elbe as an inspiration to the transgenders to come. This politically correct remark leaves a sort of bewilderment. The unhealthy fixation with own sexuality is not really the most important thing in this complex world full of much more significant problems. This text is a classical example of imposing a questionable and politically motivated point of view to the audience instead of leaving space for thought. Perhaps the story of Lili can not only be an inspiration but also a warning for those people who want to solve their psychological problems with a surgeons knife.The film is shot in a pleasant color scheme which makes it possible to watch the film, albeit not without severe boredom.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Propaganda and 'The Danish Girl',"As night fell on Christmas Eve, National Public Radio was in its usual holy-day mode, using your tax dollars to mock the traditional Christian creed. This time they promoted an activist movie called The Danish Girl, yet another alleged ""true story"" about artist Einar Wegener, a married man who wanted to be a woman named Lili. An earlier NPR commercial – sorry, ""underwriting announcement"" – said he was the first recipient of ""gender confirmation surgery.""Paging Mr. Orwell – it's NPR on line 1. Focus Features – part of the Comcast ""diversity and inclusion"" empire of propaganda – is calling this maiming of the male body ""gender confirmation surgery.""As Einar/Lili, Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne proclaims before amputation, ""God made me a woman. The doctor is curing me of the sickness that was my disguise."" It's just another LGBT heresy, carefully placed under your pine tree at the NPR holiday party.God did not do this; it is man attempting to undo what God created. But let's continue.Openly gay NPR All Things Considered anchor Ari Shapiro asked Redmayne: ""Just in the last year or two, trans awareness in America has exploded, whether it's Laverne Cox on the cover of Time magazine, Jeffrey Tambor winning awards for his performance in Transparent and on and on and on. Do you think the world reacts differently to this film because of the awareness that has grown so much recently?""Redmayne replied ""I hope so, because the education that I had in the three or four years of preparing, I feel like is now entering the mainstream media. And the world is being educated. And what is astounding is some of the, you know, the discrimination or the violence that Lili lived through is still so rife across the world, I mean, particularly, sort of job -- you can be fired in 32 states for being trans.""The world is being ""educated"" by Hollywood and the ""mainstream media."" Redmayne proclaimed to be so affected by playing the gender-confused man: ""When you, as an actor, meet people and people share their experience, one also feels a sense of responsibility. And certainly, I've been trying to learn to be an ally to the community in any way that I can.""This is just one day's example of how flagrantly NPR mocks the name of its show All Things Considered. No one is allowed to rebut Redmayne's Christmas Eve ""trans ally"" sermonizing with facts or, even worse, Christian teaching.Despite Focus Features advertising this film as a ""true story"" and a ""true love story,"" it's based on a novel, not on real life. Einar Wegener and his wife Gerda's ""love story"" crumbled. Gerda was not even present during Einar's last operation and death, but was living in Italy with her second husband, Fernando Porta.In a 1933 book that's listed as an inspiration for the movie, Man Into Woman: The First Sex Change Operation, it's reported that Einar was so twisted that he believed that with the transplant of the ovaries of a woman in her twenties, he had become young again (""an age that corresponds to my physical development as a woman""). He was so infatuated with the surgeon who killed him in an attempted uterus transplant that he asked if the operations could be under local anesthesia so he could watch him at work.All that madness is submerged for the radical politics. The movie's final credits proclaim that Einar's ""bravery and pioneering spirit remains an inspiration for today's transgender movement.""The only disturbance to this progressive force, naturally, is the radicals hate it. A ""cisgender male"" plays the ""transgender icon,"" so it's never quite progressive enough. But for the media elites trying to propel a ""movement,"" it's quite good enough. Are the Golden Globes and Oscars for building ""awareness"" coming next?",,Anonymous,Biography

"a winsome movie, but not a brave one","Tom Hopper's follow-up of THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) and LES MISERABLES (2012) is a ""true"" story about Einar Wegner, aka. Lili Elbe (Redmayne), a Danish landscape painter in 1920s, who was among the first recipients of sex change surgery in the human history, and the film is all about the telling love story between him and his supporting wife Gerda (Vikander), a portrait artist, and how they mange to shoulder on during Einar/Lili's unconventional pursuit to become a real woman.If you do some background checking, you will find the film is not nearly based on the real story of Einar and Gerda, indeed, most of the depiction is fictionalized in its source novel written by David Ebershoff. So it is rather shameful the movie has been painstakingly marketed with the ""based on a true story"" tag just because it looks more like an Oscar bait.Also, tackling the thorny issue of trans-gender cognition, the film is told entirely through the point- of-view from a male perspective to define a woman (fancy dresses, makeups, a vagina, that is all ) and a tolerant and support wife, an imaginary elaboration from a cisgender mindset, which can be explored as a particular angle, but when the whole narrative pivots around it, the film will definitely not appear as politically correct.Against all these hindrances, THE DANISH GIRL is a breathtakingly gorgeous achievement on all its technical levels, Desplat's magnificent score ushers audience into the splendor of its production design, costume, landscape, architecture and art pieces, on the eye level, the film is impeccably enticing. Then the performances of two leads, the ""it"" star in Hollywood now, Vikander won as Oscar for her ""supporting"" role, if one takes the word literally, she is indeed the most supporting character you can expect, except one brief moment of lapse when she seeks comfort from the hunky art dealer Hans Axgil (Schoenaerts). Her win really becomes a nuisance if we think of the exact same position of Felicity Jones in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (2014), her Jane Hawking is a ""leading"" role in her own life, instead of being a ""supporting"" wife for Stephen Hawking (Redmayne again), otherwise she could have given Patricia Arquette a good run for her money.Although Redmayne's physiognomy is too angular to call it as an earthly beauty and there are certain cringe-worthy moments when he relentlessly tries to imitate the feminine mannerism in front of the mirror, it is self-consciously awkward and betrays Redmayne's self-effacing nature, but this is what the best one can get from allowing a male actor to play a trans-gender pioneer, something is congenitally missing at the first placeAnyway, THE DANISH GIRL effectuates its emotional punch when reaching its lugubrious finish line, albeit its inadequately adapted screenplay. Frankly speaking it is a winsome movie, but it is not a brave one, a lost opportunity to bring about something extraordinary (casting a real trans- actor in the leading role for instance) out of an inspiring and valuable true story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Love of a Good Woman,"The Danish Girl of the title is Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe, as portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, but the film would have been better if it had made Gerda Wegener, as portrayed by Alicia Vikander, the central character. It is her understanding and loyalty--as she learns that the love of her life is a man who believes he should have been born a woman--that is the heart and soul of this film. Redmayne's performance did more to convince this viewer that there is not always a surgical answer to the transgender dilemma. His eye-batting and Princess Diana-ish downward glances reeked of ACTING and made the character seem utterly self-centered. It was the quandary of his loving wife that seemed so sad and was really the most compelling part of the story. Set in the 1920s, the film is also beautiful to watch for its sets and locations.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I watched the whole 2 hours of it and I wish it lasted longer.As far as the actors go, it was a very interesting bunch. Alicia did an amazing job, while the other male presences just made the movie even more touching.

A beautiful portrayal of a transgender man and his wife,"The successful British director Tom Hooper, who made big films like The King's Speech and Les Misérables, here takes on the true story about one of the world's first sex changes. Eddie Redmayne plays Einar Wegener who changes his sex and becomes the woman Lili Elbe. Alicia Vikander plays Einar's wife Gerde. They both deliver fantastic Oscar nominated performances. The Danish Girl is an important film not only about a sex change, but also LGBT rights and above all transsexual people's right to a life of their own choosing.The main focus of the film is actually not directly on Einar/Lili, and we as an audience sees most of it all through the eyes of the wife Gerda. I am a bit divided in my opinion about this because it makes us a spectator, but when the main plot focuses on Einar/Lili and we follow it through Gerde's eyes, we still barely get to know her. She functions mainly as support to Einar/Lili. It would have been interesting to make the film entirely from the perspective of Einar/Lili. Make us the audience become her, feel and understand how she feels. Gerda could have been a supporting character on the side. This also becomes more clear with the fact that Redmayne, nominated for the leading role has less screen time than Vikander who is nominated for a supporting role.I think The Danish Girl is a good film you must see. It does take certain liberties with the story, compared to the truth, but most likely to make it more exciting on film. This does not bother me because the film's message is more important than an exact truthful story. I do however think it would have been better if we were to follow the film more from the perspective of Einar/Lili than Gerde. Make us really enter her head, make us understand how she feels. Otherwise, the film is incredibly beautiful to watch. The costumes, the production design and the cinematography is extraordinary, plus beautiful music by Alexandre Desplat. I am hoping for a Swedish Oscar on Sunday.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Far Too Long & Drawn Out...,"Fails to stop the viewer losing all interest around 30 minutes in.

A movie worth gold every minute it runs,"The Danish Girl is one of the greatest cinematic epics I am ever privileged to watch. I must say it is nearly faultless with an unorthodox story to make, yet bursting with great acting in the 2015 silver screen. Tom Hooper's marvelous directing spreads all over the movie cleverly binding the immensity of all talented actors – Alicia, Eddie & Mathias. And it nicely pairs with Lucinda's crafty screenplay as the story smoothly entwines from the start around the main two characters Gerda and Lili. They bond with each other in a very romantic, artistic manner.It is quite impressive to note that despite the intensity of sexual nature of the main theme, director does not show deliberate scenes of love making although he could have easily done so. Nudity too, is shown in its true artistic way, not the cheap phonographic way. And there is not a single swearing word that you hear in most Hollywood movies these days just when there is the slightest relationship dispute. Even with a shattering, marriage breaking situation Gerda and Lili do not swear at each other despite the anger and frustration within themselves but show the care and love to each other and act quite civil.Another striking feature of this movie is the clever editing of each scene before it gets in to drag or boredom. Scenes build up to a climax and get cut quickly yet cleverly connects to the next scene without disturbing the flow. Best editing seen for a while! Needless to mention that Desplat's beautiful soothing music and the splendor of Cohen's cinematography further makes it a truly unforgettable melancholic cinematic poem. Don't miss it! It is a movie worth gold every minute it runs.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's Oscar-baity pathos...,"In a heartfelt interview related to his role in ""Tootsie"", Dustin Hoffman recalled that existential epiphany when he was trying for different ways to look convincing as a woman, he realized that the issue wasn't about how realistic he looked but how beautiful. He then realized how demanding was society toward women and he cried at the thought of many interesting women he missed just because he himself applied that pressure on them. The role allowed him to approach the beauty-burden of women and in that fragment of interview lays one truth that the whole ""The Danish Girl"" movie flirts with but never embraces.I know Tom Hooper's film isn't about cross-dressing as much as it's about gender-identity so I'm not comparing the film to ""Tootsie"". However, there comes a moment when the pre-surgery Lili Elbe, played by Eddie Redmayne, enjoys the idea of being believable as a woman and does the best to hide whatever can betray the male assets and deep inside, I couldn't help but feel as though I was watching an actor giving his best shot as a woman, because the initial idea of a woman was to be beautiful, to look sweet and sensitive, to let an innocent chuckle, a few sobbing breaths slip, and Redmayne looked believable in these clichés situations, but that was all.In a film where you have the wife Gerta, an independent painter and strong female character played by Alicia Vikander, it's rather frustrating to see that a transgender person, once she becomes a woman, abandons all her dreams and makes her best to fit in a female crowd, talking about the last fashion of Paris and giggling like a schoolgirl. In ""Tootsie"", being the beautiful woman was the means, in ""The Danish Girl"", it's the end. When Lili becomes a woman, I'm sorry if this comparison offends but I immediately thought of Mr. Garrison in ""South Park"" who, as soon as he became a woman, enjoyed talking with girls about girly things such as men and the 'curse', it was like joining a club. I know the film goes deeper than that and the real-life story of Lilu is an inspiration for many people who feel trapped in the wrong body, however, I'm blaming the treatment for making the gender identity something as superficial and predictable.For some reason, the film was more effective when it started like a game and Edgar started enjoying the way his modelling inspired a believable lady, having that same Tootsie ""epiphany"", when the struggle to search his identity was within the framework of art, the film could deliver its message without being too forceful, and art was the perfect medium. Think about it, what is the purpose of art, it seeks beauty, goodness and truth, a certain truth as perceived by the artist. Lili starts as ""beauty"" and then she reveals what Lili feels like the best part of herself and then at the end, it turns out that Lili was the truth, the one she's been longing for, she's his, no, her reality. ""The Danish Girl"" starts as a wonderful movie about art and the way it can speak some deep truths about our own personas, only this time, the work of art serves the model's epiphany... it's the idea of being looked at as someone, and then be treated like that someone, and then become that someone, it's a fantastic journey between the realms of reality and art, highlighting the latter's universal language.Tom Hooper had a fantastic material in the original novel written by David Ebershoff, but for some reason, he decided it to turn it into a sober and melancholic drama whose second act is obviously tailor-made to shine a light on an important issue, in other words, it played the Oscar bait thing with the dragging sequences and the sad piano theme. I enjoyed ""The King's Speech"" not because of the stuttering performance or because of its climax (it was only a speech after all) but because it told a terrific friendship story, one can argue that ""The Danish Girl"" is also a tale of love between a woman and her husband who becomes a woman, but Redmayne plays a frustratingly passive character whose efforts to be a woman are only highlighted through sad monologues, cries and sorry for the term, cross-dressing and impressions that are so artificial that they never show what it is to feel like a woman, only to look like one.Redmayne is a good actor but he pushes the pathos button way too far to make for an enjoyable experience and I'm not sure people who belongs to the community like to be their lives seen as eternal reservoirs of sadness. Vikander pulls off a terrific performance but she's clearly the leading character and while the producers put her in the supporting character to win, we're forced to enjoy Redmayne's continual pathos, regretting these true-to-life moments where even when she looked like a man was playfully posing like a woman. The second act is just the typical biopic material chronicling the final years of Lili and although her life is an inspiration, I wished it inspired more than a fade and pale drama from a director who seems to love playing on the safe side. Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
outstanding performances in depressing film,"This film is an outstanding work of art. Every performance is outstanding and emotionally moving. Based on a true story about a respected and seemingly happily married artist who discovers that he is a woman trapped in a man's body. The film starts off with some lighthearted sex games regarding cross-dressing and role reversal which appears to stimulate the loving couple. However, things take a shocking twist, when the husband begins to realize that his is a trans-gender person. The problem here is that in the long run, nothing but unhappiness and abuse becomes the couple. While the film wants to portray an heroic figure in the history of trans-gender people, I think it loses its appeal, as nothing but severe unhappiness result in this journey. Outside looking in, it might seem heroic, but for the people living it, their happiness becomes a tragic ending. With that said, great acting and an interesting historical journey makes this movie a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Second-Tier Oscar Film,"A semi-fictitious love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer.As far as Oscar reviews go, this one will be a little bit shorter. The film has four nominations, and it has only a slim chance to win any of them. For Costume Design and Production Design, it seems very unlikely that the film has a chance at all. On the costume, perhaps, because they had to effectively dress am an as a woman. But this seems more like it would have fallen into hair and makeup. I suspect no win here.I would love to see Best Supporting Actress for Alicia Vikander, especially because she should more properly be seen as the lead actress and not simply a supporting part of the film. In many ways, this is just as much the wife's story as it is the husband's. Vikander dominated, and although I would have to give serious thought to it, she may just have my vote. But this is one of the tougher categories this year, with Jennifer Jason Leigh (Hateful Eight) seen as a likely winner, and Rooney Mara (Carol) probably giving her best performance yet. So my heart is with Vikander, but my head says it is unlikely.Which leaves Best Actor for Eddie Redmayne. He won last year portraying Stephen Hawking, and he has followed it up with something almost as good. It is one thing to put on makeup and a dress. Anyone can do that. But he transforms himself completely into Lili, and has a character that is bursting with emotion and a possible mental instability. (This may give the wrong impression for transgender people, but Lili is portrayed less as a woman inside a man and more as a split personality.)Redmayne would love to win back-to-back, and in many years this would be quite possible. But all the buzz says Leonardo DiCaprio is walking away with the award for his role in ""Revenant"". Personally, I believe Redmayne put more of himself into his role than DiCaprio did. But I do not expect the forward momentum to change... this is ""Leo's year"", and when the awards get announced, expect him to be the one with the statue, not Eddie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most beautiful movies I ever watched,"""The danish girl"" is the most touching yet beautiful story I ever experience.First of all I must say that Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander delivered the characters with such a passion and such an emotional performance that,in my opinion,the characters needed to be amazing.I was not surprised that Alicia Vikander won an Oscar for best supporting actress and that Eddie Redmayne was nominated for best actor in the 88th Oscars in 2016.Now getting back to the movie I have to say that the first time I saw the movie I was a mixture of emotions and tears.The movie has a really powerful message and it really shows the difficulties that a transsexual person has to face everyday.To finish my review I just want to add that I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience a beautiful movie that it's going to make you smile,laugh,cry and much more.....But believe me it's going to be worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eddie Redmayne plays Garbo,"I found this a touching movie to sit through yesterday, but upon reflection today it's harder to take it quite as seriously as it takes itself. The early cross-dressing scenes have much of the charm of a Mozart opera,but during the many mirror-gazing scenes leading up to Eddie Redmayne's sex-change surgery, I began thinking of Greta Garbo, to whom the cameramen of her day also gave long moments of soulful introspection.Ben Whishaw also has an androgynous beauty; was he in the running for the lead role? Alicia Vikander's transition from wife to best friend, well played, is perhaps over-romanticised. Tom Hooper's 2010 Oscar/Bafta-winner THE KING'S SPEECH had the added charm of humanising our lofty Royals. In THE DANISH GIRL he's trying to do the opposite, to 'mystify' a pair of artistic misfits, and he succeeds, but less fluently.The cinematography is superb, creating harbour-scapes of Copenhagen that have the luminosity of Turner paintings. The film is only a little too long, a little too slow and maybe tries a little to hard to wring our heartstrings. But wring them it does.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
5/10,"After ""The King's Speech"" and the perfect musical adaptation of ""Les Miserables"", this is a tremendous step down for Tom Hooper. A disappointment from almost every point of view and worst of all, a definition of Oscar Bait film, which hurts even more coming from a director whose movies in the past strayed away from that stereotype.What the film can count on is of course Desplat's music which rarely ever fails to elevate a film, no matter the quality, Alicia Vikander's charisma and splendid screen presence and an unbelievable production design, that is often what repeatedly saves scenes from being cringe-worthy. It is often what is telling the story the most and without such an excellence in this department I am sure I would have got bored fifteen minutes into the film. But, also thanks to Tom Hooper's distinctive and beautiful visual style, I hardly ever got even annoyed by the film because of such a beautiful scenery.For the rest the film fails to explore or be insightful on even the most basic of its themes, it doesn't raise any thoughts or ideas, it stays on a superficial note for the whole duration and hardly managed to make me feel emotion. That is due both to the fact that the filmmakers probably forgot the meaning of understated or subtle and through at you an overwhelming quantity of acting and melodrama of which I had had enough by the first act. This screenplay does not set up its characters or story coherently, it is all over the place and doesn't give any type of depth to motivations or back story. Almost everything, right from the very beginning, is thrown at your face, spoon fed to you repeatedly and it makes for a dull experience, were the audience member is never given the chance to be engaged.Look, I loved Eddie Redmayne before it was cool to love him. His work in Les Miserables is indicative of his talent, but it's the second year in a row in which he turns out a performance that has nothing to do with what I consider to be true acting. He is acting so much it is unwatchable at times, he does not even come close to disappearing from screen and I don't care whatever he went through, that's none of my business and nor should be anyone's. DiCaprio, Redmayne, Day-Lewis, I don't fuc**ing care what the fu*k you went through to give your performance when the result on screen is so unauthentic. Yes I went there, even with Day-Lewis. It's just not the type of acting that I enjoy and it's actually the kind that I deeply hate. I want to see a character on screen, as Ian McKellen says: both the acting and the actor have to disappear from screen and this is the total opposite.

It wasn't me it was Patricia,"One of the most aesthetic movies I've seen ruined from bad plot and dialogue. Lily felt like one of the personalities that guy in split had that took over the real him. I am not trans myself but I thought trans people change their appearance not their personality. When Gerda told him to bring Ainar back he responded that he was gone,what does that even mean? Shouldn't they convey the message that trans people are born this way? Shouldn't he have said that Ainar was lily or something like that? Makes more sense to me if we are talking about gender dysphoria and not double personality disorder.",,Anonymous,Biography
Too tidy,"We live in a world of absolutes and relentless anger. Being trans, parental consent, rights of trans-children are some of the issues that enflame hordes of immoral, opportunistic politicians. ""The Danish Girl"", genteel movie from 2015, tells a story about Lili Elba, the pioneer trans woman and her marriage to Gerda Wegener. Everything in this movie is elegantly and beautifully done, marvelous cast, strong script, but I felt strangely dissatisfied. Perhaps it is all too anti-septic and tidy, and sadly, because of that, lacking genuine feeling. Elegance can sometimes be a burden instead of a shining example.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Come for the set design, stay for the acting","The Danish Girl is a story set in Copenhagen in the 1920's about one of the first people to undergo a sex reassignment. Although I was not particularly fond of the pacing or character development, the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander were some of the strongest of the year. Redmayne's portrayal of Einar/Lili made Jared Leto's portrayal of Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club seem as believable as Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. Vikander, who had a huge year, was passionate, loving and vulnerable as Einar's wife Gerda in her strongest role to date. The location, set designs and costumes provide a gorgeous context within which to enjoy the performances.The Danish Girl can be be criticized as Oscar bait, but that accusation infers an elite level of quality. There's no denying that it's a conservative exploration of trans-gendered issues, but it's certainly an accomplished one.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Drags at the beginning and end, strong in the  middle","THE DANISH GIRL is a beautifully made, artistically directed motion picture with 2 very strong lead performers telling an important story of a pioneer in the Transgender community. Unfortunately, it only had about 1 hour and 20 minutes worth of material to cover in it's 1 hour and 57 minute length.To make up for it's lack of story, director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) relies on very pretty, almost portrait-like pictures in depicting the story of married artists Einer Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) as they deal with the growing realization that Einer is living a lie as a man and really needs to be living the life of his female alter-ego, Lili. Therefore, the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of this film really drag - but, boy, is that middle hour really, really good.Starting with the acting Redmayne is perfectly cast as Einer/Lili. His portrayal starts as a male with a female inside that you watch metamorph into the full-blown female that she is. Redmayne is delicate and strong, sure and unsure, male and female throughout the film but never loses the inner beauty and inner strength of his character. He is nominated for a BEST ACTOR Oscar (an award he won last year for playing Stephen Hawking in THEORY OF EVERYTHING) and has followed that up with another strong, nuanced performance.But, to me, this movie belonged to Alicia Vikander as his wife, Gerda. At first, encouraging Einer to dress in women's clothes, as her muse, Gerda realizes that she is losing her husband to another woman - but that woman IS her husband and the anger, frustration, confusion and LOVE she has for this person is vividly seen. She is nominated for Best SUPPORTING Actress for her role - an Award that I think she will win - but that is misleading, for it is the LEAD part in this fim.As mentioned above, Director Hooper delivers some VERY pretty pictures. Since he is dealing with two artists, quite a few of his compositions on the screen could be mistaken for painted pictures, absolutely a choice that was made that works quite well. But, because he does not have quite a full movie's worth of material to work with, he does have a tendency to let his camera linger or slow pan as our two leads gaze out a window to contemplate the events of these lives.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Danish Girl,"The Danish girl is an emotional saga narrated beautifully by Tom Hooper. To be precise it is a journey of the first person who opted for the sex change operation played effortlessly by Eddie Redmayne. How one's come out of the closet supported by his better half played and nailed it perfectly by Alicia Vikander. Ben Wishaw in his brief role was as good as always.

a Bad Good film,"I just saw the movie and, yes I liked it, but now I know why Eddie didn't win the Oscar and why Alicia Vikander did. She was amazing. She didn't play a supporting role, her character was just as important as Eddie's. About Eddie, I think that he was the problem of the movie because even though he should have been the star of the story he wasn't. I believe that he established a level of acting with ""The Theory of Everything"" that will be hardly reached again. When I say bad movie, it's because it was impossible for me to concentrate on the evolution of Lili because I was more focused on Gerda's feelings and point of view. In the end, though, I'm still happy they made a movie on such an important and very much discussed topic, and I think that being a transgender is very difficult, especially in the reality of a couple. When I think about this movie the only thing I can say is that, yes it is a really good one, but they have decided to make this movie only for the current American situation and we can see the results. I think that in order to be a masterpiece they should have put their focus on the various aspects of the process and not just the transition.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eddie Redmayne Oscar worthy performance,"I wasn't sure how I would take to this movie as its not the sort I would go for. After the 1st 20 minutes I was hooked.

Based on one of the first recipients of sex reassignment surgery, Lili Elbe.Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander was fantastic in their given roles and as a viewer I felt the characters emotions.

A touching story,"This film tells a fictionalised version of the life of a Danish painter, who was the world's first transsexual person who completed sexual reassignment surgery.""The Danish Girl"" is a touching journey of Einar Wegener's self discovery that he is in fact a she all along. Through modelling, he discovers that he is a woman deep inside. Einar Wegener and his wife both go through much emotions and struggles to get to a point where love and integrity triumphs. The story is very touching, but for some reason I do not feel as empathic or sympathetic towards Lili. Maybe it is because of Eddie Redmayne's omnipresent big smiles which look rather fake and overdone at times. It appears that he wears a big smile most of the time and also tilt his head downwards to give a more feminine presence, but to be honest he already looks very feminine without these two mannerisms. I am impressed by Eddie Redmayne, he looks very feminine (sometimes even more feminine than Alicia Vikander!) but the big smile is just over the top.Overall, I am touched by the story. I hope Eddie Redmayne will win the Oscar again.",,Anonymous,Biography
Fascinating film with beautiful photography and STUNNING performances.,"The first thing you'll notice with 'The Danish Girl', is the exquisite photography and cinematography. This film looks amazing!The next element that grabbed me, was the fantastic performances by the film's two lead actors, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander - especially Redmayne, who was sensational! He conveyed so much emotion through the most subtle of facial expressions. Incredible! Having a rather feminist look with gentle eyes and facial features, he is perfectly cast.Redmayne stars as happily married man Einar, an artist. Married to portrait artist Gerda (Vikander) his alter ego, Lili, surfaces when Gerda asks him to model for her - as a woman, for a portrait. Einar soons finds woman's clothing irresistible, even becoming aroused by wearing it. When Gerda dresses him up as a woman to accompany him ""as someone else"" to an event he didn't want to go to, Einar soon finds it difficult to break free from Lili, becoming her in the process.Primarily a drama, there are some very funny moments too. At times I wanted the humor to linger a bit longer, but funny moments were often suddenly diminished by a depressing tone. I felt they should have allowed these humorist moments time to breathe. Nevertheless, I was mesmerized by this film. The costumes, make-up and production design are stunning. I loved it! Redmayne made it all the more worth the while.Goof: Note the film starts in 1926. However, later in the film after a series of events, Gerda opens Einar's doctor's letter, and it is dated 12 October 1925.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Deep pain, yet in a bit sterile way.","Another transformation story by Eddie Redmayne, which he once again played quite well after Theory of Everything.The transformation from Einar to Lili is explained very much in details, especially the stages; From the first realization to the decision up until having the surgery; the psychological roots handled masterfully. This movie is definite success.The part to be criticized on the other hand is on an important and striking subject such as a Danish painter changing his sexual identity (especially in the 1920s); the aforementioned dreams were handled somewhat superficially, and the pains displayed too ""sterile"". It may not be fair to compare, but even his colleague Van Gogh cut off his ear due to the depression he fell into as a result, regardless of what the rumors about his reason point to. In other words, the critics expected the psychological crisis to be processed more strikingly, which we read only from the facial and body expressions of Einar in the film. While it could have made a masterpiece out of such a story, the director Tom Hooper, deliberately chose this poor path because of the concern that the film might lose its popularity.It may not be a masterpiece, but The Danish Girl, a successful film that did not deserve such a high dose of criticism.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautiful film backed by Strong acting. A Must watch!,"The Danish Girl is a biographical romantic drama film directed by Tom Hooper. The film stars Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, Sebastian Koch, Ben Whishaw, Amber Heard and Matthias Schoenaerts.The film is based on the novel of the same name by David Ebershoff, and loosely inspired by the lives of Danish painters Late Lili Elbe and Late Gerda Wegener.Artist Gerda Wegener asks her husband Einar to pose as a female model for a painting. Things take an unexpected turn when this act triggers Einar to reignite his suppressed identification.One of the most beautiful film made by Tom Hooper. The film is a typical film which is made for a very limited section of viewers and film purely depends on the storytelling and acting for it's success and the film triumphs in both the field. The plot/topic of the film is indeed controversial but credit should be given to the maker for making the film with utmost purity and without getting into any sort of controversies to help the film and kept the film as simple yet beautiful as possible.Acting is the soul of the film and none of the lead actors disappoint, Eddie Redmayne does a tremendous job again and proved his skills in acting after ""The theory of Everything"" and in my opinion no one could've done better apart from him, it was indeed a tough film for him but the way he had shown the dilemmas, insecurities, confusions is tremendous. Alicia Vikander was equally impressive and leaves a mark with her commendable acting skills. She had got a tough competition from Eddie but nowhere she displays even a minuscule of disappointment in her acting. Rest of the cast were also impressive in their respective roles.Screenplay of the film is slow which generally is the case with such types of films but still keeps the grip on the film and nowhere the viewers looses the interest in the film.The cinematography of the film is also very beautiful and the era of 1920s is captured very beautifully and impressively. The climax of the film is sad but strong and gives a great closure.A must watch for terrific acting and beautiful story telling.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Uncomfortable at times but superb performances,"This was a film that I originally thought I'd skip when I first saw the trailer. However, the second time I saw it I was more intrigued by the story and do like Alicia Vikander so was looking forward to seeing her in a film with substance. Eddie Redmayne, on the other hand, I do find difficult to watch on screen no matter his role. He was outstanding as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything and won a well-deserved Oscar, however in this film he's back to being quite tricky to watch, for me at least.Based very loosely on the life of Einar Wegener and set in 1920's Denmark this is a largely fictional piece about the life of Einar, his wife Gerda and his journey to becoming Lili Elbe. The scenery of the film, the cities and locations within those cities, is simply stunning. Every scene is so beautifully considered and with extensive use of extreme depth of field cinematography an absolutely joy to your eyes. For this alone I'd recommend seeing the film, it's visually stunning.With the actual story, there are elements of it that I found hard to watch and ultimately for me I felt more for Einar's wife Gerda which is a shame as most of their relationship is essentially fictitious. Vikander is absolutely brilliant in her role (her best to date in my opinion), immediately making you feel her side of the story and taking you along all the ups and downs of her relationship. The inclusion of Matthias Schoenaerts was an inspired selection and he brings a wonder air to the film, his fourth superb role in the last 12 months.Overall I found it an OK film and have to admit to being touched towards the end, but for me the casting of Redmayne made it a little harder to watch. I'm sure others wouldn't feel the same though so don't be put off by my thoughts on that front. Well worth a watch if you enjoy how great a film can look",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a bad film,"It was recommended to me by a friend of mine and I was skeptical at first. I did convince myself to watch it and overall I like it.

Vikander is excellent as well. She is a great actress and this movie only confirms it. I would agree with some reviews here that say she outperforms Redmayne - she is simply so good!It did feel boring and slow at times but probably it is just me as I do get bored quite easily.Definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Nice Looking Film That Doesn't Really Know What It's About,"The Danish Girl is one of the films that immediately comes off as Oscar bait. You have the true, emotional and relevant story that has very good actors that relies on their acting abilities. The Danish Girl, whilst it is Oscar bait, still works as solid movie on it's own. The performances were all really well done with Alicia Vikander winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for it (even though I still think she was better that year in one of my all time favourite films, Ex Machina). The period design looked really nice and had some very good landscaping shots, almost as if it's like the landscapes Einar Wagner paints. The costumes are great with making Eddie Redmayne actually look like a convincing woman. But the story falls a bit flat when it brings up the issues that it's about. The first transgender reassignment operation. The film doesn't portray the transgender-ism as what it is. Someone who thinks or knows they were born the wrong gender and that want to change that. The film represents transgender-ism as a split personality disorder with Einar Wagner constantly referring to Lili Elbe (his female personality) as a completely different person. The film also has a very slow pace which doesn't work for character building or plot movement. The characters feel a bit bland and all the characters that matter apart from the main two don't actually show any signs of personality. The Danish Girl was better then I thought it would be but it still isn't really that good - 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Chapeau!,"The Danish Girl is masterful. I had not read the synopsis or any review of the film, so coming into it without background, I found it transporting. For me it was not a transgender question or a social stigma question, so it did not provoke in me a moral righteous reaction to how the subject was handled whether lightly or accurately or offensively to those who have different expectations. For me, the story is an intimate undramatised personal experience of a couple living a threatening and natural transformation. And the actors deliver flawlessly the maturity and honesty and will to find a form that is viable to their continuity. It is an example of how a couple undergoing critical challenges can hold itself by the qualities of real love, of adaptability and a surmounting commitment of being oneself. The film manages to impress on me the behavior of the two towards themselves and with each other, where they could have otherwise easily turned one against the other. This is a story of respect, of sensitizing with the soul, of riveting in nature. Produced with an aesthetic and at a pace that stirs a desire and pleasure in being.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The ballerina being unavailable, she asks her husband to dress as a woman. What the husband experiences is indescribable unless you have had some transvestite interests, but the point is that what he feels right there is life changing. For him, being dressed as a woman is what he loves, and he feels that he is a woman trapped in a man's body. A woman that he will call Lily.

This Danish is not worth the dough!,"Director Tom Hooper's period piece ""The Danish Girl"" is based on the courageous true story of Einar Wegener who was the first man to go under the knife to transform into a woman who became Lili Elle. Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne did a credible job in his or her transformation into the character or characters of Einar and Lili, but don't think it was Oscar-worthy. Alicia Vikander co-stars as Einar/Lili's conflicted but supporting wife Gerda Wegener. Alicia hit her wonderland earlier this year when she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance here. And Vikander's work was the highlight of the movie. What needs to be transformed a bit was Hooper's lackadaisical direction of the picture. Lucinda Coxon's screenplay was also not worth a danish doughnut. However, it should not discredit the courage that the real Lili went through. Nevertheless, I do not recommend a date with the movie ""The Danish Girl"". *** Average",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Against the grain,"The Danish Girl is directed by Tom Hooper who got a Best Director Oscar for The King's Speech.The film is adapted from a book which itself fictionalised events relating to the real Einer Wegener and Gerda, two artists living in Copenhagen in the 1920s who were also married to each other.When Gerda is let down by a female model she persuades Einer to wear female attire and pose for some paintings. This sets off a chain of events in Einer who begins to feel more feminine and creates a daring persona of Lili whose portraits sell very well.Gerda seems at first to be titillated by Einer's daring in wearing women's clothing but she then also is fearful as Lili attracts male attention. Over time Einer wants to become more female and Gerda attracts the attention of other suitors, especially Hans who also knew Einer as a child.The film is beautiful to look at with exquisite art direction, costumes and sets. There is a lot of location shooting as the film was shot in France, Denmark and Germany.Alicia Vikander who plays Gerda is the heart of the film but her motive oscillates too much from being encouraging, to be repulsed and then standing by her man despite the attentions of Hans wonderfully played by (Matthias Schoenaerts.)Eddie Redmayne is young and thin enough to pass off well in those scenes where he plays Lili and I am sure he practised posing and use of his hand and body gestures a lot to appear fragile as Lili.The film does feel like a mis-fire though, it feels rather starchy and well intentioned, even too conservative. Something never really hangs together in the film. I never got the feeling that Einar felt like someone who always felt he was in the wrong body which seems to be the common theme for people who take part in sex-change operations.I do not think it helps that is based very loosely in true events and more inspired by the fictional novel. It wants to be a period love story of a woman stoically supportive of her husband even if he takes for the time a novel and drastic steps for transformation surgery which leads to tragedy.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vikander (Gerda) carries the movie.,"I liked the movie, I like the movies that has strong messages and I truly appreciate biographies and this is an amazing and inspiring story of Lili aka Einar Wegener and Gerda Wegener. It's about the struggle of Eniar when he tries to embrace and find his true sexual identity while his wife, Gerda tries to help and preserve their marriage.Personally I think the supporting lead, Alicia Vikander(Gerda) who got an Oscar for it, carries the whole movie. I've found Eddie Redmayne (Lili) dull and simply plain. He could've make us feel the struggles of finding the sexuality in a more effective way considering it wasn't 21st century, it was 1920's. It was not common or normal. He seemed to be in Lili rather than Einar too like he never lived as Einar in his life.But the story is inspired by the true people, and their story is actually what the movie tells us. Costumes, hair and make up and production is on point. But I just think Eddie and the screenplay is a bit dull, it could've written in a more emotional way. They could've make something amazing with the story they had, but it ended up as a okay drama movie with a great pilot.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Danes,"Inspired by a 1920s Danish artist with gender dysphoria who became one of the first to ever opt for surgical gender realignment, this Tom Hooper drama offers an intriguing insight into a fairly recent time when such terms were unheard of. The central character's dilemma is, as a result, twice as interesting as he not only has to wrestle with his own identity but a lack of support and understanding. Promising as this might sound, and relatively convincing as lead actor Eddie Redmayne is in drag, his character is always self-absorbed with a near total disregard for his wife's feelings that renders him hard to relate to. Alicia Vikander fares better as the neglected wife in the equation with a more dynamic character arc as she gradually learns to accept that she needs to ""lose"" her husband for him to be happy; looks convey more than words in a memorable moment as she is told ""he won't be your husband"" after surgery. In fact, a more enticing film could have been spun from concentrating more on her. Something also feels amiss in how Vikander dressing Remayne as a woman (for a pose) is the event that triggers everything. We are later given a couple of anecdotes about him having similar feelings in the past, but it mostly feels that dressing up started it all - not deep-rooted inner doubts. Of course, there is a limit to how much can be fitted into a two hour feature, and with sterling cinematography and great music, plus accurate costumes and sets, 'The Danish Girl' does a decent job, even if it sometimes feels like it is only skimming the surface here.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful Movie Superb acting,"Watched with daughter after reading a short summary of Lili and Gerda. Amazing . This movie captivates the light and atmosphere of a time where post impressionism painted life as the movie depicts throughout its incredibly beautiful scenes, clothes and landscape shots. I could see through Renoir and Degas works as well as Klint. Lili's character story is portrayed in a delicate manner, showing enough detail for the viewer to understand the difficulties of two individuals with more avant garde than some people today . fortunately for the pair , they lived among the wealthy and arty crowd that could tolerate such scandal . The movie is a reminder of our limited attitudes to gender diversity which by the way , have only been endorsed in the Western world for less than a century.

That Danish Girl was not very nice,"A lot of people have found this film ""cold"" and difficult to emote with. I am surprised. I suspect you just fell for the wrong Danish Girl! The impact I felt was strong, deep and lasting. On the one hand, I did not like one of the Danish gals one bit and could not care a jot about his/her gender struggles. Eddie Redmayne's Einar Wegener is quite the most egocentric, demanding and selfish person whose disregard for the true affection of his partner has a truly chilling effect on both the film and the viewer. Visually, the project is gorgeous and lyrical and the costuming simply brilliant. Redmayne, too, offers a strained, stylized performance that persuades me of his determination to get what he/she wants. It is Vikander, however, who holds the heart of the film firmly in her grasp and without whom the story would probably collapse. This is a love story, alright, Gerda's with Einar and Einar's with both his selves.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Alisha Vikinder is amazing as the wife- her acceptance of her husbands condition is so well shown, her love for him and willingness to help is so evident, and then her frustrations with the course things take. Hers is an amazing performance. Eddie Redmayne is an actor who is willing to take chances and he took one with this role - he is amazing and so believable.

Wow this movie is overrated. I feel cheated,"I will begin by saying that I'm still debating whether I should give this movie 1 star to make up for all those high rated reviews.As someone else stated in the comments, Eddie's character is so poorly researched, it's almost insulting to the trans community, I may not know a lot about this, but one does not dress in a costume as a favor and then identify themselves as another gender overnight... sure, the story wants to offer more background into this but fails to do to so at a satisfactory level. The main character comes across more likely to suffer from multiple personality disorder than being trans, and considering some less enlightened viewers still confuse sexual identity for pathology, this may be one of the most epic movie fails I have seen in years.I should also add that the acting feels forced in some scenes, but that's mainly because many of those scenes are cliché so the actors don't have much to work with...... but man, if you've seen 10 movies in the past decade, the not-subtle-at-all foreshadowing will surely let you know how it ends.

This movie is much better than its rating would indicate.,"The Danish Girl (2015) was directed by Tom Hooper. This film is loosely based on the life of Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), a Danish artist who realized that he was a woman trapped in a man's body. That's not a strange concept now, but in the 1920's it was considered not only strange, but psychotic. Eventually, Einar becomes Lili Elbe, and she considers having the pioneering surgery for a sex-role change. Again, hardly shocking now, but the surgery had never been performed before.Alicia Vikander plays Einar's wife, Gerda Wegener, who is naturally confused and horrified as her husband turns into Lili. After a while, she accepts that her husband really is Lili. In fact, Gerda supports Lili through this extraordinarily challenging time,Both of the lead actors do superb work. The film would fail without two solid performances in these two parts. In addition, the remainder of the cast is excellent.The film is filled with gorgeous images of Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden. That positive aspect of the movie is also a negative aspect. Director Hooper wants us to know where we are. So, when we are in Copenhagen, we get endless views of the waterfront market. The women at the market stalls all wear hats made of folded newspaper. After the sixth or seventh establishing shot, I wanted to call out, ""OK--we understand. Market. Hats. This is Copenhagen.""When we get to Paris, Hooper actually makes sure that we see the Eiffel Tower. ""OK--got it. This is Paris."" He doesn't do as well with Dresden. Still, there's on market and no Eiffel Tower, so it had to be Dresden.As I write this review ""The Danish Girl"" has an abysmal IMDb rating of 6.4. Almost as many people rated it ""1"" as rated it ""10."" It's a much better film than 6.4. My guess is that some of the people who gave it a low rating did so because they are uncomfortable with the depiction of transgender people. My suggestion to you--find ""The Danish Girl"" and watch it. Don't let the low rating cause you to miss this important movie.We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It should work almost as well on the small screen.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good but....,"I just want to add one thing to these reviews.

Sensational Redmayne ~ could a second  Oscar be in the offing?,"Image poster The Danish Girl -- features Versatile British actor Eddie Redmayne's followup to last years Best Actor Oscar as wheelchair bound Cambridge genius Stephen Hawking -- could a second consecutive Oscar be in the offing?A competition entry at Venice 2015 ""The Danish Girl"" was co-directed by 46 year old Englishman Tom Hooper (The King's Speech, 2010) and Swedish veteran Lasse Hallström, 69 (My Life as a Dog) -- British actor Eddie Redmayne's follow-up to his 2014 Best Actor Oscar as crippled British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"" was a hot ticket on the Lido this year. This time around Eddie portrays a man who became a woman in the first sex change operation of the twentieth century. Redmayne (33) plays a boy who literally becomes a girl! ~~ to wit, a well known Danish artist of the era, male, who underwent genital surgery in the early 1900s to become a woman -- preceding the American transsexual celebrity of Christine Jorgenson by half a century. Given the sexual confusion now rampant in the so- called ""advanced"" Western Democracies this one is destined to become a gay cult classic if nothing else ...The Plot centers in the disturbed marriage of Danish artist Gerda Wegener and her sexually confused husband Einar. In a painting of hers for which she has Einar posing in drag she portrays Him as a woman which arouses his suppressed feminine feelings to the point where he starts to cross dress and see himself as a woman -- a good looking one at that. The transformation is so intense that he renames himself Lili Elbe, from where the next inevitable step is sex change surgery -- putting his male life on the line as such an operation was seen as quite dangerous at the time.Both Redmayne and his wife in the film, new face Alicia Vikander, 26, from Sweden, are superb. Classy pastel shaded photography provides perfect support for the period feeling. Exquisite sets and decor. The central subject aside from the obvious gender transformation is the search for self and marital fidelity in the face of an impossible marital situation. Vikander as a truly devoted wife stands by him and supports him all during his painful reassessment of self and final decision to go through with a dangerous operation to resolve his/her identity dilemma. Great psychodrama, great everything ~~ a strong candidate for the Golden Lion here and other awards everywhere. Not to be missed if and when it comes your way",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Highly topical and reasonably interesting,"Copenhagen, Denmark, 1926. Einar Wegener (played by Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) are a happily married couple. Both are artists, he preferring landscapes and she portraits. One day he poses for a portrait of hers while dressed as a woman. This is initially done as a lark, as is his later attendance at a party dressed as a woman. However, Einar soon discovers that he enjoys dressing as a woman and over time prefers being Lili, the female version of himself, to Einar. At first he an Gerda try to have his situation ""cured"" but this leads nowhere (other than to many doctors trying to have him locked up as a pervert and/or lunatic). His voyage of self-discovery will ultimately lead to him undergoing the first ever sex-change operation.Very well timed, in terms of when this movie was made. Transgender rights are a controversial current topic and this movie covers the subject well. Sensitively made, it shows how people like Einar Wegener were treated by the medical profession and society in general, and thus how revolutionary, yet inevitable, his decision was.For these reasons, quite interesting from an historic and social perspective.Does take a while to get going though. The first 75% or so is quite slow-moving and feels like preamble (which it is, ultimately). Once he first undergoes the treatment, then it gets quite interesting. We see the impact on his relationships and on his/her outlook on life. The last 25% or so makes the film worth watching.Can't fault the cast at all. I can't imagine anyone other than Eddie Redmayne playing the role of Einar Wegener/Lili - well cast and he is incredibly convincing. Well deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination.Alicia Vikander shines as Gerda and deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar.Even Amber Heard, who I thought may be out of her element in a serious drama, does well in her role.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Story Telling and Acting on a challenging subject matter,"The movie does a good job of telling the story. It was interesting as a period piece and a love story. The struggle of self discovery during a time when there are no others, no awareness and no language to express the feelings of being in body for which the gender is in congruent with ones feelings is compelling and I believe authentic. I found the acting to be excellent. Some are unhappy with the portrayal but often people are critical of portrayals when they experience them in a different time and environment. I found the struggle and the love of these people heart breaking, touching and warm. Watch it without expectation, have an open mind and an open heart. Then go read about the real life characters this movie is based upon.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Worthy In Award Season But Rather Sullen  And Instantly Forgettable,"You can understand the timing of this film's release . Get it in to the cinemas before a certain date and it qualifies for Oscars . On top of that being a recent release it'll be fresh when peoples minds when they cast their votes . With a weighty topic involving a true life story , good performances and other technical merits you can see what the producers of TDG are hoping for but to be honest it's a rather cold uninvolving film that doesn't really seem to exist except as Oscar baitYou'll probably know the premise before going to see the film and if not then both the posters and trailers will fill you in as to the basic story . Eddie Redmayne plays Einer Wegener and Alicia Vikander plays his wife Gerda . Something is not quite right with Einer and it's not just his constant infectious smile . When Henrik played by Ben Wishaw turns up the central idea of the movie is ripe for some cruel black comedyAh now I know what's wrong with TDG - it sinks under its own self importance . From the limited amount of Danish films I've seen there seems to be a competition as to make the most depressing film possible where audiences crawl lemming like to the cinema and transform in to grief whores . Tom Hooper realising the story is rather uncinematic uses some arty shots and the performances are fine and probably touches on the point that in a sexual relationship people have an irrational desire to be martyrs for one another but like Hooper's THE KINGS SPEECH the material would be perfectly suited to a television screen or even the theatre but lacks the scope to be true cinema . It also lacks the charm that THE KINGS SPEECH had and that's got to be judged a fundamental failure",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good acting but not much else,"This film portrays some good acting from its two leads. Eddie Redmayne in particular inhabits the role of a confused man who transitions into a woman in an unprecedented surgery. The rest of the film wasn't so great.

"Incredible acting, briefly touching upon an important topic","Disclaimer : I saw this film after having read scathing reviews, and thought it to be better than portrayed.This film tells the story of a married couple during 1930's Copenhagen as Einar struggles to come to terms with and adjust to the revelation that he is, in fact, a women. Eddie Redmayne shines as the trans gender Lili Elbe, fully capturing the mannerisms and peculiarities of women. Likewise, Alicia Vikander gives an emotional performance as a suffering wife, Gerda Wegener. A particular scene whereby Lili is assaulted whilst in Paris, was a very poignant moment.My faults with this film isn't with the acting ability of the two stars. It is the with the quality and accuracy of the script that they had to work with. Some scenes stretch out far too long, leaving the viewer wishing the time would pass faster. Also, the accuracy of the events portrayed is not as water-tight as I would like, as certain details about Gerda's art and profession where skipped over, along with the glaring differences in age. The largest omission is the details about the physical transition that Lili underwent.However, these pale into inconsideration, with a film that left me speechless when the end credits rolled up. Worthy Oscar nominations for both Redmanye and Vikander whose chemistry and performances where spell-binding.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well made although sugary adaptation,"A decent movie of a difficult subject. The acting is excellent all round, Tom Hooper's direction is The King's Speech good instead of Cats bad. Copenhagen looks wonderful in the post WW1 era.The problem lies with the plot and the relationship between husband and wife, it's just not that heart wrenching to see them fall apart.Also little inconsistencies like 4 operations were undertaken not 2, the effect and afterlife of the wife post divorce.It's OK not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A present reality from a past prospect,"I only decided to write this review because of the several comments about not understanding the movie, that I saw after watching it. It's only my opinion, but I thing this movie isn't rated according to it's quality. Transgender it's now a reality, in many countries it is now legal to change gender. About 50 years ago or whatsoever, I wasn't born and I can't say how things were, but considering history it certainly wasn't even predicted in the law and wouldn't be easily accepted in society. What we see with The Danish Girl is probably the first case reported where the person that didn't feel she was in the correct body had the courage and the support to try and change that! Some people say that there are parts in the movie they don't understand how the character could be seen as a woman...well I think this is a bit of a detail and apart from movie opinions and more about life opinions, there are several people that I have wondered about their gender, so I guess this isn't the main question. For me.. what I saw was an interesting story where Alicia Vikander's performance really touch me. I have never seen any situation like this, but one of her lines, when she is talking to Lily and says ""I need to see my husband"", that really got to me and showed how difficult this process must be for everyone involved, the person in question and everyone who loves them. So overall the story line is interesting, Alcia Vikander totally makes it worth and I really believe it's a good way to bring attention for transgender reality. Of course if you don't care for these things, it's not the movie for you. Is it the best movie of the season? I don't think so, but if you do like movies about people then it will be two interesting hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Redmayne and Vikander deliver incredible performances,"There's no denying 'The Danish Girl' is carried by the two lead actors. It's on OK script dealing with an interesting subject but these two, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, delivering the performances they did certainly helped the watch-ability factor. The subject of transgender people isn't always an easy one to understand or deal with and I suspect people who didn't like the film likely fall into the category of finding it an uncomfortable watch. The main reason it's uncomfortable is because Redmayne is so damn good. The man can act, there's simply no denying that.Getting one Oscar worthy performance in a film is an accomplishment, two though is astonishing. Both Redmayne and Vikander have been nominated for Academy Awards, Redmayne in a Lead Role, Vikander in a Supporting Role (the latter's category being quite contentious considering she had more screen time than Redmayne did). The scary fact is that they're both good enough to win too, or at least they would be if a certain man called Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in the running. DiCaprio has the award locked up sadly, but I truly believe Redmayne was better in his actual acting performance. DiCaprio is getting the award for the sacrifices he made for his role and the commitment it took. However, if you took two average movie viewers and gave them no background about either actor and asked them which performance they found better, I think a very high percentage would pick Redmayne. He won last year with an incredible performance and deserved to do so again this year in my opinion.Vikander on the other hand I suspect will win, and deservedly so. This was the first film I had ever seen her in and she blew me away. Her presence on screen was immense and her performance showed all the layers of a truly great actress. The only thing marring her nomination is whether she should be in the Supporting Actress category or not. I would have to agree she probably should not have been. I kept thinking to myself she must somehow exit this film halfway through in order for it to classify as 'Supporting'. However she did not and while I hate to take away from an undoubtedly great performance, it is hard for others in the category to compete when they are getting much less screen time.The film wasn't nominated for Best Picture despite being right up the alley for that type of nod. The story isn't entirely fact based and is more a work of fiction based on true characters, which may have hurt it. It also, as previously mentioned, isn't the easiest subject for everyone to stomach. All things aside though I'd have to say I enjoyed it a lot more than a few other films that did get a Best Picture nod. No one's complaining too much that it's not there it seems, but make no mistake, it's a fine film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

While it is only loosely based on two people and I am not an expert on them, I cannot comment on how much creative freedom was taken on certain things. But this is a movie and it does have that vibe and feeling to it. Not to mention a really nice flow to the story.

"An important biopic, but not inspiring.","Before this film hitting the screens, I remember many experts were expecting it doing well at the Oscars. Now it's got 4 Oscar nods, even though it is very sad the movie is a hit and miss. A slipped away opportunity, had a great storyline, but the outcome was decent. An important historical biopic, at least for a certain section of the audience. I respect that, but it did not impress me as I anticipated.From the Academy Award winning director for the movie 'The King's Speech', and the last year's winner for a lead role, Eddie Reddmayne together did not deliver the expected masterpiece. But Alicia Vikander was so good, another brilliant co-female-star display just like Felicity Jones from Eddie's previous movie 'The Theory of Everything'. If I were a jury I would definitely give the supporting actress award to her, that's the result I'm hoping for in the next Sunday.The actor did a hard work for the title role, in the many scenes he mastered it, but that's where I slightly disappointed. I felt his character was a little intense, maybe I'm not getting him because I'm straight. The locations, costumes, even the direction and music were good. Both the lead actors kind looks alike, no doubt on the casting, but it only should have been a bit better in exhibiting story.Maybe the pace should have been a little quicker as well as some sentimentally appealing scenes would have done good. I desperate to give more marks, but I can't go beyond this. I won't consider it a bad flick, what I meant was a missed opportunity to be a masterpiece.

Boring,"Boring, boring, boring. If the only thing you want to see is Eddie Redmayne repeatedly dressing up in women's clothes, and portraying him/her in a a single repetitive way (that means putting a wig and a dress on Eddie, and when another character looks at him, cut to a close-up, have him look down with his eyes closed, open them, look up at them with his head still down, slightly cocked to the side, then have him sheepishly smile then this flick's for you. Gosh, that must have been done like 40 times, and they nominated him for an academy award for that). Otherwise, the characters are shallow, and there is no attempt to get to understand his desire to become a woman other than a superficial, quickly told set of occurrences and examples. Even the technical/medical aspects of his outcome is only glanced over inaccurately. 2 Hrs I'll never get back. Stay away! Save yourselves!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredibly disappointing,"This is an extremely disappointing film, simply because it had the potential to be something so impressive. It's not a terrible movie, and the direction, production design and one of the lead performances are all great, but it really falls short of what it's trying to accomplish time and time again: an emotionally powerful and engrossing story.Before I get into that, let's start on the bright side. The best part of this film, by a long way, is how it looks. With excellent attention to detail in the sets and costumes, it's at least a really nice film to look at. Meanwhile, Tom Hooper's direction is at its best since The Damned United.One thing that he does extremely well is bring the camera in really close to the actors' faces to give a clearer image of their emotions, and as such make a scene more emotionally powerful. Whilst it's arguable that he did this to an excessive extent in The King's Speech and Les Misérables, it's not overdone in The Danish Girl, and it does help to bring a little bit more emotion to the table when the story completely lacks it (I'll get onto that in a moment).Now, the performances. Eddie Redmayne is the one that everyone is talking about for this film, but I didn't think he was all that great. It's not a bad performance, but I really felt he went a bit over-the-top with all of the facial tics and extreme wide-eyedness of his character, which really got on my nerves as the film went on, and consequently lessened my emotional connection to his character significantly.In fact, Redmayne is completely outshone in The Danish Girl by his co-star, Alicia Vikander, who plays his wife; she is excellent. Her performance is hugely calm throughout, and because of that, I felt so much more able to empathise with and care for her character, and so the majority of the emotional impact of this film came from her, and not the main character who we're meant to really connect with.Now, let's talk about what makes this film such a disappointment: its extreme lack of emotional power. As the film went on, I could tell that this was really trying hard to be a proper tearjerker, and why not? It's the story of a man who begins to question everything about himself, and begins to turn his and his wife's life completely upside down.However, it really doesn't work. As I said, Hooper's direction and Vikander's performance lend some degree of emotion to the film, but it still isn't impacting enough.I think the major reason for this is that the film attempts to do too much too quickly. Surprisingly, this isn't that slow-moving a film, but that's unfortunately to its detriment. The whole first act is all about this man suffering extreme confusion as he begins to question who he is, and whilst that should be the focus of the whole film, it feels rushed and therefore shallow.Meanwhile, there are at least eleven 'moments' where something really big and influential happens in the characters' lives. Now, a few of these are fine, but when there are so may apparently integral moments, most of which come way before the finale, they really lose their power, and that's the main reason why this film ultimately just doesn't work.I don't want to completely hate on The Danish Girl, because it's not an awful film, and its visuals and Vikander's performance are undoubtedly excellent. However, there was such huge potential for an emotional roller-coaster of a story here, yet it completely failed to deliver, and that's what's most disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Electrifying,"First off, let me just address one of the biggest issues people have with the film. That Einar, the transgender woman is played by Eddie Redmayne, who is cisgender - which means someone who conforms their gender to the sex they were born with. (Male/female is the sex, defined by the organs you are born with. Being a man/woman is a social construct which identifies your gender). So Redmayne identifies as a man, which corresponds to him being a male, while Einar, is a male who identifies as a woman (who is trapped inside).So, at first I did not really have an issue with Redmayne portraying this character. However, I thought about how Asian characters are often played by Westerners, and that made me rethink my opinion. It would have been politically correct to have an actual transgender woman play the character, but having said that, Redmayne does a terrific job. To me anyway.His performance, is in one word, electrifying. The intense rawness of his character's emotions transcends the screen. Especially the way he moves his hands and positions his body to mimic that of other female characters gives me the chills. He has a wide smile which is sometimes awkward, but can also be quite charming. As the character of Lily becomes more confident, more of her personality comes out. Vikander as well, does great in her role. She embraced her character and it is through her that makes the film more emotional.The visuals, from the costumes and the color hints, all aided in creating this historic feel of the movie. Because of the nature of the characters' work, the film itself mirrored that and presented itself like paintings too. Costumes and make-up bring characters to life, and the great cinematography brings the narrative to life. Tom Hooper and Danny Cohen do a great job with both intimate close-ups, and wide landscape shots. Always knowing when to use one or the other.Though this is based on a true story, the romance drama may be a Hollywood addition. That I'm not too keen on. It seems as though Hollywood adds drama to everything, and that makes it a little repetitive and boring. A little more insight into the mind of Einar would have added more depth to the character and the film.Overall, an amazing film with great mise-en-scene, and electrifying portrayals by Redmayne and Vikander.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

It does however capture the essence of the times (1920s Europe) of how society viewed this and the utter lack of knowledge of the medical establishment at the time.

"I'm Eating a Danish, Girl","A well-intentioned and certainly topical film that's prevented from being better than it could be by Tom Hooper's relentless commitment to being a boring director.Eddie Redmayne acts up a storm as a Danish painter who begins to experiment with impersonating a woman as a kind of game between he and his wife (Alicia Vikander) until he realizes that the game has awoken something dormant in him and he decides to live his life as a woman, complete with a physical transformation at a time when such a thing was extremely dangerous to attempt.Vikander won an Oscar for playing one of the Academy's favorite character types -- the nobly suffering wife, and in this case, the most understanding spouse in the history of civilization. Redmayne also received an Oscar nomination, as did the film's handsome production design and costumes.The acting is good enough and the material compelling enough on its own to engage its audience's interest, but it can't dust off the patina of tasteful masterpiece theatre that Hooper is determined to apply to it.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Anatomy of transgenderism at its first venturesome and failed efforts - Was it worth it?,"First of all, it's a beautiful picture all the way with amazing wonder of pictorial qualified aestheticism which is sustained throughout, masking the very debatable and to some disgusting plot in merciful and seducing perfume. Especially the music by Alexandre Desplat works miracles about this - he always seems to do that and has elevated the quality of many films that way, especially art films. This is above all an art film and should not be ignored as such. After six years of marriage an artist finds himself in a typical artist's crisis and finds a peculiar way out of it - by transcending into a woman. Eddie Redmayne does not make a bad job of it but actually makes a more impressing performance than the Oscar-winner in what must be recognized as one of the most difficult and sensitive performances imaginable. It's actually difficult to think that anyone would willingly venture into such a minefield.And does the transgender operation solve his problem? Of course not, and that's the disappointing conclusion of the film. Anyone should have known that from the start, and especially the artist. I have met many transgender people in my days, and not one was convincing - the old sex shone garishly through in every case. I am not saying that it must fail, but violating nature is never a good idea.Nevertheless, it remains a very beautiful film, for the music and the scenery and couldn't have been made better.

Moves at a glacial pace,"Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, and Amber Heard act as the three leads in the biographical drama titled ""The Danish Girl,"" which was directed by Tom Hooper. The film is based on the real events that occurred in the life of Lili Elbe, who was one of the first known patients to have gender reassignment surgery. The film also focuses on the connection that Lili Elbe had with her wife, Gerda (Alexander Vikander).Both Redmayne and Vikander are fantastic in their roles; Redmayne gives a delicate and nuanced performance as Lili, while Vikander is just as great as Gerda. In addition, the supporting ensemble, which includes Matthias Schoenaerts and Ben Whishaw, gives strong performances. Both the cinematography, which was done by Danny Cohen, and the soundtrack, which was done by Alexandre Desplat, are stunning.The story of the movie, on the other hand, moves at a glacial pace and, at times, comes out as needlessly theatrical. The book by David Ebershoff with the same name serves as the inspiration for the screenplay that was written by Lucinda Coxon, but the script fails to adequately convey the nuances and feelings that are inherent in the connection between Lili and Gerda.In general, The Danish Girl is a well-acted picture with stunning photography; but, the film's sluggish tempo and overly dramatic storyline hinder it from realising its full potential. Fans of Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander may find their performances entertaining, but viewers hoping for a picture with more layers of complexity and a stronger emotional impact may be let down by this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
To the point,"Was not sure how I was going to react to this movie as the subject matter was not something that has ever occurred in my thoughts so I went in hoping to gain some education and enjoy a movie,,and here's what happened..At first I should say the cinematography and direction was flawless and made this more of a journey than a story. I was never too sure about Redmaynes acting...he was good in Theory but awful in jupiter,,,so am still on the fence with that one....saying that it was a remarkable performance but somehow left me cold and somewhat uninterested in his story...which I think may have been deliberate...as it was not so much about a sex change but more about how they at the time judged the actions of a man who dare even consider something that may have put him in a straight jacket in a padded cell for the rest of his life.For me the credits all go to Alicia Vikander as his wife turned mentor ...she was absolutely exceptional and made every scene her own..she was more the lead to Redmaynes supporting role.Never was going to be a classic but gives us an insight into how we thought at the time and represents true love between people who will sacrifice all to help others. May come across to some people as cold and too rigid but that was meant to take the romance out of a very serious story. I may also add that the scene where she first finds him with feminine clothing on was probably the most erotic I have ever seen an actress portray .",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful movie carried by two talented actors !,"For once, I fully agree with the Academy's decision to nominate both Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander for their roles. Individually they are both talented young actors (who can forget Redmayne in The Theory of Everything and Vikander in Deus Ex Machina ?), but here they managed to show real chemistry on screen and, as a result, watching those two interact with each other is a real treat! They form a really cute couple!The subject matter is a complicated one and overall The Danish Girl is a drama, but there's also a romance there, and overall I felt that the tone of the movie was quite uplifting and not overly dramatic, contrary to a lot of Oscar's contenders. Much of this has to do - I think - with the subtle yet powerful way the two main actors deliver their lines and show their emotions. The rest of the cast does a great job of supporting them, especially Matthias Schoenaerts and Ben Whishaw.It's hard not to notice the parallel between Gerda and Einar's job as painters and the cinematography : lots of scenes seem to be taken from a painting. Or is it the other way around ? I thought it was a really nice touch and helped give the film a unique visual identity.The fact that parts of the movie were shot in Brussels, in places I love (the Royal Galleries and Park, the famous ""A La Mort Subite"" café) probably made me appreciate this movie more than I would normally, but still, this is an excellent, beautiful movie that I wholeheartedly recommend! 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'I think Lily's thoughts, I dream her dreams. She was always there.'","Transgender issues are finally being discussed and studied at length, and while we have no idea how widespread the numbers of people born in the wrong sexual receptacles is, it really makes no difference. This film is about the first trans gender reassignment surgery and that aspect works very well as a treatise on etiology and progress of the initial surgical candidate, but the film is more than that; this is a very powerful love story and therein lies its significance. It demonstrates the power and need for finding true, unconditional love. Based on a true story as written by David Ebershoff and adapted for the screen by Lucinda Coxon and direct with tremendous sensitivity by Tom Hooper, the true reason the film works so well is the quality of acting by the two lead characters and their supporting cast.The setting is Copenhagen in 1926 (introduced by stunningly beautiful landscape photography which will be reflected in the main characters paintings). Danish artist, Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), painted her own artist husband, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), as a lady in her painting. When the painting gained popularity, Einar started to change his appearance into a female appearance and named himself Lili Elbe. With his feminism passion and Gerda's support, Einar - or Elbe - attempted one of the first male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, a decision that turned into a massive change for their marriage, that Gerda realized her own husband is no longer a man or the person she married before. After a brief romantic dalliance with the handsome Henrik (Ben Whishaw), a childhood friend of Einar, art-dealer Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts), shows up and starts a complex love triangle with the couple. We are privy to the medical workup both by the dubious Dr. Hexler (Pip Torrens) and the genteel surgeon Dr Warenekros (Sebastian Koch) and the manner in which the surgeries proceed.But the most important sense we gain from this long movie is the strength of character of both Gerda and Einear/Lili as played with consummate skill By Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne. The always-reliable Alexandre Desplat supplies the musical score and Danny Cohen the cinematography. Eloquent and memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Absolutely beautiful...,"I found this movie to be absolutely beautiful and fascinating, and I have no shame in saying that it is one of my favorites. The actors did an amazing job in acting out their roles, honestly no other actor could have done it as well. The way the movie was directed and filmed, the soundtrack, and the somber tone glued this movie together and made it into something that I could watch every day and still find incredible. I do not understand the hate that this movie gets; what does it matter if a trans did not play the lead role? Making a movie about a war veteran doesn't mean that the character has to actually be an army retiree.

Beautifully acted story of first transgender female,"Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl tells the story of one of the first transgender females, at least one of the first, if not THE first one to undergo the sex change surgery. Set in 1926, the sets are very well designed and accurate to the time period. The makeup used in the film is fantastic, very beautiful classic style of makeup, the makeup has to be good for a film of this kind, it just has to be. The sequence where Einer is putting on his makeup for the first time is breathtaking visually and very well done. I loved the costume design for each individual character, especially lili. The costumes that lili wore suited her so very well and she looked absolutely beautiful in all of them. And Alicia Vikander looks great in both her makeup and tee various costumes. Now we get to the best part of the entire film, and that is the performances by the actors. We'll start with the academy award winning performance given by Alicia Vikander. Vikander gives a truly moving, deep performance that is rooted in love and rife with strong emotion throughout. Her character goes through a lot as you can imagine. Eddie Redmayne is such a marvelous actor! He plays both Einer and lili sooo well. The way in which he behaves, talks and behaves as lili is so skilled and natural, you never feel like you're watching Eddie act, it feels real. There are a couple of scenes I would like to recognize because they were so needed and crucial to this film. One scene is where Einer is nude in front of a mirror and he tucks his penis in between his legs and it looks like he now has a vulva, this is a crucial scene that HAD to be included, it showcase his character's journey to self discovery. Another is Einer visiting a peep show to see a nude woman and see how she moves and examine/mimic her mannerisms, another scene showcasing self discovery. I feel the ending was handled fairly well, no complaints about that. Moving, well acted, visually great looking and important story. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something about this film just didn't click for me,"I think the story portrayed in The Danish Girl is a very important one and this film could have been great, but the execution wasn't there.My main problem is that I just couldn't connect with Redmayne's performance. I think he is a good actor and undoubtedly has some great performances under his belt, but this role just wasn't for him. There was criticism of this film that a cisgender man was playing the role of a transwoman and I can't help but agree with that criticism. I think was film warranted, and Lili was owed in all honesty, a transwoman to play the role and to bring her personal experiences to the part. The whole thing would have felt more real, more authentic, and more powerful if this were the case.Alicia Vikander's performance was very powerful, tender, sympathetic and completely stole the show. I can't help but think this is the big problem with this film. This was Lili's story and I felt myself connecting and sympathising more with her wife than with her. I can't help but think a disservice was done to Lili in this respect. But this isn't the fault of Alicia Vikander, and quite frankly I think the film is worth watching for her performance alone.Aside from the obvious casting issue, I thought the film was a little too slow and ponderous at times. The first half was much stronger and the film started to lose something in its second hour.I also don't think the dialogue was explorative enough. Considering the subject matter there was a lot more that could have been explored and developed. I'm not sure we got enough of an insight into Lili's feelings from her perspective and didn't get into what it really feels like to be transgender. I was left wanting in this aspect, everything felt very surface level. To return to the point, I feel like casting a transwoman in the part of Lili could have rectified this issue.Despite all of this, there are strengths to this film. I think it had a certain amount of beauty, in the relationship between Lili and Gerda, in the score, in the overall tone and style. But I was expecting a lot more and the emotion of this film didn't come through as strongly as it should have done.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Life's Changes,"This is my review of The Danish Girl (spoiler free).Cast: Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne*, Academy Award nominee Alicia Vikander** and Ben Whishaw.Plot: Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) are both painters trying to find their way in the world, but when Einar figures out who he really is he then goes through difficult but life changing choices.This film is a biography set in Copenhagen, Denmark in the 1920s and takes place over a few months with husband and wife Einar and Gerda Wegener, this film will make you laugh and also make you cry because of the difficult changes being made throughout. Let me go through some points on why I think this film is good:Performances: The performances in this film were exceptional and might I even say Oscar-worthy, when the film you don't see them even stutter a single and it looks they understood their roles very. Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander's performances were the ones that shone the brightest.Scripting: This is a minor point the script was good but it could have been better there were few missing lines I felt and a plot hole, wasn't big but but you know it's there but other than that pretty good.Costume Design: The costume design really set the tone for the film the costumes were made as if taken from the 1920s. It's as if I felt like I was in the 1920s (specifically 1926) the costume designer made for the clothing.All in all I think this is a really good and well performed period drama that could really make an impact at the awards this year. 8/10 a must watch.* Best performance by a leading Actor, Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything, 2014), ** Best performance by a leading actress, Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl, 2015).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Interesting...,"""The Danish Girl"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the story of Lili Elbe, one of the first people to undergo gender-affirming surgery, and the emotional journey she faces in her quest to live as her true self.I found this movie very interesting because I didn't know the story before watching it and I also enjoyed how it beautifully portrayed the struggles of gender identity and acceptance in early 20th-century Europe. The interpretation of Eddie Redmayne who played as Lili Elbe was exceptional, powerful and he succeeded on capturing the inner turmoil and courage required to embrace her identity in a world that didn't understand her. In addition, the interpretation of Alicia Vikander who played as Gerda was very good and equally moving. The cinematography and costume design were exquisite and added a layer of elegance. Finally, I have to say that ""The Danish Girl"" is an interesting movie with a visually stunning and heartfelt exploration of identity and love so, I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An inspiring journey of self-discovery for two,"The Danish Girl tells the story of Lili Elbe. She was born as Einar Wegener, a Danish artist married with Gerda, living a normal life until the moment she wears a dress and poses as a female model. That's when Lili emerges, an inner voice that becomes stronger by the day.One shouldn't expect a biography, as there are plenty of historical inaccuracies, the movie is based on the power of its message that moves you and inspires you.Just like in Tom Hooper's most famous movie, the Oscar-winning The King's Speech, the main character's struggle doesn't involve overcoming external obstacles. Instead, it comes deep from their own selves, their own nature and that makes it more relatable and effective.And in both cases it's hard to imagine them embarking on this challenging journey of self-discovery without their extremely loyal companions. One difference is that Gerda's character, unlike Lionel, has an arc of her own and covers a distance almost as large as Lili undergoing a massive transformation - not literal of course.The Danish Girl benefits from two phenomenal performances by the two leads, as they perfectly capture the aforementioned transformations of their characters.The other major asset of the movie is its looks. The costumes, the period details, the colours, the scenery, the way they made Lili look gradually more feminine, it all results in a work of stunning beauty reminiscent of a painting. It offers many memorable images, such as the two series of identical houses or Lili watching the ballet dancer or visiting a strip show or looking herself in the mirror.The music score is on point, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Award season release is thought provoking if not an Oscar winner,The Danish Girl is the first cinema release I have seen in 2016 and as ever at this time of year is classic Oscar bait. Directed by Tom Hooper who helmed The King's Speech and starring Eddie Redmayne who wooed the Academy in 2015 for his performance in The Theory Of Everything.It is a semi-biographical account of early 21st Century transgenderism in a Danish artist Einar Wegener. Wegener (Redmayne) is said artist who begins the film as the more successful artist married to co-artist Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander). However the story soon descends into the story of his transgenderism into altar ego Lili Elba (as in the river). Throughout Gerda provides support to her husband with his inner struggles that result ultimately in surgical intervention and the death of Einar or Lili. Features a small role by Ben Whishaw as a homosexual artist Henrik. Whishaw is the modern day Michael Caine. He seems to be in every new film I see! The film has received mixed reviews. Not an Oscar winner in my opinion but thought provoking none the less. (3/1/2016),7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A moving portrait.,"Just as fine are Hooper and Cinematographer Danny Cohen (The King's Speech, Les Miserables) picturesque frames. Whitewashed walls, striking European landscapes, countryside murals, and even still paintings of Lily somehow look that much more gorgeous in the eyes of the creative duo. The colour palate grows nearing the end of the final act, yet the proceeding effect is anything but additive. My disappointment is not so much with the continually popping images as it is with a handful of Coxon's safe and opaque decisions by the end of the second and entire third act. A more immersive perspective during Lily's visits to several certified doctors with armchair diagnostics would have added the desired ounce of energy absent in the rushed montage effect, and never really delving into the apparent hopelessness of a male wanting to abandon his gender privileges in the 1920s. And although the conclusion was perhaps a tad too sappy, maintaining a positive outlook could help ensure films of transgender issues maintain an important longevity in Hollywood's shrinkingly phallic hills.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2016/01/07/the-danish-girl-review-indie-adam/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Delicate, amazing performances; love breaks your heart again","You (like me) may have admired Eddie Redmayne in the TV version of Tess of the D'Urbervilles (2008), in My Week with Marilyn (2011), as Marius in Les Miserables 2012), and as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything (Academy Award, 2014). You still may be surprised at how moving his delicate performance is in The Danish Girl. I knew vaguely what this movie was about—very ""loosely based"" on the lives of mid-1920s Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener. Despite their happy and loving marriage, Einar comes to realize he is a woman in a man's body. ""Lili,"" as his alter ego is named, is at first a diversion for the pair, then a painful inevitability, and Einar becomes one of the first people to undergo sex-reassignment surgery. Both of them suffer because of Lili's condition and the strains it places on their love, yet they desperately try to make some kind of relationship work. Yet it's dangerous to be a pioneer. While Redmayne is superb, he's matched in nuanced expressiveness by Swedish actor Alicia Vikander as Gerda. The delicious Matthias Schoenaerts plays Einar's childhood friend, Hans, with whom a frantic Gerda reconnects while the couple is in Paris. Ben Whishaw also appears, determined to court the shy Lili, or is it Einar he recognizes and pursues? Not much was known about transgender identities in 1925, and the medical practitioners with whom the couple shares its secret propose predictably draconian measures. But the real drama is watching Redmayne transform himself into a female being. Says Nathan Heller's Vogue article, ""He is no longer recognizable as a 33-year-old man; suddenly, the flash strikes his face and the transformation is complete."" The film, directed by Tom Hooper with a script by English playwright Lucinda Coxon, is based on the 2000 David Ebershoff novel. Due to Coxon's diligent research, the movie actually contains numerous factual details not in the book. Tim Gray's interview with Coxon for Variety reveals that the film is actually closer to what really happened than either the novel or Lili Elbe's pastiche of a ""memoir,"" which was, Coxon told Gray, ""a work of many hands.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oscar liberal bait,"I thought this movie was good and that Eddie Redmayne portrayed better acting in this than in the movie he won the Oscar. This is definitely a liberal film, but it is still enjoyable even if you aren't.The movie is about a married couple, whom are both artists. The husband, Einar, begins to enjoy dressing as a woman and his wife, Gerda, begins painting him like that and only these paintings are considered worthy enough to sell. Einar flirts with a man as Lili, breaking Gerda's heart. Gerda gets an offer to move to Paris to sell her art, so they both move. There Einar explores the transsexual world more and sees doctors, but they think he has a mental/chemical problem. Finally he sees a doctor whom is interested in performing the first transgender surgery. Gerda still loves him but comes to except him as Lili and is still there for her during the surgery. But all doesn't go well during a time of considerable infection risk.FINAL VERDICT: This is a good drama, with a different story to tell. Definitely adult themed.

Dull drawn out twaddle,"Went in with high expectations and ended up almost dozing at the slow pace of this movie. Few highlights and drab backgrounds will not attract me to visit Copenhagen. Typical Oscar type movie, well acted by Redmayne and Vikander just a too slow movie pace. Redmaynes character didn't develop for me at all and I couldn't see it improving if I'd stayed longer so 65 mins into it I followed several others who had left early and noticed one guy fast asleep. The core subject as stated in the trailers and posters is Redmayne's exploration of the femininity side of humanity. All well and good in a psychiatrists consultation but for a movie no. Had this been made for TV it could better be serialised. This is just my opinion but I was bored by it however most folk will watch it and rate it for it's acting merit - I rate for watchability.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander's show in an awesome movie!,"This movie talks about a very sensitive topic, uncomfortable, sometimes. The movie is technically well made, with a great direction (Tom Hooper) and soundtrack (Alexander Desplat: one of my favorite soundtrack composers), giving us a few key images of Denmark (about the sky, the streets...).The contextualization is interesting, and the plot is controversial but magnificent, with the power of being based in true events.But mostly, what makes this movie one of the best movies of 2015 are the performances: so delightful, so good!Eddie Redmayne gave (in my opinion) his best performance ever, as Lily Wegener (and also as Einar). He showed us his feelings, he was transparent and brilliant.Alicia Vikander, as previously showed in Ex Machina, has a lot of potential: she's pretty, her voice is softly and she acted awesomely as Gerda, explaining her concerns and fears to us.

The Director did not understand a deep character,"I saw the film and thought that the director Tom Hooper(The King's Speech) did not understand the character of Lili. In the beginning we see Einar(Eddie Redmane) as a happy and successful painter living with his wife and we have no idea that he is a transgender. I found that out when his wife puts make up on him and he puts on women's clothes. Thats where the problem started for me. People who are transgender or gay/lesbian donot become transgender if someone else puts lipstick on their lips or get them to wear female clothing. They are human beings going through the identity issues since childhood. They live a very depressed life and they are little different than normal people. I wish the director had done some homework and met some of these people to know what they went through. Neither did the actor Eddie Redmane made the effort to meet some transgender people and do some research. Actors get the script and they just jump into playing a role without doing homework.I was trying to like the film but when the wife gets him ready to go to the party and dresses him as a woman and then later she gets really upset and mad because another man was sitting with Lily and getting close, it totally threw her off. That does not make any sense. The wife made her husband vulnerable and now she is all upset. Lily says at one point she believes she is a woman inside and wife says that she believes it too. How can she believe that, she is not the one going through these feelings and emotions which Lily is experiencing. Then Lily was crying so hard when he was about to get the surgery but right before that scene he was all happy with the surgery. The actors did put some emotions into the film but the story was not developed and we did not have any antagonist. Eddie Redmane is a good actor as I saw him in 'The Theory of Everything'. He should be selective of roles and must do home work and research if he takes on to do these important characters.I am giving it 3 stars because the cinematography was beautiful and Alicia Vikander and Amber Heard had some good talent which can be utilized in another stronger film.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
True Essence of Love,"If you don't know the plot and even don't intend to then this review is for you. This movie shows how beautifully the love can be represented. I just want to say the one word for this movie and that is ""AWESOME"". I watched this movie at 3 am and my eyes were crying to sleep but this movie just trapped me in its emotions which was the result of the flawless representation and natural acting of the superb actors.
Portrayal of real characters is as it must be(advice for the people who said that Eddie Redmayne did not do true judgement with the character) and what to say about Alicia Vikandar, I was internally in love with her while watching the movie. Her expressions and dialogue-delivery just revive the real Gerda Wegenar.
Shooting locations are so impressive. It is a beautiful movie. It also contain some nude scenes but there is no sex. Those scenes are the demand of the depiction of the story. Some scene indirectly represents the feelings of Einar Wegener(Lead Male/Female(You will understand after watching the movie) character).Let us see you can feel them or not(I am hinting ""Creation of a painting so many times"").
If you are really interested in watching a master-piece emotional drama and did not have any hatred for non-straight persons then this movie is specially created to invest your precious time in it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Redmayne is superb,"Based on a true story: In 1920s Copenhagen, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is a landscape artist and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) is a portrait artist. When a female model is late to pose for Gerda, she asks Einar to temporarily replace her, partly dressed in women's clothes. This incident re-stimulates Einar's early desires to live as a female.It is also notable that Einar's transition to Lili Elbe is one of the first known transgender incidents in history.I'm sure my fellow movie buffs can recall times when a film was universally acclaimed and we just didn't see what any of the fuss is about. Sometimes, we even disliked the film. ""The Danish Girl"" creates that rare situation in the opposite direction: a film that is universally rated as mediocre or disappointing; but one which I found superb. The naysayers at least agree that Redmayne and Vikander are great in their roles. More on that later.I believe that director Tom Hooper (who helped raise ""The King's Speech"" to such a high level) deserves great credit for elevating the mood in this film to one of intensity mixed with beauty. There is much risk in expressing true identity at a time when the term ""transgender"" did not even exist. The deeper understanding of artists, among others, is on display with kindness and compassion. The beauty of cities like Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden (with exquisite set designs, cinematography, and music) all contribute to keep the aesthetics of this film at the highest level.But it truly is the acting that makes this film as great as it is. Redmayne's performance alone would have been adequate but Vikander's contribution is more than that of a supporting role. As an emerging artist and as a woman whose marriage is changing in ways that could never have been equaled at that time, Vikander brings great depth to Gerda as her love and support are unyielding during a very difficult and unusual time.Redmayne is truly sensational in this film. This is not a surprise considering his turn in last year's ""The Theory of Everything"" for which he was rightly praised with multiple awards. In ""Danish Girl"", his depth goes even further as he boldly and courageously exposes the sensitivity of a unique and misunderstood soul. From the time he first reacts to wearing women's clothes, the movie is riveting as he easily conveys nuance in his facial expressions and takes great risks to be truthful and authentic.As Charlize Theron did with ""Monster"", Redmanyne's sublime performance raises a fine film to an even greater level. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 9 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Lead Performance by Eddie Redmayne.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Trite, sentimental waste of an important subject","A non-biographical biopic, ""The Danish Girl"" is one of the worst attempts at mainstreaming an LGBT-themed story I have ever had the displeasure to see. It takes far too many liberties with the real lives of its principal characters Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, and reduces an interesting story and relationship to a superficial tear-jerker, albeit an excellently photographed one.As in the book, Gerda Wegener's sexual identity is completely neglected, and Lili Elbe's transition is initially portrayed less than identity awakening and rather than role-play. Redmayne as Elbe is thoroughly miscast - it's really, really time by now to have trans parts played by trans people. He plays the character like an effeminate gay man, and if you have trans friends, you will understand how untrue that is. Vikander is doing OK with an underwritten role which shies away from the less romantic real story - for instance, Wegener was not present when Elbe died. Whishaw's character is completely superfluous. Sebastian Koch owes his presence to a big German contribution to the film's budget - still, the most interesting part of the story, the reassignment procedure he is carrying out, is dismissed by a sloppy, predictable script.As some of you may know, there was an LGBT campaign to get ""Tangerine"" nominated for an Academy Award. That film is low budget, features actual Trans actresses and (almost) avoids cliché. If it wasn't for that fact, I would probably rate ""The Danish Girl"" a 4. But since it was actually nominated, it amounts to an insult of the LGBT community by an Academy consisting predominantly of white males in their 50s (there are also zero black nominees this year by the way). Some people seem to believe that any LGBT-themed movie is a good thing, even if it's as shallow as this one.

"Dispose of yourself, no matter what for","Complicity, the purest complicity is the league that leads people to reveal themselves to each other, to influence each other deeply, to deepen their desires in common, and to construct their particular joint scenes. Couples can achieve levels of companionship and mutual admiration that lead them to love each other intensely and truly. Love, not passion. Friendly affection, careful, dedicated, the will to support the other and be the basis for the other achievements. The Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, who lived in Europe in the early twentieth century, have achieved this love. They became extremely accomplices. He wanted to reach a point never attempted by humans and that emerged as a possibility in his day, she took his desire to the point of being not only her own but an artistic attempt of both.
In ""The Danish Girl"" we are presented to a passionate, friend couple, who makes their shared life in a succession of moments of pleasure, experimentation, romance, joy, ardent passion, mutual professional and artistic support. Both painters, Einar already relatively successful as an artist, while Gerda seeks to achieve recognition similar to that of her husband. They met very young, when students of the ""Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts"" in Copenhagen, Denmark. They married in 1904, he 22 and she 19 years old. Made for each other, a man who by that time had already idealized being a woman and who was becoming madly horny in this desire and a lesbian.
With a memorable interpretation of Eddie Redmayne (Einar) and also magnificent acting by Alicia Vikander (Gerda), the film drives the spectators to feel all the pain suffered by both in the process of decision of the painter trying to get the sensation of being a woman; and go through surgeries to amputate his genitalia and artificially construct a feminine sexual organ mimesis. It was something like the couple had come together to give life to a work of art. A few years before Einar and Gerda tried to create Lili, Oscar Wilde wisely stated: ""Life imitates art much more than art imitates life"".
As exciting and extremely rewarding as the acting of the main actors is the photography of the film. Director of photography Danny Cohen has done something phenomenal, something really rare and that strikes us, the scenes seem to be built of pictures, paintings that succeed each other. They truly fill our eyes and challenge us to find one among them that does not resemble a beautiful picture and convey the emotions contained within. Nothing more appropriate for a narrative about part of the life of the painters. Cohen also performed in the same role in other feature films, highlighting ""The King's Speech"" and ""Les Misérables"", but it was with ""The Danish Girl"" that he reached the level of splendor.
Tom Hooper did an exceptional job, also directed the two famous films mentioned above, but it is with the story of Einar and Gerda that he manages to make us deeply identify with the sadness and the disturbance of the Wegener couple. Since watching ""The Danish Girl,"" I wonder how Hooper would film the story of a person with Bodily Identity Identity Disorder.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I thought it was OK.,"'THE DANISH GIRL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Eddie Redmayne is up for his second Best Actor Oscar, in two years, for his portrayal of a 1920s transgender Danish artist, named Lili Elbe; a pioneer of her time (after he won last year, for 'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING'). Alicia Vikander is nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar; for playing Lili's wife, Gerda Wegener. The film was directed by Tom Hooper (who also directed the Academy Award winning films 'LES MISERABLES' and 'THE KING'S SPEECH'), and it was scripted by Lucinda Coxon. The movie was based on the 2000 novel, of the same name; which was only loosely inspired by the actual lives, of the Danish painters it portrays. The film has been heavily criticized; for it's historical inaccuracies, and it's questionable depiction of transgender people. Judging the movie, just on its own merits (as a film), I thought it was OK.The story takes place in 1920s Copenhagen. A successful landscape artist, named Einar Wegener (Redmayne), lives happily with his wife, Gerda (Vikander); who's a popular portrait painter. One day, Gerda asks Einar to sit in on a painting for her. He must pose in a dress, and women's shoes, in order to do so. This triggers feelings, that Einar has long kept buried inside; of identifying as a woman. The rest of the movie details her struggles to become one; and Gerda's fight to stay by her husband's side (during the battle).I don't know what it's like, at all, to be a transgender person; so I can't speak to how properly the film portrays it. I have a friend, who is a transgender woman, who says the movie doesn't do an appropriate job, of demonstrating what that life is like (there's multiple flaws in the film, she pointed out). I also knew little about Lili Elbe, or Gerda Wegener, before seeing the movie; so I can't speak to it's historical accuracy, either (but I've read it's horribly inaccurate). I do think the film is well directed, emotionally intriguing and decently acted (although I don't think Redmayne deserved another Oscar nomination). It definitely kept my interest, throughout it's 2-hour running length; and Vikander is fantastic in it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This sex change predates Christine Jorgeson by half a century,"""The Danish Girl""'viewed at Venice, 2015, features Versatile British actor Eddie Redmayne's followup to last years Best Actor Oscar as wheelchair bound Cambridge cismologist Stephen Hawking -- could a second consecutive Oscar be in the offing?A competition entry at Venice 2015 ""The Danish Girl"" is co-directed by 46 year old Englishman Tom Hooper (The King's Speech, 2010) and Swedish veteran Lasse Hallström, 69 (My Life as a Dog) -- British actor Eddie Redmayne's follow-up to his 2014 Best Actor Oscar as crippled British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"" was a hot ticket on the Lido this year. This time around Eddie portrays a man who became a woman in the first sex change operation of the twentieth century. Redmayne (33) plays a boy who literally becomes a girl! ~~ to wit, a well known Danish artist of the era, male, who underwent genital surgery in the early 1900s to become a woman -- preceding the American transsexual celebrity of Christine Jorgenson by half a century. Given the sexual confusion now rampant in the so- called ""advanced"" Western Democracies this one is destined to become a gay cult classic if nothing else ... Plot centers in the disturbed marriage of Danish artist Gerda Wegener and her sexually confused husband Einar. In a painting which becomes very popular she portrays Einar as a woman which arouses his suppressed feminine feelings to the point where he starts to cross dress and see himself as a woman -- a good looking one at that. The transformation is so intense that he renames himself Lili Elbe, from where the next inevitable step is sex change surgery -- putting his male life on the line as such an operation was seen as quite dangerous at the time. Both Redmayne and his wife in the film, new face Alicia Vikander, 26, from Sweden, are superb. Classy pastel shaded photography provides perfect support for the period feeling. Exquisite sets and decor. The central subject aside from the obvious gender transformation is the search for self and marital fidelity in the face of an impossible marital situation. Vikander as a truly devoted wife stands by him and supports him all during his painful reassessment of self and final decision to go through with a dangerous operation to resolve his/her identity dilemma.

Yawn...sorry did I miss something?,"Where do I start with this film?Over all the film had all the elements for truly memorable film: right cast, perfect script, fantastic costume, production design excellent, the locations were superb and lighting was perfection. The whole movie visually looked like a painting and it felt so wonderful. The Director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler (screenplay) at the helm of the movie production what could go possible go wrong?Well the trailer did what it was suppose to it-to draw you in and make you want to watch this film. It has sense of intelligence, of being a great movie based on a true story along the lines of The Kings Speech (2010). Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe played by Eddie Redmayne, was the first transgender to have a sex reassignment surgery. His story dealt with prejudice, acceptance, and biases in the 1930's.What the Hell happened? The pacing made me want to fall asleep, its as simple as that. This film was put me to sleep. I could not connect with any of the actors on film. Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe came across to me like a selfish douche bag and kept on crying and crying. My God how He/She cried and I get it he/she is insensitive but for God sakes grow a backbone! My pet cat is tougher than the Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe.Alicia Vikander plays Gerda Wegener, the wife and to me she was the only realistic person in the film and even then, she doesn't get enough credit. She is the most supportive film character throughout the entire movie and the wanna be transgender husband is so caught up in his own dramas that when she asked for a bit of emotional support he/she just doesn't care.So, I wonder if the film would be better if they actually cast a transgender actor in the lead rather than a Caucasian male playing a transgender, much like Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club (2013).",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautiful Tribute,"From the moment the film begins, The Danish Girl brings a beautiful sensitivity and delicacy to the story of the first transgender woman to ever undergo gender confirmation surgery. With a careful eye on the historical accuracy of everything from set decorating to writing accurately about Europeans' societal attitudes toward queer people in the early 1900's, the team bringing Lili Elbe- and her unconventional marriage to Gerda Wegener- to life did so with dignity and deep respect.The biggest controversy surrounding this film at the time of its release was casting Eddie Redmayne, a cisgender man, to play Lili. For audience members choosing not to engage with queer media with straight/cisgender people at the forefront, this film may not be the best fit for you. As much as I believe Redmayne delivered a striking performance that read as genuine and vulnerable (for which he was nominated in the Best Actor category at the Oscars), it's also worth mentioning that around five years after the film was released, Redmayne noted in an interview that he regretted taking the role and pointed out his casting was a missed opportunity for the trans community.In terms of the real Lili Elbe and the way she came to be, the film portrays the journey as closely to the historical records as possible. Before changing her name and appearance to Lili's, she was a painter and a husband to fellow-painter, Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), and the film follows the married couple through several years of discovering and inventing Lili. The meat of the story is about their complicated yet somehow easy dynamic. Even with very little scientific research about LGBTQ+ people and issues available at the time, Gerda is Lili's closest and most trusted ally throughout her transition and Alicia Vikander warms the screen with her understanding, open-minded approach to her husband's revelations.There is a rare unbloomed sensuality running through the film, showing up in a couple of intimate scenes between Gerda and Lili (early in her transition) as well as several scenes where Lili is alone, trying to understand what's happening to her and who she is. I haven't seen a film that captures the same soft intrigue and that's what stands out to me most about The Danish Girl. The score, the cinematography, and the costuming all do a phenomenal job at embellishing the bittersweet growing pains of unique identity and the entire project is stunning.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

He acts on screen the way a 14 year old bust-ass virgin around a high school cheerleader would act; all quite and timid and self-conscious. His role in The Danish Girl was no different. The entire film was one big awkward moment. I felt like Redmayne didn't know what to do with his hands the whole time. And they spent more time on imagery then actual screen-play dialogue.

The story is about what appears to be a normal couple who are happily married but then the husband begins to fantasize about what it would be like if he was a female and the movie degrades into a fantasy about sex which appeals to voyeurs who most certainly will love this flick and praise it to high heaven.

"The Best Film on Subject of Transgender Since ""Boys Don't Cry""","Well I finally saw it on cable, September 2019. When ""Boys Don' Cry"" was released in 1999, the film that exploded Hilary Swank's career, the word transgender and the subject matter was relatively new to the general public. ""The Danish Girl"" is a period piece which takes place in France at a time when it was so novel that most most doctors viewed it as a mental illness caused by an imbalance of hormones, often diagnosed as schizophrenia or insanity. Sure there have been many films that take the subject of crossdressing as farce and comedy, dating back to ""Some Like it Hot"". 'The Danish Girl"" blew me away with it's sophisticated take on the subject and it is indeed painful to watch as we empathize with the tortured artist as he agonizingly accepts his true desire to be a woman after his wife playfully crossdresses him for a costume party which opens the floodgates to his self-realization he is a woman trapped in a man's body who goes by the name of Lili -- who does, admittedly, passes as a convincing cute lady. Equally painful is the agony his artist wife goes through during his mental and physical transformation. She loves her husband and he loves her, but as the plot progresses, physical intimacy between them slowly wanes. It is a tragic love story, often embarrassing, often erotic. I likely would have squirmed in my seat had I seen it in a theater audience. Though the artistry of this film and brilliant performances of the leads make this a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I believe her character's struggles through the film were the final point to greatness because the writer handled her position with a great amount of honesty toward the topic.Tom Hooper's directing style fit this film greatly. He often uses the setting strategically and it adds to the audience's ability to connect to the situation and characters, because we have a better knowledge of the space and can assert ourselves into the world of these characters.I understand some of the controversy, but I do believe that Eddie Redmayne handled this role to the best of his abilities, which are many, and portrayed the character better than any present day actor could have with such a unique role.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

That said this film does work especially because of the conflicted nuances of Alicia Vikander's performance. What and who Gerda was in real life is the subject of another film. One the begs to be made. Who Gerda was in this movie is the result of Vikander's ability to show conflicted emotions, to respond to the world around her. Redmayne also does a remarkable job with what he is given.The fault in the film, if there is one is in the translation from inspiration to script to film. Hopper, as director, bears the brunt of that responsibility and the studio advertising and promotion bears the lion's share for misrepresenting what the movie is and who it is about.Never the less, the cinematography is divine, the acting incredible and the story, while not the true story, works on its own terms.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Flawed, but Eddie R., Alicia V. and amazing production values makes for a grand film.","I love true stories, and this one is one of the most important true stories ever. Its current, its complex, its huge. So did the film match the importance of the story and give its heroes Gerda and Einar Wegener (and many others) a deserving honor as big as they were? Well i think that yes, in some ways. But its a flawed homage with quite a few big problems.The biggest one is the fact that there's no insight, no introspective, the writer and the director seem to assume all the time that you know whats in the characters heads, their reasons and so... and its their reasons that it's also a big problem. You might get the feeling that this film is like a mini series of 6 hours turned into a 2 hour film. And for the most part what you get its the bigger scenes, which are the conclusions to many chapters of this characters lives. They all are huge conclusions thats for sure, but the lack of the path to said conclusions hurts the film and your feelings about it. You see the characters actions, but rarely do you see them discussing their reasons, fears, everything, until they actually do something, in a satisfying way.And many scenes are too objective, this is specially obvious in the third act, that seems too rushed, barely touching on the surgery and the characters thoughts. And this also makes the film lack in emotional heft. I noticed especially at the end, where the film didn't have the emotional impact on me i expected. If one thing describes this film is to the point.The 2h really fly.But films are subjective, as they should be, and so you can't argue emotions with logic. You can admit and recognize facts, as this part is bad or good... but if you feel the film is perfect to you or you loved it deep down, the facts, the problems, wont matter much or nothing at all. And this goes the other way around when you hate or dislike. Which is something that most people today refuse to understand, as they declare war against those who loved something they hated or hated something they loved.And this is what happened with me, as i think this problems are hugely mitigated by 3 things, Eddie Redmayne. Alicia Vikander and the amazing production vales.The two main leads are so great you just want to cover them with Oscars, and all kinds of awards. There's great performances that you love and then there's performances like this, that leaves you in awe the entire film, wondering how someone can give performances like this. Eddie Redmayne deservedly won the Oscar last year, and no matter how brilliant he is here he wont win, thanks to Leonardo Dicaprio, who is long overdue, which is to say the least, But Alicia Vikander might have a small shot at winning. Its unlikely thanks do Brie Larson and Saoirse Ronan, but who knows?Eddie R. and Alicia V. are the true homage to the heroes of the story, accompanied by an amazing supporting cast, while the film itself might not reach the heights it could have, the actors more than compensate this, elevating the film to another level, one it possibly couldn't reach without them.When the screenplay fails to have insight, thoughts, dialogue or scenes necessary to feel in the gaps of the story, the actors compensate with their performances, with their meticulous expressions and especially the film is very objective so there's not the emotional heft it should or could have, they are ones that bring the emotional heft, they are the one that makes you feel the mentions the film fails to evoke.And of course the production values are brilliant, especially the amazing cinematography and production design, that create an amazing imagery and atmosphere, along with another epic score from Alexandre Desplat that reads the story superbly.So once again this is a flawed film yes, it fails to achieve what it could have but to me the flaws are hugely mitigated by Eddie, Alicia and the quality of the production and what matters is that this story was told, and the heroes represented. Watch the film, because it really deserves, and i hope you can go beyond the flaws and focus on the grander picture as i did.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""God made me a woman, but the doctor corrected the mistake that nature made...""","""God made me a woman, but the doctor corrected the mistake that nature made"", surely the most memorable line from Tom Hooper's beautiful new film, The Danish Girl. This film, set in the late 1920s, details the life of artist Einar Wegener, (subsequently Lili Elbe), who, with the aid of his long-suffering wife and fellow artist, Gerda, comes to terms with his desire to become a woman in an age of intolerance, and gambles all in agreeing to undergo one of the first ever sex-change operations.Eddie Redmayne triumphs as Einar/Lili, and is surely in for many a commendation. As I sat in the cinema, I felt ashamed at the fact that I was not too familiar with his work, though I do remember him alongside Gemma Arterton in a wonderful BBC adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbevilles, which I saw in a GCSE English class several years ago. It is indeed criminal that I have not yet seen his interpretation of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, a performance by which, I'm told, even Hawking himself was bowled over. His transition from Einar to Lili is seamless, as he dons the full female attire, to the extent where I thought I was watching two separate actors. His poise and his every movement are proof that he has studied this part long and hard.I was equally impressed with Alicia Vikander as Gerda. I remembered her from last summer's spy romp, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Clearly, The Danish Girl makes markedly better use of her serious acting talents. It is quite appropriate that this film is about the lives of two artists, as the film itself is very picturesque. I wouldn't be overzealous in saying that some of the lingering shots of Copenhagen in the film are like paintings.This film is loosely based on a true story and it's release couldn't be more timely here in the 21st century, when we are all too belatedly coming to accept and admire sexual difference. It is faintly reminiscent of the not-so-distant story of flamboyant writer Quentin Crisp's struggle with homosexuality, which was brought to life in the 70s TV film, The Naked Civil Servant, with John Hurt in the title role giving the performance of his career. The Danish Girl is a film about which people will talk at length for a long time to come, and which will continue to bolster Eddie Redmayne's already flourishing career.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Powerful Story,"The Danish Girl is a film about a fictional love story that was loosely influenced by the lives of Danish artists Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe. As Lili navigates her trailblazing journey as a transgender pioneer, Gerda and her marriage and professional endeavours develop. This film was incredibly powerful and shot beautifully, this story leads the audience on a rollercoaster of emotions, from happiness and joy, to pain and sorrow. The way this story was told was eloquent and fantastic, the characters felt real, deep, and complex, the film forced the audience to form relationships and feel connected to the characters.The cinematography in this film was absolutely brilliant. I thought that this film was shot so thoughtfully, each shot having meaning and depth, the use of contrast in the colours were exquisite, showing colours to highlight or emphasize the feelings of the character in the frame. For example using more desaturated colours to reflect Lili's feelings of darkness and sadness, or using those same colours to highlight her in the frame as she wears brighter coloured clothes, also showing how different she may feel or have felt in the past. The use of shallow and deep focus was perfect, deep focus to show the entire frame, bringing less attention to the characters, but to the environment as well, and using shallow depth of focus to bring the audience's attention solely on the characters on screen.The acting in this film was absolutely phenomenal, especially from the main cast in Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, which is reinforced by both of them being nominated for Oscars and Alicia Vikander winning. Eddie Redmayne portrayed, fantastically, the mental conflict as well as meeting the massive requirements for this role, you can tell from his performance that there was care poured into this role. Alicia Vikander's performance also gave off the same feeling of care for her role, she portrayed her character to show a willingness to try to help Lili on her journey of finding her true identity.The pacing of this story is also something I want to mention, the pacing is something that is very important and is definitely a strong point of the film. I definitely recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I am surprised how poorly some reviewers rate this film,"I saw this film knowing nothing about Einer Wegener/Lili Elbe and found it a most moving story with superb acting from Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. The former already has a great reputation and the latter(Ex Machina & Testament of Youth) must surely pick up the odd Oscar sooner rather than later.Perhaps if I saw this film several times I should become aware of some of the flaws others mention, but for me the film felt complete and satisfying.

Business as usual from the predictable Hooper,"You know what to expect from a Tom Hooper film or rather you know what not to expect and that is something edgy. Hooper is the man who gave us ""The King's Speech"" and then ""Les Miserables"". ""The King's Speech"" won the Oscar as the year's Best Picture and Hooper himself, somewhat surprisingly, picked up the Oscar for Best Director. It was a perfectly fine example of what in America might have been called 'Masterpiece Theatre' and ""The Danish Girl"" is no different, apart from being duller and even more conventional when the material positively cries out for 'edgy'.It's the story of Einer Wegener, a painter in the Copenhagen of 1926, who was also Lili Elbe. Lili was one of the first recorded examples of transgender, or for the uninitiated, a man 'trapped' in a woman's body but this ham-fistedly well-intentioned film approaches the subject with such an initial tentativeness that it's hard to quite know who Einer/Lili actually is. At first he seems simply to be just another man who likes to dress up in his wife's clothes and who gets a sexual kick out of it. Then he comes across as just another gay man in a frock and the movie is at least half way through before we realize Lili is actually transgender.It's all done in the best possible taste though God knows who Hooper imagined his audience might be. It's hardly a tribute to either Lili or to the transgender community today, while gay men could just find it a tad offensive. Hooper's usual target audience of Aunt Ednas might gasp and sigh but are otherwise unlikely to embrace the picture. On the plus side, Eddie Redmayne does get under both Einer and Lili's skin and inside their heads with a real technical flourish that's certainly impressive. It's an Oscar bait performance, showy and ostentatious, but at least it's well-crafted while Alicia Vikander is excellent as the poor, put-upon wife, despite the part being shamefully underwritten. Midway through I started to notice the costumes, not just the eye-catching frocks but the suits as well. When that happens you know the film is in trouble.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Danish Girl - Movie Review,"Nice try Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hooper. I know for a fact that the two of you wanted a second Oscar so badly, so you made this movie, but this isn't fooling anyone.The Danish Girl is about a Danish artist, depicted her husband, Einer, as a female in one of her paintings. As the painting gains attention, Einer begins to transform as well - becoming more and more feminine until Einer becomes Lili Elbe - and becomes the first person to receive a male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. While Gerda is supportive, she comes to realize this change will prove a challenging ordeal to their relationship - even more so when Hans Axgil, an art dealer and old friend of Einer, comes into her life.Oscar bait movies like this really makes my skin crawl, because this movie literally ticks off ways of getting that Oscar and it's quite shocking how noticeable it is here. I really liked The King's Speech, I mean it's not for everyone but I thought it was a great movie and I couldn't wait to watch Tom Hooper's next film. Oh Hooper, what happened? I didn't care for Les Misérables and I sure didn't care for this movie. The Danish Girl sadly fails to deliver and everything feels so force. The emotions, the art and the story itself falls completely flat.What the hell happened to Tom Hooper? after he won that Oscar he really lost his touch. There's hidden greatness in this movie and Hooper could have easily taken a different path to make this movie great, but he doesn't do that here, but he intend plays it safe and makes everything feel so force with emotions that there's no emotional attachment. There were some well directed scenes in the movie and it is well shot, but I felt like the movie was missing something and that's me actually caring about whats going on. The movie itself wants me to care about whats going on with the characters, but the only one I really cared about or felt bad about is Alicia Vikander character. I miss the old Tom Hooper.Now I've got nothing against Eddie Redmayne as I think he's a talented guy, but he seriously needs to pick better roles in the future. He was absolutely awful in Jupiter Ascending and he sure wasn't good here. He's performance in this movie is what I call ""pretentious"" and ""by the books Oscar bait"". The emotions were there but I just didn't feel it and how the execution could have been better. A role like this is not a easy challenge and this must have been tough for Eddie, I mean in recent interviews, he has said that the role has personally changed his way of seeing things with genders and trans gender people. He took a risk but it sadly didn't come together as promised. I swear, if Eddie Redmayne gets a second Oscar for this movie, I will be mad.Alicia Vikander was hands down the stand out of this movie. As I said before, I cared for her more than Redmayne character and that's saying a lot. Shes been not-stop impressing me this year and I can't wait to see more of her in future movies. She was brilliant in this movie as I really felt her struggle and her dealing to whats going on in her life is truly heartbreaking. She was without a doubt the best part of this movie and she did an magnificent performance.The cinematography was good, the style of the movie was neat, the score was pretty solid and that's really it.Overall The Danish Girl isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. This movies purpose of existing is just to win awards and nothing else.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
CRINGEWORTHY.....however,"The movies cast was excellent, but some parts of this movie was unforgivably cringeworthy.Eddie Redmayne performance as Lilli - well......

Redmayne's performance was so good.....perhaps that's what made me so uncomfortable.'The Danish Girl' is a well-intentioned attempt to tell Lili Elbe's story for a general audience, however some of the unusual historical facts and much of the sparkle has been lost.Dramatically too, it somehow loses something in this depiction of the story of both protagonists.Why else would I skip through the cringeworthy moments.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Aesthetically Pleasing, But All Too Derivative","With all factors of the film considered The Danish Girl should be a sheer delight. On paper it's a perfect film; Tom Hooper as Director, Eddie Redmayne at the forefront of the picture and Alicia Vikander in a splendid supporting role. But in reality The Danish Girl is formulaic, unfulfilling and forgettable.Einar Wegener played with delicacy by Eddie Redmayne is a confused individual. Unable to come to terms with his sexuality, he craves to wear women's clothes. He's not even comfortable in his own skin and is about to proceed with an operation that will change his life.There are so many biopics nowadays that one has to discard the filth and meander some. The Danish Girl has both of these tragic qualities. Yet, if it had a solid script it would be a great film. There are far too many familiar lines that destroy any hope of sympathy for the flawed characters. Lines like; ""We were playing a game"" ""Let's give them something special"" and ""I finally feel like my true self"". Okay, I made the last one up, but you get the point.From solely a production standpoint The Danish Girl is flawless. Beautiful shots of the surrounding landscape of Denmark, sell the time period and setting of the story. The music is suitably emotional and the performances are of the highest order. But that script, the way it kills any momentum and renders all drama meaningless and uneventful. The writing remains the most important part of a biopic. I need to believe that these events really did happen. But when the script feels this contrived and fails to generate the required emotion that the writer wants me to feel, then I'm afraid I can't believe in it at all.The Danish Girl literally screams Oscar bait and melodramatic drivel. If you liked the film, then I'm happy for you. By all rights I should have fell in love with it. The film deals with a man who struggled to come to terms with his sexuality. I myself can relate to the character, having spent many years identifying myself. But in this day and age films that are merely passable and relatively harmless do not cut it anymore and The Danish Girl remains as conflicted as its central character.C",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Suffers from an Unengaging Plot and Characters,","The Danish Girl is a very mediocre movie with an overall poorly developed plot and an excellent cast that do their best to try and save it. There is no questioning the beauty of the scenery itself, the cinematography is outstanding. Tom Hooper clearly put a lot of work in to establishing the world these characters are living in. Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne also shine in their roles, beautifully portraying the emotions these characters are experiencing in these rough times.While the performances are stellar, the characters themselves are unlikeable. I had no sympathy for Einar, a man who completely disregarded his wife's feelings because he wanted to become a woman. He comes across as arrogant and selfish from the beginning, which makes it hard for us to support him in his journey.It is also tries far too hard to be heartwarming. The objective of almost every scene is to make the audience cry, delivering a wide range of emotions that is in no way subtle and leaves us feeling underwhelmed by what they are showcasing as a result of trying too much.It informed me of the importance of character development in a script,, no matter how good the performances, if the characters are not well established in the screenplay, we will gain no remorse for them. With a very slow pace and unengaging plot, The Danish Girl is worth giving a miss.A wife is thrown apart when her husband gains a passion for pretending to be a woman.Best Performance: Alicia Vikander",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unforgivable Casting Choice,"When a transgender woman is played by a cisgender man, it sends the message that the two can be seen as the same thing, which is untrue. It's also very disrespectful, at best, to the woman whom this movie is all about, Lili Elbe. As previously stated, by having a cisgender man play her, they send the message that she herself was nothing more than a man pretending to be a woman, which essentially is taking her identity and stomping on it. I could've given the movie a chance if Lili had only been played by a trans-woman, but since she was not, I find myself unable to enjoy a moment of it. Great job, guys. You took a story that could've been the greatest movie of the year and you blew it before you even began shooting.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Downfall,"I'm a gay man. I have no problem with any actor playing any role. The usual objection is to straight male actors playing gay men, and I get it. But there are certainly examples of straight male actors nailing it, like the guys in Brokeback Mountain or Tom Cullen in Weekend (you may know him as Anthony Gillingham in Downton Abbey) which being about modern guys in an accepting society goes much farther in explicitness and intimacy.In this case it's straight male actor Eddie Redmayne playing a trans person, and I agree with some other reviewers here who thought it doesn't work at all. I guess he tried, but it came off to me as completely superficial and trivializing the character. It led to me questioning his acting as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything which I thought really worked at the time. Was that portrayal also just an assemblage of physical traits with nothing much going on behind them?",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wasted potential,"Overall, I thought this movie was pretty well acted. The dialog felt natural, the characters consistent to how they were written, and the cinematography was beautiful and interesting.I'm also going to ignore for a moment that my research into the movie found it to be completely inaccurate to the actual story, because that's something I've come to expect. Instead I'd like to focus on the main point: the transgender portrayal.It is an incredibly common trope that being trans is like having a completely different person inside of you, with different thoughts and ideas and desires. And it is true that some transgender people portray it this way, because it can be easier to express yourself and remove yourself from a stressful situation. The problem is that you are NOT a different person from one moment to the next... if it were that easy, it would not be as painful when you try to come out.Einar is shown to be madly in love with the wife at the beginning of the movie and just... doesn't love her after beginning transition? It's more common that after the transition, the spouse pulls back because of the perception of sexuality (for instance, a straight woman may have trouble being with a transwoman post transition simply due to the strain on sexual attraction), but I've actually seen more couples try (and succeed) to make it work or come to amicable parting. But that's a tangent.Much of the plot relies on the fact that she was turning into someone else. So much could have been done without that. Even if they wanted relationship issues, barring the fact that transitioning in itself can be a painful and fascinating process without that, you could have just as easily gotten this with sexuality confusion or gender representation or societal pressure or a million other accurate issues that weren't ""oh no, she's a new person now"".I could rant about this all day, but the my biggest contention is that by making her an entirely different person, she ends up villainized... People don't want to love the cheater, the liar, the abandoner. So in the end, all of our sympathy is urged toward Greda, and understandably so by the positioning of the issues. So this movies is not so much about their ""unconditional love"" as it becomes more about a ""trans woman"" who constantly hurts her spouse, who refuses to leave. Any time they might have talked it out or had an actual discussion, something would happen to cut it down and then everything was fine again??No. No. This does nothing to benefit the narrative for women, or the struggle for transwomen specifically. Movies like this only further the idea that transitioning means LOSING the person you love instead of accepting and embracing them.This is getting very long, but I just- if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of what it's like to be transgender, this is not it... This movie, while interesting and well made, will not help you understand. I wish I had a better recommendation for you.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Melodramatic and Animated,"This film and it's actors just did not capture this real story to the best of their ability. Don't get me wrong as they are both talented A stars but this character Lily was portrayed to be so overly feminine and superficial in her hyper focus on dressing in female clothing. Lily's relationship encounters with men were equally lacking in authenticity. Yes she was a woman trapped inside a man's body but are we still simplify the trans gender or those who identify as such to be only in it for the lipstick and the clothes? Lots of flaws on the approach to this true story moving at a turtle pace when within all that mundane waste of the viewer's time could have been filled with so much more about Lily we'll never know about.

The murder of a potential masterpiece,"The Danish Girl's main character's story is nothing but exceptional, and it's a shame that it was treated so poorly in the movie. The screenplay was completely neglected in favour of the film's visual aspect, and this - in my opinion - made any kind of connection between characters and viewers impossible.Alicia Vikander gave a laudable (but still academic) performance, stealing the whole attention from Redmayne (also good, but understandably uncertain due to the difficult role); other than that, I can't find anything else I liked about the movie - apart from the amazing soundtrack composed by Alexandre Desplat.This movie had a great potential: it could have been provocative, emotional, powerful. So how is it that 'The Revenant' - whose plot is common and even predictable - still amazed me and made me feel a lot more than such a tragic and extraordinary story as Lili's?",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Movie-ish Girdle,"Another poison-pen love letter to freaks and monsters around, The Danish Girl is, like the pastry of the same name, sugar-glazed heavy fluff. While we all know that Denmark is the happiest place on Earth, something is definitely rotten in the Kingdom; that's why the aftertaste, one guesses. This is a BOATS movie, see, Based On A True Story but reality has been careful edited for the viewer (or is it the voyeur?) to take a stroll by the edge without taking a hard look at the precipice, the sulfurous subject-matter sanitized by soft lightning, period dresses and politically correct dialogue. ""Toddle-oh"", as they often say in Elsinor!Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne, looking both good and repulsive in lace and satin), and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander, happy recipient of an Oscar for supporting role when she is the female lead, a proved studio strategy) are both painters. He's brushing successful, moody landscapes and she's a portraitist, a lesser artistic form in friendly, neighbouringly Copenhagen. But she's definitely wearing the pants in the relationship, while Einar enjoys stockings and lingerie because ""it's pretty"".It remains unclear what Gerda's endgame is: is she creating an alternate version of herself out of an unfulfilling husband, or the muse for a sea change in her artistic career? The character is ambiguous, expressing thoughts like ""Kissing you was like kissing myself"" or ""I'll never be as pretty as you"". There is, under the layers of varnish, a canvass of cruel rivalry, the wife detaining the compass point at what her chrysalis of a husband should be. Or so she thinks.Enter the man which will precipitate Einar's metamorphosis, Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts, sweet as a lamb but almost embarrassingly manly in such a girly environment) He kisses Einar and she becomes Lili, in a reverse frog-to-prince moment. Her nose bleed: she has become a woman. Soon she webbing lies to her suitor and spreading her newfound wings in a dumbfounded small, small capital city where no one ever recognises her for who he, a public figure, was.Gerda and Lili move to Paris, where their portraitist/model double act is a success, Gerda on the course of becoming Tamara de Lempicka. They are on a see-saw, through. Lili's chemical imbalance has led to a radiation treatment which let him sterile. A painter becoming a model is even more awkward than a model becoming a painter, in an obvious parallel to a man so twisted he would like to becomes a woman. Einar has left the building, both as an artist and as a man; Lili devour him from the inside, a painful process including the mandatory homosexual mugging scene in the Tuileries garden. ""Elbe like the river"", she says when asked her name; she's adrift, drowning in a dark current stronger than both of him/her.Obviously it does not end well, but in a dignified, symbolic way, a lot being made of a scarf, a confrontation with a pregnant woman emphasizing that gender realignment surgery (as they called it in the Twenties sigh) will never make her a real woman. ""The trick is to only eat sugar"", Lili says at some point when complimented on her figure; the trick here is to film the horror story it is as a treacle treat. The director, Tom Hooper (the atrocious The King's Speech) and his production designer did their homework by pilfering paintings from Villhem Hammershoi and it seems everyone involved enjoyed recreating a monster to observe him/her suffer and die.As usual, there are two ways of watching this particular exercise of glossing over a subject matter too dark to be used as such. The first is to wonder why to make such a complacent, emasculated Oscar vehicle of it, and be a bit ashamed at having watched it, or even worse, reviewed it. The second, which one guesses is what The Danish Girl deserves, is to consider it a 25 M$ spoof of Little Britain's unconvincing transvestite Emily Howard doing her lady things with her friend Florence, and have a good laugh at it.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Highly militant, a more neutral film would have been better.","This is a difficult film to comment on. On the one hand, and speaking exclusively from a technical point of view, it is a really good and well-made film. On the other hand, I have many questions and points of disagreement that prevent me from really approving it. And the reader better be ready to disagree healthily with what I write, because I'm not used to hiding what I think, or amputating my opinions under the guillotine of political correctness.I know that the film was acclaimed when it came out and that the publicity machine sold it very well. I also know that it is one of the most beloved films in the GLBT (and all the letters and symbols they want to add) community. I have already written some reviews of other films, in which I criticized the excessive yielding to political correctness or moral/social lobbies. Since cinema is an artistic and leisure experience, I don't like to see it used for advertising or indoctrination of ideas and morals. We are supposed to enjoy watching a film and seeing the talent and artistry of those involved, not feeling that the film is trying to tell us what we should think about a subject or a theme, which is what this film tries to do. For this indoctrination, the script addresses an unknown figure: Einar Wegener, a Danish landscape painter little known internationally because he became known more as a ""trans"" personality than as a painter.Married to Gerda Wegener, also a painter, it was only after he was married that he discovered (or assumed) his femininity, moving to Paris and starting to assume himself as a woman and using the name Lili Elvenes. What is certain is that he was one of the first men to undergo a surgical process of genital reconstruction, which ended with the rejection of the transplanted organ and the generalized infection that led to his death. The clinical process was burned by Nazism. From that time, only a few of Wegener's diaries and testimonies of those who knew him survive, material that was, after his death, collected and edited in the book ""Man Into Woman"", in 1933. Far from being a biography (much less an autobiography, as it is commonly called), the book's objective was to make the public aware of the details about Wegener's condition and the innovative and risky medical procedure he agreed to undergo.Conveniently, the script had just enough historical data to concoct a good melodrama, full of heartache, existential doubts, and plenty of trans-friendly material. It was what was wanted. More pragmatic issues, such as the relationship between Einar and his original family and the consequences of his transition on his art, and on its acceptance by the public and the market, are never addressed. The film prefers to convey propaganda, as in the famous scene in which the character is attacked in a garden. Such aggression has no logic in a city as liberal as Paris and there is no historical data to sustain that Wegener was assaulted or insulted in that city, where the couple moved in order to have more artistic opportunities and live the frenzy of the Roaring Twenties. However, in order to fulfill its doctrinal role, the film needed to give that pin to those who, today, discriminate ""trans"" people, so the scene was placed at a point where the public would already have a certain sympathy with the character. Militant from start to finish, the film irritated me greatly. A neutral approach, faithful to the known facts and allowing the public to think for itself, would have been better.Despite not liking the way the film was conceived, I loved Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander's work. They dedicated themselves, especially her, which earned her an Oscar, awarded with complete justice (the question of being a Supporting Actress or not seems to me a minor issue, and perhaps she also thought so). The only objection I have to make is this: why not a legitimate ""trans"" actor for the lead role? I understand Redmayne's choice, but I don't think he even looks like the real Wegener. Well, to be honest, I didn't like Amber Heard either, I think her character is left here, and it would have been better to replace her with someone closer to the main character (one of Wegener's brothers, for example).Technically, the film has good production values that are worth noting: the sets and costumes are excellent and recreate very well the era and the environments where the characters move, the cinematography is really very good and the choice of filming locations it was done in a very thoughtful and judicious way. The soundtrack, despite sounding mellow and slow, fits well in the film.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Oscar Bait Film That Falls Short,"2015 has been a relatively letdown of a year for film. Sure, you have the obvious masterpieces and returns to form for several huge franchises, but I feel like most of the films we expected to be Oscar contenders fell short of where our expectations hoped they would reach. That is yet again the case with The Danish Girl. Coming from the director of Les Miserables a few years back, The Danish Girl is loosely based on the life of one of the first people to have a sex transformation in early 20th century Denmark.Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, who begins to feel comfortable in woman's clothing after his wife, Gerda, played by Alicia Vikander, asked him to pose for one of her paintings. Both Redmayne and Vikander give great performances, with the latter probably outshining the raining Oscar winner himself, but the film around them is just okay. With those great performances, you would think you feel very connected to their characters, but I never did. Their chemistry feels real and the conflicts that arise are most definitely real, but the solutions that the script calls for all feel unimaginative and uninspired.Sometimes you can feel Tom Hooper's direction and Lucinda Coxon's script attempt to outshine the performances too much. By that I mean, the dialogue and structure ends up feeling too cute or too clever for a subject matter that could and should be tackled in a far more meaningful manner. If anything, I'm sure this film will do good for the movement and awareness of trans-gender in general. One of the most jarring things that's only touched upon in The Danish Girl is the lack of understanding at all for trans-genders, who were outed as insane during this time, and that was under 100 years ago.The Danish Girl had promise but it only delivered on a few fronts, that being the extraordinary performance from Vikander and also Redmayne, while also creating a beautifully shot landscape of 20th century Europe. But the film itself had no regard for subtly in the big moments and profoundness in its quiet moments.+Vikander is Oscar worthy+Redmayne once again proves he deserves the hype+Looks gorgeous-Unimaginative writing-Style over substance5.7/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Disappointing,"Pro: Eddie Redmayne's performance, nice low-key score by Alexandre Desplat (one theme reminded me of Howard Shore's score to DEAD RINGERS), nice production design of 1920's Europe.Con: Story is a bit weak. I also found it a bit confusing.The trivia on IMDb (and the info on Wikipedia) explains a lot about my confusion with the story. Both the movie and the book its based on are changed a lot of major details of the true story, basically making it into fiction. The details of the true story made a lot more sense.All in all, I'm disappointed. I had very high expectations for this movie.Alicia Vikander isn't impressive at all in her role. She was excellent in EX-MACHINA and should have won the Oscar for that role instead.I should mention that her hair color is EXTREMELY distracting. Her eyebrows have a totally different color and this simply doesn't go with the era. I never notice these things, but here it was simply too obvious and distracting.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotionless,"The Danish Girl is actually an okay film and giving it a five is probably a bit unfair. However, while it does manage to feel like a good film on the outside, inside its just a bland and emotionless disappointment. By this, I mean that the acting performances are very overrated. Eddie Redmayne does a great job as playing the transgender. However, he does not manage to add anything to the character that actually makes the story interesting. Alecia Vikander is okay, but her character isnt exactly interesting as her entire narrative revolves around Redmayne. She has very little development. Her performance is defnitealy not worthy of a supporting oscar, partly because she isnt very captivating and partly because she is a lead character. In general, Danish Girl is not a very interesting film to watch and will leave you feeling nothing at the end of the film other than the relief that it has ended. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
TIFF40 2015 Film Review: The Danish Girl,"Tom Hooper seems to be the period piece go-to director for by-the-numbers Oscar films. After the immense success of the little indie that could The King's Speech gaining massive momentum at TIFF in 2010, going on to win the coveted Best Picture Oscar; then the grand and highly ambitious Les Miserables, Hooper seemed to have crafted a career out of production rich designs, strong performances and historically relevant social issues in his films. With the addition of Eddie Redmayne, fresh off his Oscar winning role in last year's The Theory of Everything, Hooper's newest The Danish Girl was expected to come out a clear winner. Sadly, The Danish Girl is a confused, highly theatrical and poorly constructed transparent film with laughable dialogue between its two leads Redmayne and rising star Alicia Vikander. The Danish Girl seemed to be a foolproof, sure-fire bet for success; Redmayne was coming off his Oscar win as Stephen Hawkings; the first look photo of the film of Redmayne in drag gained immense buzz online; Hooper finally got a project off the ground after many years of being shelved by studios and various directors; its female lead Alicia Vikander had four major roles in 2015 with nothing but great buzz, and finally, the cast rounded out with the grandly talented Matthias Schoenaerts. Yet, Hooper's The Danish Girl came across as a forced, highly contrived Oscar wannabe film with pretentious camera tricks, dizzying angles and weak vehicle for any kind of lead up to have Redmayne the first actor to win two back-to-back lead actor Oscars.Set in 1926, in what could be described as Hooper's historically hipster-era in Copenhagen, the film follows Gerda Wegener (Vikander) and Einar Wegener (Redmayne), a very passionate, close- knit painting couple who cherish the high art culture of Copenhagen, including its posh parties, galas and presentations. Along for the ride, is their close friend and confident floozy Oola Paulson (Amber Heard), who motivates the couple to partake in the lavish cultural niche of the country, without much else.In a desperate attempt to finish up a recent portrait for her upcoming, impending gallery showcase, Gerda asks her loving and supportive husband Einar, to place the painted dress on, along with some nylons and heals. As Einar caresses and is seduced by the fabrics of the garment, he becomes transfixed, mind, body and soul, with the crazy idea of becoming a woman. As Oola enters the couples apartment, in preparation for another trendy evening gather, jokingly names Einar's female counterpart Lili. Unbeknownst to them at the time, the origins of Lili would just be the start of Gerda's and Einar's life.Transgenderism is a huge and highly talked about social issue in many art forms today, especially within the visual medium. With shows like ""Transparent"", ""Orange is the New Black"" and others making waves, it's no surprise that Hollywood busted out an origin film of one of the first successful trans-gender stories and operations recorded. Sadly, The Danish Girl, while trying to be trend-setting and a wavelengths type film for the truly difficult realities for many, serves as a laughable and pretentious story of over-dramatic film aesthetics and acting.Scorn with painful editing, inauspicious mood-setting scoring and less than hubris camera angles and filing styles, it seems as though Hooper forgot to focus on his characters and their difficult and revolutionary small details. For example, when Gerda tries to persuade Einar to coming to a party with her, which he declines vivacious, she convinces him to come as Lili, for fun and merely as a joke. While Einar's transformation and changing montage is brief, unlike those clichéd high school prom films that has the big transformation of its lead female protagonist as she goes from ugly duckling to beautiful swan, Lili has no big reveal; merely a quick shot of her walking the streets, rushing to the party with Gerda. Hooper takes for granted so much of the importance of Einar to Lili, and focuses on a very muddled and hard to define relationship between a man and a woman; lovers to friends; wife to cousin?Danish pastries are famous for being laminated, multi-layered and delicate. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Danish Girl. Burnt to a crisp with overacting and some poor make-up and costume choices, the film does offer some saving graces thanks mostly to an astonishing performance by Alicia Vikander and Matthias Schoenaerts, and a very special and one of the rare believable scenes of Redmayne through a looking glass. Vikander, who counterbalances Redmayne's manic behaviour and inability to vocalize how he feels he is meant to be a woman, Vikander's gentle touch to Gerda's character brings true emotions of how any partner and loved one would deal with a very radical decision today, and more so in 1926 Europe. Vikander, who is bound to land some Oscar love come earlier next year, gently graces the screen with perfectly timed drama, poise and a gentle touch. Schoenaerts, who is a period-piece veteran, offers his masterful acting skills as an old-friend to Einar and new friend to Gerda, playing a very similar role as Charlie Cox's character Jonathan in The Theory of Everything, his passion to aid, understand and stand on the sidelines of a very unique circumstance is one of the winning areas of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not a bad movie by any means, but one that seriously disappointed me.","Eddie Redmayne and especially Alicia Vikander are so good that they make the unremarkable script mostly worth watching. Mostly.Their performances really carry what's otherwise a pretty underwhelming movie.Maybe I'll like it more on a rewatch, but first I need to want to rewatch it, and I kinda don't, at least not for now.Also, as glad as I am that Vikander won an Oscar for this, it really should have been in the Leading Actress category (and it should have been for Ex Machina, but that's off-topic)",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant performances but it seemed to drag in parts! 5/10,"Review: Although the subject matter was interesting and the performances were brilliant, I did find this movie slightly boring in parts. I felt sorry for Gerda (Alicia Vikander), who had to live through her husband changing into a woman, without any support and whilst trying to keep her career going as an artist. With that aside, the storyline is truly amazing and the outcome at the end did touch me. Eddie Redmayne, Einar/Lili, really did put in a Oscar nomination performance, alongside Alicia Vikander who made the film seem real and extremely emotional. I was amazed that no one recognised who Lili was, when they were out together because you still could see Einar beyond all of the makeup. The transformation was still brilliant from the makeup department and the mannerisms and voice from Redmayne was great. I couldn't work out what exactly Einar did as a job and I would have liked to have seen what happened to Gerda after the dramatic ending but that's just me being picky. The whole operation side of this movie, showed how far Einar was willing to go, to becoming a woman, mainly because she thought that she was born the wrong gender, and there loving relationship was truly beautiful. Anyway, the film did seem to drag in certain parts but I found the message, about one man's journey to become a woman, no matter what the circumstances, very touching and it's great awareness for the transgender community. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Eddie Redmayne, 34, has definitely picked the right projects lately, which include the Theory of Everything, the big budget, Les Miserables and My Week With Marilyn, and this movie has proved that he really does give his all when it comes to delicate subject matters. With the terrible Jupiter Ascending firmly behind him, the only way is up for this Oscar winning actor who stars alongside Colin Farrell in the big budget movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which is due out some time this year. Anyway, this movie was directed by Tom Hooper, 43, who also brought you the Damned United, the Oscar winning, the King's Speech and the questionable Les Miserables. He definitely got the most out of the leading actors and the cinematography portrayed the 1920's well but I personally think that the movie could have been shorter.Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $65millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/romance/dramas starring Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, Ben Whishaw, Matthias Schoenaerts, Amber Heard and Emerald Fennell. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Melodramatic,"I wonder what the producers of this film were thinking when they decided that a non-stop monologue, supposedly about gender identity in early 1900's Europe, would make an interesting and entertaining film?The Danish Girl is essentially a movie about a woman and a man talking. The man (Eddie Redmayne), who dresses in women's clothes, somehow decides he wants to be a woman, so there's lots to talk about there, right. Or is there? This movie is as dull as the Copenhagen sky in November, and as drab as the characters' frumpy dresses.The film starts off promising enough showing the playful and supposed erotic love between the two main characters, and the awakening interest of Einer in women's things. But just when you start to wonder is this movie about a guy with a fetish for women's clothes, or is the character a transvestite, we are taken slowly down the very heavy handed and oh so melodramatic road to transsexualism. Unfortunately along the way we are treated to the aforementioned non-stop chit chat, mini-hysterics, and drag queen antics in this feature film soap opera. Eddie Redmayne's interpretation of the character doesn't help either. His in your face mugging, preening, cooing, smirking, smiling shyly one moment and camping it up the next leaves the viewer bewildered as to what the heck is going on. If that wasn't awkward enough visually, I couldn't take my eyes off Vikander's horrendous wig. I didn't think Vikander was bald, or was having her in drag supposed to help make Redmayne not look so horrendous? Who knows, who cares. Now here's the kicker: I can honestly say the most interesting character in the entire film was the little dog owned by our stars. It was only during the dog's two close ups, near the end of the film, that I felt anything for anyone up on the screen. If anyone thought it was time for a sensitive film about transsexuals, starring some famous actors, done by a big Hollywood director, they may be right, but The Danish Girl certainly isn't it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting watch,"I enjoyed the film, it was interesting, but I did find Eddie Redmayne really annoying, kept doing this wide eyed look anout, or wide eyes look away that just made him look a bit crazy eyed! The female lead was awesome. Well worth a watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is just for entertainment.....,"This is one of Eddie Redmayne's outstanding acting as The Danish Girl, after his Oscar-winning turn as Stephen Hawking.Observe the movie. Lili seemed like a very selfish person, while Gerda was extremely patient and selfless. I agree with this. Because on real life I have seen numerous people destroyed their families due to this disorder.Will u accept ur family member If he has this problem on real life. Answer yourself without second thought.....",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Does anyone think this is in fact the real Redmayne?,"In his day to day life and he's just pretending to be straight? It's 2024 and I finally watched this movie - the subject matter never interested me and when it came out, people felt quite.. odd. As I did while watching this.Made me feel quite uncomfortable for some reason. I never did see Redmayne as a man's man, like Tom Hardy or Jake G. Or Russell Crowe.As a woman watching, it's an interesting and emotional film to watch, especially feeling for the female co star. Quite heartbreaking and she acted very well. I loved her ever since Anna Karenina.All in all, it's a film to be seen, but u get an unsettling feeling watching it. As a woman, or man, because I watched it with my husband and we both felt the same, icky and uncomfortable.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"What's wrong, cis?","Drama based on the true story of one of the first men to have sex reassignment surgery. The film focuses on the evolving romance, marriage and work of Danish painters Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander).The only draw in this film are the landscapes, sets and environment that are very evocative of the 1920s. Yes, I liked the cinematography. I also liked some of the landscape paintings. And the dog. Everything else looks dull and sleepy. Alicia Vikander really deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress because she solidly shows in her face the suffering that must have been to be part of this production. Eddie Redmayne was nominated for the Oscar for Best Leading Actor but I'm glad it didn't go beyond that, because his job was just to dress up as a woman, paint his face like a clown (at one point I even thought I was watching the Joker), batting his eyelashes and look completely embarrassed and shamefaced about what he was doing - and he might as well be. It was already abysmal enough to have won the Oscar the year before for ""The Theory of Everything"", which people with unfortunately mobility difficulties should be insulted about.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is one off many 2015 overrated movies,"In this movie we follow Einar and Gerda married couple from Demmarck. One day Einar dressed as woman to pose for one Gerda painthings and soon after he dreass in women clothing all the time and he stared using new name Lily. Lily also went on date with man .This is very overrated , the cast is very good and it's overly melodramatic. I dissagre that Lily should be played by transwomen , becouse i doubt that transwomen wanna play character that is not trans from begging off the movie. The big problem off this movie is that it's to fast like it seems that passed few mounts but accually years have passed.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tender gentle candid story of what it feels like to get the wrong body,"This movie was incredible. It grabbed my heart and I felt what it must be like to always wish you were the other gender. The roadblock to happiness. Eddie Redmayne was lilli. His natural moves were feminine, I was completely in awe of his acting ability. I was crying inconsolably at the last 15 minutes of the movie. I s the first time since n a long time that I actually was taken into Lilli's world. His wife was soin love with him.and she was brilliant in her support of her husband. I cried for Gerda, Lilly, and for Everyman who had to hide their feelings and exist in this homophobic world. My uncle was murdered in 1962. He was gay and he was bashed to death by a couple of punks he was 41 years old. And I cried for him. I cried because the shame of his being gay overshadowed the love that his family had for him. How twisted. His life partner was ignored, not invited to the service. That was so wrong. All of it was wrong. I love the people that I love for all their perfection and shortcomings. If they choose a same sex relationship, it is their choice. Not mine. What difference does it make. If he had been accepted for his gayness he would have Had a chance to find happiness.i believe the movie changed my life.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Redmayne, Vikander and Hooper consolidate their success","This film tells the remarkable true story of an early attempt to effect a transgender choice from male to female involving pioneering, but dangerous, gender reassignment surgery.The title is clever. Clearly it refers to Einar Wegener, the early 20th century male landscape painter, who wishes to become Lili Elbe not just through dress and mannerisms but as physically as possible. But the title can also be taken to reference his wife, the portrait artist Gerda Wegener who shows amazing understanding and support. So the headline performance is from British actor Eddie Redmayne as Einar/Lili who, following the Academy Award for his superb acting in ""A Theory Of Everything"", gives another convincing and nuanced representation of a real character. But this should not be allowed to overshadow the impressive acting of the Swedish Alicia Vikander who continues to shine ever more brightly since her break-out English-speaking role in ""Ex Machina"".The British director of the work is Tom Hooper who consolidates his success following ""Les Misérables"" and ""The King's Speech"". Another real talent on this movie is Danny Cohen whose photography is admirable, making subtle use of location shooting in Copenhagen and Brussels.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good performance,"I'll admit that my own personal opinion was ""it was so weird!"" - but ""in a good way!"". Still, I applaud Eddie Redmayne's performance.",,Anonymous,Biography
