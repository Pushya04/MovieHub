Helm's great screenplay and Ferrell's astonishing acting make for an excellent film,"I liked the idea of Stranger than Fiction from the start. And I still like the idea after having seen the film. I was not a big fan of all the huge press first-time screenwriter Zach Helm was getting, but in comparison to the ballooning publicity with Sascha Baron Cohen and Borat!, it was not too bad. I continually looked forward to seeing the film, and am glad that the great trailer did not reveal everything like I had originally assumed.The film involves Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent who lives his life by a very strict routine. One day, he wakes up, and begins to hear a woman narrating all of his actions. Suspicious, Crick continues attempting to live his life out, but after an inexplicable comment in regards to his ""immenent death"", he goes on the hunt for the voice. Randomly spliced into Crick's search is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). She is writing a novel about a character named Harold Crick, and is unknowingly the voice Crick keeps hearing. She is battling a case of writer's block, and spends much of the film attempting to come up with the finale for the character.Unlike many other existential comedies, Fiction is sweet and almost innocent in its design. Yes, the main focus of the film is pretty grim, but the life-altering questions that keep going around during the film do not become anywhere near as depressing and bizarre as those found in the likes of the work of Charlie Kaufman. In a way, Fiction feels a lot like a Kaufman-written film, but lacking in the means of being totally ""out there""; almost like being a decaf as opposed to a regular. As a result, while being an excellent film (albeit slightly predictable), it cannot break past the mold already set by the likes of the absolutely brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It just feels like it is missing that spark that could have sprung it right into the brilliance that all films like this strive for.Going along with the story itself, it feels a little ill-paced in some few instances, but for the most part sucks you right in and keeps you there. It has many comedic elements, and has some great dramatic sequences as well. They all play well, and while I still would not give him a ton of credit, I was very impressed by Helm's first-time effort. His writing feels vibrant and fresh, and in a film industry with absolutely little originality or thought, it is just great that movies like this slip through and get green-lighted. Every piece of dialogue and background feels well expressed, and just play out astonishingly well. On the topic of Crick however, I liked the idea of how neurotic and obsessive Crick was over numbers, but I thought it was a bit of an overkill to include special effect shots showing the numbers being counted within his head. It felt silly in The Da Vinci Code, so why did Sony feel the need to add it here too?On that note, much like my being impressed by Adam Sandler from time to time, Ferrell really pulls through here, and does give the best performance of his short career. The psychological trauma that his character goes through is evident in his facial and body emotions, and the way he conveys it on screen is nowhere near what I would have expected. He brings an amazing sense of what this character is really about, and gives him a poignancy that makes him so life-like that it becomes almost too great to explain. This is a pathetically sad man who you cannot help but pull for as the film goes on. And for all the right reason too. He may deliver some of the funniest lines in the movie, but he is totally mature and at ease in this role. Thankfully this means that he stays serious for the most part throughout the film, and does not let any Ricky Bobby or Ron Bergundy slip out. He could have easily blown it, but thankfully, manages to stay in check.Thompson is another particular standout, especially in contrast to Ferrell. She is broken and weak, searching for the perfect ending. The pain and sorrow that goes through her face as she writes and thinks has a poetic excellence to it, and she only continues to prove how good of an actor she is. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah work well in supporting roles, supporting Ferrell and Thompson respectively as the film progresses on. Hoffman has always had great comedic timing, and he does not let it go to waste here. He plays right off of Ferrell in grand ways, and just feels totally at home in the role. Latifah, while not in the film so much, is very good in her bit parts. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines here, and clearly has the makings for an Oscar sometime in the late future.For its small problems, Fiction still is able to prove its worth, and is clearly one of the best films of the year. It will be able to stand proud among the other entries in the existential comedy genre, or just stand proud on its own. Helm's screenplay coupled in with an intoxicatingly great performance by Ferrell make for a great trip to the movies. And sure beats some of the crap that's been released over the past few weeks.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Detailed, Astute, Eclectic, and Entertaining Pseudo-Comedy","""Stranger than Fiction"" is the complex tale of a simple IRS man named Harold Crick (an appealing Will Ferrel) who one day awakes to his own voice-over narration only to find he is the unwitting main character in the new tragic novel from acclaimed author Karen Eiffel (an excellent return to form for Emma Thompson). Imagine a Charlie Kaufman penned film where all the cynicism and nihilism is replaced with an endearing and heartfelt melancholy that creates a surprising amount of emotional involvement in characters who would've otherwise been over-reaching literacy devices, and you'll get a feel for the sincere type of entertainment Marc Forster's film provides.Forster, with his keen eye and eclectic visual sense, populates the film the sharp and contrasting visual angles, camera tricks, and in-frame oddities (like the play with numbers) constantly keeping the viewer engaged and on their toes. Fun supporting turns from Dustin Hoffman as a literary theorist employed by Krick to help find out if the story he is in is a comedy or tragedy, and Queen Latifah as Eiffel's no-nonsense publishing assistant help guide the viewers through imaginative stretches that are occasionally too clever by half. Ferrel gets to show some nice range here, and much like Robin Williams did with ""The World According to Garp"" and Jim Carrey did with ""The Truman Show,"" graduates with honors into more high-minded quasi-serious roles. His co-lead Thompson is subtly method and well studied as the reclusive sociopathic author who just can't help killing her characters.What really seals the deal is Maggie Gyllenhal as Farrell's love interest, the anti-establishment baker he is assigned to audit. She literally lights up the screen. There's one expertly framed and perfectly lit shot of her standing outside her townhouse inviting Farrel in for the night where the light from street lamp off screen is filtered in through the shadows of tree branches and hits her face in such a way that in that brief flickering frame you become insanely happy to be watching such a pleasant marriage of literary concepts inside a visual medium. At this point you don't care how the film ends. You're just grateful to experience that giddy moment of pure movie entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is a balm for the pessimistic.,"As the years have gone on I have come to realize that this, not the original Star Wars, is my favorite movie. And, having just re-watched it for the umpteenth time, I decided it was high time I left a review somewhere.
I am a cynical person, I don't believe in a lot, I don't believe in love at first sight, or the power of the human spirit, or in humanity in general really.
My brother tells me that makes me a misanthrope, and I don't disagree.
If I sit down to watch Star Wars for example, I can't help but loudly and frequently pick apart its many flaws: the hammy acting from the extras, the dated special effects, the story as a whole, yadda yadda.
But every. single. time. I sit down to watch Stranger than Fiction I find it akin to slipping my aching body into a warm bath after a looong day, my jaded personality submerging beneath the gentle and comforting weight of the familiar story.
Will Farrell is a clown most days, making such masterpieces as Anchorman and Ricky Bobby (that was sarcasm), but in this movie he stands shoulder to shoulder with cinematic giants like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson and he SHINES as Harold Crick, his performance subtle and low key, but poignant and introspective.
This of course stands in contrast to Maggie Gyllenhaal's 'Miss Pascal': so vibrant and full of life, with a kind and warm personality that is undiminished by an occasionally fiery temper. Whenever she comes on screen with her passion and femininity I can't help but empathize with Harold, because with each touch and sigh from Maggie I inevitably want her as badly as he does.
The two of them coming together is like that bath we talked about, or a hug from someone you love after far too long apart. But setting aside the love interest, the story itself is so much fun to experience: that of a character who is not supposed to know about his impending demise, yet does, and how that knowledge spurs him to embrace his life, however long it shall be.
Sentimental? Absolutely. So what?
10 Stars. People more cynical then myself will throw shade at this film, and I strongly urge them to go and eat a cookie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Must See!,"This movie was such a great surprise! I saw this at an advanced screening just days after suffering through Marie Antoinette. What a pleasant escape! The cast did an outstanding job. Who doesn't love Will Ferrell, but to see him in this role gives me a whole new level of respect for him as an actor. He simply shines on screen! Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight. Emma Thompson is brilliant as always. Simply wonderful! The writing was terrific. It was so nice to see a movie that could make you laugh and think (not too hard) at the same time. Direction was well done as well - it was even visually appropriate.Go see it and take a friend. You will laugh and be happy for a change after leaving a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strangely Addicting,"With his unassuming eyes and sheepish, ""awe shucks!"" demeanor, Will Ferrell is quite simply the guy you root forthe eternal boy trapped in a gangly 6'3"" frame. Just a single look can make you giggle and smile so effortlessly that you're often unaware that you're actually doing it. It is with this notion that Stranger than FictionFerrell's first major foray into a theatrical world outside the realm of in-your-face frat boy sillinessjust makes sense. By surrounding Ferrell's charisma with a subdued, darkly comic script and a talented supporting cast, we get a film that is both fresh and heartfelt.Directed by Marc Forster and penned by Zach Helm, Stranger than Fiction is an odd mix-mash, combining a standard comedy with existentialist ideas. Number crunching IRS agent and genuine loser, Harold Crick (Ferrell) one day wakes up to find his life being narrated word for word by burnt out writer Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Odd thing is, Eiffel is writing an actual book where Crick just happens to be the main character. To make matters worse, she plans on killing him off as soon as she can make it through a particularly arduous stretch of writer's block.Originality is one thing that is absent from a majority of contemporary Hollywood pictures, so Fiction immediately gets points for simply trying something different. I suppose it's icing on the cake that the film is genuinely good. Crick, knowing that is death is imminent, begins to break out of his cloistered shell and to experience the fruits of his life. And, in the process he forms a bond with a tax breaking baker (Gyllenhal) and seeks advice from a literature professor, played by a particularly charming Dustin HoffmanHowever, even though it is well intentioned, the execution isn't flawless. The romance that develops between Gyllenhal's outcast baker and Ferrell's strait-laced Crick doesn't feel entirely organic. We admire the relationship and smile at its sugar coated sweetness, but we don't necessarily believe their connection. It may taste good, but it doesn't exactly wash down smoothly. Neither, does the film's over reliance on reinforcing generic, ""Carpe Diem"" philosophies. Towards the second act, things do get sappy. Luckily, by the conclusion, the plot has bounced back to a wonderful limbo of both oddly comic and genuinely heartwarming moments.For all its flaws, Stranger than Fiction, works. Like a good novel, Forster has fashioned something that is strange, stylistic, and unexpectedly inspiring. And, despite the chinks in its existentialist armor, that's surely something worth writing home about.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clever intellectual wizardry,"What if you only realised the importance of your life only days before you lost it? Even knowing when or how you will die (not such a fatuous idea with the completion of the Genome Project) raises difficult questions about how much we really want to know about ourselves.Such a theme is usually simplified and subsumed into religious-based tales such as It's a Wonderful Life, but taken as an idea in its own right it has considerable intellectual weight. Harold Crick finds himself the main character in a story as it unfolds, but his annoyance quickly shifts gear as he is aware of the author saying, ""Little did he know . . . it would lead to his imminent death.""Not the mindless comedy that the trailer suggests, Stranger Than Fiction is a precise and fairly cerebral story where the laughs stem more from individually appreciating certain aspects of its cleverness rather than any contrived humour.The surface story is of a man who lives a humdrum if 'successful' life and is awakened to a more three dimensional existence by falling in love. The additional elements will either delight or annoy. IRS auditor Crick (Will Ferrell) starts hearing a voice in his head. It is that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a famous author. She describes exactly what he is doing but with a rather better vocabulary than he possesses. When she announces his imminent death, he takes drastic steps to meet her and persuade her to change the ending of her novel.The characterisation, casting and acting is spot-on. Thompson is at her most refreshingly deranged as the harassed and reclusive author. With a literary equivalence of method acting, Eiffel balances on the edge of her desk trying to imagine the thoughts of someone about to make a suicide jump. She sits in the freezing drizzle watching cars cross a bridge to imagine an accident. Her rants at her 'editorial assistant' (who uses more traditional methods of accessing imagination) give a convincing insight into the creative process. While the voice in Crick's head is stereotypical Thompson, the fuller, isolated character, when we meet her, is a minor revelation. ""I don't need a nicotine patch,"" she declaims angrily to her assistant. ""I smoke cigarettes.""Maggie Gyllenhaal, as law drop-out turned baker Ana Pascal, sparkles, glows and is sexily alluring and radiant with passionate love of life - and she manages to light up the screen faster than, say, even Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. Dustin Hoffman has the least challenging of the main parts, but he endows his character (an eminent professor of literature) with the gravitas needed to take ideas of literary interconnectedness seriously. Will Ferrell gives a remarkable break-out performance in a straight role, reminiscent of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. He is superbly suited to the part as audiences expect him to be a shallow comedy character and here he is trying the find the substantial person inside himself. Most of the audience are concentrating so much on the film's intricate hypothesis and how it is worked out, that only afterwards do we realise what a range of emotions Ferrell has to portray with complete seriousness.Novelist Kay Eiffel (Thompson) anthropomorphises things like Crick's watch (similarly the official website says, in real time, ""As the cursor waited anxiously for the site to load, it couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of elation."") We sense a life-imbuing process that might even be likened to what an actor does with his character; but the film goes a stage further by drawing a similarity with the essentially lifeless, clockwork existence of the IRS auditor whose only escape is discovering love with Pascal. His quest is aided by fictional plot analysis from Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) and of course begs the question, what is fiction?Director Marc Forster showed consummate skill in portraying the positive escapism of JM Barrie's creative Peter-Pan-writing in Finding Neverland. With Stranger Than Fiction, he has teamed up with brilliant new dramatist Zach Helm. Helm is fascinated with the writing process in what he calls a larger Post-Modern movement. ""From Pirandello, to Brecht, to Wilder, to Stoppard, to Woody Allen to Wes Anderson, we can see the progression of a contemporary, self-aware, reality-bending and audience-involving wave in dramatic literature,"" he says. ""I love to see Homer Simpson reacting to his creator, Matt Groenig, or the cast of 'Urinetown' complaining from the stage about their own title.""Even the street names, business names, and the characters' last names of Stranger Than Fiction are significant  Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, Banneker, Kronecker, Cayly, etc. are all puns on mathematicians who focused on the innate order of things. The invitation is to ask what is beyond the symmetry of things.Stranger Than Fiction meets even its most formidable challenge - making the ending nail-biting and moving after such surreal content. But the ultimate message of the film seems a little trite if it is supposedly coming from a groundbreaking author. Like the glimpses of Eiffel's book, we are given impressive mountains of style but little substance. As the film doesn't press the strengths forcefully by admitting in so many words what it is getting at, there is a chance you may not bother with the subtleties - in which case it adds up to very little.A superb testament to inventiveness and worthy of awards in many different categories, Stranger Than Fiction somehow falls short of being a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Saw it this evening at the Merrill Lynch Conference,"I saw an advanced screening of Stranger than Fiction tonight on the Sony lot, as part of the Merrill Lynch media conference being held this week in Pasadena, CA.I hadn't heard much about this movie prior to seeing it tonight, so I had NO expectations, which is really how I like to see a movie (without any preconceived notions, good or bad).The movie was very well acted, and told an interesting story. I kind of look at Will Ferrell in this movie the way I looked at Adam Sandler after ""Punch Drunk Love"". You're not sure how to react to Ferrell/Sandler's on-screen persona's, as up to this point, you've always thought of them as the funny men, who couldn't (or wouldn't) attempt a more dramatic role. For Ferrell, who's probably at the height of his popularity, this was a good move for him, as well as an ideal role.All in all, I really liked this movie, and I would definitely recommend it to friends/family.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A missed opportunity for greatness.,"As the cinematic writing debut of Zach Helm, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" may very well have the most creative storyline of the year. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a nondescript IRS agent who awakes one day to hear a woman narrating much of his life. Unbeknownst to him at the time, the voice belongs to a well-known author who routinely kills her main characters in her novels. No big deal, except for the fact that he soon learns of his fate. That of course horrifies him, and he spends the majority of the film coping with that inevitability.Unfortunately the lofty possibilities raised by such a fantastically original idea are never fully explored. ""Stranger"" doesn't take the time to delve into the life-and-death complexities that could arise from a man searching for the why and who behind his future demise. Nor does it address most of the unique moral questions and obligations that would arise. Instead the script settles for clichés like a typically rushed cinematic romance, premises that aren't all that bad, but are more suited to be side stories, not main arcs. These shortcomings glaringly keep Stranger from reaching the Oscar-winning level of something like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or other Charlie Kaufman work. In fact this movie might be best described as Diet Charlie Kaufman, a pop psychological movie, a thinking movie for those who don't really want to think.As Adam Sandler did for ""Punch-Drunk Love"", Will Ferrell will no doubt receive heaps of praise for his portrayal of IRS agent Harold Crick. Make no mistake, Ferrell is fine, but don't let anyone convince you this is an Oscar-worthy turn. The simple fact that he plays it straight, without getting nearly naked or over-reacting doesn't automatically create a great performance. The reality is that while he has his moments, Ferrell is the straight man in this picture, a tepid character who contrasts well with Maggie Gyllenhaal's anarchist baker Anna, Dustin Hoffman's Yoda of literature professor, and Emma Thompson's work as author Kay Eiffel, which results in the best performance in the film. She lends the part a wackiness that seems genuinely fresh, in odd, unteachable ways like how she touches both sides of a door frame when passing. She acts crazy enough but not so crazy that you sense the acting as she neurotically haggles over how she can kill off her protagonist.In the end, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is like Anna's cookies. They both taste good at the time, as the movie does have its humorous and entertaining moments, but their long term value is limited due to their lack of nutrition. Nothing here is going to linger, but if you're interested, you won't be sorry you saw it.Bottom Line: A missed opportunity, but still worth a rental or cheap theater ticket. 6 of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
TIFF Screening,"Saw it at The Toronto International Film Festival and it was well done. Original storyline, fantastic performance from Ferrel, Thompson and Hoffman. The most moving performance from Will Ferrel I have ever seen is within this film. The storyline some may believe to be too far fetched at first to take seriously, but in the end it does work. What makes the film work the most are the brilliant performances from Ferrel and Thompson. Without these two- the film couldn't have been pulled off! I recommend this flick to anyone looking to laugh and cry and then laugh again. It was a truly brilliant film. 10/10 (Hoffman and Ferrel were too kind to shake hands and greet the fans inside the screening as well.)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dramatic success eludes Charlie Kaufman clone,"In spite of ""Stranger Than Fiction's"" several charming scenes, especially those between Maggie Gyllenhaal and Will Ferrell, it ultimately underwhelms with its own insignificance.""Stranger Than Fiction"" does not leave the viewer with any lasting impression. It feels like a Wal-Mart version of a Charlie Kaufman film, metaphysics for the masses if you will. Kaufman's masterworks: ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are arguably as influential to modern film-making as ""Pulp Fiction"". And they are all light-years ahead of this film. Which is simply derivative without delivering anything new to audiences.This Kaufman-lite for the faint of heart who don't want to watch anything too psychologically revealing has the potential to be much more than what it is: a light hearted stroll through the unconscious mind, with little more than a blue bird on its shoulder. Unfortunately for film-lovers, it never goes beyond its goal of converting audiences into happy movie-goers.Although Ferrell is entertaining through out, it is Gyllenhaal who resonates in this film with a magnetic performance as a counter-culture baker. Dustin Hoffman also seems lost here in the role of a cutesy professor adding bits of schtick, as if it were left to him to pick up the comedic slack left by Ferrell. Emma Thompson's writer's blocked author suits the role well, but is the character most clipped by a gutless script. The appearance of Queen Latifa as her strict, corporate ""unblocker"" is bland and out-of-place in this film.In terms of leading dramatic performances by a comic actor, the hat is tipped to Jim Carrey's work in ""...Spotless mind"". His performance in that film is a full-blown dramatic characterization. Whereas Ferrell's dead pan attempt at ""serious"" acting is just that. It always feels like a comedian playing straight, rather than an actor realizing a character.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Additionally, the writing kept me guessing the whole time and involved an interesting and unique thought-experiment: What if you heard someone narrating your life?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good and very unexpected,"I have been very surprised recently that I have actually enjoyed several Will Ferrell movies. Why surprised? Well, to put it bluntly, most films made by ex-Saturday Night Live performers have been pretty wretched (though there are some exceptions) and I usually avoid them like the plague. With films like DR. DETROIT, NEIGHBORS, A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY, FUNNY FARM, BEST DEFENSE, HERE'S PAT, etc., it's easy to understand my misgivings. However, despite my strong bias, I must admit I really enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS as well as STRANGER THAN FICTION--though they are both very, very different movies.While TALLADEGA NIGHTS is extremely silly and a great parody, STRANGER THAN FICTION is not exactly a comedy, though it has some nice comedic moments. Instead, it's a fantasy, comedy and romance all rolled into one and it was nice to see Ferrell finally underplay a role. His character was extremely obsessive-compulsive and emotionally constricted--yet this was NOT played for laughs--an excellent decision.The film initially seems a lot like the old skits on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" which featured a writer typing a story and you saw actors playing it out as if they were real. However, the simple story idea was drawn out but didn't seem padded and offered some lovely insights into deeper philosophical issues. It was NOT a film for dopey teens or an undemanding audience, but a thoughtful and intelligently constructed film that caught my interest.If you are looking for screwball comedy or lots of laughs, then you will no doubt be disappointed. However, if you watch the film with few preconceptions and expectations and have an open mind, I am sure you'll enjoy the film. It's nice to see that I was wrong about the film and the ""SNL curse"" did not seem to apply.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Helm and Forster: The New Kaufman and Jonze?,"I saw STRANGER THAN FICTION (STF) on its opening weekend, and I think it's one of the most engaging, funny, poignant movies about writing, the creative process, and human nature I've seen since ADAPTATION. While Will Ferrell is a fave in our household, I must admit this is the first time I've seen him in a movie and thought of him as the character he's playing, not as Will Ferrell. Toning down his screechy/crazy qualities without losing his ability to make audiences laugh, Ferrell stars as unassuming IRS agent Harold Crick, who loves his job, so you know his life needs an overhaul! :-) Even Harold's curly-topped sidewall haircut seems to hint that his well-ordered life is about to dissolve into craziness. One morning, it does, amid FIGHT CLUB-style captions and the plummy, ironic tones of a British female narrator accompanying Harold's thoughts and actions in the opening scene -- narration that Harold can hear along with those of us in the audience. Our increasingly puzzled, alarmed hero soon realizes he's the protagonist in a novelist's new book-in-progress -- not just any novelist, but the reclusive Karen ""Kay"" Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who's been suffering from writer's block for 10 years and whose novels always end with her protagonists dying! As Kay's publisher sends compassionate but no-nonsense troubleshooter Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to help unblock her, Harold seeks help from literary professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), an expert on the problematic author's favorite phrase ""Little did he know..."" It might be a subject especially dear to a writer's heart (especially in gags like Hilbert questioning Harold on standard literary devices to see if he's the hero of a comedy or a tragedy: ""Have you been invited to a country house and had to solve a murder?...To find out what story you're in, I have to find out what stories you're *not* in...""), but I found STF funny, touching, and playfully surreal as director Marc Forster and screenwriter Zach Helm prove to be the new Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, only with a touch of sweetness. In addition to the excellent Ferrell, Hoffman, Thompson, and Queen Latifah, the great cast includes Linda Hunt and an all-but-unrecognizable Tom Hulce as well-meaning but unhelpful psychiatrists, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana, an anti-establishment baker who refuses to pay taxes on munitions (The Clash's ""Death or Glory"" plays in the background when Harold visits her bakery to audit her, only to be booed and heckled by Ana and her customers. Later, Harold wins Ana over by bringing her flours -- that's right, flours, not flowers! :-). There's nice location shooting in Chicago, too. STF is well worth heading out to a theater to see, and when it inevitably comes out on home video, it'll definitely be in the Writers' Movies section of my DVD collection alongside ADAPTATION, THE SINGING DETECTIVE, and the underrated ALEX AND EMMA!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great script,"I saw this film at the Chicago Film Festival opening last night. I went not knowing a thing about it in advance, and was pleasantly surprised. I'd suggest that people DON'T read specifics about this film before seeing it.The story/script is fantastic - I'd be surprised if it didn't get nominated for the big original screenplay awards. It's interesting, funny, poignant, and quite charming, actually.The casting in general is wonderful... As someone else said, Hoffman is perfectly understated... I'd never seen Maggie Gyllenhaal before, but I'm a fan after seeing this one. And Emma Thompson could see a best supporting actress nod for this film.Sadly, I thought the film's weakest point was the casting of Will Ferrell in the lead. He's not bad by any means, but he just doesn't work at the same level as the rest of the cast. Kudos to him for what he DOES accomplish in this film, but it would've had plenty of starpower without him, and the role could've been used to showcase someone else's talent.All in all, thumbs up.Just my two cents.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"has a good mix of whimsy and pathos, an excellent Ferrell performance, if less than stellar overall","I'd recommend Stranger Than Fiction, especially if you're a fan of its stars. It also speaks to a good career ahead for first-time screenwriter Zak Helm. That it also is that old, over-used statement- the parts more entertaining than the whole- is maybe in part attributable to an inherent structural flaw in the script. After I left the movie I did think about how a person's will may be dictated or not, or what really carries that man to do what he decides to do, or if he tries to do nothing at all (which Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell, does to no avail). Because the story itself is about contrivance, their is an ever-looming air of contrivance in the script too.It's hard to explain exactly, and Helm was wise to avoid certain pit-falls, such as really giving a 'logical' explanation to how the narrator's writing sticks into Crick's head in the first place, or that it might not just collapse once writer and 'character' meet. But there's still some things that I found a little troublesome- for example, does the narrator dictate the little things that Crick does, or would Crick just do them anyway? What I mean is, how much is determined by what is written or not. There is also the air of questioning where these characters are outside of their set spots in the screenplay- and Crick, albeit not without some interest is not really the kind of character I would think would make for a great subject for a book by a presumably well-renown, recluse author (played in the best way possible in the one-note terms by Emma Thompson).For the sake of Crick's central change from being very calculated, precisely so, early on, to becoming a man much more based on how he wants to live his life not based rigidly on structure- even in the structure of 'little did he know', which is kind of amusing as a writer myself- there is that sort of contrivance anyway. Yet at the same time, individual scenes are very well written though, and given fresh life by the cast.Ferrell here, of course, is showing much more of his talents than usual, at doing much more of a grounded, every-day kind of guy who has the extraordinary happen to him. He's always convincing in the part, even in scenes that are awkward or made to really pull up more of his talents than usual. That I would still have a very slight preference for his comedy roles and skills as a satirist/performer may be just subjective, though this- plus his underrated turn in Melinda & Melinda- goes to relay how he can play genuine just as well as silly and fearlessly stupid. Hoffman, as the literature professor who helps out Crick through his crisis at points, is also very good, and their scenes together were some of my favorite in the film. Gyllenhaal works well too as the romantic side for Crick's change in self.So really, it's a worthwhile trip into what was appropriately called by one critic as 'Charlie Kaufman-lite', as it goes to lengths to be an original work, but at the same time one can't help but know how things will turn out in the end, if only from the immense heap of circumstance given clairvoyance, or vice versa, and that it is, in the end, a work out of Hollywood. Marc Foster's direction does go for little odd touches to add to Helm's writing, such as numbers and lines and such on screen in fast fashion to show Crick's mind working in the form of his life early on.And the watch means probably as much as the gold watch did in Pulp Fiction in the sense of what it will lead to for the character. That it doesn't feel though completely satisfying in its sort of original send-up is understandable, but partly forgivable; it's the kind of work that gives talented actors some fun and variety, and there are at least a few truly laugh-out-loud funny moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful film that works as both a comedy and a drama,"I first saw Stranger Than Fiction because it had a concept that I was really intrigued by. But I was intrepid too in approaching it, as apart from the odd decent, funny movie like Elf I am not a fan of Will Ferrell. But what a surprise since Stranger Than Fiction does work wonderfully.I needn't have worried about Ferrell either, as he abandons the somewhat tired shtick that spoilt movies like The Other Guys and goes for the more understated approach. The result is a both funny and moving performance and perhaps his best role in his best movie. He is very well supported by an alluring Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffmann who here is more tick-riddled in an enjoyable way than ever before.Not only that, Stranger than Fiction works as both a comedy and a drama. The comedic elements are genuinely funny and the dramatic elements are poignant and affecting without falling into mawkish over-sentimentality. The premise is very inspired and loopy, following in the footsteps of Being John Malkovich and I Heart Huckabees, and avoids falling into forced intellectual whimsy, and it is well-rounded off.The production values are beautiful and striking and captured lovingly by the tight editing. The soundtrack is very beguiling with faithful instrumental versions and inspired song choices that don't spoil the mood of the film. The script is just great, and succeeds in being funny and poignant, and Marc Forster's understated direction makes it one of his better and more focused directorial efforts.Stranger Than Fiction could have been shorter perhaps by about 7 or so minutes, but overall it is a wonderful film but several aspects made it work when I wasn't expecting them to. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Involving Story &  Great Low-Key Performance By Ferrell,"Most times, I find it interesting to watch a comedian pay a dramatic role. Here, will Ferrell plays an extremely straight, low-key character: an IRS agent who is part of a as strange story. Yes, the title to this movie is 100 percent accurate: ""Stranger Than Fiction really describes this bizarre tale of a man whose life is being lived out as a writer of fiction stories types it up. In other words, the fiction writer's main character is a real-life guy.Emma Thompson comes out of semi-retirement to play the role of ""Karen Eiffel,"" a writer whose novels always end up with the hero getting killed. Also, she narrates the story to the lead character, who is the only one who can actually hear her voice. Slowly, as the story unravels, her latest subject, a ""Harold Crick"" (Farrell) discovers what is going on and tries to get her to change the ending! Along the way, in a secondary part of the film (the romance angle), ""Crick"" becomes involved with the unlikeliest of women: ""Asa Pascal"" (Maggie Gyllenhall).Crick also makes a new friend who is an expert on authors. He seeks him out because that guy, ""Professor Jules Hilbert,"" (Dustin Hoffman) is the one who helps him discover whom the author is, the person who plans to kill him off. (It's not easy to explain all of this in a handful of sentences, written off the cuff. Sorry.)This all may sound like a suspenseful thriller but it isn't. It's a human-interest story which could have many interpretations. I read a few long reviews (not here) on this movie afterward and got two very diverse viewpoints: one with religious overtones and other totally secular. I didn't read anything into this except it being an interesting and original screenplay and well- acted.Ferrell was outstanding in his performance. I'm not really a fan of his irreverent comedies but I was very impressed with him in this movie. The only unlikable character was Thompson's but she comes around with a nice touch near the end.If you are looking for something different, and something to get your brain working a little bit, this is recommended. For those expecting the normal Will Ferrell wackiness, stay away: it's hardly that. I hate to use the cliché phrase ""thought-provoking,"" but I think it applies here.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

worse than a good film,"Pitching itself alongside the films of Charlie Kaufman and low-fi indie hits such as 'Thumbsucker' this film doesn't have the charms of 'Eternal Sunshine' or the central performance of say 'The Truman show'. Where as Jim Carey brought a certain lovable quality to both his roles in said films, Will Ferrell just brings dumb. The film starts well with quirky graphics overlaid on the action as Emma Thompson narrates the life of Ferrell's Harold Crick, a stuck up taxman who doesn't live but exists. The whole premise of the film is that Emma Thompson who is writing the story is trying to kill off Harold but as he gets wind of it and starts to live his life he doesn't want this to happen so sets out to change his own destiny. Enlisting the help of Dustin Hoffman who is basically revisiting the character he played in 'I heart huckabees' the films few highlights come from the two of them trying to figure out what kind of book Harold is in, in a series of bizarre literary conversations. But what starts as a promising philosophical dark comedy fast turns into a slushy 'Love Actually' type live for the day because you don't know how long you've got melodrama. At no point in the film do you believe that free-thinking radical none tax paying tattooed young beauty played by Maggie Gyllenhaal would ever fall for the old grey boring Ferrell, let alone start to turn his life around, even though they do say opposites attract. OK it makes you think a bit, it may even make you laugh, but it lacks the style it pretends to have and by the end just falls flat on its (head so far up it's own) arse.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Highly Intelligent, Disarmingly Tender","The wonderful and disarmingly tender ""Stranger Than Fiction"" marries an inspired concept and a wisely goofball-avoidant script with some of the better actors this or any modern dramedy could hope to assemble.As Harold Crick, Will Ferrell inhabits his best role since ""Elf."" Crick is a poster child for OCD introversion, fixated on observing rigid routines and numerical drivers as a means by which to structure his own life -- he counts the strokes when brushing his teeth, and as an IRS employee, his mind is populated by large mathematical formulas he then leverages in his chronic over-arrangement. True to life, his obsession with regimentation comes at the expense of meaningful relationships with other humans. But the catalytic story driver to ""Stranger Than Fiction"" arrives with the revelation that Harold is in fact a book character; a development he only learns of once his head starts hearing the play-by-play narration of his daily life as provided by the book's author, Kay Eiffel (the great Emma Thompson). It's a curveball concept seemingly all-too-ripe for wacky, exploitative comedy, particularly with generationally magnificent comedic actor Ferrell as its hood ornament. But the creative team smartly steers clear of that easiness, directing the film instead in its pursuit of the truly touching: We're enthralled with Harold's resilience when he seeks counsel from a literary professor (wonderfully embodied by Dustin Hoffman) in an attempt to sort out whether his life's through-line is destined for the tragic or comedic. In a terrific plot twist, Harold's existential stumbling leads him to truly meaningful love, found in the warm-heartedness of a baker (the great Maggie Gyllenhaal at the height of her powers).Of the many strengths of ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" its fantastical plot constructs smoothed for a mass audience is its arguable shining star. This is a highly intelligent film, and in so many ways, a refreshing and reinvigorating one. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful.""

One of the best films I have seen in a long time,"This movie is billed as a comedy in trailers and it's choice of cast supports this idea. The fact is this movie is one of the most tear jerking movies I have ever seen.This movie starts out with a humorous tone similar to READING ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Gallaxy"" and slowly you start to feel for the main characters and understand how sad they are. Unlike a great deal of movies that are sad this one does not deliver a punch at the end to get the viewers crying. It starts much earlier.I spent most of my time fighting off tears while watching this movie but I could not tear myself away. It took me a bit to recover after the end and all I could say is ""Wow.""The casting for this movie could not have been any better. Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson all delivered some of the best acting seen for years. Will Ferrell in particular has followed many comedy actors like Robin Williams and proves that he is more than a slapstick joker.This movie needs some awards, big time.

"STRANGER THAN FICTION (Marc Forster, 2006) ***","While I had greatly enjoyed  and admired  Forster's previous film, FINDING NEVERLAND (2004), it took some nudging from the owner of my local DVD rental outlet to catch this film! His turned out to have been good advice as I found it to be quirky, delightful, intelligent and original; somewhat in the vein of ADAPTATION (2002) but with a more optimistic outlook.I had never watched any of Will Ferrell's star vehicles before, but he really nailed every facet of his character here (and was thus a deserving Golden Globe nominee); similar care has been applied to the supporting cast: a charming Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman (who had also appeared in FINDING NEVERLAND), a slightly overstated Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah (who, surprisingly, keeps a reasonably low profile throughout).Ultimately, though somewhat overlong, I feel that STRANGER THAN FICTION was perhaps more deserving of the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay than LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (2006)except that it wasn't even nominated!  but, at least, the quality of Zach Helm's work has been recognized by being one of the 5 finalists for the WGA (Writers' Guild of America) award, while the National Board Of Review deemed it the year's best.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good movie,"IMO one of the best movies Will Ferrell has ever done. This isn't your typical Ferrell movie folks. Stranger Than Fiction is a fantastic comedy from start to finish, and from the story to the characters. The idea of the movie alone is interesting and Forster and this cast pull it off well. One of my favorite parts of this movie is of course Emma Thompson being the writer unknowingly deciding his fate and Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as Ferrell's love interest. Ferrell is actually directed brilliantly by Forster who keeps him tamed and used effectively.All in all if your a fan of will ferret I recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Drearier Than Reality,"I found myself staring at the screen in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and waiting for something imaginative to happen. And it never did. I found myself daydreaming about how hysterical the outtakes must have been between such strong performers as Ferrell, Hoffman, Latifah, Thompson, and Gyllenthaal. But I sensed no magic. Now there are those who have praised this film as a mind bending experience akin to ""The Truman Show"", or ""Adaptation"". Whatever. Those were films that delighted their audience while challenging concepts of movie watching. It is not too smart, come on. Did the bakery anarchist need to drop out of HARVARD LAW SCHOOL for us to respect her? Amateurish. And Director Marc Forster paints his images in sepia dreary browns and rainy days. The professor MUST be a PROFESSOR because he drinks lots of coffee and has lots of books. The writer must be a WRITER because she chain smokes and thinks of DEATH. And poor Queen Latifah must have been standing around holding her umbrella wondering how she got in this boring movie in role that has her playing a modernized mammy. I blame a wasted two hours of my Saturday night on Marc Forster who did great work in the past, but here strived for something that didn't happen. Who hires Will Ferrell, puts min in a surreal comedy and asks him to act dull and boring the entire time? I hope others don't go see this film looking for a Will Ferrell comedy in a Charlie Kaufman script because they will be sadly disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't need a nicotine patch. I smoke cigarettes.,"Of course this film had to end the way it did. If not, then all those existential musings of the author would not mean much.

Little Did He Know,"For twelve years, the methodic IRF agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) has had a routine lonely life guided by his wristwatch.

The quest for life of Harold Crick is fantastic, blending a great humor, wonderful lines, literature and a dramatic situation supported by a magnificent music score. The connection of Harold Crick with his wristwatch recalled me a tale of Julio Cortázar's ""Historias de Cronopios y de Fama"", where the author recalls the day that he was given as a gift to his wristwatch. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Mais Estranho Que a Ficção"" (""Stranger Than Fiction"")",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Masterpiece,"This movie is very interesting. The movie had the courage to engage something different and to reject the classic Hollywood form. This is a strange mix of a little bit darker and more subtle comedy with dramatic moments that revolve around existential ideas. The acting is on a high quality, especially Will Farrell. Will give's a partially serious performance in order to gain a more dramatic and cynical role. Something like Jim Carrey in ""The_Truman_Show"". Just like the theme around which the movie revolves; this movie is like a good novel. Excellent, stylish, strange and unexpectedly inspiring. In addition to all of its dark and existential moments, the movie manages to be funny and likable. I recommend the movie to everyone. Its an appreciated masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pleasant but unremarkable,Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a routine driven IRS auditor. The movie starts with a narrator (Emma Thompson) but then he starts hearing her voice one day while brushing his teeth. He is distressed by the voice and breaks him out of his routine. He breaks out of his lonely isolated life when he audits wild angry baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who refuses to pay the part of her taxes for national defense. It turns out that the voice belongs to writer Karen Eiffel. The publisher hired Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) as her assistant. She's blocked trying to figure out how to write Harold Crick's death. Harold is sent to literary professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) for help.This feels like a Charlie Kaufman movie except he would have done something more than simple quirky. Director Marc Forster makes a pleasant if somewhat unremarkable movie. It's well made visually simplified film. The sterile feel leaves the movie without the required warmth. Will Ferrell is playing the everyman. This is more quirky than funny. It has a couple of chuckles but nothing too outstanding.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Didn't quite do it for me,"First of all, I'm delighted that a film like this got made at all. It doesn't comfortably sit in any mainstream genre - it's downright quirky, and you don't often see the cash forthcoming for a movie without a defined audience. I liked this story.Second, I'm beginning to think that Will Ferrell is an actor with an astonishing range. I've tended not to like much of what he's done in the past, but I'm coming to understand that this is because I have intensely disliked the characters he's played, and he's played them very well. His character here is much more sympathetic and has an interesting development curve: starting as a cypher (as his written character is, of course, at the start) he fleshes out nicely throughout the film. There is scope for a great deal of subtlety in his performance, and Ferrell delivers.Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an attractive performance in a slightly underwritten role, and Dustin Hoffman delivers an OK performance in a very underwritten role. Queen Latifah does well in a role which is hardly there at all.I don't know if Emma Thompson's performance was what was written, what the director specified, or what she judged was needed - it may be exactly what was intended but, if so, what was intended (and whoever intended it), it was awful. Twitchy, neurotic, depressed - not a character it was easy to feel any sympathy with. And I didn't.My main problem is that I never fully engaged with the story because I never really felt that it did as much with the concept as I wanted it to. From the charming quirky start, by the final act I felt it had moved into the mainstream and become not so much predictable as conventional. The originality of plot and delivery at the start wasn't sustained through the film's full length.For all that, I spent most of the running time with a smile on my face, and for all the right reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You won't believe your eyes...,"Nobody likes Harold Crick.Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent who is a genius at math. If someone shoots two numbers at them, he will multiply them instantly with the correct answer. He has a wristwatch that he depends on everything for. He wakes up, gets on the bus to go to work, and falls asleep all at precise times down to the second that if he misses, his day will be forever messed up. His schedule repeats every single day of his life. Oh yeah, and Harold hears voices too. It's almost as like someone is narrating his dull life...not telling him what will happen, but what already happened. This voice comes and goes at seemingly random times. One day Harold is re-setting his wristwatch after it randomly shut off while waiting for the bus when the voice says ""Little did he know, this simply seeming innocent act would result in his imminent death."" When Harold hears this, he begins to fear his death obsessively. But he is not sure what to do.It turns out the voice is real. It is the voice of author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who has a bad case of writer's block and a heavy addiction to smoking. She is writing a new novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick who is very good with numbers. Little did SHE know, Harold Crick was a real person, and just by writing the book, she was controlling his life. Oh yeah, and she wanted to kill off Harold in the book at the end. Fortunately, her writer's block makes the voices Harold hear go away temporarily, and he lives his life in his control. This drives her to hire the expert writer's assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) who vows to help her finish the book and kill Harold Crick.Harold sees a psychiatrist who recommends him to the acclaimed English literature expert Jules Hibbert (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they try to find out if this voice--who they don't know is a real author writing a real book about Harold--is trying to write a comedy, or a tragedy. So Harold begins to keep track of issues in his life to find out. In the meantime, Harold falls helplessly in love with a young woman who works at a bakery (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who he just happens to be auditing. As you can probably guess, issues revolving around that ended up around the ""tragedy"" column.Stranger Than Fiction is by far one of the best films of 2006, and I think Will Ferrell's best film yet. The acting is phenomenal: Will Ferrell is in his best role EVER. Emma Thompson is spectacular and soars above many of her other roles in her incredibly realistic portrayal of an author with writer's block. Maggie Gyllenhaal and legend Dustin Hoffman do a fantastic job as well.Stranger Than Fiction has one of the most unique stories I've ever seen, if not THE most unique. I was SHOCKED after watching this to know this was completely ignored by the Academy, including a Best Original Screenplay award that would've totally locked sabers with Little Miss Sunshine. Hell, this is one of the most original screenplays I've ever had the pleasure of watching. You won't believe your eyes and ears that someone can actually write a movie like this.

Even Queen Latifah's part was unmemorable, which I would have thought to be nearly impossible for her since she always has such strong characters.

Watching 'Stranger than Fiction' (2006) in an empty theater...,"...was one of the best movie-going experiences I ever had. My husband and I went to see it last Saturday on the 14:15 (2:15 PM) show and we had the small, comfortable, stadium-like theater all to ourselves. I was delighted but my husband gave me a suspicious look before the movie began and asked if I was sure that was the movie I wanted to see. I was sure - I've seen the trailer several times and I loved the idea the movie was based on: an IRS employee, Harold Crick (Will Ferrell has proved admirably to be able to play serious roles) leads the ordered, quite boring full of numbers and digits life only one morning to realize that he is somehow happened to be a main character in a new novel from famous, neurotic, reclusive, chain smoking author Karen Eiffel (great, great Emma Thompson) who always murders her main characters on the last page of her books. He begins hearing a voice in his head that narrates over his life and tells exactly what just happened to him. Where would you go first? To a psychiatrist, of course. What would he (in this movie, she, Linda Hunt, memorable in a tiny cameo) say? ""You have to be medicated"" but she also advises Harold to seek assistance from the literature expert. Enters Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, always reliable, always delight to watch) who would help Harold to determine whether he is in a comedy or a tragedy and whether he would be able to avoid an inevitable tragic end of the book. While figuring out if he is in a comedy or a tragedy, Harold meets a free spirited baker with the Harward Law background named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal lights up the screen in her every scene) who did not pay a portion of her taxes in purpose and now is a subject for auditing. Harold's life changes, he is not ready to go but the voice sounds in his head and his only chance to avoid the book's final is to meet with Karen and to beg her to reconsider. There is a problem, you see - Karen is impossible to find - she never meets with the readers or replies to the phone calls or letters...Little did I know how much I would like the movie and how much I would care about its characters. The movie makers are the brave and creative people not only because they chose as the subject the exploration of Author and his character relationship. It's been done before and not only by Charley Kauffman whose name has been mentioned by many commenters. The subject of Creator and his creature, the writer and the heroes of his books, the man and his shadow that one day would refuse to follow its master would go as far as the ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea. No, I admire the filmmakers because they were brave enough to make their main character an IRS guy and to make him sympathetic and compelling. Believe it or not, the movie made me smile and cry at the same time and there were the moments that I could not figure out where it would go and I liked the feeling. I don't know if ""Stranger than Fiction"" is the best movie of this year but it is certainly the best I've seen so far and I wish it all the best when the awards season comes....As much as I enjoyed being in the theater with my husband only, I truly wish more viewers see ""Stranger than Fiction"" because it is a clever, funny yet moving picture - they don't come like that very often.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Brilliant Script, Superb Direction, Best Ensemble Cast Performance: Why no Oscars?","STRANGER THAN FICTION is one of the more wise, conceptually stunning, finely executed original films to come to the screen in a long time. How this little gem of a film went unnoticed by the Academy is anyone's guess, but viewers' alert: spend an evening viewing this film and new standards for excellence will be set for you.Director Marc Forster ('Finding Neverland', 'Monster's Ball', 'Stay', 'Everything Put Together') is a director of vision, a man unafraid to tackle testy topics, and a genius at pacing a film with a keen collaborative eye with his cinematographer, his editor, his set designer, his casting director, and his actors. Taking the chance of working with first time writer Zach Helm (a gifted artist whose niche in the business is already secure with this first venture) and assembling a cast of some of our finest actors proves successful in every graphically odd twist and turn of this unusual, compelling and unclassifiable story.Harold Crick (Will Ferrell - finally given a role in which he can prove that he is an actor and not just a foolish pratfall comedian) is a boring, number obsessed IRS agent whose every moment of every day is timed to be exactly the same (with the important co-existence with his wrist watch!)...until one day he hears a voice narrating his life, the female voice of loopy and blocked writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is writing a story that has a 'Harold Crick' as her main character. Only our boring IRS agent can hear her voice: his loony office friend Dave (Tony Hale) empathizes but can do little else to help him. When the narrator begins to talk about ending 'Harold's' life, Harold freaks and seeks guidance from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, in one of his most subtle and refined roles of his career) who knows Eiffel's work and aids Harold in understanding novels, be they comedy or tragedy. Harold also seeks the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Mittag-Leffler (the always superb Linda Hunt) who is of little help, and Dr. Cayly (Tom Hulce) who repairs all upsets with hugs.Meanwhile in his work of auditing citizens he encounters anti-government baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, once again proving that she is one of the most formidable talents in film today), and a bizarre but tender attraction slowly ensues. And all this time novelist Kay Eiffel is struggling with how to 'kill Harold' so that she can complete her novel. Her publisher sends in 'assistant' Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to ground her and guide her to her novel's completion by helping her observe hospital disasters, vantages, and steadying her grip on life.The manner in which the novel is finished which involves the ultimate fate of Harold and the changes the narration of the novel have had on his life makes up the resolution of the story. And a cleverly written conclusion it is. Zach Helm is obviously a brilliant, well-informed writer who knows how to balance comedy and tragedy, crises of life with the little things that count, and can mold conversations so subtle that they beg to be rewound to enjoy the words repeatedly. Forster wisely uses graphic superimpositions of numbers and graphs and lines to show us the inside of Harold's intriguing mind, all the while allowing us to draw close to the needy and tender aspect of this nerd of nerds, thus making the involvement with his narrator, his girlfriend Ana, and his doctors and professor wholly credible.Some people (this viewer being one) avoided this film in the theaters because of the fear that it may be just another Will Ferrell bit of foolishness: over the top slapstick physical comedy that grows stale after about five minutes. But Will Ferrell here opens an important new door for his career: he can act! The ensemble cast could not be improved upon and it is refreshing to see the widely disparate types of actors gathered here work as a cohesive and impeccable unit. Added to the DVD is about an hour's worth of featurettes that are, for once, brilliantly informative and well worth viewing to enhance the film just experienced. Bravo to the entire cast and crew of this little masterwork! Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Perhaps it's just as well because Harold isn't living anyway (as free-spirited hippies would have you believe). He's alone and works as an IRS auditor with no extracurricular activities. After Harold hears the news of his impending death he decides to break free from his monotonous life and fall in love with a woman named Ana Pasca (Maggie Gyllenhaal).""Stranger Than Fiction"" is novel. I liked the idea of Harold being a character of a book, yet being a real person such that neither he nor Karen knew what was going on. It goes without saying that the drama is whether or not Harold can prevent his death. Still, as original as STF is, it's still the same as plots past: working a steady job and earning an honest income isn't living, you have to shake things up to be alive, and you must fall in love. It's a plot that's been reheated so many times it's lost flavor. Then add one more cliche into the mix; the romantic interest hated Harold to begin with. They openly stated that point in the movie so as to try to separate it from other romance movies when the two hate each other only to fall in love later; but shamelessly pointing out a cliche doesn't make it any less cliche.I was interested in the movie insofar as Harold's connection to Karen. I wanted to see how that would play out. As far as Harold's romance with Ana, then that was playing for a demographic other than me. After a summary calculation on my abacus, the movie is pretty good.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Nice Little Film That Dreamed Too Big,"I rewatched this again tonight for the first time since it came out, and remembered nothing at all about it going in but the premise, along with the lingering impression that it was a fairly likeable mainstream Hollywood attempt at fabricating some of that elusive Charlie Kaufman ""Being John Malkovich"" magic and acclaim.And the thing is, it's such a lovely premise - a man becomes aware he is a character in a book and due to be killed off - but the film has no way of satisfactorily ending it. It aspires to have as grand a finale as Emma Thompson's character's novel within the film, but likewise chickens out and so ends up a puzzling and pointless mediocrity, which no amount of swelling music, uplifting montages and platitudes can obscure.I enjoyed my time spent with the characters, and indeed, there's a lot to like about every one of them, and every actor playing them. But by the end one feels, unfortunately, that it has been all for nothing and that the filmmakers were floundering out of their depth almost from the start, not knowing what they wanted to say or how to say it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The reader is reading this review with a curious attention,"Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) goes about his regimented mundane life as an IRS agent. Until one day he hears a voice in his head narrating his life. He confronts a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who informs him that that is schizophrenia. He says no it is just a voice in his head and the psychiatrist says that is schizophrenia. Turns out he may be a character in a book and his days are numbered. Can he figure this out in time to save his bacon? He enlists the help of a literary professor (Dustin Hoffman) to help in the quest. On the way, he may even have time enough for love (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)The world inside the theme of the world is not new or unique. See the filmThe Thirteenth Floor (1999)or read the book"" Sophie's World: A Novel about the History of Philosophy"" by Jostein Gaarder.

Not Quite as Expected,"For whatever reason, I was highly anticipating this movie. Maybe it was because of the plot, or the all-star cast, or maybe just because the trailer for this movie looked cool. I can't say I was disappointed with this movie, but it wasn't what I had expected. The acting was great, Will Ferrell playing a loner named Harold Crick, and Emma Thompson playing the moody and slightly depressed author Kay Eiffel. The plot was fun; the thought of a woman's voice following a man around had always amused me. But the problem is I don't think the movie lived up to its name. It seemed to branch off, with the narrating going away, 30 minutes into the film and predictable love hook=ups emerged that EVERYBODY saw coming even though it didn't seem possible. Although this movie is described as a comedy, I didn't laugh once the whole film, it was a bit more of a love story, which disappointed me. Because of the fact that the movie had a good plot and the acting was great, it could've been a lot better, therefore getting 3 out of a possible 5 stars.Final Words: Unsatisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I would like to see another result of this movie!,"I felt even a little change affects our lives seriously. When he heard about his death, he seemed to be crazy. But if I were him, I might become crazy and lose my composure. This movie made me consider about my living. In this movie, the main character decides to follow the story. But I wonder what he would do, if he chose to be alive. I think the last scene is good. I think, if he didn't do that, the story may have become more interesting. As the story goes on, I felt he became a more human person. At first I thought he was a strict person. I think changes of our lives may make our lives better or richer even if we can't adjust to it easily.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magic Realism,"After seeing your average movie, the audience departs with a fairly cut and dry, black and white sense of whether the movie was good or bad, and can point out exactly the high points, and what needed fixing up. And then every once in a while, along comes a movie like Stranger than Fiction, which provides no such easy answers. Don't walk into this movie expecting a typical loud, obnoxious Will Ferrell comedy  it isn't. Don't walk into this movie expecting a typical Hollywood story about change and redemption  it isn't that either. Don't even walk in expecting the most standard genre of Charlie Kaufman style ""weird for the sake of weird"", because although this may be a closer fit than the other subheadings, it still fails to encompass everything Stranger than Fiction is.While it's true Stranger than Fiction does have a premise similar to the time worn story of progressive change and redemption complete with happy ending, the film is far too clever to fall into such trappings. Or is it? It becomes difficult to tell when director Marc Foster, who has proved himself immensely capable with such past hits as Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland and screenwriter Zach Helm are making intelligent social comment or self reflection and when it seems like they've lost control of their movie entirely and have little idea of what it is turning into. What should have turned out to be a quirky masterpiece ultimately ends up as less than such. There are moments of inspired genius, yes, but there are also unquestionably weak and uninteresting periods, which do serve to drive the message of isolation home, but in the end, a social comment on a boring life still comes across as well boring.However, the film also may succeed more as a philosophical message than black comedy, with musings on the concepts such as pre-determination and fatalism (the philosophical banter between Dustin Hoffman's literary professor character and the nonplussed Ferrell are among the film's high points) which also come across as frustratingly underdeveloped ideas, since the concepts hinted at are fascinating. Such is the case for many aspects of the film  they are simply hinted at, when a more in depth look might have proved far more intriguing. But once again, all the way through, the viewer is given a sense that Foster knows exactly what he is doing, and there is a reason for the frustratingly sparse nature of such concepts. Or not. The film does indeed provoke many such questions and will without doubt raise heated discussions, but it's not the kind of powerful piece of work which changes lives  simply a quirky, charmingly unconventional and frequently frustrating self-reflection piece.With a less talented cast, the idea never would have come into fruition properly, but with the ensemble of charismatic actors Foster has assembled, what might have been a very shaky film comes across as less shaky. Ferrell is refreshingly subdued as the solitary IRS agent, managing to infuse his performance with just enough sparkle for him to not come across as just as uninteresting as the character he is portraying. Maggie Gyllenhaal's character does become frustratingly predictable at parts, but she gives such a luminous performance we forgive her in our minds. But it's in the quirky supporting characters the film really draws its strength from, especially the always reliable Dustin Hoffman, perfectly understated as a literary professor examining Ferrell's predicament, and the scene-stealing Emma Thompson's delightfully quirky take on the struggling author persona.Is Stranger than Fiction a masterpiece, sure to make viewers re-consider their lives? No. But is it an interesting and quirky watch, with a great cast giving charming and eccentric performances and moments of creative brilliance that carry the film through its weaker and more frustrating aspects? Yes. Should it be considered recommended? Yes, but be advised that seeing the movie having heard as little about it as possible would be a wise idea, as most everyone is likely to have a different take on such an oddball movie, and you'll want to keep an open mind.-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What does Zach Helm think?,"Any insiders out there who know what Zach Helm thinks? Such a sharp idea. I sensed a lot more humor in the screenplay than showed up on screen.Marc Forster went all Oscar-y here, hammy and serious when I bet the writer had far more intelligent ambitions. This screenplay badly needs its own Spike Jonze.Will Farrell: whoopsie. A nice comedian but no real acting chops. Can we stipulate that only Bill Murray gets to be the one comedian who is considered a brilliant actor by keeping everything bottled up, revealing nothing?Luckily there's Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman. You can feel both tugging hard on the director, trying to bring things to life. They both have plenty scenes with Will Farrell. They darned near succeed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
perfect writing in both senses,"While generally billed as a comedy, Zach Helm's ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is also a musing on the meaning of life. Will Ferrell plays an IRS agent who suddenly finds his life narrated, not knowing that it's the work of an author writing a novel. This leads to some major events in his life.It's one of those movies where everything just seems natural, improbable though the plot may be. It lets the characters' personalities develop. It might not be the ultimate masterpiece, but I like how it prompts us to consider our roles in life, as well as our own mortality. It won't be for everyone, mainly since Ferrell isn't doing any wacky comedy. It's for those who want to think about who we are and where we're going.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was interesting,"I just saw Stranger Than Fiction tonite with my friends, let's face it, as a proud Chicago gal, I had to see it. Not to mention that this movie is the reason my best friend got to meet Dustin Hoffman and Will Ferrell since she attends The University of Illinois in Chicago. She was so excited to see Will, but didn't really know who Dustin was, sigh! I know! But, anyways, it looked like an interesting concept and a unique story.It's about this man, Harold, normal life and a lonely IRS agent who is auditing a young woman who he also has a major crush on. But things are becoming strange when he finds himself listening to a British woman's voice narrating his life. The problem is that he just heard that he is going to die and wants to learn how he could prevent it from happening. Harold meets this author who is a nervous smoking and depressing wreck, when she learns that her character is real, she doesn't know how to end her book.While, it's well acted well and the story was really interesting, this movie just didn't grab me. It had some funny moments and some sad one's, then I remember being annoyed with the talking and making out teens in the back who for some reason wouldn't shut up. Sorry, had to get that out. But back to the movie, it's something I didn't mind seeing, but probably won't see again, I'm not quite sure if I agree with the rating, but that's cool.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much More than I Expected,"This is a pretty engaging movie. For me Will Farrell is really up and down. I would generally consider him pretty lightweight. This film, however, shows that he has a great deal more range than I've given him credit for. Once we accept the premise of the whole thing, he begins to engage us. His plight is certainly one of great urgency. What I enjoyed was that they didn't play it for a sense of slapstick. Some filmmakers would have used the author's touch to put him in all kinds of ridiculous situations, finding himself naked on a street, or hooked up with some street gang, or some other ludicrous thing. He come off as a truly developing character who probably does what most of us would have done. Granted, he is a quirky IRS agent with symptoms of OCD, but the story is about what happens when you begin to realize how precious life is. It's been done a million times, but here it works quite well. It doesn't even matter that the writer painted himself into a corner because the joy of the movie is watching Farrell's character commandeer his ship. Emma Thompson's character is just a bit much; so is Dustin Hoffman, but they are certainly interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Effortless perfection!,"Effortless perfection! Director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland, Stay, Monster's Ball) deftly manipulates his audiences' feelings in the wonderful dramedy Stranger than Fiction. Precisely hitting all the notes in making an ensemble cast work, everything just seemed so carefully thought out without feeling contrivedthere is simply nothing to dislike about this film.Will Ferrell very successfully transitions from his usual screwball comedic acts to sincere, sensitive and likable everyday IRS agent Harold Crick, who falls in love with his auditee, government-hater and bohemian baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who just marvelously disappeared into the role). Dustin Hoffman flawlessly plays literary expert Professor Jules Hilbert, whom Crick runs to for help to find out how to stop his life from ending as intimated to him by the voice in his head, while Queen Latifah was able to stand on her own as assistant Penny to Emma Thompson's eccentric tragic novelist Kay Eiffel, who is struggling with writer's block, trying to find out the best way to kill her lead character Crick.Forster makes everything so easy to love: his recurring themes of contrast and interconnectivity blend smoothly with the refreshingly original story, the immensely talented actors that quietly dissolve into their characters (usually very difficult to suspend disbelief with a stellar cast), thoughtful set design (all calm neutrals in modernist designs) and a breathtaking indie-rock soundtrack (said to be this year's answer to Garden State's OST).Here are a few of the incredibly killer lines:Penny Escher: (looks at a pile of smoked cigarettes on Kay's desk) Did you smoke all of these? Kay Eiffel: No, they came pre-smoked.Ana Pascal: Did you like the cookies? Harold Crick: Yes. Thank you for forcing me to eat them.Harold Crick: (talking to Ana while holding a cardboard box with multiple small paper bags inside) I brought you flours.<---isn't this absolutely the sweetest??Kay Eiffel: (narrating) And so he did what countless punk-rock songs had told him to do so many times before: he lived his life.The line that saved the movie from triteness is a spoiler, so you will have to see the movie for yourself, on the big screen.Stranger than Fiction is multidimensional; it's not just a clever movie, it makes you think about how you choose to live your life, every minute of every day.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The ending squandered every good will I had to like the movie.,"Possible, albeit mild, spoilers in the third paragraph so just skip right down to them so you can follow my post. Actually no, I kid. They're spoilers, you shouldn't read them. Because they'll spoil the movie.So, I've been on a Will Ferrell binge the last couple of days, doing a bit of catching up on the stuff I didn't glory in in my drunken and depraved college days (namely this and his two films from last year - Step Brothers is one of the best comedies of the decade, SEE it). Anyone who's had a passing knowledge of my person knows I'm a crusader against all things quirky, but Will Ferrell is one of my heroes (he stole my heart as Frank the Tank and neither of us ever looked back), so I figured I ought to soldier on through this in the name of completism.One hour in and I'm thinking that a good movie might be squeezed out of another high concept dramedy and that the quirky tone is palatable because Will Ferrell walks through it. He doesn't yell, which is a bit like like Van Damme not round-kicking people in the mouth, but he does timid and introverted near as good as he does boisterous and narcissist. And he's lucky to have Maggie Gylenhaal next to him, for whom I never quite felt so much in lust as in her role as tattooed anarchist baker. It's all a bit predictable (loner needs to break his routine to love life) but not half-bad.And then it throws everything away in the last 20-30 minutes. Why movie?? It took some effort on my part to come to terms with Harold's resignation to his death for a book (I mean, it's a goddamn book!), but okay, death may be a small price to pay to be immortalized. But Dustin Hoffman promised a 'one of the most meaningful and poetic endings', so it might be worth the hassle anyway. And then it comes: one big clusterf-ck of pseudo faith-reaffirming schmaltz shot like a UNICEF ad. At that point I wanted to punish the movie real bad, to inflict bodily harm on it. Not only because, being a meta- riff on writing, it violates every writing code of honor with its gut-wrenching didacticsm, but more because it squandered every good will I had to like it up until that point.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction: Apples To  Apple Sauce,"Harold Crick's life is so orderly that whatever he does has white over-lays like blue prints that only the audience and he can see. He also says he hears a woman's voice telling him what to do with his life! What is so strange about a man hearing voices? What is most peculiar is having a Timex wrist watch that thinks for itself and it's owner! Unfortunately the wrist watch never gets enough personality to gain status as a main character. Rene' Magritte's paintings of the black suited men with Granny Smith Apples for faces and Black Derby hats would fit well as the character portrayed by Will Farrrell. Mr. Farrell is seen many times walking the streets of the 'Windy City' holding a large Granny Smith Apple between his teeth and accomplishing little else. Throughout the film the reference between Harold Crick and the apple becomes very apparent. The voice in his head are the written words of the novelist Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is trying to slay her main character, Mr. Crick, but at the moment has an unfortunate case of writer's block. Toward the close of the film Ms. Eiffel who is a life observer instead of using a muse, watches a stray Granny Smith Apple roll off a fruit display onto the street and this is the vision for the end of Harold Crick. Ms. Eiffel completes her novel but has a change of heart because Harold has had a total life transmogrification. This film like a good Granny Smith Apple lacks the sharp snap like sound when you bite into said fruit instead all you get is the squish of apple sauce.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Advanced tester screening thoughts!,"Like Alexander from London, England I too saw a test screening of Stranger than Fiction and wont go over the same stuff as him as he has done a good job of summarising it, but instead I shall give my own rendition of what I thought. It is a cult film with Will Farrell being at his absolute brilliance at what he does in a quirky but funny way. The film is a cross between Big Fish and The Truman Show with an amazing cast.Emma Thompson narrated the beginning of the film, which led it to a slow start and I was wondering whether or not I was enjoying the film because it was free or because the mathematical images reminded me of the Ikea scene from Fight Club, however my initial views were so wrong. The narrating stopped and the film moved along at a steady pace. Queen Latifah's role was a low in the film and rather disappointing to previous roles she has played but I guess that's down to her character and scripting.I was not interested at all in the themes of life which obviously this film was concluding to but thought this would be a much talked about film, thought provoking and should receive several film awards for its shear brilliance. I would give the film overall a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
6.5,"Hm... this movie is perplexing me.
On one hand i really enjoyed watching it. It was superbly entertaining, and unpredictable. It had great direction, cinematography and editing. It's one of those concepts that is so fresh, creative and NEW that its a treat to watch regardless of its miss steps.But on the other hand... im not sure it makes much sense at all. The concept is new and interesting but im afraid its RIDDDDLED with plot holes that just bog down the concept.
That is not my only criticism.
I did not like Maggie Gylenhall in the Dark Knight, and when i saw her initial appearance in this movie i prayed that it was just that- and appearance. Will Ferrell and Maggie have absolutely zero chemistry and it was just real uncomfortable to watch in my opinion. Although the acting is on par for both Will Ferrell and Maggie, i think they were poorly casted and not the right fit for the script. I think this could have been much better, if only the characters were more likable, the relationship more believable, and if Emma Thompson's character wasn't such an annoying pretentious punk.
Honestly though it was worth watching, and id watch it again. I would recommend it just because of how fresh and creative of an idea it was.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good acting let down by a weak script,"I think this movie is generally overrated. Sure, the general plot was intriguing, Will Ferrell proved he can act, and the characters were all developed nicely. But the script was an insult to the average moviegoers IQ. The story within the story really could not have been as exciting as we're forced to believe. Then there was only one vaguely memorable joke (the ""flowers"") which, as with most other lines in this movie, was repeated a few times as if we're incapable of hearing it the first time. Then the end - without spoiling it - was just not believable. There was so much more that could've been done with the idea, but unfortunately Stranger than Fiction comes across as a contrived, forgettable first draft at what should've been brilliant.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hard to believe I hadn't heard of this film before.,"Think Will Ferell, and the first thought that comes to your mind is a goof-ball comedy. He's known for playing funny characters and he definitely doesn't have a problem not taking himself too seriously. But this film is so very different. I would say this is Ferrells best dramatic performance (perhaps his only real ""dramatic"" performance?). The film is heartfelt and it's about this guy named Harold Crick (played by Ferrell), whose life is the subject of a certain authors book. His life story is literally being written by someone else. As he goes about his life, he can actually hear the narration in his head and the description of the events going on in his life. I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you. But its definitely entertaining and a genuine feel-good film you should definitely watch. At least for me, Ferrell's performance surprised me. And he's backed up by a great bunch of actors (think Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Emma Thompson and the gorgeous Maggie Gyllenhaal!). And there's even room for ""Buster"" from ""Arrested Development!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Clever, but strangely underwritten","The narrative and concept reminded me of Charlie Kaufmann's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Adaptation."" But ""Stranger than Fiction"" is strangely underwritten, even if it starts off with tons of ingenuity and wonder (the way Harold counts and calculates every aspect of his world while his odd wristwatch ticks away his life).Will Farrel plays the Truman Show part with wit and confidence, and we meet more strong, quirky characters along the way. Emma Thompson is an author obsessed with death. Queen Latifah is the hard-nosed assistant. Maggie Gylenhaal is the socialist baker/love interest. Dustin Hoffman is the off-kilter existentialist detective (oops, wrong movie). I mean, he's the literary psychologist (or something like that). POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.And they are all full of potential. But, strangely, none of them live up to their potential. Each character is given a magnificent and entertaining set of qualities that all seem to disappear in the self-serious and overblown final third of the film (and re-appear in an epilogue montage that tries too hard to impose a heart-felt ""mediocrity is more important than masterpiece"" theme on the story""). It's like a symphony of several fine-tuned instruments building to a crescendo, only to go out with a wheeze.So much more could have been done with the relationship between the assistant and the author (Queen Latifah is sorely under-used). And why, when we've set up the tragedy of the author's life, does she not get to confront her own personal tragedy? Surely, she has suicide on the mind. And why does Harold blithely accept his fate when his life is finally looking up and, as he so freely admits, ""I know nothing about literature""? He's a lamb to the slaughter when he should be an angry son of a bitch (see Adam Sandler in the much-better ""Punch Drunk Love""). Why does the literary psychologist gloss over his own personal failures to insist that Harold accept his fate? Shouldn't such a moment resonate with the failed-writer-now-professor/lifeguard? And why does the baker/love interest have NOTHING to do except look cute and seduce Harold?I loved the absurdity of it all -- the odd questions posed by Hoffman (""Are you king of anything? You know, a bowling alley? The trolls?""). I also loved the concept of Harold trying to figure out if his life is a tragedy or a comedy based on how often his girlfriend screams at him. ""Stranger that Fiction"" certainly succeeds in creating a much more humane story than the sometimes-obtuse ""I Heart Huckabees."" But, still, this is a work of fiction in which every character is sacrificed in the name of a high-minded concept -- a concept which may leave you smiling in the end, but not after you've scratched your head and wondered where all the characters went.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
When Reality and Fiction Become One,"After making some fine movie like 'Monster's Ball', 'Finding Neverland' and 'Stay', director Marc Forster makes the splendid 'Stranger Than Fiction'. Zach Helm's innovative screenplay makes this a unique movie. It's difficult to categorize this film even though the consensus seems to root for existential comedy. The dry humour works delightfully. Even though the film does address some grim themes, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is a comedy at heart.I liked how the story involves 'two worlds' (the writer's point of view and the character's point of view) and at the same time, they're one and the same. Forster designs the film with subtlety, whether it's with the score, the sets, the art direction, the lights or the cinematography. The Will Ferrell - Maggie Gyllenhaal romance is beautifully toned down.Will Ferrell handles subtle comedy effortlessly. He's definitely a versatile actor where comedy is concerned and even in the more intense sequences he is terrific. An outstanding Emma Thompson fits her part like the right-sized glove. She just makes it look like a piece of cake. Ditto for Maggie Gyllenhaal who is superb as Ana. Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman provide excellent support especially with their remarkable comic timing. Linda Hunt, Kristin Chenoweth and Tony Hale shine in their brief screen time.'Stranger Than Fiction' may have a predictable (somewhat Hollywood ending) but at the same time it's well done and symbolic rather than just formulaic.With a unique story, a wonderful cast and brilliant direction, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is not to be missed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's not bland.... but it's nothing too special.,"I am probably one of the few that I've seen that has generally not thought this movie was as great as a lot of people have said. Then again, I completely got it and I knew it wasn't going to be funny. Maybe it was because I was expecting a ""Punch-drunk love"" or ""Eternal Sunshine"" or maybe even a ""Being John Malkovich"" But it didn't come off as those either.After seeing the trailer I obviously saw what the story was about and everything but I exited the movie with nothing more than the A-B-C's that I had already picked up in the trailer. This could be a spoiler, but there really is no much more of a twist or story than what the trailer shows you. You know, I went in to ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and came out with a D-E-F too. With Stranger.... I really felt like nothing new and original had been popped out. And instead I felt like the trailer basically ended up being a 2 minute synopsis of the entire movie's plot save a few minutes here and there. Literally I left the movie with a ""Is that all?"" Sort of feel.Will Ferrel and the rest of the cast play their roles perfectly but I had a lot of trouble connecting with any of them. I didn't connect with Ferell and that's what really disappointed me. I didn't feel like I really even cared what happened to him at the end.I wouldn't consider this a comedy... or romance or even a tragedy. This was simply a story.

"Dustin Hoffman ""diagnosing"" Will Ferrell as autisic","It is absolutely fantastic to see Dustin Hoffman in another autism movie. While ""Rain Man"" is a movie about a person with classic autism (Dustin Hoffman), ""Stranger than fiction"" is a movie about Asperger's syndrome. Because Will Ferrell is taking everything literal; no small talk; he's not counting the tiles in the bathroom (as Professor Jules Hilbert presumes -- a direct link to ""Rain Man""), but measuring the volumes of soap in all dispensers (proving, in this context, he *is* autistic). Well, that's what I thought after watching it the first time. I've seen this movie a dozens of times now, and I changed my conclusion: it's about neurodiversity! Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) has also Asperger's. Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) are showing autistic traits. E.g. none of them is willing to change his/her rituals, and they are all preoccupied.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow and boring.,"It's been a while since I've wanted to walk out in the middle of a movie like I did last night when I saw ""Stranger Than Fiction"". I wanted to, but didn't because my friend insisted that I give this movie a chance. I did and, boy, was I sorry I did. Not a very original story: a cold, structured businessman meets a fun-loving, carefree young woman who gives him something to live for. When he discovers he is just a character in a story that ends with him dying in the near future, he searches for the author to ask her to keep him alive.I'm not sure how this film got such high marks because I saw so many things in it that bothered me. Besides its slow pacing, pretentiousness and its unnecessary inclusion of Queen Lattifah's character, this film failed to explain a lot. How did Harold Crick come to life? If he was a character in Kay's book, what about all the people he met during the course of his life? Why weren't they also characters in her book too? How could some parts of his life be in the book and others not?

A new breed of rom-com,"The romantic comedy has come in many guises from screwball to sex. Now we have a different aspect of love; the metaphysical rom-com. Actually, it's a genre that's been around for a few years now, through ""Groundhog Day"" and ""The Truman Show"" to, more recently, ""I Heart Huckabees"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Charlie Kaufmann is it's principal progenitor. The films play out like science-fiction but they are anchored in a much more earthly, literary world. The debt these films owe is more to James Joyce than Issac Assimov and it's no accident that in both ""Adaptation"", which made free with the concept of an author and his characters inhabiting the same landscape, and now ""Stranger than Fiction"", one of the principal characters is a writer.In some respects ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a decidedly old-fashioned film. It's a boy-meets-girl movie where the fate of the boy and girl hinges on the intervention of a third party. (In the thirties and forties this would have been an eccentric millionaire played by Charles Coburn). But now we have moved into the era of the metaphysical romantic comedy and here the third party is a writer and the boy is a character in her novel. He also happens to be real and while he is aware he is a character in a novel, (and none too happy about it), she isn't aware that her character is a living, breathing person. This is smart stuff up to a point but had it just been one-sided the concept would have worn itself out. It's when the character introduces himself to the author that the film really kicks in.If this all sounds terribly high-brow, esoteric and confusing, don't worry, it isn't. It's smart, clever, funny and genuinely romantic. The character, Harold, is Will Ferrell and he's a stuffed shirt but you know five minutes after meeting him that the starch is going to be taken out of that shirt and when you clasp eyes on Maggie Gyllenhall's kooky pastry chef you know she's the girl to do it. Both players are first-rate. Ferrell develops a real person out of his character and adds a dimension to his playing that he hasn't shown before while Gyllenhall oozes sex appeal. She tries to act tough but never quite makes it. There is a sexy little girl inside and Ferrell knows how to draw her out.There is also excellent work from Emma Thompson as the eccentric, chain-smoking author with writer's block and from Dustin Hoffman as the literary guru whose advice Ferrell seeks. Hoffman has a marvellous scene when he argues that Ferrell should allow his character to be killed off because that way the book will be 'a masterpiece'. The scene is highly ridiculous but Hoffman plays it with the straightest of straight faces relishing every syllable. The director, Marc Forster, has already shown he can mesh the real with the phantasmagorical in ""Finding Neverland"". Here he handles the twists and turns of Zach Helm's marvellous script with consummate ease. I absolutely loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Taste to Acquire: In Stranger than Fiction, Will Ferrell after all shows what he came for","In 1995, in his first season in Saturday Night Live, Will Ferrel was voted by the public the worst comedian of the history of the show. Seven years later, when he left the post, was elected by popular vote as the best name of all that has passed through the series, taking off the race competitors like John Belushi and Steve Martin. There is two possible explanations for this discrepancy, and one doesn't exclude the other: Ferrel is a taste you acquire; and he is capable of adapting, improving and learning. In Stranger than Fiction, the validity of the second hypothesis is specially evident. For the first time, Ferrel shows himself less as a comic and more as an actor. In the film directed by Marc Forster, of Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland, he interprets Harold Crick, a blank tax inspector that, in the lack of any clearer meaning in life, replaces it by numbers and method. Harold brushes his teeth 36 times on the vertical, and others 36 times on the horizontal. Chronometers by the seconds the time he has to be at the bus stop, and makes on his tie a simple Windsor knot, because the double knot would consume a whole other minute of his day. The reason that his habits becomes so transparent to him and for the audience is that, in a certain moment, Harold starts to hear a voice inside his head - a woman's voice, British, that narrates every one of his gestures with style, and better choice of words, that he would not be capable of using.With the help of a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman), Harold discovers that he became the character of a romance that is being written by Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). In serious existential and creative crisis, the novelist fight to finish her work the way she is known of - by killing the protagonist. Harold, naturally, wants to convince Kay to change the ending. And the movie, written with considerable astuteness and sweetness by scriptwriter Zach Helm, has to show why she should, or not, change her masterpiece to hinder the premature ending of a so insignificant man. The way out of this dead end is above all in the performance of Ferrell, that gives to his usual persona, of the fool who does not know that he is fool (his imitation of George W. Bush is quite famous), a whole new dramatic sense: of even the people which you're used to disdain can hold unsupicious moves of greatness. What goes for the character, and also for his actor.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The ending nearly ruins it,"""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a pretty good movie. It is not great, but it is not horrible either. The acting is superb and it was well paced and directed. The only problem with the movie is its ending. Without revealing any plot details, this reviewer believes that some may really appreciate the ending, this reviewer believes that it nearly ruined the film because it felt like a sell out.Karen Effiel is an author writing her latest novel about man named Harold Crick. What she does not know is that her fictionalized character is real. The real Harold Crick is an IRS agent who has lived a dull existence and one day begins to hear Karen's voice as she narrates what she puts on paper to what Harold has and is doing. Because of this, Harold enlists the help of a literary professor to find out what is happening and ends up changing things about his life including attempting to begin a relationship with his IRS client named Ana Pascal. Harold, however, finds trouble when he hears that Karen plans to kill him.The acting was phenomenal. Will Ferrell is the most surprising, and proves that he can act in something other than a comedy, as Harold Crick. Maggie Gyllenhaal played Harold's love interest, Ana Pascal. Emma Thompson was the narrator named Karen Eiffel. Queen Latifah, who this reviewer is not a fan of, played Karen's assistant named Penny Escher. Dustin Hoffman was Harold's literature professor named Professor Jules Hilbert.Overall, if you want to see a decent movie, you should see this movie. It was well acted. The pacing was fine, and so was the directing. The only problem was the ending, which nearly ruins the film. Nonetheless, this reviewer still recommends you to view this movie because you will most like enjoy it. It is hard to picture someone hating this film. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"fun, poignant, and quirky","Will Ferrell is an IRS auditor living a life that is ""Stranger than Fiction"" -- in fact, it is fiction -- in this 2006 film also starring Emma Thompson,Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah.Ferrell is Harold Crick, a smart auditor who lives his life on a strict schedule and leads a sterile life. One day he starts hearing a voice narrating what he's doing. He appears to be the only one hearing it. It upsets and annoys him, so he sees a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who sends him to a literary professor (Hoffman). The professor says the first thing to decide is if he's in a comedy or a tragedy. Crick is sent to audit a bakery owner, Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), and the two end up falling for one another.Elsewhere, a well-known author (Thompson) is sent an assistant (Latifah) by her publisher because she needs help finishing her book. Her character, Harold Crick, needs to be killed off, and she can't figure out how to do it.Meanwhile, the narrator in Harold's head reveals that he's going to die, and Crick recognizes the narrator's voice on a TV interview. Learning the name of the author, he sets out to find her to ask her to change her book.Wonderful story of a man learning to live just at the point he's going to be killed off, and it's filled with humor, sweet moments, and poignancy. Author's characters coming to life is not a new plot, but the way ""Stranger than Fiction"" is handled is very fresh.A terrific cast doesn't hurt -- Will Ferrell isn't always fabulous, but he pulls off Harold Crick very well. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the defiant baker who doesn't mind paying taxes but won't pay any taxes toward defense, is wonderful - hostile and later caring and sweet. Thompson is one of the finest actresses around. As a woman in the midst of artistic crisis, tortured by trying to bring her book to a close, she gives a strong performance. Her best scene is in the hospital -- she's there because she needs to be in touch with death for her book -- and she asks a nurse where the people who are going to die are. ""These people are injured,"" she complains with a straight face, ""and they'll be okay after you help them. Where do you keep the people who are going to die?"" Hoffman and Latifah in supporting roles are excellent, both bringing humor to the situation.Definitely worth seeing with a fine script by Zach Helm and good direction by Mark Forster.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An underestimated master-piece!,"Beautifully written where two stories merge into one and start rolling back. We certainly wouldn't have been able to find better writer than Emma Thompson in her role. Her voice and story-telling sound as beautiful as the story she is telling. Will Ferrell is known for many dumb movies and is forgotten for this one. This is a shame as he fits perfectly the character, Harold, that is pictured here. The music sets perfectly the scene and keeps you waiting for the end. You feel the story as a third character and observe with delight how the story is run through.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Super Boring !,"The movie is really slow-paced. I don't know how someone could enjoy the movie. I was just waiting for the movie to get over !The story initially felt very confusing. I had no previous knowledge about the movie, and so the first half an hour I was just trying to understand what the movie was about.But the biggest issue with the movie is the in the middle it gets really borrrriiiiinnnnnggggg ! I could hardly keep my self awake. There is rarely any good comedy. It is kinda serious. Not something one would expect from a Will Farrel movie.But the movie even fails to be a good serious movie. The characters are laden with stereotypes. An anarchist, a writer, a professor. Except the main character, the others have no depth !The only redeeming quality is that the story is very different. But a novel story by itself does not make a good movie.My recommendation would be to skip the movie. Save yourself 2 hours of time down the drain !",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Movie's Trailer As Good As Entire Film / Will Ferrel is V. Good,"""Stranger than Fiction"" is one of those movies where seeing the coming attraction is almost as good as seeing the entire movie.Author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), unbeknownst to her, exercises control over the life of IRS tax officer Harold Crick (Will Ferrel).Crick hears Eiffel's voice narrating his life, and becomes especially concerned when she begins to plot his death.Crick seeks help from a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who tells him he is schizophrenic, and from a college literature professor (Dustin Hoffman) who tries to understand if his life is a comedy -- which will lead to marriage and the creation of the next generation -- or a tragedy, which will end in death.Meanwhile, Crick meets Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a baker who declines to pay her taxes. Romance blooms.The movie is cute, and it is funny.Emma Thompson reminds us what a woman who is also a movie star can do. Thompson is commanding, riveting, interesting, engaging -- everything the teenage, arm candy, female cupcake of the moment -- you know their names -- could never be.Queen Latifah, as her assistant, is given the transparent role of secret sharer, the character who exists solely to give Thompson someone to talk out loud to. And Latifah is given exactly NOTHING else to do. This film's waste of Queen Latifah should be a legal offense, requiring the paying of a hefty fine.Dustin Hoffman is wonderful to watch; he just gets better and better. One could do worse than resolve to go see Hoffman's performance in any new movie.The movie is talky, but the director gives his characters funny bits to perform, to entertain the viewer's eyes while characters did little more than talk. Hoffman, for example, is a coffee addict, and this is communicated wonderfully. Thompson is a cigarette addict; her addiction is communicated in more disgusting fashion.Will Ferrel is a revelation. Gone is the goofball comic prancing in his underwear. He portrays a numbers idiot savant who probably has Asperger's syndrome with complete dedication and never breaks character. He made me laugh in ""Ricky Bobby;"" he made me care in ""Stranger than Fiction."" Maggie Gyllenhall is Maggie Gyllenhall, a flat nosed young woman who thinks she is smarter and more special than she is. You can practically smell her performance as a bratty, pretentious, hippy baker; you can practically taste her armpit hairs that fall into her brownies.So far so good.The problem is the movie does very little with its very clever plot device. In fact, it doesn't do much more with it than is done in the film's trailers. And that's too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Excellent, very funny; a living ""still-life""","This movie was absolutely phenomenal. Very original. It reminded a little of ""Being John Malkovich"" with a bit less randomness. I loved the way this film was shot - lots of straight angles, appropriate close-ups, good lighting. I liked how everything looked very clean and picturesque. All players performed admirably - great casting (although Emma Thompson seems to be playing to her typecasting in this one - but she's great nonetheless). I really liked Maggie Gyllenhaal - she's very cute and her voice is really sexy ... oh yeah, and she played her part very believably and naturally. Also, this was really one of Will Ferrel's best roles. I liked how he was much more subtle and subdued in this pic; He under-played Crick nicely, and his simple, blunt speech was well-delivered. This was a nice change of tone from his other roles and indicates a notable progression in the development of his craft as an actor (reminds me of when Robin Williams and Jim Carey began taking on more serious roles).My main point: It occurred to me near the end that the whole movie seemed like a living, moving still-life painting. There were many shots that looked like they could have been a painting - a slice of real life. Just as I formed that idea, there was a shot with Will Ferrel's character in his kitchen picking up a green apple from a bowl full of them. This really exemplified what I'm talking about here.Of course, the film has a good message as well. if somewhat clichéd - to live life fully and with passion and you don't know what you're capable of until you try new things and take on new perspectives with openness and deep consideration. Wouldn't it be funny if we all tried walking around for a day with a notepad tracking how many moments of delight and how many sad moments we had? It certainly would make you re-evaluate the way live and react to the life unfolding around you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Creative and New Examination of Old Questions,"Harold Crick lives a boring life of dull routine and never seems to entertain the notion that any other kind of life is a possibility. He quietly gets up every morning, catches the same bus to work, spends his day auditing people who hate him (he's an IRS agent), comes home, goes to bed and repeats everything the next day. His life is carefully synchronized by his trusty wristwatch, possibly and sadly Harold's best friend. His daily comings and goings are narrated to us by the pleasant, British accented voice of God, or at least of Emma Thompson. But one day, a seemingly ordinary Wednesday, Harold begins to hear the same narration that we hear, including a passing mention of his impending death. Harold's the main character in a novel, you see, and Emma Thompson is not an omniscient god, but rather the author of the novel. Though, as the movie hints, perhaps they're the same thing.I went into ""Stranger Than Fiction"" with significant reservations. The movie belongs to the same genre as films like ""Adaptation,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Truman Show,"" metaphysical musings on subjects like free will, the act of creation and such, all films which I found to be a bit too clever for their own good and which ultimately could not deliver on the promise of their imaginative concepts. But ""Stranger Than Fiction"" handles its topic quite well, and it's a very good movie. Once Harold realizes that his creator intends for him to die, he sets out to change the course of events of his life, not sure whether or not such a thing is even possible. He's helped by the fact that he's found something worth living for, that something being a feisty baker played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who brings a tremendous amount to the film through her nimble performance and engaging screen presence, and he enlists the help of a university literature professor cum therapist played by Dustin Hoffman, who helps Harold unravel the mystery of who's writing the book about him. Meanwhile, Thompson enters into a crisis of her own. She can't figure out how to kill off Harold Crick, and just as she comes up with a perfect and poetic way for him to die, she discovers that Harold knows who she is and that she's in control, and suddenly the act of killing him off becomes infinitely complicated by the fact that a real human life is in her hands.There's much about this film that doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you think about it for too long. For example, if Harold is a fictional character living in a fictional universe created by an author, then why isn't everyone else he interacts with fictional too? Also, the death Thompson devises for Harold isn't that original, so one wonders why exactly she had so much trouble coming up with it in the first place. But the questions about the moral responsibility of creators for their creations, and the reverse questions about the freedom of creations to determine their own fate, though not exactly new, are at least given a fresh coating of paint here, and the slick direction by Marc Forster helps the film and its ideas go down easily. It's not as intellectually ambitious as movies like ""Adaptation"" or ""Being John Malkovich,"" but in spite of that, or maybe because of it, I enjoyed this film more.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Finally,"Finally a delightful, wonderful film starring Will Ferrell. Don't miss it you'll be pleasantly surprised, I know I was.

This is an intellectually comedy as far as I'm concerned and leaves all the slapstick and dysfunctional so-called comedies in the dust. I took a chance with the main actor and I was definitely impressed! Stranger than Fiction, works.

"Harold Crick isn't crazy, he's just written that way","Emma Thompson's impeccable, blunt narration treads inventively on the poetic excellence of the writing behind ""Stranger Than Fiction"", a Kaufmanesque attempt by Zach Helm. Here is a story about IRS agent Harold Crick, a calculating, lonely man whose favourite word is ""integer"", who for years has led a sedate and ordered life. One day his wristwatch tires of his existence and Harold begins to hear a woman narrating his life, disrupting the mathematical symmetry of the film which propels the film.""Stranger Than Fiction"" plays along a unique, inventive concept about the fickleness of identity as the author struggles to kill Harold Crick at the end of her novel with all of the morbid obsessions that this task entails. It is fact and fiction merging in a rotating scale of existential questions embedded in tragicomic dilemmas. It truly is a funny film masking as a comedy, but which becomes unexpectedly poignant toward the end, without dwelling too much on its poignancy like most Hollywood films fall prey to.That is not to say it is an infallible film. Will Ferrell is unmistakably numb, almost as if he is actively struggling to curb his eccentric mannerisms and loud voice. Judging by the plethora of different situational comedy the film hedges around its protagonist, it becomes clear that it expects us to find his mere reactions side-splittingly funny, which is rather lazy writing and ineffective for non-fans of Ferrell. The humour is mostly in-tune in a classic sit-com kind of way  without the canned laughter  but it occasionally falls flat with a thud to the floor.The characters' last names are undeniably significant  Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, Banneker, Kronecker, Cayly, etc. are all puns on mathematicians and scientists who devoted themselves to the innate order of things. To support them are a wide array of charismatic actors such as Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman. Gyllenhaal plays a girl who is a militantly non-conformist, free-thinking tattooed girl around the corner whom Harold is set to audit. At times she feels too much of an obnoxious counterculture ploy to ""set the protagonist free"", but gradually she is given layers in the story. Hoffman is a worthy contribution as ever, playing a professor in literature who helps Harold identify the nature of the novel.""Stranger than Fiction"" should have been more entertaining, but its clever concept alone gets it a long way. Where characters usually struggle with inner demons in internal conflicts, Harold Crick's external conflict is just as important -- his impending death.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining if you can ignore its insistence that it's profound,"This movie tries hard to be like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but it doesn't succeed. The main problem is that the characters are very underdeveloped and don't really have personalities except for ""freak-ish rebel-ish cute girl"", ""stuffy, obsessive, boring-but-not-really guy"" etc. (the other characters have even less of a personality).It's apparent in the performances too that the actors didn't have that much to work with. The actors aren't really investing much, it's pretty light and superficial stuff - which would be good if this was a straight comedy, but it isn't. The movie really wants to say something meaningful (it screams ""MEANINGFUL"" from the very first scene - a shot of the earth, then zooming closer and closer and into the protagonist's bedroom), and it also wants to be sad and for you to root for the main guy and all those things. You know, it wants to be realistic, it wants you to suspend disbelief. It halfway succeeds at that, because it's very competently made and briskly edited, and filled with jokes and funny situations, half of which semi-work or more. (The other half have already been done better in an average Seinfeld-episode.) The other problem (except for the flat characters and the fact that it isn't nearly as funny as it tries to be), is, as others have mentioned, the cringe-worthy plot contrivances. The clichéd and cringe-worthy scenes have to do with the same thing as the problematic characters, weak and unimaginative writing. What you think will happen between the two leads, happens, and in the most well-used way.Lastly there's the absurd plot developments. The whole premise is absurd of course, like it was in Eternal Sunshine too. But the characters in Eternal Sunshine reacted to the absurd situations in a way consistent with their personalities and the world they occupied. The world in Stranger Than Fiction is neither-nor. Mostly it's clear that the movie attempts to convey a certain realism. I could give lots of examples of this but won't bore or spoil you. But then a character like Professor Jules Hilbert (Hoffman) suddenly accepts Harold Crick's (Ferrell) explanation without asking HOW or WHY this would happen, the same does Crick himself and two other characters. Suddenly we've entered fairytale-land. That Crick so readily accepts his final outcome (and the reason he does so) is also hard to buy, and not consistent at all with his character as presented. So the movie ends up being neither this nor that.""Luckily"" most of these revelations and plot developments don't happen before later in the movie, and we can't be sure where the whole thing is gonna go (metaphysically) before that. By then I'd already started to somewhat enjoy and be entertained by the movie (when I wasn't annoyed or cringing).The actors are OK but nothing more, as I said they don't really convey a lot of emotional truth - Maggie Gyllenhaal being the possible exception. Emma Thompson is mugging too much, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman (nothing wrong with that), and... there's nothing to say about Queen Latifah or Will Ferrell.In summation, a slight, but entertaining movie that tries to make you think it's very profound.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Feel-great movie,This is one of those rare movies with a strikingly flawless writing. Beautifully enacted. A feel-GREAT movie that I highly recommend to people with any sort of depressive thought.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth seeing,"The film tells the story of an IRS agent who starts to hear a voice in his head narrating his life, without knowing where it comes from, or whether he's losing his mind. This voice is that of the character played by Emma Thompson, an agoraphobic, depressed writer desperately trying to finish her last novel, unknowingly using the life of a real person as her inspiration.The film, though primarily a comedy, is much more than that, and it doesn't hesitate to give us a few great emotional and dramatic scenes, culminating in the second half of the movie when the character hears the voice predicting his death. It also explores the theme of control. The main character first feels he is controlled by the voice who knows even before him what he's going to do, but he soon discovers that if he is controlled, it's by his neurotic tendencies.Will Ferrel, the main actor, does a tremendous job in this difficult role. A lot of his scenes involve close-ups of him reacting to this mysterious voice he hears, and he conveys his confusion and panic beautifully. His reactions range from hilarious at first to heart-breaking when he's on the brink of losing hope, and it feels genuine every time.This film tells us the journey of this character, seemingly living a small, insignificant life, realizing that maybe he aspires to more when it is retold to him in excruciating details by the voice. But at the same time, it shows that every life has its worth, even the most mundane.The end is a little predicable, but offers an interesting conclusion for the characters. If you like atypical movies you should like this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
interesting idea that feels underdeveloped,"Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own ""Truman Show""-like bid at legitimacy with ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" a high concept comedy/drama, written by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Foster, about a man who discovers that he's actually a fictional character in an author's yet unfinished novel.Harold Crick is a straight-arrow, stuffed-shirt IRS agent who lives a life of highly regimented solitude completely cut off from any real social interaction with the people around him. One day he begins hearing the voice of an unidentified woman portentously intoning the details of each of his actions as he goes about the business of living out his daily life. As it turns out, the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel, a neurotic, reclusive novelist who is suffering from severe writer's block as she attempts to complete her latest work of literary fiction. Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh-and-blood human being, Eiffel plots ways to kill him off in the final scene. When Harold finally figures out what is happening to him, he seeks advice from a local English professor (Dustin Hoffman) who comes to believe Harold's bizarre predicament and tries to help him avoid his preordained fate before it's too late.Highly reminiscent of such reality-bending movies as ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" among others, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes - of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art - are so retrograde and shopworn at this late date that the movie comes across as far less cutting-edge and innovative than its post-modernist premise would lead one to expect. There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it. In short, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" feels more like an outline for a movie than a fully worked-out film in its own right.Nevertheless, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is worth seeing for the low-keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page. The resplendent Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the tax-cheating ultra-liberal storeowner whom Harold is sent to audit and who opens his eyes to the possibility of true love for the first time in his ""life."" Their scenes together are genuinely well-played, touching and romantic. With her stiff-upper-lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation. Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.There's a great deal of poignancy in the final act as Eiffel has to decide between literally killing off her creation to preserve her work or letting her creation live even if that means spoiling a potential literary masterpiece. It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God - or at least the demi-god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work. It's a shame that the movie slouches along for so much of its running time on its way to the finale.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An okay Forster picture,"I have never much been a fan of Marc Forster's films and I am not really a fan of this picture either. Stranger than fiction is a creative idea treated with a good amount of craft from the filmmakers. The performances are also well-done especially Thompson and Ferell in the unique serious role. Yet the film loses its appeal when it starts telling us how to think about the negative aspects of storytelling. It begins to tell us bad endings are for the birds and that good endings are the only endings that count. If you agree with the message and do not have any tolerance for negativity, than you will be flattered by it.

Well meaning entertainer caves in on it's devices,"Charming construct takes pride in blurring the lines between tragedy and comedy, reality and fiction, tenderness and edginess to entertaining heights, although the mildly cerebral script reads more like an accessible emulation then bona-fide creation. Tweaking omniscient observational prowess, proved masterful in such existential triumphs as Adaptation and The Truman Show, Stranger Than Fiction manages to pack most of it's brainy sentiment in easy-to-digest, bite sized formats that will compel audiences each step up the twisted narrative. The movie gets points for always maintaining a healthy intelligence that's not too heavy or pretentious for less intellectual-minded moviegoers, but in it's conceptual lightheartedness, most meaningful characterization falls prey to the broad and borrowed ideas.Acting comes and goes in waves of integrity, everyone did well to be in the moment, but some scenes simply work greater then others. By and large Will Ferrell's engagingly meek performance does not penetrate much of an inner reality, which may or may not have been intentional. Nonetheless, his noticeable but eclipsed performance of a sleepwalking taxman gets by with help from the great support, particularly in Emma Thompson's wickedly fun take on a creatively frustrated writer in search of some morbid inspiration.After much amusement is had at scribe Zach Helm's involving behest, his unbalanced third act does not manage to ground much of the overly conceptual gamble. This leaves a pointed character experiment with many wonderful, fictionally transcendent moments, some creative special effects, but also an undeniable shallowness beneath the inventive posturing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Original, well-balanced mix of comedy and drama","""Stranger Than Fiction"" isn't as hysterically funny as the trailers have made it out to be, but that comes as a pleasant surprise. What might have been another slapstick, fantasy movie with cheap laughs à la ""Bruce Almighty"" or ""Click"" turns out to be a really clever and touching dramedy in the tradition of ""Rushmore"" or ""The Truman Show"".This is the story of Harold, a guy who's starting to hear a voice-over to his life. He realizes he's a character in a novel that is about to be killed off. There's probably a million traps this story could have fallen into along the way, but writer Zach Helm gracefully avoids all of them. Both comedy and tragedy are restricted and well-balanced. The focus is never on the question why Harold's character actually hears the author's voice or why he exists in real life at all. What's more important is the thought: what if an artist could meet his own creation? What if a character would suddenly realize that his whole life is merely the creation of somebody else's mind? These are some very philosophical questions and parts of the movie serve as a great analogy for art, religion and the meaning of life.All of the characters are remarkably well-crafted, particularly the literature expert (Dustin Hoffman) who helps Harold find out if he's just crazy or really part of a novel. This character serves as a commentator on the writing process and leads Harold and the audience through the ongoings of the story.Not only are the characters written very well, they are also embodied convincingly by the actors. Will Ferrell finally gets a chance to really shine without any lowbrow comedy. Jim Carrey might have played the part as well, but Ferrell is actually much better suited for it. He nails it.If there's anything not entirely satisfying about this movie it's the ending. I'm still not sure if it wasn't a little cop out. It did feel a little tacked on, as if the writer didn't dare to consequently take the story to the ending that was meant for it. Besides, many questions are left open and, although it's not necessarily a bad thing if not everything is spelled out, some answers would have been nice.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not a good play or a well written book, this is a GREAT movie.","Multiple viewers have stated that they turned-off the movie after the first 30 minutes, the second 30 minutes is where characters start to shine. We really need to get to the third act, that is where the meat is and the actors shine in their roles. I have watched and re- watched this movie over the years since release (sometimes starting at minute 24, the entrance of Dustin Hoffmans character).It was ahead of its time with the integration of H.U.D.-like CGI elements to explain our main character's inner monologue.Will Ferrel is evocative as becomes Harold Crick.The relationships in no way feel forced for developing in under two hours, the characters are real, as are the emotions they feel for us by the actors.Give the movie a chance it should not disappoint.*And its a got a great soundtrack that adds to without distracting from the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have been much more,"This movie could have been so much moremore funny by putting in comical situations, more romantic (I could feel the romance brewing between Harold & Ana), more thrilling (Harold's search for the author could have been more dramatic, with probably some quintessential twists in the plot). But no...the spark of brilliance was missing. It could have kick-started this movie into fifth gear...I kept waiting for it. There were some scenes in the middle which posed supposedly life altering questions - what would you do if you knew you were about to die? But the screenplay just didn't push me to think or feel the desperation which Harold was experiencing. Maybe Mr.Helm should have decided before starting the movie whether he wanted fiction, a comedy or serious drama. Guess we'll never know. Overall, its better than a lot of worthless cinema out there. I really think Jim Carrey would have been a better choice than Will Ferrell to play Harold's character...and yes, I mean comedy!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why 10/10?,"This is exactly the kind of story I would write if I was a screenwriter! Just like Ruby Sparks (2012) by Zoe Kazan (yes, she's the granddaughter of great Elia Kazan).
Actually when I was younger I loved try and write something and one of the story, never finished to say the truth, was about a character who realizes he is fictional. This movie is perfect. I love Emma Thompson, since I first saw her acting in 1989 Tall Guy (higly recommended): she his one of my favorite actress.And I love Will Ferrel, too. One of my favorites is Land of the Lost (2009), a movie that look like the plot was written by sci fi writers Robert Sheckley and Douglas Adams together!I love this movie so much that I want to watch it again in the original version, you know: here in Italy they distribute just dubbed movies.

Love it!,"I've watched this movie twice throughout a span of many years and each time I really like it. It has a pretty unique plot and has very good moral takeaways about how you have to do what you love in life not tomorrow, but today because time is short.

I find it's a really great and somewhat heart-warming movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Certainly Strange, Not Always Stimulating,","Stranger Than Fiction is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast that balance comedy and drama nicely. It is a very off the cuff film that is unlike any other, as we follow a man gradually discovering that he is actually a character in a novel and his creator is struggling to conclude his journey. It reminded me of the Looney Tunes cartoon Duck Amuck, as Harold Crick interacts and struggles to discover the force that is Karen, and we get taken in to a topsy turvy world that will leave us both entertained and confused.It did bother me that the film left me with more questions than answers, there are a lot of head scratching moments that leave me quite baffled, such as Harold being able to visit Karen's office, it is never made entirely clear how this world actually works. As well as that, the mix of comedy and drama makes the film a little underwhelming, as it is never too funny, nor ever too dramatic, since it is trying to do two things, it never does either very effectively.The cast is all around tremendous, Will Ferrell delivers a role completely unlike any of his previous work, playing a character that is funny, but not in his typical eccentric way, and his characterisation in the part is immensely enjoyable. He is also joined by the marvellous Emma Thompson, who plays a very complicated role, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who has great, pure chemistry with Ferrell, and Dustin Hoffman, who brings in subtlety and laughter.Entertaining while it lasts. Stranger Than Fiction is not as incredibly unique as it may think it is, but it is great fun that I would recommend to anybody looking for a good comedy drama.Average man Harold Crick learns that he may soon meet his destiny when he begins hearing a woman narrate his life.Best Performance: Will Ferrell",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger than boring,"I saw Stranger than Fiction with group of friends at a theater, and i wasn't very impressed. I was bored with the lack of humor and entertainment, and i found myself falling asleep. For Teenagers, this is not the movie to see on a Friday night ""outing"" but i can see how this movie would amaze older adults. However: I'm not recommending this movie. We all know Will Farrell as a comedy genius but no matter the effort, it was simply unhumorous. I can see where the idea might have come from however it was presented poorly.

STF,"Stranger Than Fiction reminds me quite a bit of The Truman Show. Take a comedic actor and drop them into a dramatic role that questions the nature of our reality in a really impressive way.

Bad writing can't overcome good idea and decent acting,"How did such a blah screenplay get such a big cast? I don't understand Hollywood.First, Dustin Hoffman is a true actor. Similar to DeNiro, when he enters the movie its quality and thus legitimacy immediately become viable. The movie is worth watching if you like these actors and/or creative plots. I appreciate movies that aren't remakes, copies, or just another sequel to some poorly thought out ""universe"". But if you're thinking of how to spend a Friday night this is likely not it.Overall the writing is terrible. The idea of the movie is good and the themes and delivery are like a less artsy Secret Life of Walter Mitty, which is another movie that can't live up to its creative ideals. The music is even pretty good like Walter Mitty. Will Ferrell does a very fine job. Emma Thompson is pretty good, but the writing just keeps pulling her down. I honestly think she did what she could. Maggie Gyllenhaal is what she always is: average.The isn't a feel good movie but it plays like one. If a movie like this isn't humorous, which it's not, then it needs a better screenplay to carry it.

And I had a crush on Maggie because of this role, she is still great in this role. And Hoffman with Thompson are the same character coming from opposite sides of the story.

"""Stranger"", but not better","Call it ""I Heart Huckabees"" for the average moviegoer. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a trippy dramedy about a drab IRS auditor Harold Crick ((Will Ferell), who discovers his life is being written for him, by uber-successful author Karen Eiffel (the hilarious Emma Thompson), which would be great were it not for the fact that she unwittingly plan to kill him off. Thus begins the quest to find the reclusive Ms. Eiffel and convince to alter the story. Crick is aided by a looney lit professor (Dustin Hoffman), and a rebellious tax-evading baker who he falls in love with. Sound strange enough? The script was fought for among the Hollywood suits, but I can't see why. Sure it's a modestly entertaining existential piece, ala ""Eternal Sunshine"", but not nearly the same caliber. The acting is excellent. The soundtrack is awesome (in my humble opinion, Spoon is the best rock band on Earth). The cinematography is beautiful. But ironically for such a sought after script, ""Fiction"" stumbles because of its writing. At times, the story becomes too trippy for its own good, trying to beat us over the head with its indie ""smartness"" and ""everything's connected"" storytelling that has become in vogue since ""Crash"" took home Best Picture. The story is fun and poignant until the end, where it trips over itself, trying messily to make ends meet and spoiling what began as a lot of fun. This film is worth watching, just rent it so you can turn it off before the final 20 minutes. Create your own ending. It will be better than the real one.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Stranger Than Fiction,"Director Marc Forster has a really diverse filmography, with Monster's Ball, the touching Finding Neverland, and the science fiction thriller Stay, all under his belt. The trend continues with Stranger Than Fiction, a film which is quite difficult to categorize, as it's really a mixed bag, bringing memories of Adaptation (2002), along similar lines where fiction crosses into reality.Will Farrell is Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who lives live by the clock. Everything is precise, and he has this fixation with order. Some might term it obsessive compulsive, but that's the way this closet mathematician lives, doing seemingly mundane things like counting the number of brushstrokes when he brushes his teeth. His ordered life goes awry when he happens to start hearing a female voice narrating his life as it happens, and that is bizarre enough to freak out anyone since an ultimatum was issued.I appreciate the parts where fiction and (screen) reality collide in some weird twists of fate, and contemplate moments where reminders about living life to the fullest, the way you want it to be, get drummed up in the narrative. Taking it to the extreme, it's about the power some of us wields over others, be it employer-employee, or master-slave, or relationships of such. Given that you have the ability to cause hurt, will you continue to go with the decision on the basis of the greater good, or will you seek out a win-win situation, or in less selfish cases, allowing yourself to back down on the negotiations? The closest I can think of when watching Stranger Than Fiction, in the event of the course of work we remove someone from a position, will you be emotionally detached and end your concern at that, or ponder what will happen to people around the victim?Those expecting a comedy by virtue of it being a Will Farrell movie, will be severely disappointed. Similar to Ben Stiller's Night at the Museum, Stranger Than Fiction does contain funny moments, but these are not intentionally funny. It's filled with dark humour along the veins of fellow comedian Jim Carrey's Truman Show, with another being having supreme control over the life of the protagonist. But Will Farrell doesn't disappoint in his dramatic ability to carry the film through as the bewildered, desperate man, and that is essentially what made this movie, which plodded along at times, bearable.Assisted by a strong supporting cast, it's perhaps one of the strongest this year end. It's been sometime since we last saw most of them. The script allowed Dustin Hoffman to make some references to The Graduate, and it's indeed since Meet The Fockers was he seen on the silver screen. Emma Thompson too, given the last outing she had was under heavy disguise and makeup in Nanny McPhee. Here, she's sans makeup most of the time, as the writer Kay Eiffel, suffering from a bad mental block. Queen Latifah didn't have much to do, while you'll probably be distracted by Maggie Gyllenhaal's huge arm tattoo, as she's the token eye candy in the movie.Stranger Than Fiction contains nifty special effects but it's something already seen before. The soundtrack is nice, but nothing memorable. That pretty sums up my sentiments of the movie. It's something, but yet something else at the same time, never being bold enough to stick to what would probably work better, allowing itself to surrender its potentially brilliant strength for a typical finale.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Funnily, I think this is Will's best movie, in my opinion.It's so clean and calming, relaxing and sweet and well made.. like the care you would put into a recipe you'd make when thinking about the person that will try the sugary product of your investment. It's so well made you can feel the love in it. It's hard to explain, but after watching it once you can probably understand this feeling I have about it, and how there aren't that many stories like it. I'm reminded of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, with a witty mystical employed devotion towards a fictional character that will live forever without actually existing.. although it feels like they do, or at least we would wish they did.

This is the story of Harold Crick, who while going about his life starts to hear someone narrating what he is doing. Determined to show that he is not going crazy, Harold does his best to figure out who is narrating his life, and why. Do not think that this movie is long on laughs, it is not.

Directed by Marc Forster, the movie follows the life of Harold Crick, a dull and routine-oriented IRS agent whose life takes a surreal turn when he begins hearing a mysterious narrator narrating his every move.The story kicks off when Harold starts hearing the voice of an omniscient narrator describing his life and actions in great detail. At first, Harold is bewildered and seeks the help of a literature professor to understand what's happening to him. Together, they realize that Harold is actually a character in a novel being written by reclusive author Karen Eiffel.As Harold struggles to come to terms with his newfound awareness, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery and begins to break free from his monotonous existence. Along the way, he falls in love with Ana Pascal, an eccentric baker who helps him embrace life's uncertainties.What sets ""Stranger Than Fiction"" apart is its clever and inventive premise, which explores themes of fate, free will, and the power of storytelling. The film seamlessly blends elements of comedy, drama, and fantasy, creating a captivating narrative that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.The cast delivers stellar performances, with Will Ferrell shining in a rare dramatic role as Harold Crick. He brings depth and vulnerability to the character, making Harold's journey both relatable and heartwarming. Emma Thompson is equally impressive as Karen Eiffel, the troubled author grappling with her own moral dilemmas.The supporting cast, including Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana Pascal, Dustin Hoffman as Professor Jules Hilbert, and Queen Latifah as Karen's assistant, adds richness and humor to the story.Visually, the film is stylish and inventive, with clever visual effects used to bring Harold's internal struggles to life. The cinematography captures the essence of Harold's mundane world and the whimsical elements of Karen's storytelling.Ultimately, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a thought-provoking and deeply human story about the power of literature to shape our lives and the importance of embracing the unexpected.

Strong throughout,"The first remark that comes to mind when thinking of this film is it's good from the very start...to the end ! So many in fact a vast, vast majority of Hollywood mainstream films that do well at being engaging at first will only throw out an entertaining idea to be entertained by its audience for a while, before that idea is exhausted and the experience wears very thin. Here, it holds up til the end, and the conclusion isn't a rushed potato salad that contrasts hard in quality with the earlier developments and hopes of the movie.Some have saluted Ferrel's ""excellent acting"", while others have condemned it saying this role was stripping him of his natural charm that people watch him for in the first place. You must agree at least a bit with the first view. He does superbly well at being a hybrid, a lead character torn between being a mere fictional hero of some narrated story and an actual individual with feelings and opinions and emotions. He conveys that very well.Emma Thompson pretty good also.There are lots of symbols in this film, about the daily life... about just life. The importance of it. It gives an interesting perspective on it. And it does really well to be ambiguous with the two levels it works on but coherent all the same and manage to actually come up with a strong resolve out of that awkward mingling.One of the rare films of its kind to deliver from A to Z. Well done. Certainly more than a mere amusing Hollywood comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A different side of Will Ferrell.,"I absolutely enjoyed Stranger than Fiction, when I first saw it at the movies a few years ago. It seemed so different from most of the other movies that I had seen by that time. My roommate and I left the theater thoroughly impressed.Alas, I've seen a lot more movies since then, and my tastes have been expanded by all the great movies that I've seen in the years that passed. Don't get me wrong, Stranger than Fiction is still a good movie. I couldn't count the number of small smiles that frequently popped up on my face as I watched it. But now I see that beyond a few clever touches, it's really a pretty pedestrian story. It's greatest strength is the rather unique way that the plot is told, but nothing happens that hasn't happened in a million other films.Will Ferrell was a good choice as the main character, but it's not exactly a demanding role. None of them are. But even though the movie isn't exactly the marvel that I remember it being, I'm still glad that I got a chance to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A weird Meta Narrative on story telling.,"Unfortunately I can't say too much here without spoiling everything, but what I can say is that there is more to this movie than meets the eye. Beyond the awkward story of Harold's life being narrated by a pessimistic writer there is a underlying subtext you can find if you dig deep enough. On the surface this looks just like another rom-com with a twist. Like Bruce All Mighty, Yes Man, or even the animal, but this film actual has a strong undercurrent that raises it beyond the rest. I'd only recommend this film to the particularly artsy individuals out there who want something different.

"Good, but only a partial cigar.","I found ""Stranger Than Fiction"" to be one of the best movies I have seen in theaters for an extremely long time. It's plot, though not completely a newly formulated idea, as babsbnz from Chicago, IL ( ...""a la 'Groundhog Day'..."") so perfectly stated, is quite engaging. Will Ferrell did a very good job switching from his more comedic characters, such as his well remembered ""Elf"", to being quite solemn.""Stranger Than Fiction"" did have two goofs that jump out. Firstly, in one scene Harold Crick sits calmly on a bus reading the story of his life. As time passes, the bus comes to the end of it's route, with Harold remaining oblivious and absorbed in his own story, and pulls into the bus garage, for lack of better term. At this point there is a cut to a forgettable scene where I found myself curious as to how Harold would return home; however, within the next scene, Harold surprisingly found himself once more, as I figured, in the same bus, still reading his life story. Viewers are left to ponder whether Will Ferrell was visited by his fairy god-mother and granted magical powers all in one scene cut.The second glitch in this movie is in the script. Harold Crick is forced to live (how long must be solely determined by the viewing of this movie) with a narrator depicting his novel life in a smooth British accent. As this is the main part of the storyline, it is assumed that the reason Harold Crick is able to hear this narrator would be explained. Even if not fully explained, some explanation seemed to be quite necessary to allow a viewer to fully comprehend ""Stranger Than Fiction"".Over all, this movie, hardly able to be considered comedy, was very good and worth the ever increasing ticket and concession stand prices.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unappreciated gem.,"OMG what did I just watch? Not what I was expecting at all. This film has blown me away.I love this concept. It's smart, it's clever and most definitely thought provoking. It's kinda a mediocre Kaufman screenplay, but hey, a mediocre Kaufman is still better than 99% of modern day screenplays.Will Ferrell shakes his usual (not trying to sound pretentious here) simpler comedies to do what previously Jim Carrey did in Eternal Sunshine (a Kaufman you must definitely watch) and Adam Sandler in PTA's Punch Drunk Love to give a serious role full of emotion and masterful acting. I was blown away by how good his performance was. He hit all the emotional strings, his delivery was impeccable and you can't help but love him.The performances by Hoffman, Thomson and Gyllenhaal are all also great. No faults or complaints here.The film hits the marks on all points in direction, storytelling, acting and emotional elevation, already making it better than most comedies and even films in America's recent cinematic history. So why not 5 stars? Well as aforementioned it's a mediocre Kaufman so not quite the level of perfection to earn it full stars, but I felt the third act was a minor (very minor) letdown compared to the first two. Don't get me wrong I still love it. It's still full of the cynicism, optimism, humour and care the first two had, but for a third act it didn't have quite the impact I expected given the build up. A minor and tiny nitpick but enough to cost it full marks.Definitely check it out, it's worth it 100%.

Middle-aged man yells at cloud.,"Funnily enough, 'Stranger Than Fiction (2006)' is, well, strange. I mean, it's an amalgam of so many genres and ideas that it's difficult to ultimately describe. It moves from being a fantasy-based, quirky comedy to a more straightforward romantic comedy and then decides to bring the fantasy elements back (in a much more oblique way) to craft a schmaltzy ending chock full of anti-routine, generically 'life is good' messaging. Seriously, there's a good chunk where the most major hook of the movie just sort of disappears. Even when it returns, it's never really explained or fully explored. There are also some tonal inconsistencies and moments which are played so seriously they actually come full circle and are funny. It's a weird mix, for sure. Thankfully, the majority of the piece is pact and enjoyable, with good, likeable performances and a chuckle-worthy script. It's far more unique than this sort of stuff usually is, too. It's pretty consistently entertaining, even if it doesn't always feel entirely cohesive. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Something differant and Fun,"Sometimes its hard to find a good movie that's a little outside the box of ""normal"" and has good quality. Stranger then Fiction came out swinging as it told a normal story in a unique way. By far this is one of my favourite Will Ferrell films, he is very different then any other film I've seen him in. He's serious, sad and even fun, not over the top or silly, but just a normal guy. The cast was great, with Dustin Hoffman as the ""coach"" to figure out what was going on, he easily brought comedy to the film with his excellent acting skills. Queen Latifah who played Penny, who was strong yet sassy in attitude as she tried to support and fix Karen Eiffel. And of course the brilliant Emma Thompson who always shines a light to her roles. With the great mix of actors and interesting story the movie came across both funny and heart warming. Definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction!!! I don't know but the movie is definitely strange,"Stranger Than Fiction!!! I don't know but the movie is definitely strange. This movie has hero, named Harold Crick, who hears narrator's narration and gets irritated. And so he hears narrator talking of his ""imminent death"". So he starts his quest to find who the narrator is, finally leading him to fiction writer 'Karen 'Kay' Eiffel' and asks her to stop killing him literally (well, literally in her writing which in turn kills him). At the end the writer changes the ending by not killing the protagonist and in turn saving real person. If she had kept the story intact as per her original outline she wrote it would have been a great piece work for stunning career according to a professor. Well what I have written here tells the plot in short. The good thing about the movie is that it tells audience to live life the fullest. That part may be the reason this movie has many positive criticism.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Do not go to this movie,"This has got to be the worst movie I have seen in years! I actually fell asleep,and I never fall asleep at the movies. I love Will Ferrell and Emma Thomson. I have no idea what these two good actors were thinking when they decided to make this movie. I would consider this their Gili moment without them hooking up! This movie was dull and boring. I can't even tell you how bad this movie actually was. I can't believe that i even sat through it. I wanted to leave but something in me thought it will get better, it has to get better. Nope! Don't go, do not even bother.It's not even worth the the night of a rental. Say home and rent or go see another movie!!! This is NO JOKE!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Over-hyped, inconsistent and underwhelming","Stranger than Fiction seemed so promising from the trailer. Could this writer be the new Charlie Kaufmann? Well, sadly the film answers this with a resounding ""Not yet."" A gimmicky and quirky plot (tax inspector starts hearing narration and turns out to be the hero of a novel being written as he lives his life) is sadly not consistently carried all the way through the film. All the best bits are in the trailer, and to be honest, so is about 50% of the plot. A lot of the rest feels forced and unnatural. The casting is mostly superb, except for Will Ferrel, who seems out-thesped wherever he goes. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as usual, but her character is sadly completely unconvincing. Where Charlie Kaufman populates his world with odd characters all of whom have a basic truth and credibility in them, Maggie Gyllenhaal here plays a character whose single purpose is to be the love interest. Her motivations are unconvincing, her development unbelievable, her entire character a slightly upmarket version of a Bond girl. Dustin Hoffman does his quirky I Heart Huckabees shtick, and Emma Thompson convinces as quirky writer (with an underutilised Queen Latifah as enforced assistant).Sadly, the film just doesn't work very well. There are hints of greatness and originality, but that's all they are. Bits of good writing (sometimes even poetic writing) between minutes of average writing. Glimpses of great performances between hours of Will Ferrel. One cannot help feeling that, with a more experienced writer (read: Charlie Kaufmann) and a better actor in the protagonist's role (read: Jim Carey), this film could have been fantastic. Sadly, the ""could have been"" drawer is firmly where the film belongs, managing to remain average between the rare glimpses of genius, and all the more disappointing for it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fell just short of Greatness!,"Last night we went to see ""Stranger than Fiction"" which, by all reviews, promised to be a fabulous experience and a refreshing movie plot we had not seen before.In fact, everything was in place for this to be a GREAT movie...a well crafted story, great performances by Will Ferrel, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhal, a great soundtrack and a very fresh and new kind of cinematography which illustrated the main character's obsession with numbers.As the movie started and the plot began to unfold I was immediately drawn into a main character, Harold Crick, that you easily come to love and route for. And the story was interesting and different enough to hold your attention. Up to this point the only drawback was a very unnecessary placement of Queen Latifa as a writer's assistant....a role with no magic, which could have served it's purpose just as well by Emma Thompson speaking into a tape recorder.Yes, everything was in place for movie greatness and sadly, the last 1/3 of the movie fell flat as a pancake for me. I wish I could go in depth into what made the movie fail at the end, but to do so I would have to ruin the plot twists and ending, so I can't. But I will say this in an abstract way. All of the well-executed components of the movie had successfully made the viewer feel a certain way about the life of the main character and then, in the 11th hour, everything you have been built up to root for is switched and the movie tries to force you to completely change your way of thinking about what is valuable in this particular story...leaving me feeling let down and a bit confused.The movie's end could have been triumphant if the ending had been less morbid or even more morbid, but the middle path they chose was almost disconcerting and held the meaning of the movie back from what it could have been. In vain the writers tried to tie up it's ending with a few musings by the ""author"" writing the fictional story, but it falls way short of being reflective, deep or meaningful like it so easily could have been. In the car on the way home we could have talked about insights about life the movie offered and instead we talked about what the ending SHOULD have been to match the build-up of first 2/3 of the movie. While the movie isn't bad by any means, it is definitely short of greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Of Course I Have Enemies. I'm an auditor for the IRS.,"Karen Eiffel, a British author, has a terrible case of writers block especially when she must kill off Harold Crick, a Chicago IRS tax auditor. Dame Emma Thompson is the British author. Queen Latifah plays her reluctant assistant sent by the publisher to get her to finish her novel. Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick perfectly. Dustin Hoffman plays a literature professor who helps Crick. Maggie Gyllenhall plays Harold's love interest and audit victim. The film was done entirely Chicago which is a great American city. It was nice to see Chicago theatre locals like Ora Jones; Peggy Roeder and Cheryl Lynn Bruce in the film. I wish they shot more movies in Chicago.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Room for Improvement,"Stranger than Fiction could have been sensational rather than okay. There was something low budgetly cult, to use John Water's phrase, about this movie. Putting two characters in a room and having them talk is cheap and not particularly cinematic. It produces a very static feeling in the audience, which should be mistaken for a deep feelings among the characters in the story. Save for the bovine Queen Latifah, the actors were excellent. After Cecil B. Demented, I hoped Maggie Gyllenhaal would be in a part like this. Will Ferrell's less than leading man's features gives us all hope because Maggie is stuff. Emma Thompson was also beautiful and engaging but her scenes reminded me of those photos of George Foreman with a cow on his shoulders. Dustin Hoffman seems to be doing a variation of his role in I heart Huckabees, and in middle-age is starting to look creepily like my dad. And I'm sure everyone knows what he looked like. It is making me identify with the Jason and Will characters for reasons that only affect me. The music was singularly intrusive and misguiding. It is indicative of what went wrong. If another mood was struck for the movie, possibly, brighter and with a lighter touch, this could have outshone the geek who did Human Nature, Being John Malkovich, etc.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A story unlike any other,"This is a very unique story, an interesting illustration of literary character and storyline construction. It follows the protagonist in the most recent novel of a best selling author. Somehow, the fictional world blends with the authors reality, creating a fascinating conundrum for Harold (the main character). He hangs between the impulse to change the trajectory of his storyline, and the advice of a literary expert to enjoy the ride. The story is beautifully told, filled with anguish and joy, discovery and validation. The ending was satisfying, with a mixture of resolution and acceptance of less than ideal circumstances.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Date Film,"Not having heard much about this film made it more enjoyable. I will therefore withhold spoiler comments. Suffice to say that the script was clever and consistent; the characterizations by the actors likewise. Will Ferrell gave a great performance as the protagonist, much restrained in comparison to previous roles (in Zoolander, Bewitched, Elf, etc.--pick one). Reminiscent of a younger William H. Macy, Ferrell brings through his character's existential dilemma loud and clear. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a fluid and believable performance as the love interest whose quirky, rebellious, and intelligent manner make her sexy.Veterans Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson deliver as one would expect, entirely at one with their roles. Emma Thompson is enjoyable to watch doing practically anything, and this role gave her a lot to play with. Last but not least, the supporting cast (most notably Queen Latifah) was solid and held the film together. The story was clever, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and moved along well. The production and direction were stylish and engaging. This film is a great date movie, and is certainly worth the cost of a rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hysterical, Uproarious & Entertaining!","I had to add this to my list after a through re-examination of my humour and let's say the movie has aged remarkably. Will Ferrell is always a comedic legend when it comes to making people laugh and in this funny as ever movie he does just that. I throughly enjoyed this movie as it not only has a great story that keeps you entertained it also has some pretty incredible actos who are also in it as well as the incredible Ferrell.We follow a mentally unstable IRS auditor (Will Ferrell) who happens to hear an author's (Emma Thompson) voice in his head and discovers that he is the ill-fated protagonist of her latest work, a book.I thought it was remarkable at how much I was engaged in this story, its hilarious and should be on everyone list of movies seen.I highly recommend!

Expected More Comedy From Will Farrell,"I knew nothing much about this film, only what I had seen on the trailer and that the cast included Will Farrell. I immediately assumed this was a comedy, yet I found it to be more of an 'easy' watching romance film with a few laughable parts. Enjoyable, but a little disappointing as I went in expecting the usual from Will Farrell, a comedy. I managed to get hold of some advanced screening tickets free of charge to see 'Stranger Than Fiction' so I can't really complain!Plot Summary: Karen Effiel is an author writing her latest novel about an isolated man named Harold Crick. What she doesn't know is that her fictionalised character is real. The real Harold Crick is an IRS agent who has lived a dull existence and one day begins to hear Karen's voice as she narrates what she puts on paper to what Harold has and is doing. Because of this Harold enlists the help of a literary professor to find out what is happening and ends up changing things about his life including beginning a relationship with his IRS client, a government-hating bakery owner named Ana Pascal.

Will Ferrell's best performance (except for maybe Starsky & Hutch),"Definitely cut from that ""out there"" cloth of Charley Kauffman (ADAPTATION, BEING JOHN MALCOVICH), STRANGER THAN FICTION is a more accessible film. Harold Crick (an understated Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent living a bland life of quiet desperation that's narrated by Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Little does he know that he's the main character in Eiffel's latest novel. Luckily, this isn't one of those ""writer makes fictional character do dumb things"" films a la Rob Reiner's ALEX & EMMA but a fun mix of narrative fiction and schizophrenia.When a psychologist (Linda Hunt) can't help him, Harold goes to a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman, also thankfully understated) who tries to determine what genre Harold is living. There's also a romance along the way with a baker that Harold is auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal) that feels a little undercooked. Queen Latifah is also along for the ride in kind of a wasted role and apparently Tom Hulce is somewhere in this film but I just can't remember seeing him in it.I'm not usually one for Will Ferrell films but was glad to see him playing it relatively straight here. There were very few yelling fits or broad physical comedy. It's actual more of a ""serio-comic"" performance and, as long as he doesn't go around moping if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination, he could teach Jim Carrey a thing or two about how to easily pass from comedy to dramedy without delving into crap like THE TRUMAN SHOW or MAN IN THE MOON.Whatever you do, don't watch the preview for this one, though, as it gives away quite a few of the film's finer moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The metaphor for the definition of destiny?,"Will Ferrell's career took a turn for the better with this engaging little fantasy film about a very ordinary man with an exact daily regiment who suddenly hears a voice describing his every action as if were being documented by someone. He finds out that his life is the work of a writer (Emma Thompson) and that his final destiny lies within the conclusion of her book until he can figure out a way to stop it. With a superb supporting cast that includes Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah, 'Stranger than Fiction' is part fantasy, part love story, part detective story and an absorbing metaphor that keeps the debate alive about whether or not people are actually in control of their own lives or whether they are victims of destiny.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
something different from Will Ferrell,"This is not another Will Ferrell comedy. He actually tries his hand at drama here. It is different type of film for Ferrell; however, we have seen films like this before. Such as Jim Carey in the Truman Show. Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS agent who wakes up one day and hears a voice describing his life. He thinks he's crazy as well as others. He visits a doctor but doesn't want to take medication. So, he goes to see an English professor. He describes what the voice says and how poetic he sounds. One day at the teachers office, he sees an interview on the TV of an author who sounds exactly like the voice in his head. He tracks her down and discovers she is writing a book and he is the central character. She writes tragedies, but he asks her not to kill him off. There is a side plot of him falling for a baker whom he audits. Not really a whole lot there. Plus Maggie Gynallhal is way to young to play his love interest.Overall, it was sort of interesting but nothing great. It is not something you care to see twice. And you won't be missing anything by not seeing it.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK. It is what it is. Sort of bland sort of interesting, but nothing that stands out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My new favorite movie,"All I could say after seeing this film was ""That's what I've been trying to say???"" Ya' see, it wasn't hard for this brilliant writer to condense the concept that I've been making an effort to relay to those who will listen for the entirety of my life, into the compact format of a screenplay. Good for you dude! Movie was mad wonderful, and I have insisted that all people I communicate with, go to see it. The character development was frickin' flawless, never have I had a fuller understanding of individuals in a movie. The acting was so much better than I could have imagined...but it all comes down to the writing. Yeah, I have the screenplay, it was ordered the night I saw the movie...I hope to get it signed one day, that would be great. Do not delay, see this movie, so if you die before you make it home, you can have some concept of what you should have picked up along the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliantly original movie!,"Wow! Now this is one of the most original movies that I have seen in a long time! Normally I really do not like watching Will Farrell in any movie (except for Mugatu in Zoolander), but he really impressed me in ""Stranger Than Fiction""! The acting was first rate in this movie, with supporting characters like Robert DeNiro, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah. Will Farrell surprisingly held his own against these heavyweights and together, they carried out the very clever and suspenseful script to perfection. This film really threw me off as it is a very witty comedy, as well as a powerful drama and a potential tragedy (I won't spoil the ending). At points I wasn't sure whether to cry or laugh at the scene, and that is something that very few movies have been able to do to people. The script was very poetically written, considering it is mainly about a famous author's description of an every day guy.Thus, with all these great aspects of the film coming together (acting, script, directing, humor), it made for an exceedingly impressive movie in which I may consider giving a 10 upon a 2nd viewing in the future. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly fun, original, and well executed film!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I especially liked Maggie Gyllenhaal who is very moving. Dustin Hoffman is excellent as usual, as a literature professor and swimming teacher. Emma Thompson is a really good crazy novel author and her British accent makes a good contrast with the American accent of all the other characters.So, it's possible to make a good movie without sex nor violence.

A very strange movie that gave me something unexpected,I am not a movie guy yet as I am young and still watching older movies to understand the culture of film.

The movie has this way of changing a man through the simple things in life weather you play an instrument or bake or go biking these simple things give people joy if you just stand to look at the things you are doing to bring yourself to happiness. This movies teaches about the simple things and that even the most simple of people can be the hero of the story.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loser. Fatally defective premise. One of the year's worst. Goes nowhere.,"Maggie Gyllenhaal was a delight to watch - but even she could not save  this loser movie. There was not a single good emotional payoff! No good  laughs. No warm fuzzy moments. Nothing. This movie is very bad. I felt  very ripped off. I was angry when I left the theater! I blame Will  Ferrell for agreeing to do this loser movie. The premise of the movie  is not believable. The premise/ plot is not entertaining. It is stupid.  This is a first attempt for this weak writer. I wonder what kind of  underhanded deals put this loser screenplay in motion. The previews  were boring and stupid. I mistakenly hoped that maybe there was some  redemption. No. The movie was soundly bad from beginning to end.  Sometimes a stupid premise is used to provide insight. ""Groudhog Day""  was such a movie: ""Groundhog Day"" has a dumb premise but a wonder heart  warming story. Not so with ""Stranger and Fiction"" Aside from Maggie  Gyllenhaal the performances were boring and brainless - and that is the  fault of the boring writer. This movie is beyond mediocre. It  is offensively bad. If theaters could be required to give back the  ticket price, this would be the movie that would deserve a refund.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film isn't the barrel of laughs I was hoping for, but it gave me more than that. This is a film about life, love, and literature. It is fantastic. If I was to compare this film to another in acting terms, I would say that this is like Ferrell's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" except that I enjoyed ""Stranger Than Fiction"" much, much more than that, and so should anyone that watches it.

A fantastic movie!,"In the tradition of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, Will Ferrell, an actor know for his comedic talents makes the jump from comedy, to drama. He does a superb job and gives his best performance ever.Stranger than Fiction is a movie about a man named Harold Crick (Will Ferrell). Harold Crick is an IRS auditor who lives a dull, solitary and deliberately predictable life that revolves around numbers. Little does he know that the only reason that he hasn't died is because a writer named Penny Escher (Emma Thompson) has writers block. She has been trying for ten years to find a way to kill Harold Crick. Harold is the main character in a book called Taxes and Death and somehow exists in the same world as the author. When he starts hearing a voice that narrates his life and foreshadows his future death he enlists the help of a literary professor named Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) to find out who the author is. In the meantime Hilbert suggests to Harold Crick that if his life his going to end he should make it the life he always wanted.That suggestion is basically what the whole movie is about. Living each day like it was your last and getting the most out of life. It is exactly what Harold Crick attempts to do. Will Ferrell, in sharp contrast to his usual role as a crazy, obsessed and dimwitted character is now sensitive, interesting and dynamic. If he continues to star in roles like this one I would not be surprised if he got an academy award nomination. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and seeing how Will Ferrell matured as an actor.On only a few occasions have I left the theater feeling so entertained. This movie was funny, exciting, emotional, uplifting, interesting, intriguing, touching and inspiring. It makes you laugh and think at the same time. All the performances are brilliant and powerful. The writing is flawless. There are parts where you will be on the edge of your seat and others where you will be basking in pure entertainment.I highly recommend this film. Of all the movies I have seen this ranks near the top in terms of entertainment and enjoyment. It will give everyone who sees it something to talk and think about.91%",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Can't Complain,"As a big Will Ferrell fan, I decided that I had to see this movie. I expected this to be one of those films where your favorite actor doesn't play his typical role, I was right. First, I must say that Will Ferrel isn't alone in making this a good film to watch, he is accompanied by pleasant surprises (if you didn't do previous reading on the film) such as Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman.My favorite things about the movie are the balances of emotions and realities. You have Will Ferrell who comes off as a strange-cookie and obsessive compulsive in the beginning with his ritual and repetitive daily acts, but at times he seems normal and not so interested in being ""weird."" Then you have Ana (played by Megan Gyllenhall) who comes off as a punk-rock, rebel who hates anyone, but then develops into a sweet, artistic, and soulful woman.So, it feels like the writers and directors could have gone with the stereotypes, but they didn't, they let the characters be more than just their surface.I also enjoyed the visuals of the film, the architecture was nice and the colors were appropriate for the story and concept.""Stranger Than Fiction"" was an enjoyable film and there is no other way to describe it. It brought upon various thoughts and feelings.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Good kind of Strange ...,"This movie has an innovative plot line and it kept me engaged until the end. I wouldn't exactly call the movie funny; I'd say the word ""endearing"" is more appropriate.Basically, the movie is about a quiet, reserved man who comes to realize something very unusual is happening to him: he is hearing a voice in his head. Not just any voice though - a voice that describes what is happening to him in rich, literary detail. It sounds very much like narration ...The strongest aspect of the movie is definitely its unusual plot. How it unfolds and what happens is what keeps the movie interesting. The innocent tone gives the movie a heartfelt atmosphere. Ferrel seems perfectly cast as a mild-mannered character and Thompson seems right for the role of a neurotic writer.If you are in the mood for some light entertainment, this is a great choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

For those of you who haven't seen the film, don't think for a minute that this is just another ""date movie/love story"" with the same film theory as the movie ""mill"" generates once a week.An amazing performance by an exceptional cast, especially the performance by the always extraordinary Emma Thompson AND I am now twice blown away by Will Ferrell. If you thought he was endearing in ""ELF"" and that it was an accident that he just fit the part which made him so terrific in that role, this will give you yet another layer, another perspective to his acting ability. He's actually BETTER in these more ""serious"" roles than he is at the bumbling slap-stick.The conversations are fast paced and as I mentioned prior, smartly written. Dustin Hoffman has some of the best of these pages of dialog and performs them with perfection!

"A Warm, Witty Film","Stranger Than Fiction is a personal favorite of mine. It is nearly the only Will Ferrell movie I enjoy (excepting The Lego Movie).The film follows Harold Crick, a boring, lonely IRS auditor, as he discovers that he's the main character in a still-being-written novel with a plot that will change his life forever. As the story develops, we meet English Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), a rebellious bakery owner (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who's trying to overcome a lengthy bout of writer's block with the help of a new assistant (Queen Latifah).The first half of the film is particularly excellent. The writing is wonderful and the dialogue is witty and funny. Emma Thompson turns in a delightful performance as a rather moody, detached writer, and Dustin Hoffman excels with his humorous role as an academic caricature. The second half of the movie slows and loses a bit of the magic, but overall it's a fun, heartwarming experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst. Movie. Ever.,"I sat through Son of the Mask. I survived Spider Man 3. And I barely made through The Ring. But Stranger Than Fiction is the worst film I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell, but really, Will, what the heck were you thinking when you accepted this? It sounds promising: a comedy starring Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Maggie Gyllanhall and Emma Thompson? I'm in! But it the end, the film is a big steaming pile of...y'know.The plot is promising too. Ferrell plays a depressed IRS agent who has his life narrated by a suicidal author (Thompson) who plans to kill him. While we could've had an Anchorman-esquire comedy with that, we are instead put through visions of Thompson trying to kill herself, Ferrell acting lonely and depressed, and Gyllanhall just being plain annoying. Latifah is given next to nothing to do but roll her eyes at Thompson, and Hoffman does nothing but mumble his few words. I didn't laugh at one scene, unless you count a small chuckle during one of the previews.I know people praise Ferrell for his performance in this, but I personally hated it. Ferrell sulks on the screen, looking like he wants to chuck himself off a bridge half the time. I like seeing Will Ferrell prancing in an elf outfit, not sulking around Chicago getting into half hearted arguments with a tattooed baker. Overall, a huge disappointment in the career of Will Ferrell. I can only he will recover from it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unexpected but appreciated result of my visit at the movie theater.,"The other day, my friends and I decided that we wanted to go see the new Scorsese movie; The Departed. As we are not the kind of people who plan our lives to the fullest extent, we had made no reservations and had no idea whether it was playing during day time or not. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, The Departed was not on for another couple of hours, and watching any movie weighed over waiting for 6 hours to see the departed, and so we decided to see the new Will Ferrell movie; Stranger than Fiction.None of us had even heard the title of the movie and it's safe to say that we all expected a somewhat silly, but oh-so terribly amusing, classic Will Ferrell comedy. How wrong we were. This was a movie to completely change my perception of Will Ferrell, and I appreciate him even more after having seen him in this drastically more serious role. He has proved himself a versatile, highly skillful actor in my book. Hoffman and the rest of the cast also play very well in the movie and the script is amazing. The movie offers much excitement and triggers many emotions. Good job!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This one is different.,"Will Ferrell moves away from his usual comedy movie choices with Stranger Than Fiction.While still very amusing in places, the real catch for this movie is its original storyline and touching character development.Main character Harrold Crick (Ferrell) is for years a boring, friendless, lifeless, tax agent with an extreme compulsion to count things.Harrold gets up at the exact same time everyday and brushes his teeth the exact same way with the exact amount of up and down and left to right brushes as everyday.However, one morning Harrold begins to brush his teeth and is interrupted by a voice that begins to narrate his everyday life.The plot thickens further when the narrator announces abruptly that Harrold Crick would ultimately die, leading Harrold on a race against time to stop his impending death.A very enjoyable movie with great casting choices.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of a potentially great idea,"Having seen the trailer for this film, I was moderately interested in how it would play out. Having seen the film, I am quite disappointed. Will Farrell is yet another SNL grad who, for my money, should stick to sketch comedy and films that mimic that short-attention-span genre, ie. Anchorman. I really liked the notion of a character discovering that his life is a fiction produced by someone else's imagination. I think there's a lot can be done with that. But this film didn't manage to do that much other than make it a cute comedy with a few clever lines. Maggie Gyllenhall is completely unbelievable as an anarchist; check out her apartment. Dustin Hoffman is on auto-pilot. Emma Thompson seems to have picked up Kenneth Branagh's taste for chewing scenery, and Queen Latifah looks completely bored. Poor acting, a half-baked (pun intended) script. Oh, by the way, it isn't Monty Python and the Holy Grail that you see on the television, it's the infamous Mr Creosote scene from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. I've never been a big fan of Charlie Kaufman, but this disaster puts his skillful handling of similar narratives into sharp relief.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Excellent work all round, plus Will Ferrell's strongest performance to date.","Stranger Than Fiction a premise that only occasionally crops up in film-making; what if the boundaries between what we perceive as real and our imaginations became inextricably linked? As this is such a hard question to base an entire narrative around, it is a pleasant surprise to see that the film succeeds admirably, mostly due to excellent characterisation and a lean script that doesn't waste a word.Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS agent who, for most of his adult life, has just been going through the motions without any feelings or attachments to anyone. He comes across as unresponsive and cold; a man so obsessed with numbers that he counts his footsteps and how many strokes he uses while brushing his teeth, and doesn't really come alive until he starts hearing a voice in his head. Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllanhaal) is a free-thinking, fiery local baker who resents paying income tax whom Harold must audit. Jules Hilbert is a literary professor whom Harold asks for advice when he begins to hear a voice in his mind, dictating parts of his life. Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is a frail but acclaimed author with a severe case of writers block, and only through her narrative does the film take shape and intertwine the characters in a way that skillfully explores the concept of 'breaking the fourth wall'.To say too much about the plot would ruin some of the comedic value and suspense. It is something of a black comedy which is played as dryly as possible for maximum effect. What I can discuss is the performances of the lead characters, which are uniformly excellent. Dustin Hoffman shows how much skill a veteran actor can inject into every nuance seemingly without effort and provides many of the films best lines and physical comedy. Emma Thompson, with assistance from Queen Latifah as her assistant, is convincing as an author trying to wring one last great novel from herself by any means possible.Of particular note is Will Ferrell, who shows us a skill for drama and monologuing that I would never have expected given his previous 'Frat Pack' output. Instead of using hammy techniques and going for the easy and obvious, his understated subtlety works well as Harold grows into his own life and takes control in a way that had once eluded him. It is a completely straight performance played without irony and works all the better for it.As mentioned, the script is completely airtight. I can find no flaws, small or large. It is not necessarily the most quotable piece of work found in a film but it doesn't need to be. The pacing backs up the strong writing: never going too fast and cramming in ideas but never going too slowly to drag and bore the viewer. This makes it appealing as it avoids the currently popular choice where 'fast cuts' are used to artificially inflate the sense of tension.Other points to note. The incidental music is fantastic; whether it is a score or a piece of pop music, the motifs used give the various moments of the film a pleasing cohesion. The titles and subtle use of graphical overlays (mostly in the first act as Harold Crick's methodical life is explained) are very noteworthy, too. Again, small details that add crowning touches to an already impressive motion picture.Stranger Than Fiction is an excellent piece of film-making, proving yet again that big budget special effects and melodramatic performances are not what makes a movie so enjoyable, especially upon repeat viewings. What does matter is characterisation, something that is in abundance here. All the characters have little quirks and tics that make them more tangible and all seem to change and be enriched by the depicted events at the conclusion, finding hidden strengths they weren't aware of and answering all the major questions posed.It is nice to know that pictures like this are still being made, in between the botched remakes of old classics and excessive cartoon-to-celluloid superhero adaptations. A beautiful piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'Stranger than Fiction' a Good Dose of Comedy and Tragedy,"'Stranger than Fiction' tells the story of Harold Crick, a dull and unimaginative man whose life seems to be stuck in pause. His days are spent adhering to an uncompromising routine: he wakes up, brushes his teeth, goes to work, comes home, eats alone, and goes to bed. Everything is perfectly timed down to the minute by his wristwatch. Spontaneity is simply not an option, and not surprisingly, Harold has no real friends. To make matters worse, Harold is an IRS agent. When he does go out to meet new people, it's usually to audit someone for tax fraud.The film opens with a series of shots showing us Harold's daily routine. Almost immediately we hear the voice of a narrator telling us the details of Harold's boring life. The narrator is not Harold, but rather an unidentified female voice. Here's the catch though: one day, Harold begins hearing the voice that's narrating his life story. Since nobody else seems to hear it, Harold believes he's going crazy and seeks professional help. In a very short time, Harold's life will be turned upside down.Emma Thompson plays Kay Eiffel, a well known author in the midst of writing a new novel. She also happens to be the voice of the narrator! Unknown to Miss Eiffel is the fact that Harold Crick, the protagonist of the novel she's writing, is actually a real person. Reality and fantasy collide throughout the movie as we see how whatever is written in the story becomes true. As the story is being written, Harold can hear every word that is typed and knows his fate before it comes.Will Ferrell, who plays Harold Crick, gives an unusually understated and subtle performance for a comedic actor. His performance is reminiscent of the kind of minimalism that we usually expect from the likes of Bill Murray. By not overacting, Ferrell gives the movie weight and depth and manages to make a mundane character worthy of audience sympathy.'Stranger than Fiction' is ultimately a movie about fate and control. That's one of the problems I had with it. On the one hand, Harold Crick learns his fate from the narrator and tries to change his ways. He falls in love with Ana Pascal, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and tries to learn to play the guitar. All of this is an attempt to truly live life as it is meant to be lived. On the other hand, Harold's life is being dictated by someone else. So doesn't that mean that Harold has no free will? The movie tries to have it both ways and it doesn't really work. It's hard to cheer for a character whose life is being completely controlled by someone else. Even when Harold does try to change his ways and escape fate, he remains a passive character.The ending, which I will not reveal, is both unsatisfying and disappointing. It's a bit of a cop-out and an appeal to Hollywood sentimentalism. Also, some of the supporting roles are wasted opportunities. Dustin Hoffman, who plays a college professor helping Harold Crick, is given little to do. Queen Latifah, who plays Miss Eiffel's secretary, is given even less to do. I'm still going to recommend the movie, however, because it's always well intentioned. I think it's one of those movies that might have looked better on paper than on film. I'll definitely give it credit for being original.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
outstanding!,"Altought it's a little late to comment about this film, I couldn't avoid to print my small point of view. I saw this movie a couple weeks ago. It really stuck out, I hadn't seen all the good comments about it, that's why I hadn't write something. Let me say that this script is quite sensational, throughout the flick I was eager for discovering what happened in every shot. A original Will Ferrell's performance, it's nice to see different characters of a guy that has a particular line of acting. The rest of the cast did sufficiently well in support, the direction of the film was excellent as well. A excellent plot, full of emotions and different kind of feelings.

Didn't live up to the promise,"I like this recent spate of constructivist movies playing around with narrative authority, time, and memory (think of Usual Suspects, Memento, Run, Lola, Run), but this film allows two characters to prevent the suspension of disbelief. First there's Gyllenhaal's Ana. An anarchist running a oh-so-cool bakery, who then falls remarkably quickly for the nerdy, uptight IRS guy. Next there's poor Latifah, brought in to close a book buy getting the author to kill the character, an intriguing premise, but she doesn't do anything. These two characters are crucial to the plot, but they are in the end simply devices, ironic since this is supposed to be the author's (Thompson as Eiffal) masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Funny and insightful,"Of all the films I've seen with Will Ferrell, I have to say that this is my favorite, so far. He is brilliant as Harold Crick, a highly organized (to the point of obsession)and somewhat forlorn IRS agent, who finds his tightly controlled life start to unravel one day when he begins to hear a voice narrating his life as though he were a character in a novel headed for a tragic end. This sets into motion an hilarious series of events that involve a somewhat bohemian baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and a Professor of English Literature (Dustin Hoffman), who together with the eccentric novelist (Emma Thompson) narrating him to his apparent end, bring him around to a fresh perspective on life. Granted there is a strong fantasy element here; the idea that a novelist creates a character that just happens to be real in every detail, and that he can actually hear her as she writes about his life, is of course, really ""out there."" Also, the idea that a bohemian baker can relate at all to a very conservatively minded IRS agent challenges also. But honestly, the film charms you so that you can't help but just go with it. This is no superficial comedy that is only designed to trip the funny bone, but is as entertaining as it is insightful about what it really means to live a happy, meaningful life.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good...could have been great,"Twist Endings have always faded in and out of popularity over the decades...recent movies, from ""The Usual Suspects"" to ""Fight Club"" to the first ""Saw,"" usually bank on a curveball in the last act that aims to redeem something seemingly conventional with a forehead-slapping plot development. In the world of ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" the ""twist"" is done with such earnestness and honesty that part of me felt bad in not completely accepting it; there is a palpable dramatic swell, after which we cut away to What Really Happened. I guess any movie that casts Will Ferrell as a bland-as-cardboard IRS auditor looking to seize the life he's wasted deserves some consideration, especially in its third-act machinations. Ferrell plays the painfully-named William Crick, who lives a life of routine (counting teeth-brushing strokes, for instance), until one day he begins to hear a woman narrating his life (including a budding relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaal); turns out he's unwittingly become the main character in reclusive author Karen Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) new novel. The catch? Eiffel's lead character always dies. While ""Fiction"" is modest in its exploration of existential matters, the randomness of its premise comes off as gimmicky; while director Marc Forster (""Finding Neverland"") keeps things moving along with a sense of purpose (though the superimposed diagrams that occasionally flash on-screen are a distracting miscalculation), Zach Helm's screenplay barely rises above convention. Ultimately, ""Fiction"" is a case of the performances really selling the material: Ferrell is quite good in a quietly funny and believably dramatic role; Gyllenhaal is plucky and spunky as his love interest; Thompson communicates a wonderfully wiggy, stress-fried persona; and Dustin Hoffman shines as literature professor who helps Harold with his predicament.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Made me think twice about calling a movie predictable!,"Stranger than Fiction is one of those movies than you would try to predict, but everything turns out totally different. Here I was, at the movie theater, attempting to predict a movie with so many twists and turns. When you hear Emma Thompson's words projecting from that movie screen, your mind is elsewhere, trying to figure out what all this means. There are so many lessons to be learned from this movie. Even if you think you figured them all out, you still have many more lessons to learn.The movie starts out with Harold Crick (Will Ferrel), an ordinary IRS agent, hearing a strange female voice in his mind. This voice narrates what is happening in his life and foretells what will happen to him. Harold figures out that he is a character in a novel... written by an author who always kills off the hero (which is in this case, the hero is Harold). And then, the author narrates that he will die. So then Harold seeks out a literature expert, Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) to help him out. Jules helps him reveal the identity of the author. Harold then seeks out Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) to tell her that he is real and that he will die if she writes this.Will Ferrel, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson make a fantastic movie, as they usually do. This is easily Will Ferrel's best performance.7/10 and Three Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Semi-serious Will Ferrell in an Expertly Orchestrated Film.,"When I first saw a preview for this movie, I was extremely excited to see that Will Ferrell was going to be in a serious role. although it is a fairly serious movie, Stranger Than Fiction still has it's odd moments in which Ferrell still brings his usual funny lines and what were most likely ad-libs. Harold Crick, his character in the film, is an IRS associate that goes through what seems like schizophrenia. he then is called to audit Maggie Gylenhaal who is a Harvard-Law dropout who now works at a self-established bakery. From there, the story just keeps on developing into a beautiful movie with Dustin Hoffman providing Harold with wisdom. Stranger Than Fiction is saying that we should live every day to the fullest, pursue realistic dreams, and not to overlook the little things. This is a great movie. go see it if you like Will Ferrell, but don't expect to be completely brain dead because you might have to ponder some ideas in the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Harold freaks out and his life changes completely. Anyways, the story becomes interesting and gives great explanations into what's going on. At some points you might even question your aspects in life when you really think about some of the things. Anyways, the movie was something a good amount of people would enjoy. I actually didn't get out of my seat to get more popcorn for this movie like I did with Miami Vice which equaled Garbage.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger and Better than what's out there,"Perhaps the most interesting concept in mainstream film this year, Stranger than Fiction has Ferrell playing the character in Thompson's newest novel, though he just recently has become aware of his status as fictional character. The idea is brilliant, much in the vein of Charlie Kaufman's crazy ""plot within a plot"" films like Adaptation, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Thankfully, the entire cast is up to the task of making the most mileage out of this quirky concept. Ferrell's crazed lunacy works wonders here, as his everyman abilities blend nicely with his penchant to spazz out in full improvisation mode. He equally carries the romantic, psychological, and comedic sub plots with ease, effortlessly engaging with his co-stars.Gyllenhaal deftly handles another May-December romance, adding to her growing resume. She and Ferrell have a bizarre chemistry that you'd think you'd only find in a novel (or a film), further adding to the perplexity of the film's converging plot lines. She is sexy and charming, but believably drawn to Ferrell in way that's hard to explain, without the help of Hoffman's literary professor character.Hoffman continues his career resurgence, as he is quickly morphing his history of brilliant leading man turns into stellar supporting roles that are upstaging his co-stars. Here he propels the film forward by guiding Ferrell's character arc and bridging the two major plots together. Hoffman demonstrates his comedic prowess in both physical and lyrical delivery, and is a treat to watch.Finally, Thompson, who is normally one of my most hated screen foils for no reason other than she's the type of Brit that irritates me, rather than entices me, is quite charming as the writer of the entire piece. Thankfully, her screen time is limited, though she delivers well, much as she did in Love Actually.This film has to be seen, possibly multiple times, to be fully appreciated. You will enjoy it on a multitude of levels.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Plagiarized idea from ""Mist""","It's a shame. The thrust of the argument of this story is a shameless plagiarism of the famous novel ""Mist"" by Miguel de Unamuno, in which the main character, Augusto Perez, going to the author's house to ask him not to assassinate him in the novel. ""Mist"" is the most significant fiction of this Basque writer. The book addresses the insecurity of modern man who cares about his fate and his death, a theme par excellence Unamunian. ""Mist"" was written in 1907 and published in 1914. ""Stranger than fiction"" plagiarized an idea that is 100 years old. Another striking episode is the reference to cookie dipped in milk that causes a strong déjà vu of the ""cupcakes dipped in tea"" from the novel ""In Search of Lost Time"" written by Marcel Proust, coincidentally, at the beginning of the twentieth century. It seems the author of ""Stranger Than Fiction"" has a preference for novels written in that time. Film with uncreative argument.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is lovely, elegant, playful movie-making - compare the overlong and clankingly obvious 'Adaptation'.

"Enchanting, Sweet, and Too Funny!!!","This is a story about a man named Harold Crick, and his wristwatch. Those are the first line you hear Emma Thompson say over the action. The wristwatch actually plays quite a large role in this film- it really determines the ending. And though your first thought might be that this would be a ridiculous film, think again. This film is excellent.It's a story about a man, Harold(Will Ferell, in one of his best roles), who has lived his entire life in the most ordered and planned way possible- he does the exact same thing everyday. I mean, the man counts his brush strokes every morning while brushing his teeth! Then one day, he begins to hear a voice that is quite hilariously narrating his life. Then, the voice says he will die. Harold freaks, and sets off to try and discover what he can do about this very serious problem, and by doing so he starts a brand new life that will make him do things he never dared to do before. And yes, he stops counting his brush strokes.Smartly, the film never comes off as heavy-handed or overly-dramatic. It keeps a light and very humorous tone throughout the whole film while still delivering a great story. Will Ferell gives a very sweet performance as Harold, and you can really connect with him as he changes. Dustin Hoffman is also good as the literary expert who Harold seeks out to help him discover who the voice narrating in his head. Queen Latifah does fine in her rather small part, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is enchanting and sweet as the woman Harold falls in love with. The best part of the film, though, is Emma Thompson's captivating performance as the author who is narrating in Harold's head and so desperately trying to kill him off in her latest book. She gives on of the best performances of the year and makes herself the stand-out of the film by far. But, we've come to expect such great performances of Ms. Thompson. She gives one of her best in this film.This is an over-all fun, original, funny, and very sweet film. I've seen it twice in theaters, and plan to buy it on DVD. The underlying message about living your life for the best it can be, and the overlying sweetness and light-heartedness of the film work together perfectly to create one of the best films of the year. 9/10 stars!Jay Addison",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life and Art Clash for a Sad Sack Tax Auditor in a Kaufman-Lite Fantasy Dramedy,"Put-upon protagonist Harold Crick appears to exist in the same absurdist universe as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's off-center characters in ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"". It is not Kaufman, however, who penned the creative script here but rather Zach Helm, whose fertile imagination drives this fatalistic 2006 dramedy. Directed with a nice contemporary panache by the increasingly versatile Marc Forster, the fantasy-driven film focuses on Harold's sadly mundane existence as an emotionally unavailable, anal-retentive tax auditor for the IRS.One morning, he hears a particularly erudite voice describe his life with real-time precision and zealous literacy. Harold desperately seeks out the source, first by speaking with the unctuous office psychiatrist and then by eliciting the help of an eccentric literature professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert. It turns out to be the voice of author Karen Eiffel, who has been undergoing writer's block for nearly a decade, a situation alarming enough to her publishing company that they send a foolproof assistant to ensure a final manuscript is delivered. In the meantime, Harold finds himself drawn to a high-spirited, non-conformist bakery owner named Ana in the middle of a testy, confrontational audit. But the more serious problem is that Harold is the main character in Eiffel's nearly completed novel, and she always kills off her heroes in her books.How Helm and Forster resolve this fanciful dilemma is the best part of the movie because they build the far-fetched convolutions toward a satisfying emotional resonance. If the rest of the set-up doesn't reach the dizzying high-wire act of Kaufman's best work, the film still has genuinely clever plot turns and moments of creative momentum. In a reflective seriocomic performance, Will Ferrell proves he has the acting chops to handle the gravity of Harold's dilemma, even if he has to act constrained most of the time. Emma Thompson manages to capture Eiffel's angst-ridden reclusive nature with her familiar sardonic aplomb.As Ana, Maggie Gyllenhaal finally has a role worthy of her ripened, effortlessly coquettish persona. Playing a more deadpan variation of his bumbling sleuth in ""I Heart Huckabees"", Dustin Hoffman nicely underplays Hilbert. Queen Latifah has relatively little to do as Eiffel's assistant Penny, but she does it with authority. With this accomplished film, Forster really shows a flair for balancing the whimsical with the tangible that drive Helm's charmingly inventive story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Too many thoughts to put into one summary line,"Stuff like ""Critics of Will Ferrell need see this movie and reconsider"" or ""Charlie Kaufmann and Spike JOnze could've wrote this!"" were some of the ideas that came to mind to sum the way I felt about this movie,but they really couldn't do this justice. THere's plenty of themes being played with in this off-beat,gentle and existential comedy,and I'm gonna TRY to cover all of them in this comment/review.FBI auditor HArold Crick(Will Ferrell,as docile and somber as he's EVER been in film to this point)lives the highly ordered,lonely lifestyle of someone who would be considered a nearly hermit-like control freak. Numbers,stats and equations are very much the gatekeepers of order in his world,and he approaches his job,just like everything else,with a sense of professionalism and efficiency. He has few friends,no discernible family,and has no great ambitions and goals in life.Somewhere through the order of work and life4,two things create a disruption:the interest he's feeling stir in him over a pretty,bakery manager he's about to audit(Maggie Gyllenhaal,whose large,pretty facial features and warm,sexy body language are as enticing as I've witnessed of any female lead in a comedy) and the small matter of a narrator's voice that has been correctly and acutely describing Harold's life that he(And only he)can hear. When he discovers that the voice is not only accurately describing every element of his life,but is hinting at his imminent demise,he starts to slowly realize that while he may be the center of his own narrative world,he is most certainly not in control of it.While this happens,dyspeptic author and recluse KAren ""KAy"" Eiffel(Emma Thompson,who looks like she's been on a steady diet of black coffee,cigs and little-or-no sleep for weeks)wrestles with writer's block over her next novel,which has been on hold for over a decade. Sent to her is a no-nonsense editor's assistant(Queen Latifah,who is showing that she can dial it up as well as down with equal amounts of effectiveness) there to help tighten her finishing of the novel she's trying in great frustration to finish. The book Kay is trying to finish involves the mundane life and appropriate-yet-somewhat ironic demise of one very unremarkable character,one by the name of HArold Crick.As HArold tries to track the source of his distress,through shrinks and anyone who'll listen,he instinctively goes for the counsel of a English professor and literary expert named Hilbert(Dustin Hoffman,paternal,droll and patient;not qualities ordinarily admired in a performance for films,but very necessary here,and as such,very well done!),who tries to infuse guidelines for whether or not Harold's life falls into two basic literary constructs:comedy or tragedy. While HArold's quest to find a clear difference between the two elements seems to yield mixed results,it starts to clear things gradually to the IRS auditor that his life needs a narrative direction,and he may or may not have much time to figure that out.Directed by untraceable auteur Marc Forrester(unless YOU can link MOnster's Ball and Finding Neverland to this type of film) and written by relative new-by scribe Zack Helm,this movie would be oh SO easy to pigeonhole as an existential comedy or light drama,but it feels like more than that. It's kind of a knowing Dramady,a film and story that understands the constructs of narrative creation,and has the ingenuity to parallel that across the type of mundane,unextraordinary lives that ordinary people live. Ferrell shows great restraint in the role as Crick,but really everyone here seems to fit their roles with ease. Even minor parts such as the one friend Crick considers from work(Tony Hale)or the two shrinks who seem helpless in finding the root of his dilemma(Linda HUnt and a hirsute,heavy and unrecognizable Tom Hulce) are added with the right measure. This is a film that may test the patience of more direct,linear film-goers,and the ending(and this as close a spoiler I'm giving)seems to be somewhat of an awkward fit for the way this film builds, but this is arguably a very memorable movie and it somewhat defies an easy description. See it for yourself,and see if you don't agree.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Great movie, one fatal flaw that wasn't in the acting...","This was a great movie with one exception. When I go to see a movie that costs millions to make and contains big name stars, I expect for the editors to be able to remove the microphones that kept dangling over Will Ferrel's head and some of the co-stars.

Luckily, it started happening just over halfway into the movie. Unluckily, it was during the ""epiphany"" and most important part of the film.Other than that, Will Ferrel was the perfect fit for this movie. I went into the theater expecting another goofy, silly performance. What I got was real, or as real as a movie with this plot can get.

"An unusual, but never mundane, film....Ferrell is excellent!","Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent obsessed with numbers. He brushes his teeth a certain number of times each day, walks the same number of steps to catch the bus, and does complex multiplication in his head with great ease. One day, however, he hears someone ""narrating"" his life as he goes about this daily existence. He consults a psychiatrist who suggests schizophrenia. But, Harold knows he is not going crazy and, instead, turns to a literature expert (Dustin Hoffman) to help him make sense of the voice. Then, too, Harold is struck by some of the narrator's words and he realizes he is missing some of the big assets of life, such as love. He is smitten with a lovely baker, who he is supposed to be auditing, and he goes for broke in the romance department. It works in his favor. But, wait a minute. The narrator suddenly predicts Harold's death. Does poor Mr. Crick have any hope in avoiding his own demise? This is an out-of-the-ordinary movie, to say the least. It has wonderful messages about living life to the fullest but it's own construction is somewhat awkward and misconstrued. The idea of Harold being a character is someone else's book is difficult to fathom and does not quite work in the final analysis. That being said, Ferrell is absolutely wonderful as the man who needed a running commentary on his life to discover new possibilities in living. The rest of the cast, including Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah, is also very nice. Production values, including costumes, setting and photography, are more than adequate. If you want to see a film that is a far cry from the formulaic, this is the one to choose. The story may not be entirely successful, but with Ferrell in the lead and the other fine cast members in tow, a viewing of this film will take you to the brave new world of intriguing film making.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Engages both the heart and the mind in a lo-fi way...,"Stranger than Fiction is a kind of a Garden State for grown-ups. Strange but not over-complicated, or overdone: sweet, sincere, surprising, and original. Unsual fare that is highly watchable and definitely worth the admission or rental.In particular, it's hard not to like the underplaying by all the actors: even in the moments where overacting would seem appropriate. Will Ferrell gives a performance that is much more in his Woody Allen style: small nuances, and an everyman confusion - even the compulsive disorder is played down: nice. As the movie develops the characters become more and more entwined but - and here is the clever part - every character is given enough time and space to make their delivery count - it really is a pleasure to watch, and like a great meal it is not the fare but the experience that really matters and lingers.A film about life, death, fate, literature, and yet it is handled with a sense that this is entertainment for the more grown-up without being intellectual stodge.The viewer is left with a very rounded experience - it really engages both the brain and the heart in a way that's all too rare - definitely one to savor and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Oh, the Tragedy of Harold Crick.","First of all, Will Ferrell is amazing as Harold Crick. I highly doubt that anyone expected his performance to be as good as it was. I, myself was surprised at his ability..His performance was almost immaculate, though he could have been funnier. I'm not gonna lie; I thought it was gonna be the typical Ferrell comedy with a clever twist and actual plot line, so needless to say I thought he'd be a screwball. Surprisingly though, he was rather serious about it, so his performance lacked that wild.. spontaneity(maybe?) that usually comes with the Ferrell package, (meaning he didn't fully lose himself in the role until mid-film, as opposed to his performance in Elf and Talladega Nights, where he was screwball from beginning to end.) Also, I wasn't fully convinced nor did I cheer him on until mid-film.The film itself is a pearl in an oyster, meaning it looks decent, but the true brilliance doesn't show until the fourth wall is broken and opened. I think this is due to the fact that Ferrell's character doesn't become interesting until he realizes that he's being commented on by some random woman with an English accent. Kind of makes you wonder what you would do if you were him...The cast is amazing, and aside from the plot, the cast makes the movie. Who's a better supporting cast than Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Maggie Gyllenhaal? Honestly! On that note, I bid you adu.~the amazing frances.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A bland, cliché of a movie","I am so angered at having sat through this movie that i have registered an account with IMDb just so i can write this review and spare someone else the torment i have just been subjected to.I enjoy a Will Ferrell movie to sit back,laugh and relax into, finding comfort in his recognizable comedy style. However I was aware that the mere concept behind Stranger than Fiction would not lend well to the Ferrell i had become accustomed to but his usual humor still shone through. Add such greats as Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson and i was expecting something memorable with a certain originality. Unfortunately i was subjected to the opposite.After a very short time into the film i started to draw obvious comparisons to the Truman Show; although not exactly the same situation, the main character does begin to find that his life is being orchestrated by another person and seeks a way to find out his apparent destiny. Ferrell does this by speaking to a professor of literature played fantastically by Dustin Hoffman. He then finds the narrator to his life to be a writer played by Emma Thompson. So far a very basic and quick to establish scenario for the story.Now this is where the film follows the well trodden track of clichés and predictive plot. Stop me if you have heard this before.. a boring character who suddenly becomes inspired to be a more interesting person, apparently seizing the day after discovering love where he thought he had none (in this case a slowly warming female played by Maggie Gyllenhaal). The now evolving hero blossoms into this glowing hero of a man, inspiring us, the viewer, to look into our own lives and draw an uplifting sense of optimism that we too could better ourselves and get more from life! PLEASE! Don't treat us like children. Don't patronise us with the same stale fell-good story. Don't ruin my opinions of Ferrell, Hoffman and Thompson who have all agreed to take part in this banality.The next major problem i have with this film is how it knowingly pokes fun at itself. A writer with the inability to make a masterpiece she has become so well known for. A writers block which is causing her novel to drag on and on without closure. This is how the film makes me feel! Please end and release me from this nightmare. Then Hoffman references the fact that there exists only Seven basic plots and eliminates in front of our very eyes all but five of them explaining to Ferrell that his destiny can therefore only follow one of the remaining two. Is this really necessary, again please don't treat us like idiots! Then the narrator with writers block has issues with concluding Ferrell's destiny following one of these two plots. Does the film have to become so narrow that i have a 50% chance of knowing how the film ends?! I should have guessed by now anyway by the mushy feel good crap that is being spoon fed to me and now half way through the film i am angry that i have sat this far through it. I am now to be dragged reluctantly to the anti-climatic ending which leaves me with a ""oh no - please don't let this pathetic moral of an ending be the closing of what is a wasted opportunity of a film idea!""It saddens me to realise that yes, there are only seven basic plots that a work of fiction can take and yes, this film, like the life of Ferrell's character, can only follow one of these seven paths but do i need this excuse to be forced upon me to accept that this film may not live up to my expectations. I have seen many films which have been subjected to the same restrictions in plot direction but they have left me with good memories and not an bitter aftertaste. Unfortunately Stranger than Fiction is one of the nastiest aftertastes i have had the misfortune to experience.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Creative mix of cinema and literature,"Stranger than Fiction rewards you from the very beginning; you hear the voice of a woman narrator recounting every repetitious step in the life of IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) while you watch his tedious life unfold on the screen. He rises exactly at xx:yy a.m., brushes his teeth precisely zw times, walks across the street at the cross walk careful to step on the white markings, catches the bus at such and such a time, etc., etc.His actions are determined by a very special wristwatch that serves as his alarm clock and, really, his identity. Aside from the regimentation of the watch, the special effects wizards attend Harold's various movements with little white numbers of time or money calculations. Like images on a blackboard, only there's no blackboard, then when the formula is completed, the numbers and geometry crumble into nothing.Then he realizes he's a character in a story...There isn't a single false step in how the actors execute the characters and in how the director fulfills the artistic vision of the writer (Zach Helm). Indeed, the roles are perfectly cast, even Queen Latifah who carries herself professionally as the publisher's rep charged with breaking down Karen Eiffel's writer's block. But especially Ferrell. He's the perfect mixture of shyness, intelligence, and, yes, understated humor... like Peter Sellers in Being There, though certainly not on that scale....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great cast, great script, super movie","We caught an early showing of this movie last night and like the rest of the audience (to judge by the laughter and applause) thoroughly enjoyed it. Will Ferrell as Harold Crick is fantastic in a completely different kind of role from his usual over-the-top comedy performances (which I always enjoy, but it was nice to see him stretch a little). Maggie Gyllenhall is adorable, and Emma Thompson is magnificent, as always. Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman are also very good in their supporting roles, as is Tony Hale (Buster from ""Arrested Development"" as Harold Crick's work buddy, Dave). The cinematography and special visual effects are quite nice; it's a pleasure to see Chicago looking so picturesque. Although this is a comedy, it has a deep undercurrent of thoughtfulness that makes you feel really invested in the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An enjoyable, inventive sort-of-comedy","You'd be forgiven for mistaking this film as a Charlie Kaufman creation because screenwriter Zach Helm seems to have pulled a page right out of Kaufman's book of quirky ideas. Needless to say, if you enjoy Kaufman's inventions then you will probably enjoy this film as well.The story concerns an IRS auditor (Will Ferrell) who suddenly finds that his life is being narrated by an unknown voice that only he can hear. The premise is simple but the treatment shows surprising depth. The film freely plays with conventions and manages to make some pretty dry concepts somewhat palatable.The cast is well-assembled, with Will Ferrell taking the spotlight and holding his own alongside major talents like Dustin Hoffman & Emma Thompson. Also worthy of note is the ever-enchanting Maggie Gyllenhaal.My main regret is that the movie wasn't quite as good as I thought it could have been. There were some very funny moments early on but comedy soon took a back seat to more 'serious' matters. I think that a more outright comedic slant would have benefited the picture. Not to the exclusion of the 'serious' side but hand in hand with it.When you get down to it, though, I'm just glad to see that there are still a few movies coming out of Hollywood that can't be pigeonholed into an easy classification.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Opinion,"This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. Will Farrell plays a character that I now list as my favorite from anything he's done. He is much more serious in this movie, but still keeps his classic humor. The supporting cast including Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhall, Queen Latifah and (my favorite character played by) Emma Thompson really hold the movie together well. Everyone brings different dynamics and humor to the film. Everything from the directing, cinematography and acting is masterfully done. This movie is good for a wide audience either those looking for a comedy or a smart, solid storyline. There is no reason anyone should pass up on this film and all it has to offer.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Fact Is The Fiscal,"I got really geared up for this film before it was released. Had the makings of Spike Jonze doing a Douglas Adams novel with Terry Southern and Tom Stoppard as the screen writers. And the cast drafted, it had the Vegas odds of being a sure fire win. So why wasn't it? In two words - 'creative restraint'. What had the air of a 2hr 23min Woody Allen or Terry Gilliam art house masterpiece was brutally condensed, compressed, and compacted to run just a little more than a hour and a half. And even then it still seemed like it was too long. It starts off well enough, and draws the viewer in. But as the revelation and paradox starts to unfold, it gets sidetracked to this valiant and righteous love story. Which could have worked well enough on it's own without the superfluous and surreal pretense of this 'parallel universe' meanderings. But that's what I initially bought the ticket for. And was like sitting on a well inflated Whoopee Cushion with a delayed reaction. It was sitting high at first, and comfortable. And I knew something was going to 'go off'. But when it did, it was quiet and muffled and not at all the outlandish and chaotic hilarity I had hoped for. I just slowly sank in my seat disgusted while the old lady three rows behind thought it might be her emanating the rude expulsion - which this film rightfully deserves anyways. Too little with too much does not always equal cinematic merit. The box office receipts, and where did a hour and a half of your life disappear to is the true mystery of Stranger Than Fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Already Dead, Just not Typed","Greetings again from the darkness. The endless run of previews for this one had me a bit concerned that it might be a comedy with 4 funny scenes - all of which appear in the trailer. I never should have doubted director Marc Foster, who has two excellent films to his credit: ""Monster's Ball"" and ""Finding Neverland"". As different as those two films are, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" proves Mr. Foster has a real eye for quality scripts, regardless of genre.For anyone expecting a typical Will Ferrell film or performance, I say go in with an open mind instead. Ferrell is remarkably deadpan as IRS agent Harold Crick, who just so happens to also be the protagonist of novelist Kay Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) latest book. This is Ferrell's best performance on film to date.The film is a bit quirky, but provides an excellent look inside the world of creative writing, while at the same time allowing us to question the daily process we go through in living our lives. ""Adaptation"" provided a look behind the curtain at the writing process and in this film the ""meet your maker"" theme is an added bonus as a nice thought provoker. What if the maker is really making it up as he/she goes? What if we have more control over our destiny that some would believe?The three lead actors are all terrific. Ferrell as Harold Crick is like a blossoming flower as he discovers life with the luminescent Maggie Gyllenhaal (a baker - one who makes things for others enjoyment). Thompson is just outstanding as the blocked writer who always kills off her main characters and finally starts to question why. Few actresses would allow themselves to be filmed as disheveled and unmade-up as she appears here. Supporting work is solid by Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah (surely much of her role was left on the editing floor?), Tony Hale, Linda Hunt and an almost unrecognizable Tom Hulce (remember ""Amadeus""!).A solid script, nice direction, wonderful acting and a very interesting theme make this an excellent film for most ages. Pay attention to the nice music provided by Austin's own Spoon.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slight disappointment,"Pretty slight and sometimes awkward comedy/drama, propelled only by a great cast and interesting visuals. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, which is fine, but it's not even clever or witty for much of it, and many times the joke attempts just fall flat. The drama portions are heavy-handed and melodramatic, and the romance feels rushed and, as a result, becomes unbelievable. The acting is terrific, though - Will Ferrell is great playing against type, Dustin Hoffman is quietly funny, and Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah are both solid. But Maggie Gyllenhaal steals the show, coming across as both funny and sad. I liked the writing and diagrams on screen to represent Crick's thought process, and the look of the film is adequately quirky, but the story just leads up to nothing. Somewhat disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Barely Worth Watching,"To sum it up, the premise of the movie is interesting, but the execution... not so much.They could have done some hilarious things with the narration, put him in some wacky situations, but instead it just plays out in the most dull and uncreative way imaginable. The way Ferrel's character reacts to it is stilted and unrealistic, in my humble opinion.Besides the life-narration thing, the story is the typical boring salary-man lives boring life, and we're SOMEHOW supposed to feel sorry for him and accept him as representative of a mediocre life when in an actuality he is quite privileged as a tall, fit, healthy man with a good job, and no responsibilities such as a wife or kids. Come to think of it, why and how could a great novelist write a full novel about such a boring life anyway?Anyway, one day he meets manic pixie dream girl. They skipped the essential part though where their relationship has any actual ups-and-downs. The way they get together is pretty unconvincing too. I am puzzled that either one likes the other. His overtures towards her get downright cringe-worthy and creepy in its overly-earnestness, reminiscent of Anakin and Padme in Episode II.I'm probably missing something, I don't understand what theme they were going for, or what the significance of the ending is. The movie overall seems pretentious and self-important. The movie sputters along boringly until the end when it tells us (but doesn't actually show us) it is dramatic and profound.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger than Fiction,"""This is the story of Harold Crick"" So begins what may well be a career altering move for the notorious Will Ferrell. At least we all can hope. Stranger than Fiction is the story of an IRS agent who suddenly begins to hear the voice of a woman he has never met narrating his life and predicting his death. What he will soon find out is that he is the central character of a novel-in-progress that will forever change his life.Will Ferrell (Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Betwitched) plays Harold Crick. This is a character quite possibly unlike anything he has done before. Everyone has become very much accustomed to the utterly ridiculous and more often than not simply obnoxious people he has played in the past. Whether by some divine intervention or other benevolent force, that character has been thrown out the window. With any luck, gone will be the days of Elf and cameos like his appearance in Wedding Crashers. Of course these comedic turns can be fun but in all honesty the true word, as a friend so aptly put it, is ""gratuitous"" and for the most part just unnecessary. This new version of the Will Ferrell, with his smart but not over-the-top or high-horse ""ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances"" face lift, is vastly preferable to his insultingly in-your-face style of previous roles.The supporting cast is also well worth the price of admission. The always brilliant Emma Thompson (Love Actually, Sense and Sensibility) plays the slightly unhinged, as all great authors seem to be, Karen Eiffel, who has not published a book in 10 years. Thompson once again devotes herself whole-heartedly to the role, very believably outfitted as the plagued creative genius. Dustin Hoffman (Meet the Fockers, Rain Man), as literary expert Professor Jules Hilbert, brings a decidedly quirky yet cleverly realistic element to the film. His character is perceptive and practical, although at times very fatalistic, but Hoffman pulls off this contradiction without a hitch. Even the love interest played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (World Trade Center, Mona Lisa Smile), bakery owner Ana Pascal, finds that happy medium between just plain weird and approaching normal. She is accepted because she reflects the reality of how an individual can be made up of so many different parts yet still find happiness within their own highs and lows.The film channels I <3 Huckabees and Punch Drunk Love, but even if those two films seemed way too out there to follow, this one is not. It shares the ideas and messages from those films but makes them easier to understand without diluting them or drying them out. It is fun but smart, laugh-out-loud but thought-provoking. Essentially, the tight script and flawless casting are what make the film. The characters deliver their one-liners and soliloquies with finesse. Timing, both on the side of the writers and the actors, really draws the viewer in and keeps them there for the duration. The awkward small talk of the socially inept, the connection made at the recognition of a shared favorite song or the different ways of dealing with the notion of destiny; these are what make the film amusing, touching and revealing. It is interesting that at one point the discussion of literature that Harold hopes will reveal the truth behind his situation turns to whether he is the hero of a comedy or a tragedy, because that categorization can be applied to more than just the written word, and this film catches that, both hilariously and movingly.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A complete breath of fresh air,"A masterpiece, this movie.In this age of B-rated action flicks and predictable teen-comedies and/or dramas, this is exactly what I needed to see to renew my faith in movies.Will Farrel is brilliant, in comedy or tragedy, the man knows what he's doing and I adore his work. He played his part well here, both the comic and the tragic parts without a flaw, and I cannot think of anyone more suitable for the role. His average appearance makes him perfect for the hero of the story, and it's absolutely brilliant that we've not yet again been forced to watch two absolutely physically perfect human beings couple, but instead see two average people, far more flawless in spirit than simply and only looks, create a strange, yet very romantic and tragicomic bond.The movie will make you laugh, it will make you think, and in some extreme cases, it might make you weep. The only ""thumbs down"" thing in the whole story is the fact that, were the novel mentioned in the story ever published, I am thoroughly convinced it would.. well.. suck. :) As I've said before, this movie is a complete breath of fresh air in the stench that we're being served nowadays, and I strongly encourage everyone to see it. You'll feel happy after you do, I know I did :) Cheers",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Easily the biggest positive surprise of the year,"This is a very clever and enjoyable movie where apparently everyone involved knew they were into something special and gave it their all, and it worked. Will Ferrell could not have done better. Nor could Maggie Gyllenhaal or Emma Thompson or Queen Latifah. It's a refreshing new take on the 'What makes life worth living?' issue. No really new answers to that question, but you won't mind. I'm a number person myself, and though I would never count things like the number of steps I took to the bus stop, I know the type. The Gyllenhaal character, Ana Pascal, is also familiar, and someone I like spending time with. Even the tax aspects of this story, hardly a focus, make sense.No, if this doesn't become an instant classic, it won't be for lack of quality on almost every dimension. And I'll be taking notice anytime I see that the director is Marc Forster or the writer is Zach Helm.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life imitating art imitating life imitating art ...,"""Life is stranger than fiction,"" or so the saying goes. Borrowing from the expression, Mark Forster's STRANGER THAN FICTION is about one man's life that has become the subject of soon-to-be published fiction. An as yet undetermined narrator announces at the very start that, ""This is a story about a man named Harold Crick."" That narrator is revealed to be author Karen Eiffel (the always absorbing Emma Thompson), whose previous novels have all ended with her protagonists dying to serve the story's greater purpose. Somehow, her voice has found its way from the pages that tell Harold's story to the head of a man actually named Harold Crick (Will Ferrell). As she pushes through the novel that has taken her a decade to complete, Harold begins to hear her voice wherever he goes. As she points out his obsessive-compulsive behaviour, he begins to question the strict structure that has kept his life in order for years. When Eiffel announces that he is unknowingly spiraling towards his imminent death, he has heard enough. The funny thing is Harold's death was imminent before someone told him it was. He just needed someone to remind him that he should probably get around to doing some living while he was still alive.But is this actually a story about Harold Crick? Is it not just as much a story about Karen Eiffel? After all, she knows the story she is telling so well that her words and voice have torn some line in the fabric of the universe to make it into Harold's head. I don't know how likely that is in real life but I'm pretty sure it would never happen if there weren't an intense cerebral connection between the two parties involved or if he weren't a complete fabrication of one's imagination. At first glance, Crick and Eiffel seem like people on entirely opposite ends of the spectrum. After a closer look, they are clearly in opposition to each other but they inhabit the very same spectrum. Both are shown as obsessive-compulsive people. Harold counts his brush strokes and goes to bed at exactly the same time each night. Karen lives a reclusive life in a starkly white apartment, extinguishing her cigarettes in spit-damp tissues she tucks away in her pockets. Both attempt to exert high levels of restraint in their lives to maintain the illusion that they command the direction their lives will take, one through chaos and the other through control. It is also a convenient way to avoid experiencing anything frighteningly unknown,Eiffel struggles with how to kill Crick for most of the film. How do you kill someone to make a literary point when their life barely has any relevance to begin with? Meanwhile, Harold's recent bout with schizophrenia has him seeing how the tiniest changes in his life can make it all the more exciting. Funny how the knowledge that death may be around the corner acts as a good kick in the ass. The connection between Crick and Eiffel also exposes their attitudes towards life and death while helping each of them heal their apprehensions towards both realities. Crick had conveniently eliminated the possibility of death from his calculated existence. Eiffel's eerie fascination with death had stopped her from seeing her own possibilities for happiness in life. As the two become more aware of the other's existence, and subsequently more comfortable with that, they each begin to see what they were not seeing prior. Life will not be and will never seem worth living if you don't take risks, no matter how small they may be; from wearing a sweater instead of a tie for a change to stepping outside your apartment and meeting new people.STRANGER THAN FICTION is smart without being superior, funny without being asinine. Forster's previous work has either bored me (MONSTER'S BALL), frustrated me (STAY) or filled my heart with warmth and my eyes with tears (FINDING NEVERLAND). Here he creates a poignant piece about a woman telling the story of a man because its easier than telling her own story. Her real problem with killing Harold Crick is that she no longer knows if she wants to. Killing Harold would just mean metaphorically killing herself again. Writing Harold's newfound appreciation for life has sparked her own and Forster hopes her reminder will be one to us as well. Not to sound too morbid but our deaths are as imminent as Harold's. The film's subtle layers expose a simple insight about the distance between our lives and the stories we tell about our lives. These stories are told to create meaning and give shape but we all run the risk of missing out in the process if we don't allow for the unexpected.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Love this movie, one of my favs","I really enjoy seeing Will Farrell in a dramatic role, not comedic. It's interesting how his life's routine are told in a story like way, but the main character (Will) can hear her and it's driving him crazy he's got to figure it out. She's writing a book, yet its his life. However mundane and boring it may be. Dustin Hoffman is an interesting as a psychology professor. Will meets the Maggie Gyllenhall character and she's so much fun and such a free spirit, quite his opposite. Yet he lets loose a little and is attracted to her. She's so free and open minded she gives him a chance. I love this movie and it's such an unusual method of story telling. One of my all time favorites. Such a great message.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely Terrible,"This movie was so frightfully dull that I had to fight the urge to flee the theatre cursing Will Ferrell and every other miscreant involved in the process of making this film. Some might find the lack of suitable soundtrack (or sounds in general at some points) artful, but I found those long, blank pauses to be anything but a lack of substance and/or acting. I was so unsubmerged in the plot, in fact, that even more shocking scenes of attempted suicide or dramatic apartment reconstruction left me in a near comatose state.

Difficult to describe without giving all away but if this is not quite, laugh out loud comedy, it is certainly, smile all the way, comedy. Some great lines and some thoughtful ideas, indeed this could be taken as pure silliness or a more serious existential exploration of life and death and the bits in between.

The biggest surprise,"It just goes to show you that Will Ferrell is not just a comedy actor where he usually does idiotic things just for a short laugh from the audience. He has proved that he is more than an normal comedian, that he can not only act in comedy films but in dramas as well. To be honest when I first heard about the film s plot I was amazed by it, but I was even more amazed when i heard that Will Ferrell is starring in it, so I said to myself ""Will Ferrell in a drama!!!!! Dude I got to watch it."" In the beginning I was a bit sceptical about the film, but when I started to watch it, it held me from the beginning to the end,not just only the well developed and well executed plot, and surprisingly immaculate acting by Will Ferrell, but what impressed me the most was the amazing portrait of an everyday average guy who is a lone wolf but due to certain events he find his peace and meaning in his life.

A Wonderfully and Visually Experience,"Will Ferrell can always make audiences laugh, but can he make audiences feel sad and be more sympathetic for whatever role he takes? The answer is without a doubt: Yes. Will Ferrell is absolutely fantastic in his role as IRS Agent Harold Crick; he can not only be funny, but also can be serious. This is in my opinion my absolute favorite Will Ferrell movie. If you like him doing comedies, then you'll love him doing drama. He really does steal the show. The idea of a man whose life is always distracted by a narrator is actually a pretty clever concept, and I thought it was well executed. I do get the sense of the movie as it was taken place in Chicago because the city itself does play a character, you usually do get a sense of the environment and see how these people do with their lives (EX: kid riding on a bike, an African-American woman doing her job, etc.). The direction by Marc Forster is outstanding, and he really does tell a good story and knows where to point the camera at. The rest of the cast Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, and Queen Latifah all do their jobs well. The story; the pacing; the cinematography; the editing; the direction; and the music all come together pretty well. This is also one of my favorite movies, and my favorite Marc Forster movie. I do enjoy his direction alright in a James Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace,"" but I love his work on this one the best. The movie does add into a lot of context, which it is hard to explain but I can't help it on how much I really love this movie. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is both a wonderfully and visually experience. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Urban and Surprising,"Just watched this movie the other night, having a baby made a serious dent on our movie going schedule, but a Blue Ray rental was almost as good! What a wonderful film! Great screenplay and the acting crew. Two actors who got casted in the most unusual ways are Will Ferrell in a role of protagonist, and Queen Latifah playing in supporting but no less important role of the organizer a.k.a. manager for the Emma Thompson's character. Both delivered surprising level of artistry playing the characters that are very much off their usually comic acting tracks.Another thing worth mentioning is how wonderfully a site is integrated into the movie. One of the main characters in the film is played by the City of Chicago. Although never mentioned by name, the city is always there, be it in the beautiful architectural detail of the 70's brutish concrete, accidental sky-scraping perspective of a street or in the worming around the intersection trolley.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, also, if you watch it on DVD, try peeking into the Extras.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, quirky, clever!","This is a fun, quirky, clever little film and it's an off-the-wall character study that'll let you appreciate cinema that tiny bit more and will almost certainly go down as a cult favourite among selective film fans. Directed by Marc Foster (Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland) and written by Zach Helm (currently making his Writer/Director debut with Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium) Stranger Than Fiction makes its presence felt from the outset with various cinematic conventions and rules being toyed and played to help create the films own individualistic style. The film tells of a companionless tax man (Will Ferrell) who one day becomes aware of his imminent death via the narrator (Emma Thomson) in his head, he seeks literacy advice from a professor (Dustin Hoffman) who advises him to discover if he's in a comedy or a tragedy to which he does by attempting romance with a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), once this is established it then becomes his sole purpose to discover his fate and ultimately contact the narrator to prevent it.Charlie Kaufman (Writer. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich) was my primary thought at who could have written such a film as it is very Kaufman-like, but unfortunately Stranger Than Fiction does lack some of the more punchier/out there moments experienced in his films. Where Stranger Than Fiction does supersede his work, despite its arguably depressing storyline, is in its ability to remove any feelings of a nihilistic nature and replace them with a warmer, more endearing, optimistic and emotional attachment.Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman all put in brilliant performances and to be honest these are the sorts of performances I would like to being seeing more of, especially Ferrell as I feel that this film does for Ferrell what Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind did for Jim Carrey. The two films are very similar and, if push came to shove, the latter being more accomplished one, although that shouldn't detract anyone from Stranger Than Fiction as in its own right it is a very good, engaging film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""His name is Harold Crick""","""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a great movie, and one of Will Ferrell's better fairings in a movie. The acting by Ferrell was at its best, as well as the acting by Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Hoffman as the professor was a favorite of mine.The storyline was easy to follow, and the characters memorable, which makes it an instant hit with me. When a man starts to hear voices, you would think he was going insane, but not Harold. As an IRS agent, Harold starts to hear his life be narrated. It turns out, Harold is the subject of a book by Karen Eiffel.It is a love story and it is too a drama. Very well written, directed and acted out. And it is great to see Dustin Hoffman in a role that is fitting to his likeness again. And to see Ferrell in a film that is not nearly so stupid is a plus for him. It shows that he wants to be a serious actor in the business.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderfully unique,"I was never a huge fan of Will Ferrell's. To me, he's just like Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler in that he hasn't outgrown adolescent status when it comes to his sense of humor. However, seeing him in Wedding Crashers, The Producers, and Talladega Nights recently forced me to appreciate the comedic talent that he's been hiding. And now, with Stranger Than Fiction, Will Ferrell has forced me to acknowledge that he can act. And quite well, too, which was a very pleasant surprise. Luckily, the movie was just as good as he was.Playing Harold Crick, an IRS agent without a social life who counts his toothbrush strokes each and every morning of his life, Will Ferrell is marvelously understated. Some critics have said he underplays Crick to the point of boredom, but I think he leaves enough of himself to keep us entertained. And even with that, the plot and characters around him are so amusing and intriguing it wouldn't have mattered if Crick were dull.The story kicks off to a start within the first five minutes as we embark on Crick's daily routine, narrated down to the very last carefully counted step on his way to work by Emma Thompson, a suicidal writer who is authoring her next book about Crick and his humdrum way of living. However, Crick hears her voice dictating his every move and is upset by this- naturally. Especially when he hears Thompson predicting his premature death.Forster deftly balances Harold's impending doom with his discovery of the joys of life, most importantly in Ana Pascal, a baker played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (wonderful and fiery), who at first hates Crick and his IRS background but then grows to love him. Through Pascal, Harold learns how to enjoy life outside of his job, which he never enjoyed in the first place. The genius of Stranger Than Fiction is that it manages to take matters of life and death very seriously while at the same time finding much light in simple everyday facets of the world such as cookies or a kiss or a good book. I'm not sure how you combine existentialism and compassion in the same movie, but Forster and Ferrel and Co. pulled it off in a very creative way.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did I miss somethin'?,"It's gotta be me. I read many of the comments/reviews here and all of them placed this movie on an Academy Award level. You all loved it..from the story to the acting. To put it mildly..I beg to disagree. Stranger than Fivction may have been the most boring movie of all time. There was absolutely nothing in it to keep my girlfriend and I awake for more than half of it. No humor, no suspense, no cursing, no use of the ""n"" word, no frontal nudity, not even rear end nudity, no sex at all, no car chases, no drive-by shootings, no screaming or yelling..just NOTHING to keep a person awake for 2 hours. I don't care how perfect Will Farrell and Dustin Hoffman were for their roles, they were totally monotone and robotic and seemed to sleepwalk through their scenes. They were better than Ambian for putting the two of us right into dreamland. So if you want a movie that's a perfect cure for insomniacs, Stranger than Fiction is your medicine.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Greatest ""Dramedy"" of All Time","Stranger Than Fiction starring Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson and directed by Marc Forster is a film that has kind of slipped under the radar for a lot of people. I hadn't even heard of the movie until I saw its trailer on a DVD, but I was immediately intrigued by its super creative concept. Going in, I was expecting an interesting enough Will Ferrell comedy with some funny twists and turns along the way... what I watched instead was one of the most emotionally impactful and thoughtful comedies ever made - a deeply intimate, thought provoking, quirky, and darkly humorous story that might just be the greatest dramedy of all time.The film about a reserved and lonely man named Harold Crick who wakes up to find a women narrating his life within his mind. We find out this narrator is a famous author writing a book... she plans to kill him in the end of the novel.The concept itself it brilliantly original and it sucks you in from the very start. However, the concept is not why I love this movie. I love Stranger Than Fiction because it takes said absurd concept and morphs it into an undeniably human story about control, love, life, fate, and responsibility.This film could've easily been your run of the mill Will Ferrell absurdist comedy, but, instead, it analyzes the humor of the story to make us look at our own lives through the lens of a character who feels deeply human in all aspects. Harold Crick is just an extension and exaggeration of most people's own fears, desires, and regretful contentments. Even though his fate is solidified by the author writing his life into her novel, his fate had already been decided by his fearful and risk-less lifestyle. Crick's thematic arc ultimately makes us contemplate the life we, the audience, lead, but, most importantly inspires us to reach higher and live life to the fullest.Though I've painted the movie as a mere mediation thus far, it's important to mention that, despite its nuanced themes and dramatic plot-points, Stranger Than Fiction is still a comedy... and a pretty darn funny one at that. Writer Zach Helm delivers clever and witty scenarios and punchlines from start to finish, and I can confidently say that there are no swing and misses in this movie when it comes to the comedy. While it might not be a film that has you clutching your side every other scene or anything to that level, it's still guaranteed to plaster a smile on your face.A core reason I think that Stranger Than Fiction is the greatest dramedy ever is because one of the main themes of the movie is literally how the tragic and the comedic apply to a person's life. This exploration is a clever commentary on literature, the film itself, and, modern life.This movie is almost flawless up until the last 15 minutes - funny, surprisingly artistic, and packed with emotion. However, despite the ending of the movie being, overall, very well executed, sweet, and charming in its own right, it still feels like a bit of a compromise considering how powerful the scenes leading up to it are. Ultimately, I feel like the story could've gone in a less safe direction, especially with how daring the movie was (for a fairly mainstream comedy at least) up to that point. Nonetheless, the ending is still very satisfying and clever in its own right, and you could argue it makes the most sense logically.Stranger Than Fiction is one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. It has a superbly creative plot and even better execution. Will Ferrell gives, by far, the best performance of his career and proves that exuding huge emotions and character complexity is too in his toolbox as an actor.This is one of my favorite comedies of all time and I hope you decide to hop into the both humorous and dramatic mediation that is Stranger Than Fiction.10 / 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good,"I never thought that Will Ferrell could act this good.In most of the movies that I've seen with him, he plays very bad roles, doing almost always the same annoying character.But in this movie, he acts completely different. It is a comedy (Or better said, a dramatic comedy) but he plays here a very serious (And interesting)character. His character in this movie was completely believable and likable, all the opposite of the stupid characters that he usually plays in other films.""Stranger than Fiction"" was a great film, it has very good performances, likable characters, and a surprising and unpredictable story. This movie definitely deserves more recognition. I just cannot understand of how come this movie didn't receive any Academy Award. It was one of the best movies of the 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Really, pneumonia? That's an interesting way to die""","I need to tell something, it's kind of a confession. Last week I was looking at my IMDb film history and as I realized that 7 out of ten movies that I been watching were from the US, I decided i would't rent any more American movies from a month. Thank god I didn't keep my promise!. This movie is fantastic in many levels. The scrip is a filled with black humor, drama, romance, full-colored characters. It's an impossible story, and yet it seems as it could happen. The people in it is very real. You get to love this characters, you want them to live a good life. It tells such a complete story that you feel as if you've read the book that's been being written in front of us. What can I say about the actors? Will Ferrel is the main reason why I watched this movie. I was sure he would suck. I'm an idiot. He gave so many interesting things to Harold Crick. he is a totally believable shy guy, not the stupid person that movies usually show us as a shy guy. He lives a boring life, yet he is not boring, he is funny, and sweet and real. Emma Thompson is one of the greater living actress in the world. And I thing this is one of her best works. She is living her book, suffering, trying to kill smartly, and that seems hard. Dustin Hoffman also seems to be Tailor made to play the professor. The scrip provides some of the more real and profound characters I didn't like the previous Marc Foster movie, but hats off, he can tell a bittersweet story in a subtle way, using some original techniques, but all in favor of the story, and not to show the viewer that he is a great director. He prove me wrong, let's hope he keeps the good work American cinema has seen in a long time, and probe me that i have to continue criticizing USA cinema, so that once in a while I get to see one of this gems.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My new favorite movie,"This is absolutely the type of movie that I usually ignore. A friend saw the movie and recommended it, so i went to see if because i had an afternoon free and could not think anything better to do. And....How did this movie not get any Oscar nods? The performances of Ferrell, Gyllenhaal, and Thompson were perfect, the story was poignant and touching, it was cleverly directed and it is a joy to watch even after the first viewing.Ferrell showed he has breadth as an actor, Emma Thompsons frenetic performance was fantastic, and i think i might be love with Maggie Gyllenhaal.It is at least as good as the winner (The Departed--which i enjoyed but did not think it was Best Picture material) and better than a couple of the other nominees in 2006 (Babel was half a movie at best and The Queen was not much of a movie outside of Helen Mirren's excellent performance). The nominating committee really dropped the ball on this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This has to be one of the best films I have ever seen,"I am normally a fan of horror and action films. However, after thoroughly enjoying Anchorman and Old School I decided to take the plunge and go and watch Stranger Than Fiction. What I found was such a moving and masterful film that I am still struggling to find words to explain it. I can only highly recommend this film to anyone and suggest purchasing it to let the makers of this masterpiece know how you feel. The subtle mixture of narration and action are masterfully intertwined in a love story for the modern generation. The inclusion of the watch at the beginning of the film and the personification therewith truly shows how 'out of the box' the writer of the film though. To bring us such an epic tale of humanity, I salute you!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Zach Helms script was a great surprise and left me looking forward to his next film which he is writing and directing. Will Ferrells performance was very well composed and articulate, a complete inspiration as was the wonderfully consistent Emma Thompson. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah felt underused in their roles. But for me Maggie Gyllenhaal was the real standout. She stole every scene and totally lit up the screen every time plus she is absolutely gorgeous. Don't miss this if your after something very different and unconventional",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A ""Wow!"" Moment For Will Ferrell","Will Ferrell fans now have a very good reason to stand up and cheer. Myself not being much of a Ferrell champion (although I modestly enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS), I came into STRANGER THAN FICTION wondering if he might try some over-the-top antics or just give another mediocre performance. Amazingly, Ferrell gives a thoughtful and insightful portrayal of a conflicted man who believes he's being followed by a narrating woman's voice.What gives Stranger Than Fiction its emotional heft, too, is its clever script and fine performances by Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal (SHERRYBABY), Dustin Hoffman, and even Queen Latifah.Falling partially into the fantasy category (but only slightly so), the story is of Harold Crick, an IRS agent who one day begins hearing a woman's voice narrating the more mundane portions of his life (""Harold brushed his teeth 32 strokes up and down and 72 side to side""). Initially Harold fears he may be having some sort of mental break. He goes to see a shrink who eventually (and reluctantly) refers him to Professor Jules Hilbert (Hoffman). Some of the most entertaining dialogue is heard here as Hilbert and Crick try to decide whether the voice is narrating his life as a comedy or a tragedy (or maybe some other genre). When Hilbert asks Crick what he does for a living and if there's anyone that might want to hurt him, Crick replies, ""I'm an IRS agent, everyone hates me."" To which Professor Hilbert responds, ""Well that certainly sounds like a comedy to me."" Eventually, Harold discovers who's voice is in his head. It's a novelist named Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), and it appears that Harold is simply a fictional creation of her's that has somehow come to life. Harold races to find Ms. Eiffel before she finishes her novel, strictly because he knows that he plans to kill her (she narrates to him this simple fact, much to Harold's dismay). Once they meet, Ms. Eiffel is somewhat freaked out by the prospect that one of her creations has come to life, and Harold is even more freaked to learn that she's finished the novel (the ending isn't typed yet, but is handwritten and awaiting the plunk! plunk! of the typewriter keys).The ending is bittersweet for both Harold and Emma. Can she change her masterpiece of fiction? Can she not kill Harold and still retain the essence of her work (she's killed off her main protagonist in all her other novels)? Ferrell's soft-spoken tax-man performance was something of a marvel. His witty line deliveries and his tender relationship with Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) goes way beyond anything we've seen from him before. Again, much of this can be attributed to the brilliant script by Zach Helm. But Will Ferrell's performance cannot be denied. He's in almost every shot, proving that he can be a great leading man if given the right set of circumstances. Now let's just hope that he continues on this upward swing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much better than expected.,"I guess I should have known and yet I didn't. I didn't hear much of anything about this one at all. The kids wanted to see it, so when it came around to the local discount theater, we piled up the car and went. I didn't know who the other members of the cast were and I didn't know it would go deeper than a fluff comedy. The silliness that most often accompanies Will Farrell was understated and quite nicely subtle. Maggie Gyllenhaal is fabulous and the other characters have to suffer with the likes of: Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Queen Latifa (that was written to be decidedly tongue in cheek). All three were solid with Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifa also playing their roles (which could have been camped up and over the top) not in any way those things. Emma Thompson gets to put a bit of a screwball twist on her character. I had absolutely no expectations of this movie and found myself very entertained. Two thoughts occurred to me as I watched-one: ""this is why these actors are great"" and two: ""that was a clever turn of a phrase."" A much smarter film than I thought I'd be seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
tour de force,"One of the best films I have seen for a very-very long time. Clever, deep, witty and beautiful. With this film Zach Helm emerges as one of the most promising and talented writers of his generation. The idea is borrowed from Dostoevsky's 'The Double': a hero contesting the authorship of the author, refusing to accept his bleak and dull personality. The movie is about spiritual awakening, the shock of discovering the hidden and forbidden. The movie is full of wonderful and beautiful moments: the watch going crazy at the bus stop is one of the most memorable and beautiful cinematic images I have ever seen. Dostoevsky once admitted that he failed to properly materialize this wonderful idea. The plot of 'Stranger Than Fiction' is brilliantly crafted and the authors of the film should be congratulated with this amazing achievement!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
At Last!  Will Farrell Has Found His Niche!,"Will Farrell is a talented actor, in my opinion. After a decade of meaningless, inane, and even stupid roles, he has finally found a proper vehicle by which to showcase his talents ... Stranger than Fiction is a beautifully blended, well-adapted chronicle of the life of a hapless victim-cum-quintessential hero.It has often been said that we all (humans) carry within us the traits to be a hero in times of darkness, via the character Harold Crick, this is demonstrated with a great style and panache. The plot is wonderful and the narration by Emma Thompson is inspired. This will touch your heart without leading you down the smarmy path of melancholy.It seems Mr. Farrell has gone the way of Steve Martin in that this time he chose the role of the ""straight man"" (to use comedic vernacular) in a rather intelligent romantic comedy, and to let the story carry the comedy rather than his antics, pratfalls, and the like.While this is not your typical Will Farrell comedy, I sincerely (and without hesitation) hope to see him in more roles such as this one. He came off as thoughtful, intelligent, and sincere in his performance. I always knew Will had talent. I'm just glad the rest of the world got to see it...finally.All in all? This was great!It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Forgotten Masterpiece,"I watched this movie one rainy day while I was camping, stuck in a little tent. I found it lost, deep in the depths of films on TVNZ and thought: ""huh, this looks alright, good plot, star-studded cast, I'll give it a shot"", boy was I blown away. There couldn't be a better casting than Will Ferrel for the main character. Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal are also amazing. One thing I was afraid of was that the way the film was going, the ending might not be very satisfying, but no, it was a masterpiece. It's similar to the Truman Show and The Matrix (and the more recent Free Guy was essentially a much worse remake of it) but has enough flair to stand out as its own unique, stunning, film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A movie of Fiction that aims for the Truth,"Another good movie that proves that mainly comedic actors can perform well in dramas,Stranger than Fiction is a drama with a bit of comedy thrown in.Will Ferrell follows in the footsteps of comedic actors who have made the transition to dramas such as Jim Carrey(The Mask to The Truman Show),Robin Williams(Mrs.Doubtfire to Good Will Hunting),Tom Hanks(Big to Philadelphia),Adam Sandler(Click-Reign Over Me).Besides starring Will Ferrell,the supporting cast includes the likes of Maggie Gyllenhaal,Dustin Hoffman,Quenn Latifah and Emma Thompson.For this film,Will Ferrell was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor-Musical or Comedy but I feel that instead of that particular award that Will Ferrell's Golden Globe nomination should have been in the Drama category.Stranger than Fiction in a way has a vibrant feel reminiscent to The Truman Show and this film indeed borrows certain elements from that film such as the main characters unaware of their surroundings until something out of the ordinary happens.Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wonderful and witty!,"""The Truman Show"" meets ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in this slightly less perfect, but still intelligent and heartwarming film.Unpredictable to the point of suspenseful this entertaining movie blends black comedy, romance, mystery, and literary thriller with almost seamless precision.Will Ferrell manages to rein in his usual manic exuberance (for the most part) to portray the mundane and scheduled Harold Crick before sliding expertly into confused and powerless and finally acquiescent and uncomplaining. The on-screen chemistry between Harold and law-school-drop-out-turned-baker Ana (brilliantly played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) is fun and believable.Queen Latifah proves once again her uncanny ability to steal scenes like a leading actress while supporting the hell out of Emma Thompson's frustrated, mentally drained Karen Eiffel.The weak link in the cast, since there has to be one, is Dustin Hoffman. His Dr. Hilbert, who you immediately forget when he's not right in front of you, did not pull off ""deep"" or ""esoteric"" and was just generally annoying.My favorite moment from the movie was easily when Harold arrives at ""The Uprising"" at closing time to bear his heart (or at least his libido) to Ana. And what does he bring her? Flours. It doesn't get much more perfect than that.All in all it was clever, fun, and kept me guessing until the last frame which is always a plus. Sure there were lines and scenes that could have been better, leaving my husband to make the astute statement that the film would have been flawless had it been written by Charlie Kaufman, but it was a lovely little movie and it certainly made my weekend.:)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The pen is mightier than the sword,"""Stranger than fiction"" is (To put it simply) a great film.And now, the reasons behind my statement. First off I believe this to be Will Ferrell's best piece of acting yet, for a man who usually play's over the top and in some cases embarrassing characters, this was defiantly a good turning point for him as an actor and has helped this particular person to appreciate his talent now that I know that he's not always going to be characters like Ron Burgundy (Anchorman) or Jack Wyatt (Bewitched).I think that ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a film that you should watch with a group of friends or your family since it has some great elements and subtle of both humour and tragedy. As it has plenty of imagery to discuss, and the standard ""Aww"" moments you get from time to time. It also has moments which don't have much meaning when you first watch it but when you think back are actually there to give the story as little ironic quirk such as Harold watching the ""meaning of live"" in the Cinema and the part when Harold Crick is running down the street with an apple in his mouth (reference to ""Son of Man"" by Rene Magritte) and the picture is concluded when he is talking to the doctor at the office and he is sat in front of cloud pattern wallpaper.As I said before I enjoyed this film a lot and I would recommend it to most people for the structure of and story it and I would recommend it to the rest of the people as a good family and friends film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Refreshingly different,"Harold Crick was living a clockwork life without meaning. Not that he was searching for any. And then.... one day, everything changed.With a plot like that how can you not love this movie? With an out-of-the-world plot, amazing execution and a brilliant background score, this movie really blew my mind.The way things start changing, you think there is something really weird going on. You have an author, who is suffering from a serious bout of writer's block. She's looking for a way to end her book. And then you have Harold Crick. Who is not really able to understand what is happening to his life. Slowly, everything turns topsy-turvy. He is beginning to think he's going mad.The reason I loved this movie was the way it was shot. You are not able to understand why is the plot movie the way it is. You being to sympathise with the central character.

"""Are you relieved to know that you're not a golem?""","Of all the things I hold dear. Stranger Than Fiction may be different from my normal intake of high octane thrillers and intellectual opii, but it is no less glorious than an evening sunset with a voluptuous lover. Breaking from the normal ""romantic comedy/drama"" mold, it uses subtle irony and a huge left-hook plot twist at the end to create what is possibly one of the best films of 2006, truly a stunning accomplishment considering how many other noteworthy films came out around then.Stranger Than Fiction is a pure ""feel good"" film, making anyone who's capable of smiling break into a big, wide grin by the rolling credits, with side-splitting laughs and silly nuances around every corner, and yet it never slips into cheapness or slapstick. There is much more here than a simple comedy. Stranger Than Fiction is intricately layered with dramatic tones and a few rose-tinted romantic scenes, and the whole thing is a boiling cauldron pot of influences, creating a positively shimmering mixture that will never grow old or stagnant, a story that will keep your mind entertained and your heart warmed and softened. And the irony I mentioned? Brilliantly executed, all the way through. It is a story within a story, and even when you already know what's going to happen next, the film will keep you all smiles. How can anyone say no to that glorious ending? Stranger Than Fiction rises above such paltry number ratings, so heed no attention to the perfect score - just check it out now.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Every element drove to the conclusion and I didn't find myself wishing anything had been done differently. I wouldn't ordinarily be a huge fan of Will Ferrell, but I thought he was fantastic. He was funny without being over the top, showed vulnerability without big flashing lights saying ""I'm being vulnerable"", and played the part to perfection.

Wonderful and fascinating.,"I enjoyed this movie to no end. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it would be an OK movie, so I didn't see it. When it came out on DVD, I bought it on a whim and I am very grateful to that whim.This movie is very inventive on it's take on really living life. When I watched it, it made me appreciate the quirkiness of my own life. It makes you think about how mundane an existence can be and that you shouldn't start to live life after you find out you're going to die. It's deep, but whimsical. It has humor and disguised serious undertones.I have to say, Will Ferrel surprised me. Most of the time he's playing a mindless character that will do anything for humor and he can be very funny, but other times he can just be crude. This was a wonderful departure for him. I was impressed and look forward to other movies from him.The performances were stellar, especially from Will Ferrel, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman. It's a wonderful movies that makes you laugh and think.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly Original,"In a world of film consisting of sequels, remakes and adaptations its been a long time since something this truly original has come to the screen and it a film well worth watching. Will Ferrell is on truly outstanding form and i think what is great is that he gives a very natural performance that makes his character a totally believable one. The whole cast in fact are wonderful to watch as they are aided by a brilliant script that keeps you wondering even after you finish watching it and with superb visuals and soundtrack to boot you will laugh,cry and feel satisfied when the end credits arrive. Im glad to see this sort of film being produced in a Hollywood that doesn't want to think.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Perfection, down to the last tick of a wristwatch...","...and anyone who thinks otherwise is just wrong. Sorry.I have so much respect to the writers of this tragedy, or is it a comedy? The concept itself is great, but to get it down on paper and to make it make sense is another thing. Then to the director and all of the others who helped this to be the thing of beauty that it turned out to be.The cast is excellent and I do believe they were fully behind this project. I can only imagine when they read the script for the first time, they instantly jumped on aboard - and it shows from their outstanding performances. Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhall and Dustin Hoffman were all perfect.Thank you to everyone who made this happen :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Once again, inside this film was a truly great film","What a disappointment! I was truly looking forward to this and prepared to absolutely love it. Ouch.A great cast assembled by a talented director, unusual location for its topic (Chicago) good music, innovative graphics, what could go wrong? Let me count the ways. There was stupendous potential in the whole premise. It could have been brought into a totally surreal level between writer's block and perhaps a diabolical controlling influence of the protagonist, along with an older female author falling in love perhaps with her younger hero. None of this transpired. Instead we get everybody just about woefully miscast. Linda Hunt wasted. Dustin Hoffman completely miscast as a literature professor and part-time life guard for the faculty (huh?). An unrecognizabe Tom Hulce in a tiny bit part, Queen Latifah as set decoration as her role made no sense whatsoever and should have wound up on the cutting room floor.How many times can one watch Will Ferrell brushing his teeth and tying his tie? Yeah, he's a compulsive counter, we get that from the on-screen graphics. But the knuckle-dragging audience needs at least eight planks on the head to alert them to this. And Maggie Gylenhall as an anarchist who mentions insignificant political matters but doesn't mention the Iraq war and she drops out of Harvard to get her arm covered in tattoos? Doesn't every decent anarchist worthy of the name?Cardboard thin characters in a transparent plot. No tension, no chemistry, no plot. I kept imagining what it could have been in the right hands and right cast and with a decent script that hasn't been done a thousand times, and better, before. And just about wept in frustration.4 out 10, a snore-inducing waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A definite feel good film!,"This is just a lovely all round film with a surprise act in Will Ferrel which is nice to see and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman making a for an excellent cast.Yes some people may complain about flaws in the film, how there are parts that seem to clichéd to be real. But that isn't the point of this film.

Lovely and thoughtful,"I simply love these sorts of films that seek to explain the human condition. It was an even more delightful treat that this film decided to take it in a comedic route. The end result is a very thought provoking, uplifting, and inspirational film, showing that any life can be exciting and fulfilling.The cinematography is beautiful. Well framed, and composed. The colors are so telling, and they change throughout the film to match the situation, and this simply adds to the experience.As for the performances, simply amazing. Will Ferrell steps out of his cliché over-the-top r-rated comedy role to play a very sensitive and late blooming character. He handles it perfectly, and it truly shows that Will Ferrel has the ability and can more that handle different roles. Alongside him on screen are Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gylenhaal. All of these characters propel the film and brings the whole piece together. Great casting.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Nothing Strange, Completely Familiar","Stranger than Fiction The comparisons are flying around the net and papers to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but let it be known that Marc Foster's Stranger than Fiction is a remarkable cinematic achievement in its own. It does have that Charlie Kaufman-like feel to it but captures the heart at a vulnerable point in its rising action. The film tells the story of Harold Crick, a thirty-something IRS agent that lives his life one second to the next. From brush strokes to calculating equations, Harold's life has become a very secluded one. Meanwhile, Kay Eiffel is a successful author that hasn't published a book in ten years and is in a serious case of writer's block. Along with her assistant, Penny the two search for inspiration to complete Kay's latest work which ironically is telling Harold's current life. At first it's just talking about things that he is doing, which keeps Harold inside the realm of Kay's narration. But when Kay mentions Harold's ""inevitable death"" Harold's transformation and search begins.This film is by far the best performance this viewer has seen Will Ferrell. As awkward as he is touching, Ferrell elevates the material and does a transformation that comedians like Jim Carrey have had trouble doing for some time. His Harold is completely alive to the audience and touches the most personal parts of the soul. Not since tales such as Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind have I cared so dearly about a character. If justice were to be served Ferrell would be a serious contender to such a weak category called Best Actor but in all seriousness, is the Academy ready to have him come to the Oscars? Maybe, he is a voter now and the season is just beginning.Emma Thompson's haunting portrayal of a suicidal author should garner a few raves. Thompson has been popping in and out of good films lately, (Harry Potter, Love Actually, Angels in America) and seems poised for a nice comeback to the Oscars. Again, another weak category could welcome her back and along with Ferrell could train ride the both of them to the Kodak.The rest of the supporting cast is magnificent. Dustin Hoffman is still chewing some of his comedic elements beautifully. Queen Latifah is showing her range despite how small the role is. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is having a fantastic year but in Fiction she is the sexiest and authentic I have ever seen her. Foster also has great control of his picture and never loses sight of Helm's message. He drives the film to a wonderful destination of oddity and elusiveness of the narrative.Aside from the the beautiful screenplay by Zach Helm, the score is probably one of the strongest points adding to an eerie, yet completely volatile moving picture. Consideration if there is going to be any, should focus on the powerful screenplay that carries that ""who thinks of that?"" feeling and Ferrell and Thompson powerhouse performances. If it were up to me however, this would be a definite Best Picture contender for its originality and heartfelt humor. This film could change your complete outlook of your existence.Grade: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The movie we can all agree on,"It's very hard to find a movie that the entire family enjoys, but Stranger Than Fiction hits the mark for us. We've seen it over a dozen times! The concept is original, the acting is wonderful, and Zach Helm's wonderful script is bittersweet. If you haven't rented this indie drama yet, get yourself a copy.
Will Ferrell is introduced to us with the lovely narration of Emma Thompson. She tells us he's a precise man, a lonely man, and a man without real relationships in his life. He works for the IRS, so it's not exactly unpredictable that he's disliked by most people he meets, including his latest auditee Maggie Gyllenhaal - a rebellious small bakery owner. If this were the plot, it would be interesting enough, but there's a little extra oomph to the story. Emma Thompson isn't just the narrator of the movie; she's narrating her latest novel. Will is a character she's written!So what's a man to do when he starts hearing voices describing himself in the third person? Naturally, he's scared and visits a psychiatrist. But when expert Linda Hunt tells him he's suffering from schizophrenia, he seeks help elsewhere. He turns to Dustin Hoffman, a professor literature, to help him with the third-person narrator. All the while, he finds himself desperately attracted to Maggie but doesn't know if he can jump easily into unchartered territory.There's so much to love about this movie, and I could talk for hours about why it's one of my favorites. Will Ferrell shows hidden talents as a man discovering the joys of life for the first time. Maggie Gyllenhaal is fantastically earthy, rebellious without coming across as being riddled with problems. She's generous, intelligent, interesting, and wildly sexy; it's no wonder Will's willing to come out of his shell for her. Emma Thompson, her publishing assistant Queen Latifah, and Dustin Hoffman seem to have a blast eating up their quirky characters and hilarious lines. If you haven't seen this sweet, romantic, thoughtful, original comedy yet, buy yourself a DVD copy. I know you'll love it and watch it over and over again with the whole family!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shockingly Familiar,"This one is certainly on my top 10. I was pleasantly surprised to come across such a creative story line. I had no idea what the movie was about beforehand, and I advise you see it the same way since in my opinion it is such a subjective movie. There is a huge amount of symbolism and often in a mocking sense. The cupcakes, the guitar, the IRS office. My favorite part of course is the Monkeys song.I have always enjoyed a successful narration and the narration in this movie is absolutely brilliant. It makes you want to learn more about Harold, and I can't imagine anyone failing to feel for the main character.So the story is a story of what at first feels like a typical overachiever. As the movie goes on however Harold's desperation and a lack of direction is portrayed in bits. That in itself is incredibly familiar to all our struggles to make something of ourselves in this life. There is an incredible balance between tragedy and comedy. It's not the type of comedy one is used to from Ferrell. Every time you laugh in this movie there is a sense of melancholy.Some have suggested the movie makes a claim that only happy endings matter. I personally perceived the message as exactly the opposite. What's important is the story itself and it totally triumphs the ending.I have to note that Maggie Gyllenhaal playing Ana Pascal is absolutely brilliant (and adorable too). She is the trigger for the plot and a development Harold would never ever thought would happen to him. Being so out of the ordinary, she is all that Harold needs to appreciate himself. Dustin Hoffman is incredibly funny and I thought he is a great fit for the quirky literature professor.What makes this movie however is the story itself. This movie will make you think, think about challenging moral questions. This movie will make you laugh. This movie may make you cry. And most importantly, this movie will stick with you and i assure you, everyone can take something valuable out of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A nice story of odd circumstance,"There isn't much to add in another review of this movie as there are already over 500!But I can say, for anyone seeking a finely told story, that this is a good choice! If you are concerned about Will Ferrell as the lead actor and this being one of his goof ball comedies, you are wrong. He's not a comedic actor I enjoy but his dramatic acting is spot on and he does a fine job here.The movie is also visually pleasing with sets reflective of the characters and rich with colors. There is a scene in the movie with Harold Crick sitting on a bus - and it's one of those double buses with the accordion like flexible middles. Crick is sitting at the accordion part - the movement outside the bus as it turns and travels is reflective of what is about to happen to Crick. In other words his life is about to become very confusing and unbalanced.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deliciously good.,"I really wish I could help raise this movie's grade with my 10/10 vote - in fact after I finish commenting it I'm gonna take a look if it made any difference whatsoever(...) This is one of the most surprising movies I've watched in a loooong time. First of all, I wouldn't expect Will Ferrel to be the protagonist of such a fine thing - and I usually think that too many good actors in just one movie (Dustin Hoffman + Emma Thompson + Maggie Gyllenhaal) doesn't really mean a positive thing (could be the sign of weak story, that is). But I just watched it, it's like 8.55 in the morning and I'm actually still listening to the song that plays while the final credits scroll by. It's the very first movie I comment here and I don't feel like getting into the details of the story - that's what the plot outline is there for. Just tell you this: if you feel like watching a movie and having the (strangest) feeling of having just watched a thing well-done, from start to finish, with actors that seemed to be born for their characters, great great soundtrack, and a magnificent, delicious story, then go for this one. Can do no wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Film about death and life and philosophy,"This is a great movie. One can read from the films story that it is about a man who realizes that he is character in a book and he will die. Moreover, the real subject of this film is about death, life, love. How do we act in our lives. Knowing that we will die. Or live in the routine of the everyday works counting the minutes. This the core of this movie.This film tells us all. If you do have a routine life, have not thought about dead, as I did (writing a master thesis in Philosophy), this film gives you the idea of death, its importance and the remembrance of that idea from not a harsh perspective as dozens of films every month does. Like Killing all the world with disasters, wars and aliens.This film makes it just concentrating on an ordinary man's life. Entering a narrator to it. Suppose just for a while that your life is narrated. How scary is it? All your habits, all the usual and routine things you are doing. Your obsessions your loneliness. How will your react. As in a controlled manner this film gives you the way to react to this routine.Excellent movie. Must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
We need to get rid of what happened to us,"It does not excite anyone who is not interested in literature, daydreaming, and reading; but this is a movie that can excite those who are interested in what I'm talking about. In this movie, as in many foreign movies, even if the subject comes to a place that requires a very serious and deep emotion such as death, foreigners are almost condemned to maneuver in a dry area. They can't connect the topic to anything meaningful and go on indefinitely. It's like they have to connect to things that are mundane, deep, and at the frequency of everyday life. Unrelated to the topic, but I think many scenes and attitudes in the series Innocent Apartments were inspired by this. Even the emotional piano music playing in some scenes of the movie...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very enjoyable,"Without being able to nail down precisely why, this movie is just wonderful. It's original and quirky without being too off the wall. It's funny in a dry and clever way (not at all what I expected from Will Ferrell), but also dramatic and romantic. The main characters are all so well cast the actors fit perfectly and work together naturally. Even visually it's ""just right"". As a reader I enjoyed the completely non-specific references to literature that still hit the mark (probably a different mark for every viewer.) It reminds me very strongly of The Shawshank Redemption, not in any specific way, but how both movies just leave you feeling good, glad that you got to see them, appreciative of the work that you never consciously noticed because you were lost in the film. Because of that no one part stood out to generate rave reviews and buzz and all that, which is too bad, but I think, like The Shawshank Redemption, this movie will just stay quietly popular for nearly everyone for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pleasant surprise.,"'Stranger than Fiction' was on Cable TV last night and, by having nothing better to do, I decided to watch it, but I wasn't really expecting much, since the main part here is Will Ferrel's and features Queen Latifah, so I though it was one more lame comedy. But when I saw the rest of cast, with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, and the director, I got cheered up a little. Marc Foster had directed 'Finding Neverland', a great picture. And by giving this one a chance, what a pleasant surprise I had.'Stranger than Fiction' is a original screenplay by USA-born writer Zach Helm. It tells the story of a methodic IRS agent who wakes up in one morning and starts to hear a voice on his head narrating everything he does. At first, he thinks he is crazy, but when he goes get help he finds out that the voice is of a writer who's writing a novel about him, even though he doesn't know her. He is just a character for her. Although the plot seems weirs, and it really is, the script is very well-written and keeps you interested on what's going to happen with those characters. There lots of intelligent dialogs, and the funny parts aren't forced or out-of-place - it's all exactly were it should be. There also a few memorable lines.The cast here has famous names, featuring also Maggie Gyllenhaal aside from the already quoted names - Will Ferrel, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah. And it was really nice to see Will Ferrel different from what he is used to. After this movie, I'm going to see him as a real actor, he just have to choose better projects. Queen Latifah was also a surprise - she was great as the writer's assistant. Maggie Gyllenhaal is lovely as the main character's love interest, and Dustin Hoffman is always great, but the member of the cast that really drew my attention was Emma Thompson. I always particularly liked her, and she is absolutely marvelous on the role of Karen Eiffel, the writer.Marc Foster's direction isn't bad, with some interesting camera-work and the intelligent use of special effects, one thing really rare on today's movies. And talking about those, they were really great, even for today's standards. The editing is also well-made, so is the cinematography. The soundtrack really fits in - another thing that you don't see much on today's movies.Overral, this is a little and funny comedy movie that really makes you feel good. An interesting plot, a great casting ensemble and the efficient directing by Marc Foster are worth the ticket. A few flaws and holes on the script don't ruin the pleasant surprise I had watching this.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A nice little movie that's bigger than life!,"I leave comments almost never (too lazy, I guess). But this movie was such an unexpected surprise with a brilliant script, fantastic acting and beautiful cinematography that I just felt I had to! Take it from someone who does not normally enjoy films without a lot of actions -- this one you gotta see! Oh, and Will Ferell? I knew he was a funny guy, but I could never believe he was such a tremendous actor. He is completely different in this movie; nothing from slapstick, in your face, comedy he's known for. In fact, I was reluctant to see this movie because of him. Boy, was I wrong! I think this film is perfect. Can't find any fault in it. Just make sure you understand it's not really a comedy.

The name is perfect,"Reality truly can be stranger than fiction in ways that we least expect. This movie conveys this message via subversion in a way that stuck out to me. For one, the premise almost seems science fiction/fantasy but presents shockingly realistic and grounded story that had me glued to the screen and putting myself in Harold's shoes often and uncomfortably.I could also reach for this being a representation of how the 1% capitalizes on the rest of the population almost as if they are fictional characters and how they would react when coming face to face with those they affect.

After that I thought the movie was set in NYC (where I swear I saw the MOMA in the background), and Chicago, among others.

Mediocre attempt at intellectual comedy,"Cast: Will Ferrell; Dustin Hoffman; Maggie Gyllenhaal; Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah Writer and character come together like never before Acclaimed fiction writer Kay Eiffel is busy constructing her latest literary installment. It's not intended to be a Pulitzer winning effort, but it is an interesting exploration into mediocrity and the shackles of conformity.When Eiffel suffers the debilitating effects of writer's block, she enlists the help of an assistant, Queen Latifah to give impetus to a story stuck in the doldrums. Of great concern to Eiffel is how to end the lead character's life and thus conclude the story.The real twist in the story is the juxtaposition of fiction and reality. When Harold Crick (Ferrell), a mundane IRS agent and the protagonist of Eiffel's story, begins hearing voices, he becomes alarmed.After a series of hilarious meetings with a literature professor portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, Harold believes that he is the victim of an author's creation. Together they slowly begin to unravel Crick's story, voices and all.A sudden love interest begins to stir Harold Crick and it is this caterpillar cum butterfly princess that ultimately steals the show. Harold realizes that his imminent fictional and physical death can only be undone by meeting with the author Kay Eiffel.The stimulating script is masterfully written; the characters are exceptional and the essence of it is poignant.Stranger than fiction is best described as an intellectually stimulating insight into the complexity of love, life, humor and mediocrity.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ferrells best role in a while,"Imagine your life being narrated to you. Your every thought and action narrated out to you and you have no idea who is telling this or how they even know. So what happens when the voice tells you that you are going to die and you have no idea how or when. Now what do you do?Stranger Than Fiction keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to end with simple twists and hilarious extras that make it a movie worth watching. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is just a normal man until this unfamiliar voice begins to narrate his every thought and move. What Harold doesn't know is that writer Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is trying to finish her new novel and Harold is the leading character. Harold goes nuts trying to figure out where this voice is coming from and why it is narrating his life. Along the way, he audits and falls in love with the baker, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and meets Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who tries to figure out what kind of story Harold is in.The acting in this movie is one of a kind. The normally over the top Will Ferrell is perfect for this role. His crazy and spunky personality on the set proves a good fit for the character of Harold Crick. The gorgeous Emma Thompson portrays an amazing and crazy writer in the midst of a writers block and Maggie Gyllenhaal could not have been a better suit for the sarcastic and fun loving baker. The structure of the story is not something that you see every day in Hollywood and is very original and creative. Not often will you find a mans life being told by an unfamiliar voice of a writer trying to finish her story or an IRS worker falling in love with the girl he audits. This creative ideas give this movie an edge that many others never find.Stranger Than Fiction receives a four out of five stars. It has the concepts of both a humor and love story mixed in with even a little tragedy. There is something in this movie for every member of the family to enjoy and I can guarantee that everyone will.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction - one of the best movies of 2006,"If I were asked to guess who wrote the screenplay of this movie, I would definitely say ""Charlie Kaufman"" because this is exactly the kind of story that could come from the mind of Charlie Kaufman (except in this case, we owe our thanks to Zach Helm). In this stranger-than-fiction tale, our hero, Harold Crick is an IRS agent who lives his life by calculating every step, carefully planing his day, his schedule instead of enjoying the moment. One day something goes wrong with his wrist watch while he is asleep and then he starts to hear his life being narrated by a female voice. It is funny that just as the narrator is introducing us to the character of Harold Crick, the very same character (who is supposed to be merely fictional) also hears the same narration. Soon, the voice becomes quite intrusive and makes him lose his train of thought. Harold goes to a doctor seeking advice about this weird situation. Of course, the first thing that comes to doctor's mind is that Harold is going insane or probably schizophrenic. Considering this may not be the case, Harold ends up seeking help from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who tries to understand what kind of story Harold is in (comedy or tragedy?). In the meantime, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) the voice inside Harold Crick's mind, is actually a real-life author and writing a story about her character...well...Harold Crick. But the bad news is that, at the end of every story, Kay kills her main character - something that puts Harold on the edge. Harold, who is not very good at socializing with others and who is a very lonely man, starts to open up a little and connects with the woman he desires, a young woman named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). But, if the story's ending doesn't change Harold's life will cease to exist. This is a very good movie with an inspirational message about the meaning of life. If we think about it, the author Kay is more like a God figure because she decides who lives and who dies. We can think of ourselves as characters in a book written by God. And if knew the exact time of our death, how would we continue to live our life or could we continue at all? The movie's message is strong and inspirational: live your life without calculating every step, be more spontaneous, stop being so result-focused and indulge yourself in the little details of life, enjoy the moment. After all, these are the things that makes life so precious. This message comes way before the ending but the ending puts a cherry on top of this message. I highly recommend Stranger Than Fiction to anyone who is interested in the meaning of life. I give it a 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
death and taxes...,"Being a huge Emma Thompson fan, I decided I had to see this one. I wasn't disappointed. Will Ferrell does very well in a part that's more serious than the roles he usually tackles, and Maggie Gyllenhall and Dustin Hoffman clearly enjoy their roles.A movie that reflects on all sorts of issues--isn't real life almost always stranger than fiction? Why is it that we expect a story to be a comedy or a tragedy? And why is it that people seem to think they can get out of dying someday, whenever or however it happens. Overall, this is an interesting interpretation of the Benjamin Franklin quote that death and taxes are the only things that are certain in life.For those who like movies that are funny and intelligent.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great film - impressive screen writing and acting,"Going into this film, I understood the premise pretty well from the trailers I'd seen. And I'd heard someone say this was Will Ferrell's first totally serious role. What I wasn't expecting was what a great screenplay this film has.Ferrell does have a more serious role than many of his past films, but it's also very comedic. Before seeing it, I imagined this being Farrell's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but it isn't. That said, he does a great job as leading man and makes us really believe in his somewhat fantastic character.The rest of the cast is a brilliant collection of stars. After leaving the theater, I was wondering how the filmmakers were able to get Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman to both play supporting roles. Maggie Gyllenhaal does an admirable job as Farrell's character's love interest and life changer, though her role doesn't require the depth that Thompson's does.Finally, the most delightful part of this film is the awesome writing. Zach Helm's screenplay has just enough circularity - it's a story about a story - to make it intellectually appealing without getting bogged down. I'm not sure the Academy would ever give awards to a film with Will Farrell, but I think ""Stranger Than Fiction"" deserves the Best Screenplay Oscar more than any other film I've seen this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An original story, being funny and dramatic at the same time, a celebration of Will Ferrell indeed","I had seen this movie before, but as it was so good at the first time, I decided to watch it another time to see if it's still that good. Oh yes, it was. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" tells about an IRS agent Harold Crick, whose life is pretty much dependent on his wristwatch. He's precise in everything, from brushing his teeth to his coffee breaks at work, every day is the same and Harold's whole life is repetitive. All of a sudden, he starts to hear a narration of a story in his head, telling about Harold's life, being right in everything he does. Obviously the narration starts to affect his life as well.The screenplay is very well written, it's very unique and original, like no other I've seen before. It's so sweet in a way that it just makes you smile. The whole story telling is just marvellous, progressing with comedy and drama mixed up together, it makes you laugh and it makes you sad, so this is not just a comedy. For me, it's more like a drama and though it is actually, quoting the movie title, stranger than fiction it is after all some way so believable, although you know it can't be true. That's why the screenplay's so fantastic, making something fictional to seem like something like it could actually happen. The directing makes the screenplay even better, by being accurate and precise. It's nothing phenomenal, but still deserves a big plus.Will Ferrell does his best role performance yet to date, by far. The movie's a perfect example of the fact that Ferrell can do drama as well besides the usual comedy. He's also just so fitting for the role itself, he actually looks like Harold Crick, being the character by his substance. A big applause for Mr. Ferrell indeed, just perfect. What comes to other role performances, well, there couldn't be better actors doing them. Dustin Hoffman plays a professor named Jules Hilbert and he's just so incredibly funny in the role as well, being that enjoyable himself he always is. Emma Thompson is the narrator and the author, doing it perfectly. A little bit different role from Thompson which also makes it rather surreal, but oh well, she's one of those actresses who can actually perform any role. Great. Despite the excellent performances of Hoffman and Thompson, the one who takes the cake is Ferrell. We've seen comedians doing dramas in the past and to just name a few excellent ones there's Jim Carrey with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", there's Steve Carrell with ""Little Miss Sunshine and there's Robin Williams who has done it a million times, yet perfectly every time. Will Ferrell belongs to that group of comedians now and he is more than warmly welcome.All in all, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a great movie. It's very enjoyable, it's funny and it's surprisingly dramatic, including an excellent scene which actually made me shed a tear. That's what is so surprising in it being so dramatic, there's the hilarious Will Ferrell, who can obviously break hearts as well. This just makes me waiting more of dramatic roles from Ferrell, as he just was so good in this movie. Hopefully he'll be doing more drama, as when it comes to comedy that's guaranteed from Ferrell. Anyways, the movie's great, no matter what your aspect is. Just watch it and most certainly enjoy it. It puts a smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A good movie that you ask yourself throughout ""Is it a comedy or tragedy.",Stranger Then Fiction is a very clever Drama/Comedy that is definitely his cleverest and most thought out movie ever. The movie is about Harold Crick a guy that has the same daily routine day in day out before finding out that he is actually a character in a novel that that the author is planning to kill him off in the end of the novel. The movie has twists all over the place and is really unpredictable yet really understandable. Overall this movie deserves an extremely high rating as it is definitely one of Will Ferell best and Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah also do a pretty good job in this awesome movie so watch this movie and it will make you think while you laugh. I rate it 83%.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
complex comedy,"Although Will Ferral has acted in his fair share of movies, he redeems himself with ""stranger than Fiction."" This movie displays and demonstrates well his acting talents. ""stranger than Fiction"" had an interesting plot that contained lots of twists that all come together at the end and kept me watching. It is centered around a New York city auditor, Harlod Crick, who begins to think that he is insane when he starts to hear a female voice in his head that is narrating everything that he does in his life. It turns out that it is an author's voice as she writes her novel. The problem is that in order for her book to be as phenomenal as it can, Harold has to die. All in all, I would recommend ""Stranger than Fiction"" to anyone who has some extra time on their hands to enjoy a complex comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting storyline but not really my cup of tea,"Rated PG-13 for some disturbing images, sexuality, brief language and nudity.I just saw Stranger than fiction on the movie network.I enjoy Will Ferrel's previous films.Despite what IMDb says at the moment, Stranger than Fiction is a comedy.Its not a hilarious comedy like say other Will Ferell films such as Old School or Anchorman but it does have its funny moments.The plot I will have to admit was interesting and original.The film is about a man who hears a narrator who is speaking about his life.The narrator is a writer who is writing a book but little does she know, her book is happening in real life.The writer/narrator also plans on killing off the main character.So the man basically tries to live his life while meeting a psychiatrist while the writer thinks of a good way to kill off the main character.Stranger Than Fiction has its funny moments and it has an interesting storyline but it was fairly strange and not really my cup of tea.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quirky and weird (Microphone boom),"I loved this movie. It was quirky and surprising. I saw this movie over the Thanksgiving weekend at a very small theater. There were TONS of scenes where you could see the microphone booms. Several they were very very clear. There is a scene they show in the trailer where they are sitting in the rain. In the theater I could see the microphone boom in that scene clear as day - the rain was even dripping off of it. I'm left with thinking that the placement of the booms in the scenes was intentional? Possibly to illustrate how the picture was a narration of Harold's life. I can't imagine that the director left those in there by mistake as they were so apparent. I'm really surprised to see that there were no other mentions of it within the comments. There are a couple of mentions of the booms in the ""goofs"" section however.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A warning - seeing this movie may compel you to seeing it again!,"Seeing Will Farrell in a straight role in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is at first puzzling - but it soon leaves as the interest in what the plot is setting up becomes primary. I was taken in - not only as voyeur but really caring what was going to happen to this character. I loved the on-site in Chicago aspect and the detail to the overall look of all the secondary roles and rhythm they evoked to enrich the visuals. Emma Thompson, I think, should be nominated for best actress for her role. I loved the casting choices and would gladly recommend this movie especially to those who may be involved in writing, as I am. I do plan on seeing it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More Boring Than Fiction,"I've had more entertaining poops than Stranger Than Fiction. And yes, that includes this morning.Where to begin? Will Ferrell is NOT a meek man whose life is being mysteriously controlled by a novelist. He's just a great big lug, chewing the fat and mingling the gums. I wish he would do Alf again... I used to love it when he'd eat cats and cough up hair.Also, what is with the Dustin Hoffman? What is this, his 1,000th movie and all of a sudden he tries to be Dr. Funnypants, PhD? He just wasn't right for the part, is all, homies. Why couldn't this be the movie where they resurrected the career of Bull the bailiff from Night Court? Dy-no-mite!One thing I will say is that Stranger Than Fiction has a good debut from Emma Thompson. This gal can induce laughter faster than that gruff homeless man who used to tickle us as youngsters. I'll take the glazed!Overall, I do not recommend Stranger Than Fiction.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction Indeed,"Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS Agent whose world is turned upside-down when he begins to hear his life being chronicled by a narrator only he can hear. The Narrator, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a nearly forgotten author of tragic novels, is struggling to complete her latest and best book, unaware that her protagonist is alive and uncontrollably guided by her words.Fiction and reality collide when the bewildered and hilariously resistant Harold hears the Narrator say that events have been set in motion that will lead to his imminent death. Desperate to escape his fate, Harold seeks help from eccentric English professor Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) and finds unexpected comfort in a burgeoning romance with a defiant audit subject, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhall). Unluckily for Harold, Kay's impatient publishers have unleashed a stern assistant named Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to help the author finish her book and finish off Harold Crick",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Very Clever Romantic Comedy/Tragedy,"I'm going to avoid spoilers as much as possible in my review because the magic of watching Stranger Than Fiction is the mystery surrounding the character Harold Crick. If you would like a story with some very original comedic elements that don't aim to be disgusting, this may be what you're looking for. This film was truly unoffensive which is quite refreshing, and managed to be interesting and a lot of fun to watch too.Be sure to see this film from the beginning. There are some exceptionally clever things that happen that help with the character development.Stranger Than Fiction has a fantasy element combined with a romantic dramedy element. Somehow the film manages not to fall into being a sentimental sappy mess either. I would place it between The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. It's not quite as fantasy-like as the Truman show and it's not quite the tragic romance of Eternal Sunshine. I didn't get the feeling that it was trying to give an earth-shattering message about life, but it also wasn't light-hearted fluff either. It was a very balanced film with good acting, a great plot and a lot of laughs. It was a very solid movie.I saw the film with my family and my boyfriend and we all left the theater in a good mood which to me, says a lot about a film. It was a very satisfying experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who would have thought Will Ferrell would ever be in a masterpiece?,"This movie is superb on every level: a strong concept, witty and well thought-out writing, marvelously inventive direction (by Marc Forster, who previously showed what he could do with a story about the edge between fiction and fact in the equally wonderful ""Finding Neverland"") and great casting. For once Will Ferrell is actually funny instead of just dumb, and Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are equally good in their supporting turns. And if Marc Forster is reading this, I have the same request for him that I did after I saw ""Finding Neverland"": will he please, please, PLEASE buy the rights to the Alfred Hitchcock-Jay Presson Allen script based on James M. Barrie's play ""Mary Rose"" and make that as his next film?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Free Drexel Student Viewing sponsored by Chase Bank, Facebook, and Columbia Pictures","Acting Overall out of 10: 8 Will Ferrel: 10 Emma Thompson: 9 Dustin Hoffman: 9 Queen Latifah: 8PLOT: 10 SCRIPT: 9As a student of Drexel University I was quite excited to take advantage of this rare FREE early movie premiere hosted by Columbia pictures, Facebook, and Chase. Simply I just thought the movie was amazing. It had great performances from the whole cast, Queen Latifah the only exception, as she was just herself really like in every movie she does, but overall just phenomenal. Though I would agree with the one other comment a person made before that there really wasn't too much character development. Will Ferrell really pulls off this new part for him, as he is forced to play the reserved, methodical, conformist of society. If you're expecting a laugh out loud comedy from Will Ferrell with silly faces, noises, and stupidity, than this isn't the movie for you, though I still definitively recommend you to go and see this. I mean don't get me wrong it is a comedy, ""Stranger Than Fiction"", but it's a serious part for Will Ferrell, revealing the more practical and realistic side of his charisma and acting. The whole concept behind the story is great though. Really enjoyed it because it was like watching or hearing two movies/stories at once, but about the same person and about the same story.weird but true. Its not confusing or anything like that, but it's a story being written about the movie you're currently watching, so as the story is being written by its author Kay Eiffel, Emma Thompson, in her new book, its also how the movie turns out, or the events which occur in Cricks life. Its smart, funny, can be a tear jerker, and whimsical, its definitely one of Ferrell's best performances and proves he can be serious and normal I guess you can say.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

a great comedy with heart and a brain,"I saw an advanced screening of 'Stranger than Fiction' tonight at my university, and I absolutely loved it. The film presents a fresh take on the themes previously best examined in Pirandello's 'Six Characters in Search of an Author,' but in this instance, it's one character, Harold Crick in search of his life within the narration. Mr. Ferrell plays Harold Crick with the earnestness that always ran at the core of his best characters; this is his 'Truman Show.' The film expertly skates between comedy and tragedy, perfectly voiced by Emma Thompson as the author of Harold Crick's life as we know it. She plays Eiffel with conviction, wit, and a great affinity for gallows humor. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a very ""Maggie Gyllenhaal"" character, but she adds levity and romance with aplomb when necessary. Dustin Hoffman and Tony Hale also do well in their somewhat-limited screen time (especially in the case of the sadly underused Mr. Hale, who imbues each of his scenes with a similar childlike exuberance that those of us who know and love 'Arrested Development' are familiar with). Queen Latifah does an admiral job with a character who seems merely to act as the voice of the audience or the recipient of exposition. Her character sticks out (sometimes painfully) among the many round characters of the film.The film has a similar tone to 'I heart Huckabees': a little erudite, a little tragic, great fun, witty comedy, generally life-affirming. The difference is that this film has more heart and less pretension than 'Huckabees'. That being said, this is a wonderful English major's movie: it's about the power of literature.I would highly recommend the film, especially as an alternative (or chaser) to the raunchier 'Borat'. (I saw the two within a few days of each other, and both illustrate that the American comedy is not dead. Both movies thrive on opposite ends of the spectrum.)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent Film,"Stranger Than Fiction was excellent. The characters are well developed and strong, the plot -- superb and surprising, and the dialogue-- witty and true. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) seems, at the beginning of the movie, to be a stereotypical sub-genius living the boring lonely office life of a IRS agent. Yet, he is not introduced as a man who is tired with his life and he doesn't really go though some major midlife crisis, which one comes to expect with such characters of Cricks age. No, when he unexpectedly meets up with the knowledge of his own death, given to him by the third person omniscient narrator whom he hears in his one mind (Emma Thomson), Crick does not decide that he wants to live; he simply decides that he does not want to die.At first glance, each character seems far fetch and overly rambunctious. But as the story unfolds the characters become real. The outspoken baker who wishes to express her political views in any way she can (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the eccentric novelist who has a terrible case of writers' block (Emma Thompson), and the infatuated and unusually wise English professor who tries desperately to find the fate of Herald Crick (Dustin Hoffman) are people that we have met and see often; they may even be our friends. And they do become our friends in this delightfully entertaining and surprisingly thought provoking film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Moving drama,"STF is a drama, not a comedy, about an IRS schmuck (Will Ferrell) who starts hearing a voice in his head. The voice belongs to a deranged author (Emma Thompson) who is suffering from writer's block and very slowly spinning a yarn about the schmuck with eventual plans to kill him, as she has done to the protagonists of her previous eight books. The schmuck understandably doesn't want to die, and goes in search of this mystery voice in his head. Along the way, he meets a winsome bakery owner (Maggie Gyllenhall) who helps him take charge of his own fate, more or less. Dustin Hoffman, sporting one hell of a Captain Kirk toupee, plays a coffee-snorting literary professor who helps the schmuck sort out what kind of story he is in, in order to figure out the author's identity. Hoffman is hysterical, Ferrell is tightly controlled as the schmuck slowly coming out of his shell, and Gyllenhall is just about the sexiest baker on the planet -- except for a really gruesome tattoo on her right arm, marking her feminist spirit. Linda Hunt has a tiny role as the schmuck's shrink, and an unrecognizable Tom Hulce plays the schmuck's strange human resources manager. A very good movie, but it is definitely not a comedy, even with quite a few laughs. So, as such, be prepared for a shock or two. The trailers for it stressed the few comic moments. The studio evidently did not want you to know it is a drama, along the lines of the director's previous STAY or that Malkovich movie with John Cusack or that Japanese hootenanny with Bill Murray.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Strange enough!,"A pretty mellow movie, actually kinda strange in parts, but totally original. It was an interesting concept for us, and the portrayal was near life. Despite a personal objection to the fact that the book writer or the book had no reference to the other characters in the movie, I appreciated the overall simplicity of the movie (not only with reference to setting, attire, mood, etc).I like the continuous calculator in our hero's mind. I like the way the charming baker wanted to make a difference to the world. I also liked the way how all of us have a sense of hygiene, when the writer while trying to visualize the jump, wipes her nose and puts it back in her pocket. I was educated by the dealt issue...WRITERS BLOCK......grrrr....i wanted to sympathize with her! In fact, I liked the way the Professor scientifically tried to narrow down to who could be the writer... What i did not like was that it was too slow (probably because of my addiction to action) and almost made me sleep in some parts...totally strange but overall worth it!

Are you a tragedy or a comedy?,"Stranger Than Fiction is a grown up story. It is a story of an everyman. We aren't given his childhood despair, we don't know how he became who he is, only the nugget that he doesn't like cookies. He could be any of us, who grew up and lost ourselves along the way. Will Ferrel is quiet, restrained, and deeply touching as Harold Crick. The movie of Crick's life made the theatre laugh, especially for those of us that got the literary jokes, but it reflects a lonely life too many of us know. Beyond the superb acting of Ferrel, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson, Ms Latifa and Maggie Gyllenhaal are appreciable side notes. This isn't a Charlie Kaufman film and it doesn't try to be. The fact that Crick is somehow the character of Emma Thompson's new novel is simply a structural element that allows us to see more deeply into his life.

I'm not usually a fan of Will Ferrell's more goofy antics but in this he held himself admirably well, amidst such greats as Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman - all while holding onto his unique brand of whimsicality and comedic timing.Emma Thompson nails her characterisation of a well seasoned author at wit's end, thanks to writer's block, as only she can do. No actor feels out of place among their peers in this piece and not one of them is failing to pull their own weight. The script is like a breath of fresh air. It's awkward, painful, hilarious, charming and refreshingly intelligent, without thinking too much of itself or abandoning its characters in the hopes of purely being a ""smart film"".Stranger Than Fiction is a small nugget of brilliance for the writer, reader, lover, laugher and life liver in all of us.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
what's the deal with the boom mic?,"I didn't much care for this movie simply because it isn't the type of movie I care much for. performances were good, concept was interesting, direction was adequate. It is clearly the type of movie which its devotees will spend endless hours discussing ""what it really meant."" My question is this, ""what the heck was the deal with the boom mic?"" In the print I saw, the boom mic hangs down consistently into almost every scene for the first half of the movie; moving from actor to actor. It isn't just a glimpse of the dang thing but the whole microphone, including the boom a couple of times. It is there way to much to be poor editing or an accident. But if it isn't poor editing or an accident, it must be intentional. If it is intentional, it must ""mean"" something.Had the author been writing a screenplay instead of a novel, it would have made some sense, but since a novel is a narrative form rather than a recorded form, the mic is way out of place and seems to have no context.I would love to read anyone's thoughts about this.

"From out of nowhere, an unforgettable film","It took me all of 30 seconds to be completely attached to this film. The idea that all of those archetypal patterns we studied in school can apply to our own lives is only a small part of what this movie offers. You can look past it as simply a fun little film to go see (plenty of humor to please those looking for that surface-level comedy--which I am in need of sometimes, myself), but if you look at literature as an imaginative rehearsal for life, then you may see the ""life rehearsals"" in this film, too. I appreciate having a character who is completely unique, and yet an everyman at the same time. And I like how he blunders his way through the unfathomable predicament of being narrated. Seriously--I am afraid to think about what my own ""narrator"" would have to say about me. In fact, I'm hearing those voices in my head right now.I like the intense look at these words ""Little did he know,"" because, honestly, think of how little we know about the next moments of our lives.The character of the boy on the bicycle and the woman looking for a job--those characters represent the fate that we just don't hold in our lives. They come in and out of the film with such stealth that when they pop in, you suddenly remember that you had already forgotten them. Yet without them, an additional layer of meaning here would be lost.The cinematography is artistic and worth the price of admission in itself, and the graphics here that are used to represent an entire personality are brilliant. Again, if you're interested in applying art (in this case, film) to your own life, you'll begin to wonder about your own graphics? What do they look like right now? Ferrell and Thompson provide outstanding entertainment--Ferrell, especially, because his timing in every respect (dialogue, physical comedy, facial expressions) are flawless. Thompson is excellent casting. I thought that Dustin Hoffman's role added a clever balance, though the symbolism of his role of lifeguard was a bit too in-your-face.If there's anything that I didn't like about this film, it would be Queen Latifa's small but almost annoying role (very typical of her ""watch me break free from type"" intentions) and the glow of the watch.

"A wonderful movie about fate, destiny, and mortality","This movie was such the pleasant little movie, and shows Will Ferrel's ability to take on weightier dramatic roles far different from his old school Old School days.At its heart, the movie is of Ferrel's Harold Crick, a go-nowhere IRS auditor with no friends, living a self-imposed regimented life of constant monotony, doing the same things the same way in the same sequence every single same day. Until one day, he hears the voice of writer Kay Eiffel (played by Emma Thompson) narrating his life, in particular a line of prose hinting his ""imminent death,"" whereupon his life take a turn away from the mundane. Faced with the certainty of his death, he seeks the owner of the voice in his head, and trying to divine whether the way he lives his life is influencing the narrative, or whether Eiffel's writing is directing the path of his life. In the midst of this, no longer fettered by his self-imposed boundaries due to his imminent death, Crick develops as a person aided in part by a renegade baker (in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal) and finally coming to grips with his mortality.It may sound like this is a tragic movie of gloom, but in reality, it is a comedic tragedy, delivering humor in the unusual. This may be one of Will Ferrel's best and least annoying roles. Emma Thompson is wonderfully on the edge of breakdown as the death-obsessed author.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best films of the year,"Stranger Than Fiction is one of those films that exceeds expectations. It is a beautifully crafted film in all regards with memorable performances, intelligently poetic direction and an absolutely spellbinding script.The biggest surprise is the range that Will Ferrell brings to his role as a bland, unremarkable man who works for the IRS who finds his life flipped upside down when he begins to hear a narrative about his life. While he is certainly in his element in comedy, the dramatic demands of this film prove to be a feat well matched by Ferrell who left many in the audience I watched the film with in tears. This role certainly stands as a high mark for Will Ferrell and he certainly is to be commended for his work.The script by first time film writer Zach Helm stands as equal a breakthrough in screen writing as Being John Malkovich was for Charlie Kaufman or American Beauty was for Alan Ball. His creative, narrative style is only matched by his skillful character development. The characters breathe and grow with the deftness of a mature writer and the well-paced plot moves with grace, something sorely lacking in the average Hollywood script.Stranger Than Fiction is certainly one of the few easily recognized Oscar contenders for this year. It certainly stands likely to receive nominations for direction, screen writing and acting for Will Ferrell and for Dustin Hoffman who nearly steals the show. It is an easily recommended film that stands out as fresh and truly heartfelt, and the level of acting talent that the script attracted certainly speaks volumes as to how well written the film was.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Delightful Surprise,"I loved ""Stranger Than Fiction"" although I admit I went in with mixed feelings. I'm not a huge Will Ferrell fan, but I was intrigued by the premise of a life being narrated by an authorial voice.I had seen enough previews to have my interest piqued, but then I read a few negative reviews. I generally trust the ""movie viewer's review"" over those of critics, but the mix of comments had me feeling a bit cautious as I plunked down my money for a Saturday matinée. I was very pleasantly surprised! Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are both delightful in this film--not that I would expect anything less from either of them. Maggie Gyllenhaal was also terrific. A restrained, less over-the-top Ferrell was also very good.I don't know if you'll find a most original premise for a film, and I truly think it ""works.""

Quite a memorable movie,"After huge success, many comedians feel they are atop the world, and as a result, try to branch their talents out to other genres (or sub-genres) of film. When it comes to a switch from the outrageous to the subtle in terms of the comedy, popular comedians such as Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler, among a number of others, have mastered the switch seamlessly. Add Will Ferrell to the list, who trades in the over-the-top Ricky Bobby get-up of last summer's ""Talladega Nights"" to take on Harold Crick, the protagonist of ""Stranger than Fiction,"" which is, in itself, a fantastical comedy with streaks of drama here and there.In the film, Harold Crick is a lonely, IRS agent. Hated unanimously because of his job, Harold has replaced the joys of life with numbers, meticulously plotting out every event of his day, from getting to work to tying his necktie in the morning. To put it simply, Harold lives a life of solitude; one that traditionally would not even bear a story worth telling. However, Harold suddenly gets a fantastical twist to his otherwise incredibly ordinary life: He has a narrator.The narrator is Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), an eccentric, chain-smoking novelist who is suffering from writer's block. As far as she knows, Harold Crick is just one of her characters, and she is desperately trying to find a way to kill him off to complete her latest novel, ""Death and Taxes,"" which may just end up being her masterpiece. After Harold hears a line saying ""Little did he know that these events would lead to his imminent death,"" he decides to find out what's really going on. He goes to a literary professor named Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who at first passes Harold's story off as nonsense, but becomes more and more convinced that what Harold is describing is really happening. All the while, Harold tries to figure out whether he is in a comedy or tragedy, most of that determination hinging on Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a rebellious baker who he first audits, but comes to fall in love with.Right off the bat, the most interesting thing ""Stranger than Fiction"" does is break down the elements of story by presenting its protagonist experiencing them on-screen. Creative innovation is strong from the earliest points of the film, as computer-generated structures surrounding Harold show what is going on in his head. ""Stranger than Fiction"" clearly has a premise that calls for a large amount of applied ambition from those involved, and in most spots, the ambition is melded with the pure talent of those involved. The script, written by first time screenwriter Zach Helm, is consistently clever and funny, and unknowingly plays off the skills of its performers.The acting is another area where ""Stranger than Fiction"" particularly excels. As mentioned above, Will Ferrell manages the switch from the over-the-top to the subtle very well, as he believably plays Harold Crick. He is appropriately odd at the beginning of the film, and appropriately advances in tone with his character. Surprisingly, Ferrell manages to draw high-brow laughs as well as he does the simpler, less mature ones he has gotten out of moviegoers with such outings as ""Elf,"" ""Anchorman,"" and ""Talladega Nights."" The Ferrell in ""Stranger than Fiction"" is much different than the one audiences have come to know over the last few years, but it's worth mention, as Ferrell shines in his third attempt of more serious acting, following mixed results from Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" and this year's ""Winter Passing."" The other actors are on similar (or in some cases higher) ground as Ferrell in terms of performance. Emma Thompson is delightfully eccentric in the role of Kay Eiffel, as the actions of her character at first seem to have a twisted humor to them, but audiences soon come to sympathize with her and understand her intentions. A large part of Thompson's performance comes from the narration voiceovers, but she steals the show whenever she's on screen, as she does an excellent job with the brilliant-but-troubled character. Maggie Gyllenhaal continues her excellent year with the role of Ana Pascal, where she turns in a terrific performance. It would be a shame if her name fails to get mention at awards time, given this performance, along with her arguably more impressive turn in ""World Trade Center"" and her powerhouse leading role in the little-seen ""Sherrybaby."" Dustin Hoffman also gives a winning performance as Jules Hilbert, consistently getting laughs from the audience. However, Queen Latifah is unfortunately underused as Kay's assistant.With ""Stranger than Fiction,"" director Marc Forster has yet another very different film to add to his resume of very differing genres. It's odd that he chose this as his follow-up to last year's immensely confusing thriller ""Stay,"" which followed the personal drama ""Monster's Ball"" and the whimsical tearjerker ""Finding Neverland."" Forster handles the action well, executing the very creative nature of the script and getting excellent performances out of everyone. Granted, it's not the best film on his resume (that honor belongs to ""Monster's Ball,"" with ""Finding Neverland"" also arguably being superior), but it's the kind of solid, well-executed entry that a number of directors would like to have.If there's anything at all to complain about with the film, it's the ending. It seems very Hollywood-like, and that it may have been tweaked for the sake of getting the best word-of-mouth possible from common audiences. But to be fair, it's more or less a minor gripe, and one of just a few things that the film does wrong.Through uniqueness, it's clear that ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a memorable film. Though it likely won't be the box office smash that ""Talladega Nights"" was, it will likely be remembered as one of Ferrell's best films. There's lots to love about ""Stranger than Fiction,"" and the film hits on target in just about every area.Review posted by W. Slinger from http://www.boxofficefanatic.com",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comedy with some unexpected drama,"This was a great movie. It started off pretty funny and it actually had jokes that weren't in the previews which is always a plus. Later, it took a gradual turn to a more dramatic direction which was unexpected, but not unpleasant. The acting was great. Will Farrel does a great job and so does Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. All the characters worked well together and it turned out really well. I didn't really listen for the soundtrack so I don't remember if it was good or not, but it definitely wasn't horrible. The story line is somewhat simple, but original and well done. I was really glad I went to see it and I would definitely recommend this movie. I'm going to buy it as soon as it's out on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
makes us laugh at and love its awkward Harold,"Stranger than Fiction reviewed by Sam OsbornIn Stranger than Fiction, reality and the imaginings of a novelist are bridged by, of all things, a British narration; to be precise, the narration of Emma Thompson. She plays Karen Eiffel, a reclusive novelist struggling with an especially thick bout of writer's block. Her narration, clicked out on a typewriter in her huge, all-white apartment, is mysteriously transmitted to Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), whose every action coincides with Ms. Eiffel's words. His life has suddenly become a narrated event. This would only be a slight annoyance had Ms. Eiffel not foreshadowed Harold's tale with what she calls ""imminent death.""It's a great and clever gimmick for a comedy; a gimmick that could gobble up a whole film without trouble and maybe drop in two years later for second helpings on the sequel. But Screenwriter Zach Helm isn't mining for gimmicks here. Just as soon as he settles in, about to rest on the laurels of his neat plot device, Mr. Helm gets back up and spins the gimmick like a top, letting its breadth span more than the silly expressions on Will Ferrell's face. His hero is a man of routine, one who counts out his steps and times his procedures with quick mathematics and numbers. He's lonely and seemingly mechanized, quietly unremarkable at his job as an IRS tax auditor. But amidst the distracting narration that now plagues his routine, Harold meets Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a grassroots tax-evader who rebels against the government with milk and chocolate-chip cookies from her independent bakery. Harold is assigned to investigate her case and, despite her publicly abusing him at her shop, he falls for her. His routine is thus changed, but his death still imminent. For counsel he goes to Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), an expert on literary theory to work up a list of potential authors he might be channeling.In the same way Jim Carrey sang two octaves lower than his usual high-pitched comic screech in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so too does Will Ferrell quiet down for Stranger than Fiction. It's not as though somebody pressed the mute button on Ferrell's antics; his performance is comfortably natural in all its quaint and charming awkwardness. He plucks laughs from the audience, but doesn't whore himself out for them like in this summer's Talladega Nights. Similarly, in her small role as Karen Eiffel's assistant, Queen Latifah turns in a thankfully understated performance. And finally, Hoffman and Gyllenhaal both shine hard and bright under the stereotype characters they're cast under. But great cast work is no surprise from Director Marc Forster. His previous filmsStay, Finding Neverland, and Monster's Ballhave churned out consistently stunning performances from all actors involved.The only words I have for describing Mr. Forster's directorial prowess are a ""natural affinity for movie-making."" Like Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead), his films are driven invisibly. In synopsis and description they're hardly exceptional, but when seen, the films have a preternatural magnetism. They engage us inexplicably close and don't let go until they're through. With Stranger than Fiction, the draw is wonderfully human. It makes us laugh at and love its awkward Harold and let the gimmick work its spinning magic until the whole situation has taken its whimsical turn. It's a wild and delightful success that hopefully won't go unnoticed this upcoming awards season.Sam Osborn",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction,"I was recently given the opportunity to see a screening of ""Stranger Than Fiction"", a new film by director Marc Forster (who also directed the acclaimed ""Monster's Ball"" and ""Finding Neverland""). After seeing the many trailers for this particular film, I came into the crowded movie theater expecting another silly Will Ferrell movie with asinine jokes and situational irony around every bend.Fortunately enough, this movie caught me off guard. Although it is categorized as a comedy under IMDb and other websites alike, I found it to be much more of a drama than anything else. I maybe laughed once or twice throughout the extent of the movie. I was much more enthralled in the story being unraveled through each reel, almost every scene filled with ingenuity and cleverness.In my opinion, I see this film as Will Ferrell's best role in a movie. I had been beginning to see him as a continuous actor, always playing the same ""funny guy"" roles in every film. But he took a delightful turn in this as Mr. Harold Crick, a very structured and organized middle-aged man who follows a specific routine every day. I found Will Ferrell to be both humorous and charming in this certain role, and I believe he portrayed his character really well.The other actors in this movie that I thought really, really stood out are Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman. Gyllenhaal, as the obnoxious yet delightful Ana Pascal, somehow managed to become the apple of everyone's eye even through her rather harsh façade. Thompson, as the kooky and exuberantly depressed Kay Eiffel, brought out a comic relief that was very refreshing from other films. Almost every scene featuring Thompson and the always splendid Queen Latifah are simply movie magic. Hoffman, as the eccentric and witty Prof. Jules Hilbert, was probably my favourite actor in the entire film. I shared his views and I thought he was amazing in his role.Throughout the entirety of this movie, the plot thickens and thickens until you've begun to really feel for Harold and Kay alike, even though they completely contrast each other (you know, except for the fact that she's narrating his life). The ending is certainly one I will not forget, and I loved how everything pulled together for the conclusion.""Stranger Than Fiction"" is definitely one you'll want to check out sometime, whether it is in theaters or on DVD.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Taxing rom-com...,"Tricksy, would-be cutesy rom-com with a ""Truman Show""/""Sliding Doors"" type twist as blue-collar IRS nobody Will Ferrell finds his mundane life manipulated by a mysterious omnipotent ""narrator"" towards an ultimately tragic conclusion (at least for him). Problem for me here is the ""com"" part as my funny bone steadfastly refused to let itself be tickled by on-screen events and with the extra-dimensional plot having, as indicated, been done before to more credible effect elsewhere, I found the movie ultimately an exercise in futility. Ferrell really needs a Jimmy Stewart or even Bill Murray-type languor to carry off his Average-Guy part while Maggie Gylenhaal is equally unconvincing as a tattooed baker, behind with her taxes (seriously!). You don't get any sense that this unlikely duo could ever get attracted to one another except in a kooky Hollywood movie, then throw in Dustin Hoffman in a by-numbers part as Ferrell's shrink, Emma Thomson as the befuddled author/narrator and Queen Latifah as her P.A. so that it's difficult to highlight whose character is the more useless. In addition, quite why the director sees fit to soundtrack early 80's UK new-wave songs from the likes of The Jam, Clash and the great Wreckless Eric (whose little-known classic ""Whole Wide World"" takes centre stage as Ferrell's song to his particular siren), is ultimately as confusing and meaningless as the rest of this slight and unsatisfactory confection. By the end I'm sure I was meant to have a little Capra-type glow and some expansive thoughts on the old free-will versus fate discussion, but honestly, I'd have been more entertained evaluating all this in the dustiest of text-books...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Restoring Faith in Hollywood...,"I went through a period where I hadn't seen a truly great film come out of Hollywood for several years. Last week, I saw Running with Scissors, and was glad to know that not all hope was lost. That film was made by people who really wanted to make something with lots of value. And I walked out of the theater thinking, ""that was the best film I've seen in years"".Last night, I went to see STF, and had to revise my opinion...IT now was the best film I've seen in years (the former, being American Beauty). The heart and soul of the filmmakers showed clearly evident. No Hollywood sensory overload formula, no grabbing big name actors simply to get people in the theater (Must Love Dogs), no bland or predictable script (MLD again), no overacting (Crash), no red flags all over the movie, that read ""that would never happen in a world of fiction"" (Crash again) (if you can grasp what that means).Stranger than Fiction was stupendous. The flow of the movie was perfect. It was one that sucked me in, and I stayed in.The acting was in the top 3% of greatest achievable by man. Will Ferrell's performance was perfecthe's one of my favorite comedic actors, but transitioned perfectly to a subtle personality, believable, consistent and captivating (even better than Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), which I liked very much, as well as JC's performance).I was especially impressed with Dustin Hoffman's performance. Another great actor, who went through a too long phase of Hollywood formula movies (Outbreak), where the acting was a 2nd priority in the production. Mr. Hoffman's performance in STF was spectacular. Relaxed, fully submerged in his character. Besides everything else I love about this film, I want to see it again just to see DH's supporting character role. Truly, I think this is one of his best films.But all the characters in the film are to be applauded enthusiastically. Marc Forster's direction left no leniency for a non-fully immersed moment in any of the actor's performances (bravo to Maggie Gyllenhaal). Emma Thomson's character was refreshingly odd, but not overdone  just genuine. Brilliant work by all involved in producing the character of Kay Eiffel.The plot was not simply a single great idea with a mediocre script. The flow was smooth, and ended perfectly. Never once did I find myself with any confidence of how it might turn out. I had no clue as to if or how he would actually die. And Kay Eiffel's reasoning for changing the ending (no spoiler here!) was impacting and a subtle climax of the movie, revealing much of the spirit of the filmmakers, let alone a very intelligently written script.I surely hope that Hollywood throws this title in the mix of contenders come awards time. It clearly deserves numerous points of recognition. This film, like American Beauty, seemed to have little concern for pleasing anyone other than themselves. They were far too involved in making something great to be concerned by the aforementioned.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction,"I saw Stranger Than Fiction tonight and it was awesome! This movie was absolutely hilarious. I loved the storyline and how the main character, Harold Crick(Will Ferrell) reacted to each new occurrence. Emma(Thompson) and Maggie(Gyllenhall Sp?) were brilliant. I've been a fan of Emma's ever since I saw Much Ado About Nothing. And Maggie can draw you into the story without much effort. I recommend this movie to anyone that has a sense of humor. And even if you don't have one, see it anyway and you will develop a sense of humor. Will Ferrell was the perfect choice for this role. Awesome!! I laughed so hard I had tears. Without a doubt, this is most definitely one movie I will be adding to my collection. That's really all I can say. Oh, and GO SEE IT!!!! =)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I don't see the depth others saw. I think another comedic actor could have delivered the performance with much more credibility. If there is one flaw, it was Ferrell. Thompson, Hoffmann, Gyllenhal, and Latifah were all fabulous in their parts. Since I felt the same chill during last years, Crash. I call this as the best movie of the year.

Easily a best screenplay nominee,"One of the smartest and yet most moving screenplays I have seen in a long time, brought to life by across-the-board wonderful performances. Savvily marketed as a comedy, this movie turns out to be so much more than a ""simple"" comedy. Possibly Will Ferrell's best work in his film career; his ""Truman Show"" moment when he can show that he is more than a man-boy comedic buffoon and can hold his own against acting heavyweights like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. By turns funny, moving, poignant, introspective and engrossing, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" may very well turn out to be one of the best movies of the year, if not the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Well thought out, well directed","Sony/Columbia Pictures - 113 minutes Will Farrell/Dustin Hoffman/Emma ThompsonWarning - this is not your children's Will Farrell movie. But that's not a bad thing. Many (might I say most) typical Will Farrell movies are a little over the top with easy slapstick, teenage boy laugh humor. This movie has a heart. Many of the great laughs don't even come straight from Will Farrell.This is a vary subdued, laid back, well thought out movie, that progresses much like a well-oiled machine. Every movie usually has a love story of some kind in it, but even within the well-thought out main plot, at the heart of this movie, is a love story. It's not gooey or gushy, but a straight-ahead, nerdy guy becomes a man (and yes, in this one it works quite well) and falls in love.The concept of the movie (and main plot) is that Harold Crick (a stuffy IRS auditor) starts hearing a female voice in his head, and it has a British accent. Yes, understandably, for the comic factor, no one else can hear it, but it seems to know him, narrating his entire life, just as he's living it. It drives him crazy.First he visits a psychiatrist, and then, from there visits a literary professor, all in an attempt to get hold of his life, which is being torn apart from end to end, due to this voice in his head.It turns out, Karen (played by Emma Thompson) is a well known author, writing a book. Each sentence she types is what Harold hears in his headOf course, that, in and of itself is disturbing to him, but not as disturbing as what he finds out the author is going to do to him in the end of the book she's writing....Gross out Factor - .5 (as they walk through a men's locker room, there are a few old man butts seen, very briefly) Profanity Factor - .5 (just a handful of words to get their PG13 rating) Sex Factor - .5 (just a little bit - no sexual nudity) Feel-Good Factor - 5 - all in all, after leaving the movie, I knew inside that I had a really good time and felt good about having seen the movie. I'd recommend it to 99% of my friends. It was definitely worth spending all of the 113 minutes in the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Ferrell should do more of this,"Not knowing what to expect, and considering Ferrell a bit of a hit-and-miss actor, I started watching this with some trepidation.I was soon proved wrong - this is a lovely little story, unique and quirky, with stellar performances from Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Emma Thompson. Dustin Hoffman supports admirably, and director Marc Forster never lets the plot drag. In the wrong hands this could have been a disaster, but the story works its way to a surprising ending whilst maintaining a deep sense of appreciation for the key characters.Loses two points due to the terrible miscasting of Queen Latifah (who, in fairness, doesn't have a lot to do except stand around in a suit and look annoyed).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
should be wonderful -- but it's precious and airless,"What a wonderful cast wasted on a concept that should have been inventive and wonderful but becomes only a circle of self-consciousness conceits. Every single actor is so good you could watch them with the sound off -- Will Ferrell with Maggie Gyllenhaal are a revelation -- but too many of the conversations are Will Ferrell endlessly playing dumb for us so that the other characters tease out the profundity.....Also there are some annoying little visual frills -- to make us feel like Harold lives in computer-aided design program...? I love the idea of a movie about literature, but this one never breathes any life into its ideas. A much more satisfying film is Adaptation which is just as self-conscious but comes to odd, enchanting, uncomfortable -- and exhilarating-- life.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very moving and surprisingly credible,"Will Ferrell (whom I don't ordinarily like) gives a believable, sensitive performance in a role that could have been a two-dimensional caricature. Emma Thompson is brilliant (Oscar contender once again?), and Maggie Gillenhall engaging; Linda Hunt, Queen Latifah, and Dustin Hoffman are understated and satisfying. Perhaps the only false note is the character/caricature of the ""company psychologist (although it was a pleasure to see a rare appearance by Tom Hulce); he was the last person one might expect to find in a federal government facility.This is an intelligent comedy (the adolescent triple date seated behind me ""didn't get it"") that manipulates the viewer, lulling him/her one moment into accepting easy comedy, challenging him/her the next with a ""gotcha!"" scene or moment. Seemingly chance glimpses of three anonymous characters alert us that ""foreshadowing"" is in play. Overall, very moving and surprisingly credible: ""I brought you flours.""",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good Things Do Come in Small Packages,"These days, Hollywood movies like to sell drama in the form of reactionary deception, violence, and hopelessness. It's easy for the film industry to continue playing the strings of guilt, fear, and despondency. Stranger Than Fiction is a more rare find. It explores human choice and some of life's tough questions with a kindness, a humaneness that is neither contrived nor sarcastic. The film paints the characters with natural abilities to think philosophically -- which brings a sense of joy and optimism to the intelligent audience. I find it easier to engage in a movie that doesn't clobber the audience over the head with ostentatious political or corporate propagandas. The movie is also a gem in terms of its sincerity in celebrating the subtle acts of human kindness. This film's minimalist approach to human drama is one of the neat gifts that come in small packages.Will Farrell gave a surprisingly good performance. This movie maybe the springboard out of type-cast roles.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delightful Comedy,"A quirky but thoroughly charming little film, 'Stranger than Fiction' finds humor in the mundane and celebrates individuality. This unusually sentimental story finds Will Ferrell at the top of his game, while the film's supporting cast lights up the screen wonderfully. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, and it'll win you over in a heartbeat.Harold Crick lives a simple life. He lives and works with numbers, and never sways from his precise and calculated schedule. All this will change, however, the day he begins hearing a voice. A voice that will narrate all that he does... and informs Harold of his imminent death. Little does he know, this is actually the voice of Karen Eiffel, an author whose writing block is preventing her from killing the main character in her new book. The character? Harold Crick. The real Harold is now in a race against time to understand what's happening to him, and along the way, he will meet new faces who help him learn a thing or two about life, love, and his own mortality.Like Harold Crick, 'Stranger than Fiction' is a simple film. All it asks of you and me is to suspend our disbelief for a couple hours and open our minds, however illogical the film's premise may be. Other than that, the film's charm will do the rest. It's such a heartfelt and well-meaning film, it's easy to get pulled in and caught up. It's fast-paced with an intelligent script which packs on the quick and witty dialogue that underlines many of the movie's fantastic performances. Almost everything 'Fiction' does is spot-on. From its dry humor to eloquent narration to its theme about mortality and life. And though it's a movie, it's as poetic as a book as it unfolds right in front of us. A very good book at that.The key to such a character driven film such as 'Fiction' depends overwhelmingly on the workings of its cast. And for the record, the talent that assembled to work together on this project couldn't have been better. It's difficult to see a physical comic like Will Ferrell in such a subdued role, when he's usually so... in the moment. He's a great actor, and his role here is definitely among his best. But for some reason, I think I like him better when he's being his outrageous usual self. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers another fine performance as always, and yes, even after the year she had in 2006, she remains criminally underrated. Go figure. Queen Latifah is delightful as ever, her presence as an actress continues to be striking and impressive. But I believe many will agree when I say that the highlight of the film comes from veteran actors Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Both find themselves at the top of their game with their respective roles, they're so delightfully funny and happen to be the perfect touch to top off this tender film.One of 2006's most pleasant surprises, 'Stranger than Fiction' is a winning offbeat dramedy. Its message of living life to the fullest is one we've heard time and again, but it's presented in an original and effective way this time, handsomely wrapped as a little fable of a comedy. A film like this is worth seeing for its phenomenal character actors, who bring this film to life in great fashion.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Kaufman-lite, but Forster's best film is charmingly good","I saw ""Stranger Than Fiction"" because the trailer made the film seem awfully intriguing and, despite Will Ferrell's appearance, it also starred Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal.I realize the studio decided to sell this film as a comedy. And it is. But also is much more. It's heartwarming, fantastical and maintains a certain sweetness that, as cynical as I am, I found incredibly appealing.The story's hook: Renowned author Kay Eiffel (Thompson) is penning her latest book in which her protagonist is a chap named Harold Crick (Ferrell). However, unknown to her, Crick is an IRS auditor in real life and can hear her narration in his head and that drives him bonkers.What follows is a wonderful film that unwinds unexpectedly and slowly, allowing us to know and appreciate not only Kay and Harold, but also supporting characters, including a literature professor Jules (Dustin Hoffman) and a bakery-story owner Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), who proves to be Harold's object of desire.It is inevitable that Zach Helm's screenplay would draw comparisons to Charlie Kaufman's works, ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999), ""Adaptation"" (2002) and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004), which is one of my favorite films. I suppose it is unfair to compare Helm to the incomparable genius that is Kaufman.So, though Helm seems like Kaufman-lite, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is helped immensely by four superb performances and it's premise: The responsibility of at. How many good films could you say you've seen about that topic? Ferrell - who is best in small doses, which is why I've never really enjoyed his starring roles all that much - is finely subdued as a man slowly becoming unhinged as he realizes his fate. Ferrell never overacts - I know, that's shocking to believe, but true - and his goodness and kindness serves the story very well. I wish he'd take on more roles like this and fewer Ron Burgundys.Thompson makes a welcome return to the screen - I know she was in ""Nanny McPhee"" (2005) and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004) - but she's back playing a normal person. Kay's a woman with writer's block, desperately trying to figure out how to end her novel. She knows how it will end, but doesn't know how exactly, if that makes sense.But the star of the film is Gyllenhaal. She truly is one of the most gifted and talented actresses working today, someone who completely takes over a film with her charm and uncommon beauty. Here, she's Ana who's being audited and turning Harold's love life upside down. She wins us over with a minor role.The questions Helm raises in his film are intelligent ones about art, love, life, responsibility. If there's a flaw in the film, it is the ending. The ending is a compromise. And I couldn't help but think it felt something handed down by a studio exec. I don't know. Or, perhaps, Helm, realizing that he needed to make his film more appealing to the masses, compromised at the very end. He does seem to make it work, though the other possibility would have been excitingly intriguing, trying to see if the characters could get out of that one.However, the compromise aside, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" works beautifully. Despite it's fantastic ideas, it never seems forced or false. We buy the premise and are taken along for a delightful ride. I always thought Forster's other, better known, films, ""Monster's Ball"" (2001) and ""Finding Neverland"" (2004), were a tad over-rated. With ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" however, he proved me wrong. He's made one of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Will Ferrell the next Robin WIlliams or Tom Hanks?,"Comics becoming dramatic actors? Is it possible? After watching ""Stranger than Fiction"", I am convinced that Will Ferrell has the potential in his talent to expand his dramatic presence in movie making. I think if someone were to look at many of Robin Williams or Tom Hanks early works, there would have been considerable doubts that either of those actors could break the barrier placed against comedians becoming considered for serious or more dramatic roles. Will Ferrell proves in ""Stranger than Fiction"" that he has a much wider range than his characters in many other roles he has played would indicate. Will is generally believable and is able to hold his own against Oscar winners Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. He presents a warm genuine persona that makes his character very believable and likable. While Will Ferrell is known for characters that are over the top and outlandish, he proves that with a proper script, he is just as capable of playing a normal person in a dramatic situation as some of Hollywoods heavyweights like Mr. Williams or Tom Hanks, both actors got their start in comedic roles and stand up. Kudos to Mr. Ferrells agent who convinced him to take this role, and even more Kudos to Mr. Ferrell for making the right choice and play this character.

Harold Crick was de,"You will know exactly what the title of this review means when you choose to see this movie. My review title is THE climax of the movie. The absolute point of no return. And it has all to do with simple writer's block. Now you still dont know anything and that's the way it should be, because this story deserves to be discovered without knowing exactly what is going to happpen. It enhances the fun a lot. I have seen it over 10 times now and I still enjoy it to the fullest. Never understood why little children want to hear the same fairytale stories again and again, till I noticed myself that some movies just enchant me that much that I just can't get enough of them.This movie is really heartwarming. But it is slow. I love that, but some dont. And this gem is heavily relying on dialogue and plot. Those who like reading books might be especially interested. Those who are more interested in the intelligent arthouse films will probably adore this gem as well. But those longing for a simple straight comedy might not understand the subtle humor and find it boring.I cant guarantee you will like this movie, but I can guarantee you that this movie is special because of it's story. Really special. This story is clever, yet simple and heartwarming simultaneously. I had never seen anything like it. When I will tell you that it is about a man called Harold Crick whose destiny is totally controlled by a writer, it might sound awfully silly. It is silly, but portrayed magnificently by Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson. You just gotta see it to believe it.The story is about Will Ferrel who is playing a hilariously boring tax editor. Suddenly he starts hearing a woman's voice in his head. He fears he is losing his mind. But after some research he finds out he is a character in Emma Thompsons new novel. And everything she writes, starts happening to him. Sounds bizarre. Might seem childish. But it is honestly the best script I have seen in years. And brilliantly directed by director Marc Foster, known from World War Z (Brad Pitt), Quantum Solace (James Bond), Finding Neverland (Johnny Depp), Monsters Ball (Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry) and The Kite Runner. This director has made the most varied choices in movie styles amongst all the directors I know. He can make action, comedy, drama or everything in between. The man has got the talent to create any world for any audience with total credibility and wonderful imagination. Remember that name! Marc Foster.Acting is always paramount. However good a story might be, without good acting the story wont be credible. Fortunately it is because of a tremendous cast: Will Ferrel as well as Emma Thompson play one of the best roles of their carreers. They are just to die for. Will Ferrell usually is associated with blunt teen comedies, being dressed up as an elf or something. Now he is acting seriously. Well on the edge of serious and funny. Emma Thompson is almost unrecognizable as an writer in despair, bordering on psychosis. Supporting roles by Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman, how much better can it get?I love this movie. I truly love it. It stimulates my thinking, it caresses my solitude, it lifts me up when I am down. I just feel wonderful after seeing it again and again...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life on Audio Commentary,"This film is one of the greatest of 2006. Certainly Will Ferrell's best since ELF. He stars as tax auditor Harold Crick, a dull man who does everything being obsessed about numbers, doing equations in his his head, etc. He is constantly and silently critiqued by his wristwatch who is as human as Harold is not. Then one morning, while brushing his 32 teeth 72 times (once up and down, second side to side) he begins to hear a woman's voice narrating his life driving him to the point of depressing insanity. One day, he hears her mention that just by resetting his watch would send him to his untimely . He is terrified until he meets a literary expert named Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who helps him sort through stories he might be in or stories he's not in after he learns that she began her prophecy with the third-person omniscient phrase, ""Little did he know..."" The woman narrating is Karen ""Kay"" Eiffel (Emma Thompson), an eccentric and isolated author with writer's block, who spends every spare moment contemplating her in various situations (jumping off a building, crashing her car through a bridge and careening off and drowning) who receives an unwanted assistant named Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) who vows to help her finish her book % and Taxes"" by quietly and gladly off a fictional character named...Harold Crick.Beneath all this is a romantic subplot between shy, inner-self Harold and a rebellious baker he's auditing, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who she hates and does anything to ridicule and embarrass, even forcing him to sort through a box full of receipts and making him eat an unwanted cookie.This film is brilliant, making you think. Dustin Hoffman's character and Emma Thompson's characters are remarkably the same. Will Ferrell is clever, convincing audiences that he really is hearing a narrator. Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance of Ana is a bit far-fetched and expected but well worth it.As it is said in the movie by Prof. Hilbert, ""The thing to determine conclusively is whether you're in a comedy or a tragedy. Have you met anyone who simply loathes the very core of you?"" Harold responds dead-pan, ""Prof. Hilbert, I'm an IRS agent. Everyone hates me."" Hilbert responds, ""Well, that sounds like a comedy.""",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Refreshing Fun Movie But Ultimately Tame Ending,"9 December 2006. This intellectually delightful comedy has the innovative mark of qualitatively different for 2006 - much as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) or Being John Malkovich (2000). With a dry sense of humor, this lofty comedy begins with a Douglas Adam's ""Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy like voice over. This less fantasy like Neverending Story for adults provides a nice more level headed, more nuanced performance from Will Ferrell in one of his best roles yet. Unfortunately, the ending sputters to perhaps cater to American tastes without the more dramatically satisfying bittersweet dark ending that would have been more in character of the movie. Eight out of Ten Stars. 8/20/2023. Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffmann star in this comedy about the fantasy of a man who begins to hear the narrative that a writer is writing about this life and who attempts to work through with this crazy story with a therapist. An entertaining romantic movie that is quite unique and quirky and fun with undertones of John Candy's Delirious (1991). For a truly different and ultimately surprisingly suspenseful treat, try this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Bridge film for Ferrell?,"I have to admit I have become a Will Ferrell fan. I honestly did not used to be. I found most of his work on SNL somewhat shallow. His earlier movies were along the same lines. Then suddenly, in the movie Elf, I started seeing something more than just another crude slapstick comedian. I noticed Will kept his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. There was also an ""I know a secret about this character but I'm not going to tell."" look in his eyes that I have seen so infrequently. It drew me in in spite of myself. I had the feeling that he had spent real time thinking about the history of the character and their life prior to the movie. He took this feeling to a new level entirely with Stranger Than Fiction. It is a comedy but it is also much more than that. It has been a long time since I have been in a movie and wanted to laugh yet, at the same time, felt the need to hold my tongue to not spoil a tender moment. If they gave Oscars for performances in comedies I think Will should at the least be nominated for one in this. His range is becoming nothing short of impressive and I very much look forward to seeing him in more films and hopefully cast in rolls that challenge him to discover how great he can become!I also suggest this as one of the best ""date"" movies this season if not this whole year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Movie,"This film does more than expected. The main character Harold Crick is played by the well-known Will Ferrell. This movie is not simply another impromptu classic from the wonderful mind of Will Ferrell. While Ferrell still has a number of funny lines, the humor is much more sophisticated than usual for him. Also, the movie shows the acting ability that Ferrell truly has. In this film, Ferrell captures the hearts of those watching his character by pulling them so deep into the movie, that before the watcher knows it, the movie suddenly transforms from a comedy to a heart-wringing drama. At the beginning, the air about the movie is extremely light. The film seems as it will be nothing more than average comedy that does well in the box office because of the big name actors. But as the movie progresses, so too does the light air. The movie becomes more serious bit by bit, until at last, it turns into an unforgettable tear jerker. This is a must-see for all people, especially for those who think Will Ferrell is only capable of making movies that have such stupid jokes that you actually begin to laugh at something that is really simply ridiculous.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The song is called ""Whole Wide World."" During the song then she falls in love and makes love with Harold.I think Will Ferrell was a good actor in the film.

"Brilliant, but . . .","Harold Crick is an IRS agent who hears a woman's voice narrating his life as he goes through his day. The woman is actually a novelist, and he is the main character in her latest novel. This is bad enough for the fellow, but one day he discovers she is going to kill him off.This film is brilliant. The premise, the dialog and the acting are superb. The story is literal and allegorical and clever all at the same time. It's wraps a lot of different concepts together in a way I've never seen done before in a film.Will Ferrel has truly made the transition into ""serious"" acting here. Dustin Hoffman, as usual, is amazing to watch, and he has the best lines. Emma Thompson has her character flawlessly portrayed.The reason I have not given this film ten stars, is because the ending is not consistent with the rest of the film in terms of quality. OK, it's an acceptable ending, and it makes sense, but it lacks the brilliance of the rest of the movie. They should have come up with something better. Also, the Maggie Gyllenhall character was flawed; she starts out a firebrand and ends up a Barbie Doll. Unfortunate.But these flaws notwithstanding, a great film to see and savor. The most original dialog I've heard on screen, and an amazing tour de force of literary style that shows a respect for the audience rarely seen in a tinseltown production.P.S. Trivia note. The director went to great pains to make this take place in an unidentfiable city -- all the transit buses have nary a word painted on them -- but the opening scene has Harold getting onto a BART train! The rest of the film doesn't look like San Francisco tho.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very interesting.,"I went to this film thinking it was a Will Ferrell film, playing comic and serious at the same time. However, he has some lines that are funny, but he is more serious than anything else he has done. This movie, reminded me a little of The Truman Show, but yet with a different twist. The cast was great, Dustin Hoffman was great. I really like Maggie Gyllenhaal, she is funny and very cute in this film. Emma Thompson gives a great performance, as always. The movie is hard to figure how it will go. I highly recommend this if you are looking for something different to see...you may come away with more respect for Will Ferrell as an actor.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A contrived story about a man who finds out he's a character in a book written by someone else,"This movie is good, that's certain, and judging by the reaction of several people I know, you might like the hell out of it. To me it was so and so, probably because my expectations have been set high by a friend. You see, I would not have seen this film my myself for the sole reason that it stars Will Ferrell, but this friend was adamant that this was his all time favourite movie. While I give it a 10 star originality rating, the rest of it wasn't really that exciting and some parts I found borderly offensive.One clear example is when the character, a by the book (or should I say watch) guy who lives his life according to a precise schedule just has to be ""saved"" from his bland life by the story of the film. I understand why most people would hate that kind of life, but people living their lives according to their choices do not hate their life, nor do they appreciate other people critiquing it like it's a piece of consumer product. Another is the character of Ana, who is a beautiful rebellious kind and energetic woman, the perfect romantic interest... and absolutely nothing else. In fact she may be more bland than the main character who was designed to be that way.Was this an interesting gimmick? Yes. Was it fun to watch? I didn't get bored watching it. Was it acted well: I love most of the supporting cast and they did a decent, if not stellar, job. So if you like the kind of self referential stories about writing stories which in fact determine the outcome of one's life, then you're in luck. I found it merely above average.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A quirky and utterly original treat for the thinking man's film-goer, featuring a welcome change of pace for its star...","STRANGER THAN FICTION is an offbeat and imaginative fantasy that is as intriguing a journey for the film-goer as it is a welcome change of pace for its star, Will Ferrell. Ferrell is cast dramatically against type as Harold Crick, a lonely and brilliant IRS agent who wakes up one day and hears a female voice narrating his life, which the pragmatic and completely practical Crick finds unsettling at first but learns to accept it to a point, until the day the narrator announces that he is going to die. We then learn that the narrator is actually a mentally-shredded, chain-smoking novelist named Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) with writer's block and that Harold is the main character in Eiffel's latest book. It is revealed that Eiffel always kills off her main characters but is stuck on how to do away with Harold. Meanwhile, Harold seeks the help of an eccentric college professor (Dustin Hoffman) in learning who this narrator is while tentatively pursuing a relationship with a free-spirited baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who he is auditing. The story reaches a fever pitch for the viewer as we become completely engulfed in this cat and mouse game of Harold trying to prevent his death before Eiffel can write it, but then the story veers in an unexpected direction that makes this challenging race for Harold's life even more riveting. The film features an intelligent screenplay and crisp direction and Will Ferrell is an absolute revelation here, creating a character like nothing he has done before. His Harold Crick has a mind like an Excel spreadsheet, but is also socially inept, hypersensitive, and full of suppressed dreams. For those who have hated Ferrell's work prior to this, I challenge you to give this film a try. Ferrell actually delivers a performance of depth and vulnerability that might surprise you. Gyllenhaal has never been more appealing on screen and Hoffman is quietly masterful as the know it all professor trying to figure out who the narrator is by learning who it isn't first. Thompson tended to grate on my nerves as Eiffel and Queen Latifah was miscast in the pointless role of her assistant, but it is the deft story and the surprisingly effective performance from Will Ferrell playing a normal human being that made this film a winner.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Actor?,"There is not much i can say that hasn't already been said about this movie. Emma was good and deserves a best supporting actress nomination. The script was one of the best in recent years. The direction was excellent.BUT! I can say that Will Ferrell was amazing. This performance by the outlandish comedian was not amazing because he stepped out and did something different. He has done some serious comedic work like in Melinda and Melinda and Winter Passing. This was just an excellent performance by a honest, caring, and truthful actor. This was a performance i would expect from a Dustin Hoffman (who was also excellent). Not that i am comparing the two time Oscar winner with Will Ferrell. I am only saying that Will Ferrel was understated, poignant, and funny. This was a performance as good as Paul Giamatti in Sideways. This is a performance that deserves a nomination for Best Actor. This performance will surely win a Golden Globe for Will Ferrell. I hope that it wins him an Oscar for him as well.As for the movie; it is better than every movie it has been compared too. Yes, i even mean Eternal Sunshine.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Waste of Talent:,"Let me start by saying hat ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is an awful movie. Period. The worst thing about it is not the plot, which is admittedly dull and drawn out. It is not the art direction and cinematography, which is still very plain and unoriginal. Nor is it the title, which is somewhat fitting in a strange sort of way. Though these things are not enormously positive, the worst part of ""Stranger than Fiction"" is the blatant way in which it wastes the talents of its capable cast and produces such a terrible final product.""Stranger than Fiction"" is the story of the life of Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrel. Crick lives an enormously dull life, and Will Ferrel can do little more than make him a somewhat likable, but intensely boring person. Was this the intent? I don't know, nor do I care. Watching the events of Crick's life play out, which we spend the entire movie doing, as about as dull and unoriginal as it sounds. The role is such a waste of Ferrel's talent. We see this problem a lot in the movie.We soon switch between Crick and Emma Thompson's character in the movie, a best-selling author who's writing a book with Crick as the main character. Emma Thompson gives the writer such a soporific quality that she is even more unbearable to watch than Ferrel himself.The other main characters to come out of the woodwork in the film are a tax-evader who falls for Crick (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a coffee-hounding scholar (Dustin Hoffman), and a boring publishing executive (Qujeen Latifah). None of these characters are remotely interesting except for Hoffman's, who is brought to life well by the veteran actor (no surprise there). The usually wonderful Gyllenhaal is lacking in every area except for gross-out humor (unintentional), when she and Ferrell...-well I won't ruin it for you.This film is an overrated piece of trash that is as ridiculous as any comedy of its mold.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Niebla?,"I just saw the movie, and I thought it was surprisingly intelligent and entertaining, but I find it interesting (and a little frustrating) that none of the critics have mentioned that it's almost the exact same plot as Miguel de Unamuno's novel ""Niebla"". In comparison to the novel, they did a great job, especially in small allusions to the novel that wouldn't be apparent to someone who hasn't read it. (i.e. the author's sky rise office, the ""trip"" on the bus that Harold takes, etc.) The treatment of Unamuno's existentialism is complete yet accessible to all viewers, although I think that the major plot changes that were made in order to reach a larger audience weaken the movie as a whole.

"Intelligent, clever, and intriguing without being pretentious","For those who haven't seen the previews, the basic premise of the movie is this: Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) plays a boring tax auditor who one day starts hearing a woman's voice narrating the events of his life. Emma Thompson's character, Karen Eiffel, is an author who is writing a book and it so happens that the main character in her book is Harold Crick. The things that she writes about her ""fictional"" character Harold Crick are what ends up happening in the real Harold Crick's life. She is famous for killing off her main characters in the end and has struggled for years to find a way to kill off Harold Crick, not knowing that he is a real person and that she is controlling his life.The film overall has somewhat of a renaissance, awakening, coming of age type of feel to it. Harold starts out as a fairly drab ""tax man"" whose eyes are slowly opened to life and whose emotions begin to bubble up inside of him as Karen Eiffel leads him through a series of life-changing events.The kicker in the movie is that it engages the viewer into wondering how everything is going to tie together in the end. There are a few instances of foreshadowing like one involving an apple that kept me very interested in what ultimate significance it may hold. Early events that seem like trivial details end up being very important for the ending. There is enough humor to keep the mood light, yet it is subtle enough humor to maintain the tension that should exist in a movie where the main character's ""impending death"" is constantly hanging over him like a cloud.The movie is smart and witty and I found the acting in it to be quite believable. The intro has some clever visual effects and sets the tone well very early in the movie.If I had one criticism for the film, it would be that Will Ferrell was at times a little bit too humorous and clever for the type of bean counting tax auditor that it seemed he was supposed to be portraying. Overall, however, I would strongly recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys a good intelligent movie and can deal with one scene of bare male buns in a gym shower and one F bomb.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life is too short.,"I haven't seen this creative of a film where there were no animated characters. It is inventive (although, done before with different slants). Without giving anything away, let's just say that life is too short to NOT live the way you want, fulfill your dreams, and be free to be your true self. I know that sounds probably ""hippie-corny"", but it's what I got out of seeing this. This film has comedy, albeit dark at times, sadness and depression, and true joy and happiness. The realization that sometimes, you need a bit of a curve ball thrown your way to shake you up enough to learn that you are not really and truly living your life. Harold Krick (if I remember correctly), the main character, has routine down perfectly, too much so. People rely on him to be a certain way and display a certain demeanor. And just like touching one dangling piece of a baby's mobile, once a part of him has been ""touched"" by a very unusual event, the rest of his ""routinely perfect"" life shakes out to be nothing routine at all. At the same time (again without giving anything away), an author struggles with how and why she usually ends her books, a.k.a., her own routine.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ferrell's best performance,"First of all, I'm a fan of comedy before anything, and Will Ferrell is a comedy actor. Though he has his over-the-top moments often, he is a funny human being who easily makes me laugh 80-90% of the time he's on camera. I was expecting this film to be a lot funnier than it was but wasn't at all disappointed with it. It is a beautifully written story that is completely original and acted out superbly by a wonderful cast. Not so much comedy in this one but well worth the hour and 52 minutes.

Amazing movie with Philosophical implications,"As a fan of subtle psychological character profiles and ironic philosophical consequences ( sorry, lots of big words ), this was BY FAR the best movie I have seen in the past year.Very similar in tone and style to ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" ( also one of may very favorite surprises ), this movie was ridiculously entertaining, while shocking me with Will Farrell's chameleon-like acting performance. The director's use of architecture in this film is stunning, painting an emotional portrait of a sometimes-cold, modern world of urban existence.Characters are brilliantly portrayed, and I felt an emotional attachment to their development on-screen, which is difficult for someone with little emotion. Note the psychological profile of each of the characters, and you are almost sure to notice a different psychosis, OCD habit or other mental shortcoming that only adds to the characters' development throughout the film.This film truly is a piece of ART... the way movies ( I mean FILMS ) were meant to be.

A waste of a promising concept,"Some concepts are just meant to be used for greater life questions. Think Twelve Monkeys, Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind or Donnie Darko. And then, there's Stranger Than Fiction. Even though the concept of a man knowing his fate might leave some scenario writers eager to explore the possibilities, the writers of Stranger Than Fiction just thought it was necessary to turn it into a tacky love story, with a very unsurprising end.There's just too much wrong with this movie. Although it starts with a promising style, that style is quickly abandoned. Although the movie starts with the promise of creating a deep character, it quickly becomes obvious no psychology is included in this movie. The characters are flat and even though the cast is outstanding, there just isn't any magic between them at all.Then, there's the love story. It is as cliché as love stories get, with an unlikely couple, a romantic moment in which music plays a major role and of course a narrated description of the main character's bliss afterwards. Of course, the love story evolves into a minor drama, after which love literally saves a life. Please.Still, there's some moments which made me smile for just a few seconds. Some moments which were too embarrassing, the entirely stereotyped cubicle office worker. They don't weigh up to the shortcomings of the plot, though.

Well executed comedy-drama...,"1st watched 10/14/2008 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Marc Forster): Well executed comedy-drama about a man who's life is really just a character in a book that is currently being written. Will Farrell brilliantly underplays the main character as he goes thru his mundane life as an IRS agent, but then suddenly starts hearing a voice narrating his every move. He first goes to a shrink that thinks he's schizophrenic and suggests pills but then suggests visiting a literary teacher played by Dustin Hoffman. The teacher tries to help him figure out what kind of story he's involved in. Hoffman plays the role brilliantly like most of the cast. The only downspot in the casting is Queen Latifah as the novelist's assistant. She doesn't do well underplaying, and just doesn't bring much to her role. Emma Thompson is wonderful as the voice in Will's head who eventually meets up with the character. The music and pacing is very well done and the movie even makes you think as well as being comedic. A storyline like this is bound to have a few flaws, but overall the execution makes up for it and the experience of viewing the movie was fun and thought-provoking with even a little romance added in to spice things up. I am definitely looking forward to this director's next movie and it also showed the acting ability of Will Ferrell when given good material.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"We Never Know When Life Will End, Or How","Stranger Than Fiction is a film written by Zach Helm, a screenwriter who never let there be a dull moment in his dialogue or his story, and that includes the internal mechanics of both. Each character is a much different character than you expected them to be, and very absorbing and compelling that way, creating the film's universe, and because your attention is drawn to a character you've never seen before, you feel much more inclined to get to know them.I've always found Will Ferrell to be more of a talented actor than just a comedian, or an SNL alum who had a character big enough for the movies, hence happening upon a so-so film career. His characters in his comedies are too brilliantly stupid and wholly created. His timing is impeccable, as you will see in his almost robotically dull character in Stranger Than Fiction, Harold Crick, whose sudden losses of control are hilarious simply because of the contrast to what you've seen of him so far. He's an all-too-real satire of a commonly overlooked sort.Having recently seen In the Name of the Father, I commented on Emma Thompson's stunning talent as an actress, because I'd re-watched Primary Colors not too long before, and I realized how sparingly one thinks of her as anyone aside from her character. She completely becomes whomever she plays, like a chameleon. I see her now in Stranger Than Fiction and I realize the same thing about In the Name of the Father. Each film I see her in, the more I like her. She has a scene in this film that stands out, an interview her character gives on a network talk show, her host being a young bimbo whose lack of knowledge she finds so aggravating that she can't help from showing it in the expression of the answers she gives her, and she is hilarious.Dustin Hoffman does the opposite. As in Confidence, he's playing sort of a caricature of himself or a variation on his own personality rather than becoming a different one like in Rain Man or most of his earliest work. This doesn't detract from his performance however, though I've always enjoyed him as one of the few classic contemporary actors with the charisma that influences so many actors of later generations who actually does play many different people and explore many different genres and characters, as opposed to other great actors in that category---Pacino, De Niro, Nicholson, Penn---who take generally relative roles and infuse their own personas into them.The visual style of this film is very smart, conveying Harold Crick's mental state, as a mentally refined, all-too-reserved fellow who sees the world in numbers, systems and mechanisms everywhere he goes and fails to see life in other ways. The director, Marc Forster, shows us this as Crick goes through his daily algorithms and we see elegant diagrams and word groups with pointing lines, math problems done corresponding to his pondering through them. These image accompaniments don't necessarily face the audience, though they sometimes appear to be. Rather, they are facing Crick himself.It may seem odd that I analyze this film so much and study it so meticulously. When you see it, you'll realize that it truly is not just another blueprint zany comedy. It is one of the most intelligent and most well-made Hollywood films this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliant piece of work,"I am glad to be able to write a completely positive review on a movie for once! I have to admit I had not heard anything about this piece until it was recommended to me by a colleague at work who could not stop praising this movie. The movie is a masterpiece from the beginning to the end. The story of a Tax Agent who lives a boring, unfulfilled life of work and neurotic spleens suddenly starts hearing a narrators voice actually narrating about his life. Everyone who is a bookworm will love this one. For one thing the idea is intriguing and the viewer is wrapped up in the story after minutes. You just want to know what happens to main character. Secondly the cinematography and visual effects of the movie are just brilliant.Anyone interested in graphic design is (in my opinion) destined to love this movie. I watched ""Stay"" as well and liked it but this one is Forsters Masterpiece. I am looking forward to Forster's new project ""Kite runner"" because I loved the book and am confident that it will make great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It felt like I was watching a Twlight Zone episode.,"The only thing missing was a Rod Serling look a like at the beginning. Will Ferrell gives a worthy performance, a good change of pace from his overly silly roles he is best known for playing. He plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor, who brushes his teeth a certain way, goes to work, eats lunch and dinner, like it was a daily routine. His existences in life seems to bring out the worst in some people, like baker Ana Pascal(Maggie Gyllenhaal). Until one morning everything changes when Harold starts hearing a woman's voice, the voice seems to be narrating his every movement. Harold knows he is not crazy, so he turns too professor of literary theory named Jules Hilbert(Dustin Hoffman) who comes to the conclusion that he is a character in a book, but then Harold discovers that woman's voice is author Karen Eiffel(Emma Thompson). Will these two ever meet? You'll half too see the movie to find. Everybody gives a good performance. To the people who have not seen this yet, please it is worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Intriguing concept of modern life but lacking in energy,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that changes the way you look at a comedic actor and really shows off their acting prowess in the dramatic talent. Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Will Smith have all made the cut, each of them earning critical acclaim for their performances.Stranger Than Fiction tells the story of hopeless Harold Crick stuck in a boring job, living in his solitary life, being imprisoned by his daily routines. He trundles along day after day waiting for his life to explode into action. One day he begins to hear a voice in his head. Is it god? A higher power? Someone is writing a story about every waking moment of his life and only he has the power to take control of it; to try new things, fulfill dreams and find love.The revelation that something is changing occurs almost from the beginning of the film, so little time is wasted on establishing characters and setting. As a result the action begins early, and thankfully so do the laughs.Will Ferrell's performance has been hailed as moving, touching, and in slyly humorous overtones. He gives one of his best heartfelt performances here with much restraint and self-loathing comedy. By the end though I wanted to see more from Ferrell instead of just the poe-faced, drab IRS auditor. His transformation could have been stellar showing off a palette of emotions. By the time it came to ""carpe diem"" for him I was let down a little bit by his sluggishness.Gyllenhaal is charming, sweet and sexy in her role and she provides an attractive love interest. Her character in the film is a good ""opposites attract"" match for Ferrell and she has good material to work with in the film. Hoffman (as well as each of his films) as Professor Hilbert is marvelous and totally outshines Ferrell at times; is so natural and zany, pivotal to Harold's life changing actions.I really wished we saw more of Emma Thompson's Kay Eiffel, the chain-smoking author of Harold's life experiencing writer's block. She is so believably wacky and eccentric, inhabiting her role. Unfortunately there was not much for her to work with and the character was not fully developed as I would have liked. Her assistant (Latifah) was underused and wasted and I felt did not bring anything worthwhile to the plot or the dynamic with Eiffel.But the main problem I have with the film were the serious pacing issues, especially during the second half. There were some dead moments where the action didn't seem to move along even despite the commendable efforts of the fine actors. I felt the climax of the film was too drawn out and overdone and really lacked the wit and pace required in tradition with the film's subject matter. Forster tries to infuse humour into many scenes and downplays the score and tone of many scenes. However most of the time it comes out just awkward and lacking energy, ultimately I felt that the film slowed down terribly.The story itself is a very Woody Allen-esquire premise with voice-overs, blurring between reality and satire and rantings on the futility and ridiculousness of modern life. I was expecting a really clever, witty and satirist comedy but in the end I really was a disappointed. The script lacked energy and bite, the dialogue should have been much sharper. Also given the fantastic cast, how could you go wrong?This is a remarkable debut for this promising writer and another solid film for this versatile director. They had a fantastic cast that fulfilled their roles very well. But I felt that the script should have been much stronger and the editing was very flat. Still, a valuable addition to Mr Ferrell's resume and worth a look for the very intriguing concept.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellent Film Despite A More Serious Will Farrell,"As many of you may have gathered from the movie trailer, this movie was intended to be more of a drama than a comedy but the right twists of humor were able to keep fans of both genres interested. Will Farrell had some very excellent acting and most viewers would've sympathized right off the bat.The movie was interesting, well-acted, intelligent, quirky, funny, and very original. This is nearly a must see for any fans of writing or just Farrell fans in general. This movie was actually a welcome break from the stupid humor of teenage comedies that Farrell frequently brings to the screen.My two cents, well worth admission and I would rent when it hits DVD. An excellent movie overall, though my only gripe (without a spoiler) would be that I wish the ""narrarator"" had stuck to her guns and kept it a true tragedy, though who could blame her in the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In a word... perfect.,"This film has everything. It's funny, scary, surprising, happy, sad, romantic, and the list goes on. If you are not a fan of works previously done by Will Ferrell, do not let that stop you from seeing this movie. This is not only a fabulous script, but it is, by far, the best performance Ferrell has ever given. Emma Thompson is absolutely incredible as the author. She makes what her character does seem so normal. Deep down everyone does it to some degree, but she is completely up front about it. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant, of course. Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as well. Her character reminded me that a life I might see as too simple can still be exciting as long as you relax and just be who you are. It's an inspirational, thought-provoking story that you don't want to miss out on.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A clever fiction that is stranger than fiction...,"Stranger than Fiction/2006/***1/2Main Stars: Will Ferrell Emma Thompson Dustin Hoffman Maggie Gyllenhaal Queen LatifahA clever fiction that is stranger than fiction.Marc Forster's Stranger Than Fiction is a pure delight. Writer Zach Helm shows us his intellect by writing this movie and succeeding rather well. Before seeing this movie, my crazy predictions were telling me that this movie is just going to be about this well organized guy that has a narrator narrating his life ""accurately and with a better vocabulary"". However, the story goes much beyond that, and shows us that Will Ferrell is THE perfect actor to portray Harold Crick. Harold Crick is SUPPOSED to be a fictionalized character in Karen Eifel's (Emma Thompson's) new novel. What Karen doesn't know is that her character is a REAL person. The real Harold Crick is an IRS agent who has a rebellious IRS client Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who just doesn't want to pay (in her words) ""unnecessary taxes"". He tries as nice as possible to make her to. She wouldn't. The movie flips between scenes with Karen Eifel and Harold Crick very frequently. The Karen Eifel scenes are disturbing in some ways because she is a messed up author who smokes and drinks. When you think about it, she's basically playing a TRUE author, because a lot are messed up. A lot of authors in the world today are just a bit ""off"" in how they get their ideas. In her case, she sees a fruit rolling down the road and it gives her an idea on how to kill Harold Crick. It shows she does have an imagination but an imagination so ""out there"" like, a perfect example, Stephen King. The movie is a comedy-drama, and it even has scenes where Harold uses a journal to find out if his life is a comedy or a tragedy. He puts a tally mark under Comedy if something comedic just came about, or he puts a tally mark under Tragedy if something somewhat tragic came about. He uses this as an experiment to see what kind of story Eifel is writing, that is after he finds out she's writing a story about him. He goes for help a couple of times to find out if he's losing it. One person told him if he's hearing voices in his head, then he's suffering from schizophrenia and should go on qualified medication. Others were of no help until he went to a literary professor named Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who was very humorous in this movie and played his part perfectly. Crick was insisting help from Hilbert. Hilbert asks him loads of unnecessary questions, including, ""What's your favorite word?"" Crick replies, ""Integer."" Funny, yet not helping his situation a bit. Plus, this might interfere with his love for Ana Pascal. Crick is desperate and doesn't know what to do now that he finds out that Karen Eifel is going to kill him. Will Eifel kill him? If she did it would be a very depressing ending, especially since Crick is such a kind person in this film. And after a little while in this film, Crick stops thinking about counting his brush strokes from top to bottom and from left to right, and stops thinking about counting his steps before work and catching the bus at the exact time. His wristwatch is one to keep him so organized. And the story is about him and his wristwatch. And he is an organized person. But what happens when your wristwatch goes bad. You might not get up at the exact time in the morning or get somewhere at the exact time you need to. You lose your perfectionism after that. I would focus on life a little more too if I knew I was going to die. You shouldn't worry about the trivial things in life, but the important things in life. He had many important things in his life and had even more when he stopped worrying about being perfect. Do Karen Eifel and her assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) (who helps her find an ending because she has writer's block) know that she is writing a story about a REAL LIFE person? It is not my job to tell you, but it's your job to find out. Movie directed by Marc Forster.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't believe the hype..,"Will Ferrell plays the lead here and unfortunately it doesn't work for him. I am a fan of his more slap stick roles, which he excels, but the dead pan state of Harold Crick in this is not something that suits his style. Hoffman and Thompson are good so too Gyllenhaal but they don't make up for a film that fails to draw in an audience.The story line has true originality but you don't really build any empathy with the characters so in the end you tire of Crick's predicament and the film's sentiment is lost.Films are subjective and everyone takes something different away from viewing. Friends of mine loved Little Miss Sunshine, others didn't get it. I think in the end this film will polarise audiences as some will really like it but many more wont understand the fuss..",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sensacional story!,"Great movie! Zach Helm is an incredibly creative and fantastic author. Now I'm searching on the net to see whether he wrote something else for me to watch. He simply rocks! At first, because of his wisdom in describing the movie characters and the thoughtful insights on their personalities I thought he was an old person, very mature. I was astonish when I saw a picture of him along with his date of birth, which is only in 1975. I am positive he has a long and amazing career yet to come. The movie is simply fantastic. You have to watch it all and there is not a minute where you loose your connection with its characters...Guaranteed.

Harold Crick and his wristwatchStranger Than Fiction,"Marc Forster is one of those directors that over that past years have been on my film radar. After a strong debut, (I know he had a couple previous, but lets go with it), with Monster's Ball and a great follow-up of Finding Neverland, he really wowed me last year with the visual flair and emotion of Stay. This year sees the release of Stranger Than Fiction written by Zach Helm, whom people are hailing as one of the best new screenwriters, interesting since this is his first script made into a Hollywood feature. There were definite reservations on my part having the lead be cast to Will Ferrell, but I decided to go with my inclination to Forster movies and hope that we get Melinda and Melinda Ferrell, not watch me be an ass Ferrell. Thankfully Will gives possibly his greatest performance yet and really helps drive this intelligent, poignant allegory into a strong feature and a continuance to Forster's streak of winners.Many things could have gone wrong with Stranger Than Fiction. Ferrell could have pulled a Jim Carrey and highjacked the tale, it could have turned into slapstick comedy, or also could have become a Wonderful Life ripoff of sentimentality as all involved discovered an inner love and exuberance for doing good. Credit Helm and Forster for sticking to their guns and creating a true existential parable, showing how we are in control of our actions and we make choices in our lives either for worse or better. If you woke up tomorrow hearing a narration of your mundane activities, you have the ability to dismiss it as craziness, disregard it all together and except your fate, or wake up and decide to do something about it. Fate doesn't dictate your willingness to survive and that is exactly what Harold Crick wants to do. No matter how worthless his existence has been, all it takes is one wakeup call to turn it around and make something meaningful happen, to take a chance rather than cowardly take the easy way out.Yes the film has many laugh-out-loud moments, however, it is mostly a nuanced and subtle film. It takes itself very seriously and most of the laughs hit big because of the deadpan delivery and gravity of the situation at hand. These characters don't necessarily make light of the circumstances as much as go along with skepticism and a dash of possibility. Every instance is orchestrated to perfection and besides bringing up early on that a certain Wednesday event held the key to Crick's demise, days before our author even began to know how to go about killing him, complete without any real plot holes. Helm took his time with this tale of the meaning of life, (great reference to this by having Monty Python's movie of same name on screen briefly), and made every detail work throughout the evolution of a nobody into a literary hero.Besides Ferrell's revelation in acting ability, we are treated to numerous standout performances. The always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal shows how skilled she is in playing a bitter idealist while deftly balancing a budding interest in that she is against. Dustin Hoffman does spot-on work as an eccentric literary historian trying to help Crick, more out of educational curiosity than human compassion; a nice companion to his performance in the other recent great existential tale I Heart Huckabees. Emma Thompson steals the show, however, with her broken reclusive writer, so enthralled in finding ways to kill her characters she can't have a real connection with that of living people. The need she has to correspond with Hoffman's character, but her inability to do so as it might cloud her ability to write profound dark tales, is portrayed beautifully. Every emotion she goes through during her discovery about the novel is great to watch.Every minute of Stranger Than Fiction is measured and calculated to the utmost degree. Much like the film's fetish for numbers, (I loved the computer grids and diagrams superimposed throughout), Helm's script is a formula being solved. Every equation has one answer to even out both sides and while this film is no different, the filmmakers took a bit of liberty with its ultimate conclusion. The way it was going was perfect, the characters reactions to what was about to happen magnificent, and then the story took one last turn. While at first unfortunate, the final twist of the tale was redeemed by a profound statement from Thompson's Karen Eiffel, so true to form and relevant to the proceedings that I agree with her: I'm OK with just good. Just because the answer wasn't quite correct doesn't mean they can't get partial credit for the great work they did in the process.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction is a surprising delight...,"Stranger Than Fiction3.5/4Harold Crick: ""You don't understand that this isn't a story to me, it's my life! I want to live!""Having just written and optioned his first feature, Zach Helm decided to take a risk. Rather than taking on writing assignments or rewriting various projects, Helm went the unorthodox way and decided to take however long he needed to write a new, original screenplay. Coincidentally, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is a wonderfully inventive and substantive film; it is one of the most original films of the new millennium.Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS agent living a life mired in routine. He counts brush strokes, wakes up everyday at 6:17 AM, and maintains a precise schedule for everything he does, even the most trivial of activities. However, Harold starts to hear a voice, a narrator- a voice only he can hear. The narration begins to affect his entire life, from his work, to his love-interest, to his death.One of Stranger's strengths is that it is able to both create and sustain a perfect balance between moments of drama and comedy. This is rare, especially in 2006 as scripts like Peter Morgan's ""The Queen"" fail to find equal footing in these territories resulting in a handful of poorly received jokes. Even in the moments leading to the films dramatic climax, Helm cracks a shell of tension through comedic narration that is both effective and hysterical. This is an incredibly difficult area to navigate for any screenwriter, but Helm, aided by Marc Forster's assured direction, succeeds.The most notable aspect of the film is Zach Helm's masterfully crafted screenplay. It is awe inspiring in its creativity and novelty. Every word is exact in its selectivity, just like Harold Crick's life. The quality of the script is what caused such stars as Oscar winners Thompson and Hoffman as well as the talented Maggie Gyllenhaal to gravitate toward the project. The crux of its dramatic material is powerful, to say the least, and ultimately heartbreaking. Such a screenplay demands recognition but sadly, it may be passed over in an incredibly strong Original Screenplay category this year featuring Oscar winner Eric Roth, the renowned Peter Morgan, and a fellow freshmen, Michael Ardnt.Will Ferrell is a revelation in ""Fiction,"" he is cast perfectly and shocks his audience. Ferrell strides through the dramatic material with ease, something that fans of his comedic ventures such as ""Talladega Nights"" will be surprised to discover. Emma Thompson thrives as struggling author and narrator Karen Eiffel, delivering one of the best supporting actress performances of the year. Hoffman, always charming, works his magic here with a good turn, triumphantly returning to a quality films.The films only misstep occurs in its final act, which I won't discuss in length. Suffice to say, rather than going for the gut with an incredibly dark and emotionally complex turn, the film takes a different route but still ends on a relatively satisfying note. Despite a slight wave of disappointment that came over me, I understood why Fiction took this direction and still enjoyed it.""Stranger Than Fiction"" isn't a great film but it comes close enough. Fiction is drenched in poignancy, and manages to be uniquely intelligent and profound. These qualities are exceptionally rare in today's world of blockbusters, sequels, and low budget horror films. Stranger Than Fiction deserves its pathos, it is a pleasurable viewing experience amidst its intermittently dreary (yet simultaneously brilliant) content. It is a film worth seeing, if only for its wit, let alone the questions it poses. The film hits topics ranging from carpe diem to omnipotence to routine and it does so successfully. Helm has a bright career ahead of him and if he continues writing like this, he will join the ranks of writers like Eric Roth and Charlie Kaufman as the best writers in the industry. If this happens, I can assure you, film-goers across the world would not be in a tragedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What's great is I've watched this with people who aren't Ferrell's biggest fans and they've been turned by his character and how passionate he is with it. If you're a fan of thought-provoking original ideas and are happy that they might fall into that 'quirky' category then definitely check this out. I don't like to use the work quirky as I don't think it's a fair description as Thompson and Ferrell are beautiful to watch.

AN Honest Review,"I am one of those people that normally hate Will Ferrell, especially in a leading role. I find him obnoxious, and over-the-top to the point where he is pandering for laughs form the LCD than actually attempting to be funny.However, there is always an exception to the rule. Usually that exception comes in the form of a supporting role... as in Old School... but here it comes in the form of a leading role.It seems like Marc Forster really reigned him in on the one and the pay off was AMAZING. It's seriously a funny and quirky film. It's hysterical and kind of plays to an audience that wonders if writer's creations can come to life.It's an imaginative script and plays to the people that feel, maybe, a little guilty for leaving a book over night when the characters are left in a bad position just in case they are real and might get stuck there. It appeals to anyone that has ever wrote fiction, and felt like a God because of the control they had over their characters... and it does so in the most ridiculous way possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A major disappointment,"I was expecting great things from this. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" has been lauded by the critics, but unfortunately it never lives up to its reputation. While Will Ferrell's performance is strong, the script suffers from a lack of true invention; its intriguing central premise is never fully exploited, instead becoming bogged down in the same old tired romantic comedy conventions. Ferrell's and Gyllenhaal's characters are so patently incompatible that their relationship never rings true. Dustin Hoffman plays another cookie cutter eccentric who's not nearly as interesting as the screenwriter thinks he is (see ""I Heart Huckabees"" for another example of this) and Emma Thompson's character is simply annoying, a stereotype of an ""important"" novelist who just comes across as maudlin and self-absorbed. Indeed, it is her character's voice over narration which robs this film of its credibility: she is supposed to be a novelist of major talent and importance, a writer whose work is the subject of academic study and fevered reverence; yet the language she uses in her narration is so full of trite clichés and amateurish idiom (she uses expressions like ""But little did he know"" and ""he found himself standing outside the building"") that anyone with even a passing interest in or knowledge of ""proper"" literature will find it laughable. The audience is asked to believe that she is Jane Austen when in fact she writes like a housewife who's taken one evening class in creative writing; a hugely irritating flaw which, for this viewer, almost rendered the film unwatchable. There are one or two striking visual moments and Ferrell's character is given a couple of funny lines, but on the whole this film is a major disappointment. It is as though, in attempting to give it a broader appeal, screenwriter Zach Helm has smoothed away all its rough edges. With an R rating and a good deal more imagination, it could have been truly innovative; instead it must go down as a wasted opportunity.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ferrell good in dramatic role; film is a true winner,"It's been said that when an comedic actor decides to take a turn at dramatic emoting, the results usually veer more toward the cloying, oversentimental than toward the sincere. (Think Bill Murray in The Razor's Edge, not two decades later in Lost in Translation.) And Will Ferrell, star of such wacky fun as Anchorman and Ricky Bobby, wouldn't at first glance seem to be the type of actor with the necessary range to carry a dramatic role. But Ferrell, miraculously pulls it off.Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS auditor who's, shall we say, fastidious. He has routines, you see, from the number of brushstrokes his teeth get to the number of steps he takes to get to his bus stop. A place for everything, and everything in its place. In short, the sort of punctual, detail-oriented soul that an entity such as the IRS love to have on its side.Everything's moving along smoothly for Harold, at least as much as it's moving at all. He lives a solitary life both in and out of work and has no dreams or ambitions. But everything changes when he's brushing his teeth one morning and hears a British woman's voice narrating his actions.Bearing in mind that Harold's well-ordered life could hardly stand even the slightest deviance, it's easy to see how he might completely wig out over this, and that's about what happens. The HR department wants to talk to him, and then he's shuffled over to an in-house doctor (Tom Hulce) and then finally to a college professor (Dustin Hoffman), who tries to figure out the identity of Harold's mysterious novelist through literary means.So now things aren't moving along smoothly, although they are moving along. Until Harold hears some ominous words in his head that suggest that he'll soon be killed off.In the hands of a comedic actor who lacks range, this would have been a maudlin, treacly pile of goo. But because Ferrell is so wonderfully understated, you instantly empathize with Harold. And that's no small feat, considering the wild implausibility of hearing someone's voice in your head; the movie ran the real risk of alienating its audience when it desperately needed it to identify with the main character.Another highlight is the sweet, caring relationship that develops between Harold and Gyllenhaal's character, Ana. Physically, they're an oddball couple - he's quite tall, she's quite not - and personality-wise the two actors seem kind of a mismatch. But although their characters suffer through some necessary awkwardness, the two actors are able to make their union believable and desirable. In other words, they look great together.As Kay Eiffel, the novelist in Harold's head, Emma Thompson brings a coffee-and-cigarettes nihilism to the role; she's supposed to kill Harold off, but she doesn't know quite how to do that; her publisher has sent her an assistant (the always solid Queen Latifah) to encourage things so Eiffel meets her deadline.Thanks to beautiful performances by Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal, an exceptional supporting cast, and a script that doesn't nosedive into oversentimentality but does sprinkle in some genuine laughs, Stranger than Fiction is an exuberant, charming film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Plod or plot?,"The gang of eight monstrous, giggling little girls at the back of the theater where I saw this film made me acutely aware of the delicacy of its pace, longish silences and deadpan mood. That having been said, I admit to liking the story and the execution of a subtle, mind-bending plot. My viewing companion said, ""It was like having a novel read to you."" He really liked it...more than I did. Emma Thompson ran through her range from haggard neurotic to supercilious Brit. Queen Latifa did her usual limit-setting, hard-edged woman of humble beginnings. Dustin Hoffman seemed to be pacing out an extended cameo. Not much energy in his performance at all. Will Ferrel was impressive as the protagonist. It was a pleasant surprise to find out he really can act. Maggie Gyllenhaal was superb and delivered the best performance in the piece, I believe. If you like moody, thoughtful and slow-paced...go see this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awful Mess,"I watched this because it showed two landmark Draper and Kramer realty properties: Prairie Shores and Lake Meadows. They are photographed in the movie and grace the lakefront near 31st Street Beach & Marina. Yet they are not mentioned in location. Acting was awful. Storyline stupid. Will Ferrel is idiotic not funny, Dustin was boring and Emma scored A+ in disgusting. Queen Latifah and Maggie had little to work with but did their best. The scenery was more interesting than the movie. Waste of electricity and time this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger than everything,"This film is an incredible masterpiece, nothing like any other movie I'd ever seen before, or since. Surprisingly groundbreaking film pouring a bizarre twist on the idea of third person narrative.I was recommended this film by a friend and had no idea what to elect, this was the best way to see our, as i feel the trailer is too much a plot spoiler in this case.Definitely watch it, and watch it again... it's amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a revelation,"it sometimes so happens that one may come across a certain experience that causes him to have a stunning revelation. when that experience is a book or a movie or a song it is usually called a masterpiece. i'm glad to say i've watched a masterpiece today, it's called ""stranger than fiction"". a movie that is nothing short of an epic piece of art about life, death and the meaning of it all. sometimes while reading a book i would find myself compelled to turn the pages and skip ahead to a following part owing to a certain suspense situation or thrilling events. when that happens i almost always never skip ahead but rather go back to savor the writing technique that the author used to put me in such a state. with thriller movies it is different. i don't know why. maybe one does not relate to the fictional character owing to the fact that a novel character is more subjective and therefore a reader sometimes identifies with it more than the movie character. maybe it's the fact that thrillers are too often too superficial to be savored at all . or maybe even it's the fact that a good enough thriller has not been made yet. i don't know all i know is: i have not watched a movie before that simultaneously had these two characteristics; thrilling me to a point of needing to skip ahead, AND enticing me to savor the artful skill of producing the thrilling material. until today. that movie is great.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great script... ""I like the part about the guitars""","Every good movie necessarily has a good script. Great acting can overcome some weak scripts (ensemble in Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl - Johnny Depp/Geoffrey Rush were great so were Orlando Bloom and Keira Nightly - overcame what can be considered a weak script).However a great script can shine with competent actors. Christopher Nolan 'made his bones' this way (see the Following and Momento), and so did Charlie Kaufman (Human Nature, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).This movie may not be backed by a script quite that (Nolan/Kaufman) good, but the script shines through nonetheless. In the above paragraph, I am not referring to quality of acting in this picture. The cast was excellent so was the casting. Although all the actors have been in better form in other pictures (Will Farrell in Talladega Nights/Anchorman though some may say the comparison is apples and oranges considering this was a dramatic role for him, Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, Queen Latifa in Chicago and Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary, I have not seen the too much of Emma Thompson, but she was fine form too), but they gave the SCRIPT the justice it rightly deserved.The picture was funny, witty (especially with Dave, Harold's friend from work), sad, introspective sweet, and rocking in turns and while being each it was paramountly very very engaging.A strong solid 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Ferrell in something different and exciting.,"Wow! This film speaks volumes to me. I write this after my second viewing and I don't know why I haven't seen 'Stranger Than Fiction' sooner but maybe it makes it more special when you wait. I think I first heard of this film on IMDb while searching for films Will Ferrell is in. I love his comedies; the stupidity portrayed in films such as Anchorman, Old School, Elf and Zoolander (my favourites) are a joy to watch as they always put a smile on my face. I read an overview that Ferrell was playing it straight and had to take a look for myself.The film is funny but in a different way to Ferrell's previous encounters on-screen. The film is not full of memorable one-liners; instead the humour for me is derived from the situations Ferrell's character (Harold Crick) is placed in. Crick has a serious, deadpan personality and I think Ferrell nails it with a terrific performance. Ferrell is supported by an outstanding cast; Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman, who all have fantastic and memorable supporting characters. Extra credit must go to Emma Thompson, who does a brilliant job in depicting her character, and a lot of the humour stems from her character's relationship with Queen Latifah's portrayal.Praise to Zach Helm for writing such a great script, I will be watching closely for any new projects he is involved in. Marc Forster is a superb director; Finding Neverland is well worth a viewing and I can't wait for the new Bond film to arrive. Again I will mention Will Ferrell, for those who already know of his talents, I'm sure you'll appreciate it and for the few who don't think he can portray a serious character, I implore you to hold judgement and watch.Going back to my first remark...After the credits, I am left with a feeling of inspiration. I feel that I can achieve goals and conquer fears that stop me from doing things with my life that I know deep down, are what I should be doing. I think the themes portrayed in this film resonate with many people and I welcome everyone to spend under 2 hours of their life, rediscovering themselves. It is definitely a rewarding experience. This is what Films and Art in general are here for.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie,"I loved this movie! I think many people will have a hard time seeing Will Ferrell as a serious actor after he has done so many comedies... and often relied on childish, slapstick humor (and being naked). In this movie his performance is still funny, yet it is much more intelligent and subtle. The meaning of his life, life in general, and the life of Harold Crick (as the narrator's character in her latest novel ""Death and Taxes"") all run together in a way that intrigues me enough to want to see it again. If you liked Punch Drunk Love, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, you will probably enjoy Stranger Than Fiction. Do not go if you expect it to be anything like Anchorman or Old School!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Ferrell Beyond SNL and Talladega Nights,"I'd wanted to see this film for quite some time primarily because I'm an English major and any movie having to do with writers or writing automatically scores high in my book (""Throw Momma From the Train"" is still one of my favorite movies and I'll demolish with words anyone who tries to disagree with me) but also because the overall premise, from what the trailers let on, was original and quirky: Harold Crick, a boring everyman who works for the IRS, counts more things than should be counted, and lives a life defined only by the number of people he's audited, wakes up one day to find that his life is being narrated, and rather well at that, by a mysterious voice speaking in third-person omniscient that informs Harold indirectly that he's going to die soon. I didn't see it sooner because the friends who did see it said that it was a mediocre film, touting it with a stream of ""Yeah, it was okay""s. Well, my friends, who probably expected typical Ferrell fare, were horrendously wrong, because this movie goes above and beyond the call.""Stranger Than Fiction"" does everything right in a movie; the story is creative, with a no-one being haunted by a faceless narrator, and this movie unlike oh-so-many does NOT take an original premise and cock it all up by selling out to mainstream expectations. Cough cough, Hancock, cough cough. There's a love story involved, but it's well played out and realistic with a minimum of saccharine-drenched sappiness involved. In fact, the story is downright engrossing, because Will Ferrell takes the character of Harold Crick and makes him downright likable; the audience identifies immediately with him and grows to like him more as the character evolves. There's another thing this film has going for it; character arcs. The characters are all well-drawn people that we feel we know, from the gorgeous anarchist baker played to a tee byactress Maggie Gyllenhall to the eccentric-bordering-on-bonkers lit professor portrayed perfectly by Dustin Hoffman, to Crick himself. There's a lot to be said about Ferrell's performance here; it's not by any means his usual fare of frat-boy antics and over-the-top humor, which is why so many were disappointed. This is genuine acting, the portrayal of a real person in a real (if tossing weird) situation, with real, honest-to-god emotions, and it's here that W.F. shines as the brilliant actor that he is. The laughs arise from the characters naturally in sync with what's going on, and so do the tears.The story is impossible to describe with any kind of justice; it takes turns and brings in new depth, but we're there with it every step of the way. Every character plays a part in developing things; no one is present just for a joke. For those expecting an outright comedy, you're at the wrong door. For people expecting a quirky, cute comedy-romance, first of all, most of those films aren't really that good, and secondly this isn't one of those films. It's a rare treat; a Hollywood work with a stellar cast that's truly original, beautifully crafted, and almost flawlessly executed. Keep your eye out for the little things that make this film work, from Harold's blueprint-like heads-up display to repetitive appearances of certain characters to the expressions on the actors' faces when they come to a final crossroad with a lovable IRS agent's life in the balance. Eight out of ten stars, each one proudly earned.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An average man (Ferrell)  realizes that his life is being narrated by a British writer (Thompson),"I think it would be a lot harder to count out the things that I didn't like in this movie. It would probably be around...zero! I loved literally everything about this movie. Some things were a little awry, like the little boy and the older woman, who are always parts of Thompson's death scenes, but they all connect at the end. Ferrell gave a terrific performance and did something that (at least to me) was the most suttle performance of his to date. Maggie Gyllenhal did excellent as a rebellious young woman who owns a bakery and refuses to pay taxes on a count of she doesn't want the money to go to funding for wars. At first it seems to me that she is a hippie, and that's kind of what she is, but she if great and she gets great marks in my book. Thompson was also fabulous again and she gave an inspired role as a writer. Dustin Hoffman did great, but the life-guard scene with the naked men in the shower was a little pointless. BUT- I didn't think that it was a mark down for the overall rating of the movie. Queen Latifah did great with what little part she was given. I didn't enjoy how (once again) this movie made Thompson (who was the real main actress) take a back seat to Gyllenhal and Latifah (who were the supporting actresses). The movie had a suttle funniness which was very enjoyable, not to mention a thrilling end that made you even hold your breath. You'd hang on your seat, and sit back to laugh. It was a great movie, and I recommend it to all who like a good laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An intelligent mood film that begs the question...,"Why aren't there more films like this? I'll be up front, I am not a Will Ferrell fan. In fact I find his comic shtick on things to be over the top, totally ludicrous and thus not funny. And this may very well be why some people hated this movie. If you're expecting a Will Ferrell vehicle along the lines of ""Blades of Glory"" or ""Talladega Nights"", then you will find this film very disappointing.Others hate this film because they find the whole premise boring and all I can say to this is I believe this type of movie calls for the viewer to be in a certain type of mood. And this is where the film can cause a bit of confusion; it's not really a romantic comedy, it's not really a silly comedy, it's not an out-and-out drama, it's definitely not an action flick. Because it doesn't fall into a specific category, people unsure whether to watch this film may create preconceived ideas which ultimately result in them not enjoying it because it wasn't what they expected (i.e. their mood was for a specific type of flick and ""Stranger than fiction"" didn't fit into that category).It's also a film that I strongly recommend you watch without interruptions. If your attention is not firmly fixed on the subtleties and intricacies of the character development and plot then you'll lose the overall effect of what this film tries to deliver. And what this film does deliver in spades (if you let it) is the idea that no matter how alone you might feel, you can find love. And bravery, hope and courage can come from the most unexpected of places.I saw this movie without any idea of what it was going to be like. I found it to be the surprise film of the year for me. The characters are all colourful and have layers of depth that come forth the longer the film goes on. But really the story is where it takes it from a 7 or 8 to a 9 out of 10. I'm all for the ""brainless"" movie every now and then; I'm a big fan of the action genre and enjoy the ""there's no need to think through this movie""-kind of flick. But during a time when box office success seems to mean ""more special effects"" less ""substance"", it's wonderful to see a movie that not only has a bit of thought in it but also a heap of substance.Class performances all round - Ferrell as Harold Crick is a revelation, Maggie Gyllenhaal (marvelous as usual), Dustin Hoffman (underrated humorous turn) and Emma Thompson (can drain drama out of a stone) are all casted wonderfully. And lest we forget I would like to make a special mention to the undisputed hero of the film, I won't actually identify this character as it would spoil the film but I will say Harold Crick's sidekick brought a smile to my face by movie credits end.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Liberal crap,"This is one of those liberal pretentious movies. You know, like Wes Anderson movies. The ones that seem think they are oh so clever but aren't. The ones that liberals certainly rated higher than conservatives.The first 20 minutes or so did pull me in. It had a good premise. But that was it. It kept on going on and on and on. It would have been a good 30 minute Twilight Zone episode...maybe 60 minutes at the most. Absolute most. It just dragged on and went nowhere.I guess I have to make 10 lines of text to get this review published. That is what this movie felt like.

Amazing Film!,"One of the most creative / intelligent original story-lines I've ever seen. Great casting too, Will Ferrell is excellent as are those by; Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Gyllenhaal. It's hard to believe this film didn't receive any Academy Award nominations, it certainly should have in my opinion. Especially since ""The Departed"" won for best movie of the year - that movie was completely over-rated in my opinion.The alternative music score is great as well. I hadn't heard of the band Spoon and they are listed as one of the main bands that contributed to the soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stranger Than Fiction - In a word, EXCELLENT","I ""watched a book"" today and the sounds and visuals drenched me to the point of satisfaction like no book has ever done. Yes I mean to say it just that way. I have not seen many movies any better than this one. And I have only seen one movie that kept my attention in the way ""Stranger Than Fiction"" did. Coincidentally, or by design, that movie, ""Stay"" was also directed by Marc Forster. As a result, I guarantee I will not miss a single Marc Forster movie no matter what diversion may attempt to block me. His direction was sheer genius. I truly believe that Forster deserves an Oscar for this movie (he really deserved it for Stay too).This may scare some people away but I hope not. Book-readers should be encouraged, though. Watching this movie was exactly like sitting down in your favorite chair in an atmosphere you choose, with a book you cannot put down. I have not read a good book in a very long time and I suppose it is mostly because I do not feel I have time to read a book. But after watching this movie, I felt like I soaked in everything just like you do with a good book. I felt like I was part of this remarkable experience and not the client in a sales job.Will Ferrell was remarkable! I have not been a great fan of his and always thought he should have stayed with Saturday Night Live. But his performance takes him out of the scatterbrain slapstick comic mold. He was so charming in this movie, I hope he can refrain from going back to silly, nonsensical, nonstop slapstick. But never fear, he was still comical when it was required and beautifully so.Maggie Gyllenhaal was seductive, beautiful and totally enchanting. As the person everyone loved she proved to be just that. She easily had the ""Meg Ryan innocent young woman with a delicious smile"" appeal but was able to also exhibit the kind of power hard headed people have when they make up their minds to hate someone.Queen Latifah added her charm as a mysterious, dedicated and determined beauty who made her presence known but kept you in the dark with her performance.Dustin Hoffman provided everything that only he can. Subtlety was a total stranger to this direct, arrogant, yet totally charming and strange professor. I didn't mention funny did I? He was that, too.After all is said and done, no performance was as satisfying as Emma Thompson's. She also should be up for an Oscar nomination. The characterizations, mannerisms, timing and expressions were a professional's dream come true  perfect, without flaw.Zach Helm should not be left out. He wrote such a strange and certainly satisfying story that everyone helped to make a masterpiece which I will see again and again. I might even start reading again because of him.If you are a book-reader who believes movies are a waste of time or a movie goer who cannot stand to sit and read a book, do not miss this magical work of art. You will find yourself stunned.This, in all its glory, gets a perfect 10 from me!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Living through your life's narration,"Will Farrell plays it straight (no goofy stuff) as a guy who live a normal, boring, prescribed life and has a knack for numbers. He is set in a numbers routine: teeth-brushes, walk to the bus, and times he goes to bed and wakes up, among other things. As an IRS agent, his way with numbers has given him job security. When he begins to notice a voice in his head narrating his every move and thought, then his life starts to change.The change also involves his attraction to a ""hippie baker"" he is in the process of auditing. They seem to be complete opposites, yet he knows from the moment he meets her that he ""wants her"". One of the better aspects of this film is the chemistry between Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhall, and it may not be too long when they are paired again for a romantic comedy. She was a bright spot in the movie.StF is not a comedy, but rather a drama with some comedy and romance thrown in. It's a little different than the typical Hollywood fare, which appeals to me, and the movie challenges you to think sometimes, which is more than just amusement. I can also see some theology/faith issues people can use from the movie. Besides the ""what am I here for and is my life worth anything"" question, you also have the question of how you get direction in life.Does God speak to you? Is your life script already written and you're just working through the narration? I have not watched any Ferrell films besides ""Elf"", but if he can continue getting work like this he could have a long and strong career. He seems to slip into dramatic roles much better than his current contemporaries (Sandler, Carrey), but time will tell if he can keep the momentum.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction,"We watched this movie for English class and I thought it would be one of those stupid movies that your teacher makes you watch, but it wasn't. I really enjoyed it because it makes you think in a whole different way. I like how they show all the different people's lives separately and then intertwine them all at the end in one single event. The concept behind the whole movie was so intricate, yet simple. It just goes to show the complicated aspects of our everyday lives. We are so reliant on other things, like technology, in our everyday lives like Harold and his watch. Fiction sometimes becomes reality and I loved the way this movie portrayed that so well. This is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This is a very good, enjoyable and thought-provoking movie which reveals that Will Ferrell can act beyond a strictly comedic role.","I really liked the movie. Will F. and Maggie G. were outstanding, and actually had chemistry between them. The movie flowed well and the script was well-written. My only ""neutral"" comment (""negative"" would be too harsh) is that Dustin Hoffman did the best he could in regard to an explanation or two in the plot which could have been more succinctly defined and explained. It is certainly a ""feel good"" movie, but with more substance. The talent of character actors featured is most impressive. I do not remember the initial release of ""Stranger Than Fiction"". I hope the movie was promoted well; ""Stranger Than Fiction"" would have deserved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stranger Than Fiction,"Will Ferrell, like many a comedian before him, obviously wanted to show he could do more than just clown about, and so made this quietly amusing 'Truman Show' inspired film.And it's a nice vehicle for him, he plays the role well, holding his own when surrounded by a top class supporting cast.However, this film didn't do a lot for me, I wouldn't rush to see it again.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stranger than fiction, but much better than average","Marc Forster's latest film maybe stranger than fiction, but thankfully it's also much better than the average movie playing at your local theater, well almost. It's seems that ever since Scorsese's Departed just about every week there's been a new movie that's actually really good and finally there seems to be a reason to keep returning to the movies. Hey, they're finally making some good stuff for a change! In Stranger than Fiction Will Ferrell plays a calm and orderly IRS auditor named Harold Crick; a man who lives for his job, day in and day out. Harold seemingly has one friend at work, Dave (played by Tony Hale, formerly of TV's Arrested Development), no private relationships and no personal life what-so-ever, and his entire existence is about getting up and going to and from work. Harold is stuck in a never-ending routine that is disturbed one morning while brushing his teeth. While counting the number of brush strokes Harold begins to hear a strange woman's voice narrating the things he's doing as he's doing them. The voice is that of Kay Eiffel, a depressed, chain smoking and very talented author whose come down with a serious case of writer's block. When Harold discovers that Kay's novels are quite famous for their tragic endings, where the hero always dies, he seeks the help of literary professor Jules Hibert, played by the always entertaining Dustin Hoffman, to help get to the bottom of Harold's problem.Two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gives a wonderfully distressed performance as the author that shakes up Harold's life, and Queen Latifah plays an assistant brought in to help Kay break through her writer's block and get back to finishing her new novel. Harold is driven crazy by the voice of the narrator in his head, and is heart is aching for a feisty young woman named Ana, played with a free and wild spirit by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who he's assigned to audit for failing to pay all her taxes as a way of sticking' it to the government. As Harold comes closer and closer to his demise he falls in love with Ana and discovers how sweet life can be with just a few cookies and a glass of milk. Life can be so sweet; we just have to go after it, each and every day. But time is running out for Harold and he is desperately trying to track down this mysterious author while there's still time to stop her from finishing her novel.Director Marc Forster, whose last films included last year's Stay and the imaginative Finding Neverland has crafted a wonderfully entertaining and equally smart film with some great performances from one of the best ensemble casts this year, right next to Little Miss Sunshine. Will Ferrell gives what is easily his best performance of his career, and his most sincerely enjoyable since Elf. Stranger than Fiction does for Will Ferrell what Eternal Sunshine did for Jim Carrey; it's just the right material for the right actor, and I'd love to see Farrell do more roles like this one and lay off the Anchorman kind of stuff for awhile and give him some room to grow as an actor. I don't know what its Oscar chances are, but given the films that have already come out this fall in my book all bets are off; expect a very close and interesting Oscar race.Stranger than Fiction is part comedy, part drama and part romance; there's a little bit of something for everyone. I found myself getting so wrapped up in the film's premise and constantly thinking to myself; ""How is this all going to come together in the end?"" so much so I was never bored for a single moment and not only was I fascinated with it's ideas, but I was also quite touched emotionally with it's engaging performances. I really enjoyed this movie, and more importantly its message. Yes, on the surface Stranger than Fiction may look like a Charlie Kaufman-esquire psycho-babble ""weird $hit happens"" movie in the vein of Being John Malkovich or Adaptation, but beneath it all there's something that those films didn't quite have  a beating heart, without all the cynicism.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A compelling collision of fiction and reality ensues.,"If you're looking for a ""Will Ferrell comedy"" where he runs around acting stupid, screaming at the top of his lungs, and basically annoying the (Fergie's Music) out of me then you need to keep on lookin'. What I'm about to say will soon become a cliché, but this is a different role for Ferrell, and I happen to think that's a good thing.Is ""subduedness"" a word? If so then that's what Ferrell brings to Harold Crick. *pulls out the dictionary* Cool, it is a real word! Just a slightly awkward one. Fine, we'll say Ferrell underplays this just enough to make Harold the sweet, innocent hero that he is required to be for us to cheer for him to find that alternate ending. Better?Harold seems like a tough guy not to like. Until you find out he's a tax man. Plus, he's a little obsessive. He counts the strokes when he's brushing his teeth. He knows the exact number of steps he must take to reach the bus every morning. He takes a 45.7-minute lunch break and a 4.3-minute coffee break. Everything is a routine, and he relies on his wristwatch to keep him on track.Contrast that with the woman he's sent to audit - the tax-evadin', anarchy-lovin' bakery owner Ana Pascal (played by the extremely personable Maggie Gyllenhaal). It's a match made seemingly, well, not in Heaven, so when they start to have feelings for each other you really don't expect to buy it. But you know what? It works! The romance is simple and subtle, and surprisingly believable.But the meat of the story, the ol' sauce on the steak as grandpa used to say, revolves around Harold's efforts to figure out from whence the voice in his head is coming. Whereas I'm about to initiate some efforts to find out why I just used ""from whence."" Harold really needs to figure out what to do once he hears her talk about his death. Is his life a comedy or a tragedy? Can he change his fate, or should he resign himself to accepting what appears to be inevitable?I can hear you now (you crazy voice in my head!) - how do you take a story about a real-life man who slowly learns his life is some weird product of fiction and make it work? How do you deliver a satisfying ending to such a perplexing structure? Well, I had the same questions. I didn't know if it'd pull it off, but it does, and all I can say, without giving too much away, is the proof is in the viewing.A viewing experience that is unique in how it takes so many elements of different genres and figures out how to make them work together. There are laughs, there's drama, there's fantasy, and as I mentioned earlier, there's a little romance as well. In fact...*puts down man card*Ferrell gives Gyllenhaal a gift that inspired the most amount of ""awwwwws"" from the audience that I've heard at a movie this year. I have to admit, it really is a sweet moment.*picks up man card*I liked the structure of the story, and Emma Thompson's narration is handled in such a way that it adds a little mystery and keeps you guessing how the story will wrap. I was even impressed with some of the visuals in the film, specifically the manifestations of the numerical analyses in Harold's mind.The first 2/3rds of the movie set everything up so well that I was really scared of a disappointing payoff. I wasn't necessarily rooting for a ""happy"" ending; I simply wanted a satisfying one. If it were true that Harold must die for the book to be Emma's masterpiece, then sell me on it. However, if Emma could figure out an alternate ending, then sell me on that.As always, I won't reveal what happens. I recommend you watch it and find out on your own. So I'll just sum up my final opinion this way - sold.THE GISTYou might be disappointed if you want another over-the-top Will Ferrell comedy. However, those of you in the mood for a less annoying side of Ferrell, a mix of drama and comedy, and something a little different and inspiring should consider giving Stranger than Fiction a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Exceptional film - small scale yet huge concept, brilliantly done.","The trailer is truly misleading. This film is much more leftfield and original than you'd expect from watching the trailer and would definitely be one the films that I've most enjoyed watching.I like ""Anchorman"" Will Ferrel, but in this he's in another league altogether. Bouncing off the rest of the cast - Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are on particularly fine form and perfect foils for the main character - he climbs to a new level as an actor.As a production it is pretty much spot on. The use of Wreckless Eric in the soundtrack was genius. I'm not a fan of either slush or explicit sex in films, aesthetically, but in this the play between Ferrel and Maggie Gyllenhaal really made me smile. It is slick, but feels a little bit indie, as if there were a lot of people who had a passion to make this movie.If you enjoyed ""Being John Malkovitch"" then I really recommend you check this title out. It's suitable for a wide range of viewers and has baking and guitars, so great for guys and chicks too! That's Not a sexist comment, but one that will make more sense when you see the movie, trust me...",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Literature meets Life,"The narrator is a very important component of literature. In order for a story to be told, there has to be someone telling it. It can be an outsider, the person involved, or someone known only as ""The Narrator"". Life, however, doesn't have a narrator. People have the power of free will.For Harold Crick, life isn't as care free. His life is being told to him. In Marc Forster's film Stranger Than Fiction, Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent, has lived his life in solitude, to the tick of his wristwatch. For no apparent reason, on what seemed to be an ordinary Wednesday morning, Crick can hear a woman narrating his life on while he brushes his teeth.This voice that only Crick can hear is of acclaimed writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Eiffel hasn't published a book in nearly a decade. Her publisher sends Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to her rid her of ""writer's block"". All of Eiffel's troubles rest on one predicament: how to kill Harold Crick.It seems like Crick is just going to have to deal with this ""voice"" when all of a sudden while waiting at the bus stop, the voice tells Crick of his ""imminent death"". When looking for help, he is placed in the lap of literature theorist Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Like everyone else, Hilbert believes that Crick is crazy, but is willing to give his literary advice to Crick to see whether or not that his life is a comedy or a tragedy. In other words, will Crick end up dying or ""getting hitched""? To make things more complicated, Crick must audit an anarchistic baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whom he becomes attracted to. She becomes his obsession and a way of finding out whether or not his life will end up being a comedy or a tragedy.Director Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) along with up and coming writer Zack Helm deliver a heartfelt film. The film itself looks really nice. Crick's life is surrounded by routine and he sees and does things that a normal person wouldn't. Forster's makes his world look like it is filled with diagrams and timers like a futuristic touch screen. Slow motion shots and fantastic dream sequences make this a visual feast.The cast is perfect. Ferrell's performance is original compared to his other characters in Old School and Elf. His timing is perfect and his delivery, delightful. This could be his Lost in Translation. Along with Ferrell is Hoffman, who together deliver some of the funniest dialogues on film. The cagey veteran Hoffman has such a wide range in his acting from The Graduate to Rain Man, and it shows. He is always spicing up the screen with his characters.The leading ladies deliver superb performances. Thompson is paranoid and jittery, perfect for the troubled author. Also a veteran actress, Thompson's composure and presence gives more substance to the film. Gyllenhaal's ""fight the power"" attitude along with her tattoo's make her the perfect love interest for Ferrell. She can be so nasty and still be desirable. Latifah's performance, although a minor role, is a step back in the right direction for the Oscar nominated actress (Chicago).All it needed was a great script. Helm's fresh style of writing is a breathe of fresh for the screen. The story itself is very original and exemplifies his unique way of thinking. The future is bright for Helm.There is a lot of buzz surrounding the film. The Oscar season is just beginning with many highly anticipated releases coming up. Stranger Than Fiction is a hopeful at the 2007 Academy Awards in several categories. With some many variables not yet accounted for, it is too early to decide.There are laughs across the entire spectrum of comedy from the blatantly funny to the more complex jokes. There are even some heavy moral issues that provoke some thinking for the audience. Stranger Than Fiction is guaranteed to strike a cord.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Movie I have seen all year!!!,"What a great movie! The cast was amazing. Will Ferrel has outdone himself. The music, use of color and visual images is perfect. The best part of all is the screenplay. It is hard to believe that a person as young as Zach Helm has the insight and awareness to know so much about life. The screenplay is brilliant and surely is Oscar worthy. The directing is great too. The magic of ""Neverland"" can be seen throughout the film. The experience of watching this film is very moving and anyone can relate to the main character. It is a great tale of the evolution of life. For anyone searching for the answers to the meaning of events in their lives this movie is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"this movie may sound like the average film of the day, but when you actlually look into it...","Directed by Marc Foster, starring Will Ferrall, Emma Thompson, an Dustin Hoffman, the story circles Harold Crick, an I.R.S agent, and middle aged bachelor whose life is nothing but routine, ignorance and counting every step his daily routine, suddenly realizes that he being narrated by some invisible force, and soon discovers that he is about to die, and his life changes completely...
Will Ferrell strikes again with a great performance as the main character, and so does the rest of the cast, Emma Thompson, playing Karen Eiffel, who is the unseen force or the writer that narrates Harold Crick, show once again that she is capable of doing a marvelous performance. The cinematography is great and story is very creative and imaginative and very gripping and has the ending more than just satisfying.
The plot may sound kind of crazy, and may seem like just another average film of the day, but with the acting of Emma Thompson and the magic of Will Ferrell, this film is perfect for a nice and relaxing Sunday Afternoon or evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Ferrell's best movie,"I always thought Step-Brothers was Will Ferrell's best movie but boy was I wrong. It was very humorous with a nice touch of romance and a ton of drama! I had not heard of this movie actually until just a few weeks ago and was insure whether or not to watch it but I'm very pleased to say that I give it two thumbs up. I was very moved by this movie and it got me thinking, what if your life was like a book. Your fate being controlled by a writer who knows nothing about you, or even the fact that you are a real person. A truly original film that really draws you in from the beginning and keep you laughing and in a great mood. It has a star-studded cast and great all around acting a definitely worth the watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A surprisingly thoughtful, affectionate movie","I have often been told that you should never base your review of a movie on your initial screening of it. First of all, since you do not necessarily know what is going to happen next, you tend to overlook certain nuances simply because you are following the story or trying to figure out what is going to happen next. For the second and subsequent viewings, you are able to notice more in different areas because you aren't so focused; you might even see something you missed on the first go around.Sadly, I have only watched this movie once; however, I can confidently give this an 8 / 10 rating because it had a profound effect on me while watching. Afterwards, I thought about it for quite awhile. I even thought about buying a guitar because I always wanted to play a musical instrument.To me, this movie is about discovering yourself and making a choice to actually 'live' your life as opposed to only being a part of it. The movie's main character, Harold Crick, lives a mundane and structured existence, one in which his everyday actions are planned and timed to the very second. He is a lonely and bored accountant for the IRS who doesn't really know how lonely and boring his life actually is. Everything changes, however, when he begins to hear a voice in his head paraphrasing and describing his actions and thoughts. His annoyance with the voice turns to fear when the voice mentions that he will soon die. Harold seeks out the help of a local college professor played by Dustin Hoffmann to figure out who it is that is authoring his life. The struggles continue as Harold and the professor try to discover who the author is and what kind of story he is actually in. Contributing to the stresses are several life-changing experiences including meeting a very difficult audit case in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal.I thought Will Ferrell was great in this movie. He really had to play a different part from every other movie he has been in. This was not a slapstick comedy by any means; this is a very thoughtful and affectionate movie about a person discovering himself and what his purpose in life is.The voice overs by the 'author' are eloquent and the 'help' provided by Hoffman's character is funny but acceptable. Sure, there is a certain amount of disbelief that has to be given for this movie to even exist, but the premise is original and is executed perfectly. I felt for Harold's character and felt myself hoping for positive resolutions in his life.The story, acting, and originality carry this movie very far. I am really glad I was able to watch it finally and hope that it stands up after the second viewing. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Smart, Charming, and Touching Film with a surprisingly Literary Experience","First of all, don't go expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy of the typical Will Ferrell fashion. If you see this film with an open and perceptive mind, you will get to enjoy incredibly clever script and some terrific performances by all involved. Will is at his best here, as he plays Harold Crick with such nuanced sincerity it really makes the film. Without creating a complex and ultimately genuine character, the film would have not succeeded, and Ferrell deserves much recognition for that. In fact, not a single ounce of Ferrell's trademark shtick ever appears in this film, and it's surprising. And refreshing.Zach Helm, the writer, also needs to be commended for crafting a screenplay that gives viewers the experience of reading a novel, and yet also somehow manages to be self-aware. There are loads of little details in the film that it will probably take multiple viewings to appreciate them all. Of course, the director expertly ties it all together and is able to even add a great visual style with creative angles and effects to add another layer to an already solid film. It's just a shame that the DVD transfer is terribly sub-par.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Imitation of another work,"If ever the discrepancy between real writing and screen writing were still moot this film makes it apparent, in a script which contrives to appear quirky, self-reflective, and because it is non naturalistic, contemporary, even pushing boundaries of narrative form in film.While that may seem true to anyone who last read a book prescribed by their high school teacher, this movie is a derivative and arch work that has poached Borges, or Sterne, among others, for its motive and conceits and consequently the finished work is completely pedestrian.The banality is compounded by a layer of trite homily suitable to a youthful, if inexperienced audience, about leading an authentic life. This element might have come from the counterculture but it is then reflected through bland corporate platitudes that have the effect of trans fats on the mind.The shortcomings aside the director has done well, as has the editor, to realize the result. Likewise the actors manage quite well with the material they have, although it becomes more and more strained.How this stale, hack, script ever saw production, let alone was lauded with awards, should be a cause for some soul-searching by all concerned.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The bus shot,"At first I was like, greaaaat (sarcastic), Will Ferrell. A stupid slapstick comedy. But, I was wrong. It's actually a well thought out look at a writer who's character may or may not be real (I can't say anymore without it being a spoiler). The actors were great (even Ferrell) and the story was great and shooting style was awesome. There's a great shot on a bus - look for it. There's this kind of sub-genre of (very few) films that dabble into the writers world really manipulate reality. This one is high of that list.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Read it again.,"I truly loved this film. I went in with uncertainty, because of the relatively lightweight parts Will Ferrell has had before, and left feeling very good about the world. It blends fiction and the love of fiction better than any other film I can think of.The basic concept of the film is obvious in the previews: the main character who discovers that he is a character in someone else's book. OK, clever, maybe promising, but could be silly. It wasn't, not for a moment. What is remarkable is how unflinchingly and at the same time tenderly the writing, directing, and acting pursue the ramifications of this simple premise. The elements of love story, the comedy, and the tragedy are not separate aspects of the film; they all relate in important and often subtle ways to this central premise.One remarkable aspect is the literary quality. Movies about books are rarely satisfactory to people who love books, and here, the relationship was crucial. The narrative from Karen Eiffel's (Emma Thompson's) book in the works, her own personality, and Professor Hilbert's commentary thoroughly coincide. I have never before seen literature, as such, handled in a movie so convincingly. I could easily believe in Eiffel as a serious, intelligent, introspective author, a master of literary craft; I could fully understand Professor Hilbert's (Dustin Hoffman's) reaction after reading it; I could easily believe that I'd want to read more of her books.The weakest part (in my subjective view) was the very last scene: not so much the ending plot, but the narrative. For me, that took a bit of the edge off the literary merit. On the other hand, the scene in which Crick and Eiffel finally make contact with each other could so easily have fallen flat; instead it was one of the most perfectly crafted moments I have seen in a long time.Note added 2014: After six years this is still one of my favorites ever; every little aspect is just right, and it occurs to me to mention that the relative weakness of the ending is completely appropriate to the story. Those who have seen it will understand why.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely Wonderful,"It has been awhile since I was able to watch an entire movie, engrossed in the story, the characters, and the mood, without being distracted by something that reminded me it was just a movie. The photography, the acting, the music, the screenplay...everything was in sync. This was a moving ride, excellently played by Ferrell, Hoffman, Thompson and Gyllenhaal. Will Ferrell has proved to me that he can carry drama, heavy and light hearted, with grace. Even the more minor characters added depth to the story. Queen Latifa was firm and yet a tender addition to Emma Thompson's portrayal of the very anxious and a bit disturbed author. I could not recommend this any stronger.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What's the hype?,"Maybe it's a high at its time, but it definitely doesn't stand against time. This whole obsession with writer's block in movies seems so pretentious and a little annoying.

The white professor has to be eccentric knowledgeable and arrogantly wise.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Movie Everyone Should See,"Very few things these days make a point of trying to get us to think, about things we already know, ideas we haven't considered, or anything, really. I admit I like to watch mindless television that has no goal other than to make us laugh, and there is plenty of that out there. That's precisely why I love movies like Stranger than Fiction; it makes you think.The film is centered around Harold Crick, a lonely man who works for the IRS. Through a series of events, he finds that his life may be more interesting then he thought; he seems to be the subject of someone's book. Throughout the entirety of the story, we feel for Harold in many ways, ranging from cynical humor to sadness, and we really feel like we know exactly how Harold himself feels. The casting in the movie is very well done. We are shown that Will Ferrel is a very good actor. I'm used to seeing him in silly comedy shows and movies, but I must say, his performance in Stranger than Fiction is his best I've ever seen.If you're in the mood for something different, or for something that you walk away from with a satisfied feeling, then give Stranger than Fiction a try. I'm glad I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
poetry.,"Stranger than Fiction is a 2006 dramedy film directed by Marc Forster, also known for directing films such as Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner, and the upcoming Quantum of Solace. It is written by Zach Helm. It stars the extra-ordinary talent of Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah.As the narrative states early on in the film, Will Ferrell's character, Harold Crick, is all about numbers; and this story, is about him and his wristwatch. The weird intervenes when Harold starts hearing the voice of the narrator in his head, narrating his every move. All this, unknown to the narrator herself. The concept is taken from Miguel de Unamuno's Spanish novel, Niebla. However, Zach Helm's screenplay is extremely well written, perhaps worthy of much more praise than it got. There are numerous double-meaning references in the film which one would probably miss at first viewing. Stranger than Fiction is a film which demands numerous viewings to spot out any flaws. The film is so perfectly made than one could often find oneself looking for flaws in it, which aren't there at all.Will Ferrell has never been better. His role as the suddenly frustrated man who many think has gone nuts because of the intervention of that voice in his head, is brilliant. Then there are Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman, who seem to have been miscast, but a few seconds into their roles, the roles seem made for them. They own their characters. Like I said before, everything in this film seems too perfect, and also, too simple. There is also a very cute, nice chemistry between Ferrell and co-star Maggie Gyllenhaal. Every one of the characters seem to share a beautiful chemistry between them.Stranger than Fiction lies in the league of films like The Truman Show, Fincher's Zodiac; all amazing in their own way, but simply not for everyone. Hence their underrated-ness. This, remember, is a story about a man named Harold Crick, and his wristwatch.8.5/10. Loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ferrell can act !,"It's true ladies and gentleman Ferrell can act!!! I'm sure most of you know Ferrell from movies like Old School ,Anchorman and many other comedies as his periodic apparition in Wedding Crashers and you have categorized him as a cheap comedy actor but please watch this movie and change your opinion because he gives an awesome performance in Stranger Than Fiction,in the same way that Jim Carrey has proved his acting skills in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,proving he can do an awesome job in drama and not only in comedies Ferrell proved his in Stranger Than Fiction(i predict and Oscar or at least a nominalization for Ferrell in an year or two if he keeps this up). As its name states Stranger Than Fiction is a fictional movie but it also presents a very cute love story between Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal(who does an awesome job herself in this movie).Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah also play in this movie,doing a very good job. If you haven't seen it already i suggest you get it because it's a very good and entertaining movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Premise and Likable Characters,"A very creative premise about an IRS accountant slowly realizing he's a fictional character in an author's novel. The meta-textural themes are very thought provoking and give a great deal of insight on deconstructing fictional literature and how it often relates to how we can find meaning in our everyday lives. Will Ferrell gives a surprisingly mature and restrained performance, with enough humor seeping through his sympathetic character to make this a bittersweet performance. Dustin Hoffman is also terrific as the passionately blunt literature professor who guides Will Ferrell through his meta-textual existential crisis. Emma Thompson is a great deal of fun to watch as the eccentric author, whose eccentric mannerisms and unaware narration of her character's life is a joy to watch. While the pacing can be a bit slow at times and the romance is a tad rushed (albeit in a satirical way), the stylish presentation and intriguing unfolding narrative more than make up for this. Definitely an underrated gem in Will Ferrell's filmography.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
remarkable,"This was quite a change of pace for Will Ferrell. While he will always be remembered mostly as a comic actor, this film proves he can handle a dramatic role as well. The story was certainly unique-a man all of a sudden hears a voice narrating his life and every action and soon finds that it is a writer putting together a book about it. He soon learns that she is going to do something drastic and tries to prevent it. I found underlying themes in the film such as appreciating life, not taking anything for granted, and being aware of your surroundings. In that sense it was a little bit like the Queen Latifah film ""Last Holiday."" Coincidentally, she is also in this movie. Will Ferrell was excellent in the film. It had a good cast, which worked really well together. Not just Ferrell and Queen Latifah, but Dustin Hoffman, Linda Hunt, and Emma Thompson. Everything in the movie was good. I really liked it, and I guarantee you will too.*** 1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliance on many levels,"You might want to see this movie because of the story, it unique development. You might want to see it because the story inside the story has a wonderful message: ""This is my life - Absolutely. So make it the one you always wanted.""I personally love this movie for the reason that every actor gave his very best. Emma Thomson is eloquent as a author should be, while as a narrator she paraphrases every meaning in every carefully chosen word ... it's wonderful. At the same time is Dustin Hoffman as Literature professor eloquent, yet more theoretical and therefor harder towards the real world. While WIll Ferrell gave up is typical funny act and dived into the gray world of his IRS agent.You should definitively not watch this film because you expect an Will Ferrell movie.So finally I think the reason why this movie got 7.9 Stars ""only"" is that there is simple too much in it. You are not sure what to enjoy and watch when you watch it the first time. So instead of watching it like a normal movie I watched this one multiple times enjoying it's too perfect being.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Voices in your head narrating every move you make.,"Imagine if you were the subject of a David Attenborough documentary for alien visitors! Your mundane activities, described in details you've never really noticed before, or hadn't heard it expressed in that manner, narrated in ones head. Like a mental illness, but much more fictitious.A role that puts the goofy comedy styling of Will Farrell in a secured safe while he brings his best performance, in my opinion. A nuanced and subdued representation of an everyday, shy accountant haunted by a future he both desires and fears: a tense battle to stop the inevitable passing of time. And more.It's a film that you should see with as little information as possible. Just know it was good enough for Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strangely Addicting,"Will Farrell (Harold Crick) stars as an IRS auditor in this fantasy movie. He lives an extremely boring life and doesn't seem to care much about anything. But everything changes on a particular Wednesday. Harold starts hearing an unbridled voice and the voice appears to be narrating his life. The voice also knows exactly what Harold is thinking. Harold is confused the first time he hears the voice because he doesn't know what's going on. He thinks he's becoming insane. He thinks his toothbrush is telling him everything.

Stranger Than Fiction is strangely addicting. It's a must see!!!!1",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much food for thought even as it entertains,"This film is a pleasant watch with more to chew on than first meets the eye.First, it moves at a brisk and engaging pace, alternating funny moments with moments of pathos. Several of the performances are excellent, including (as one would expect) Dustin Hoffman's, but also (perhaps surprisingly) Will Ferrell's. Ferrell is terrific in this role, understatedly funny when he needs to be, but also perfectly inhabiting the inhibited, overly earnest main character.But what sets this film apart is the food for thought. In case you don't know the premise, Will Ferrell pays Harold Crick, a character in a novel being written by Emma Thompson's character. We follow along with Harold's world as though it exists in reality, and something causes Harold to start hearing the author's voice narrating his life. At first he just finds this irritating, but at a certain point he hears her reference his impending demise, and then his problem becomes urgent: how to find and persuade his creator not to kill him off.The ideas in play here could easily fill a ponderous philosophy/metaphysics seminar, but fortunately the film gives them a light, unpretentious treatment. It's left to us to muse on them. Whether you believe in God, or whether you think our consciousness is nothing more than an illusory byproduct of a set of chemical reactions, you may have contemplated what it really means to have free will, if forces out there made us, and if we are fated to function only as we are designed. When Harold thinks he's going to be killed off, he faces the problem: can he do anything about it? Can he stop it? Can he delay it? If he can't delay it, how should he live? And of course, we all face similar choices in real life. Most of us don't know when or how we're going to die, but we know that we will. We thus face similar choices to Harold, as to how much emphasis to place on trying to affect the inevitable, vs just making the most of the time we have.The film also plays with similar ideas from the author's point of view. It reminded me a little of the Borges story Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, where the characters invent an imaginary planet with its own physical properties, and ultimately not only does information about that planet start to turn up in encyclopedias and such, but objects from it begin to appear in the characters' ""real"" world. Similarly, Harold becomes literally real at some point to Emma Thompson's character. And it's worth reflecting on what it means for a character to be fictional. Even if a fictional character is only an idea, ideas are nevertheless real. A mathematical theorem is real even though it has no physical existence. Is Hamlet less real in our world, because Hamlet was an invention of Shakespeare, than is my own blood ancestor who lived in Shakespeare's time? Past a certain point, all we know about any person, living or fictional, is how someone else depicts them. Is it wrong, then, for Emma Thompson to begin to care about Harold Crick?This closely relates to another interesting question - the relationship of art to empathy. What if art is served by a character's demise? Does it follow from this that we should hope that the character dies? Different people can feel differently about this. Not only several characters in the movie, but several imdb reviewers of the movie, believe that sentimental attachment to the life of a character must give way to the demands of art. But is that necessarily so? When we read or watch a story about someone we care about, don't we often want them to have a happy ending even if that makes the film a little cornier? Is that necessarily wrong, or is it testimony to the power of art, to make us care about someone who didn't exist? Without giving any spoilers away, I will say here that the film presents different perspectives on this question, and I am totally fine with how things were resolved.It's rare that a film entertains this well while providing so much fodder for contemplation. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will Ferrell singing... nice!,"Harold Crick is an IRS auditor who leads a very measured, predictable and precise kind of life--so precise that he does things on the dot and counts trivial details like the number of his brushstrokes (36 up and downs, 36 side by sides). He lives in a pleasant cycle until one day he realizes something is wrong--he starts hearing the voice of the narrator dictating almost every step he makes. Little did he know that he is merely a character in someone's novel.Marc Foster's metafictional story about the interconnection of a character exhibiting a classic case of a contemporary corporate desensitization and a novelist experiencing a writer's block works on the same plane as Sam Mendes's American Beauty--it's a story about someone being reawakened, realizing that he hasn't lived his life the way he wanted it to be. The moment that Harold Crick hears his narrator explicitly telling him that his death is imminent, he freaks out and takes a vacation from his monotonous life.And he did make everything different. Will Ferrell's acting is surprisingly subtle--considering how wacky he can get in his other films. His tandem with Maggie Gyllenhaal's character Ana Pascal, an intelligent/radical baker who chose to bake cookies and breads (to make the world a better place), is surprisingly effective and at times, though embarrassing to admit, giggle/kilig-inducing.And there is also this issue whether the narrator Kay Eiffel is writing Harold's story as a tragedy or a comedy. When Harold realizes that he's being driven to make his life better and fall in love with Ana, he thinks that he's definitely in a comedy. But while seeking the help of the character played by Dustin Hoffman, Dr. Jules Hilbert, a literature professor who helps Harold get his way out of this strange literary labyrinth, he tells Harold that the narrator of his story Kay Eiffel, whom HIlbert has taught a class on, is notorious for killing her novels' main characters.As he continues to understand his role in the story, Harold Crick's wrist watch continues to click and tick to his climactic death. And so there goes the million dollar question: will Harold Crick be able to stop his narrator from killing him?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A difficult film to make. Maybe it shouldn't have been made?,"I don't even pay attention to this page ratings anymore. I read one long review with a positive score, one long with a really low score and one that is closer to what I think, and that's it. 7.6? This? Lol.This story was probably really hard to make. It's kind of a really Nolan-like intelligent type of story, that plays with reality, time, and ever changing (or not?) destiny/end. And yet, the execution of this was so stupid, so ridiculous. I feel the producers and director just quit before even trying.And even then, you can cast Will Ferrell and try to take the most humorous parts of the story and tell it that way. If that's what they tried, I just didn't see it, because I didn't laugh (not even chuckle) once. The movie takes itself completely serious even when scene after scene, the acting it's so bad for a realistic take, making it looks worse for itself, second after second.I don't blame Will Ferrell in the least. He put his trust in Marc Foster and the casting director, and they let him down. A scene with Maggie Gyllenhaal in particular was so jarring to see. It was like someone mixed ""Anchorman"" with ""You've Got Mail"" and couldn't decide the tone they were going for so they just keep it like that instead of re shooting the whole thing.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
