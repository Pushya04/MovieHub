The heart of the delta blues,"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role, as is Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with a few shining performances here and there, particularly John Cothran Jr as Reverend R. L.. I'm a very selective movie watcher, and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with its cinematic genius, in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An excellent movie with disastrous marketing,"We just saw this film previewed before release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: There were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What's sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too ""heavy"" for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn't be caught dead walking into the theater showing it. Too bad. A good film wasted.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Everything is indeed hotter down South,"I'll be honest with you; this is not the type of movie that I'm usually drawn to. All you have to do is watch the trailer and read the plot summary to figure out where you stand. But just to continue this honest streak, I have to admit that Jackson and Ricci are so good in their roles, that they were able to pull me into the story and keep a grip on my interest.Combining a sweltering Southern setting, blood and guts blues riffs, and a little unexpected Bible imagery, Brewer has definitely given this film a style of its own and an atmosphere that's as effective as the actors in telling this strange little tale of love and redemption.Though its aspirations run higher, there's no denying that the film has its moments of exploitation. Ricci's half-nakedness for 75% of the film is testament to that. Those of you with more delicate palates might experience a little discomfort watching this, and understandably so. It's raw. It's ugly. It's dirty. Even Brewer agrees that this isn't exactly for everybody.And that's what makes this such an odd movie to pin down. On one hand, I don't think I'd ever have a need to see it again. But on the other, I'm kind of curious how my opinion might be affected via a second viewing. Did I really like it? Or did I merely appreciate the effort and success in Brewer's ability to tell his unusual story in his own unconventional way? It's definitely a film that inspires discussion ... and a wide variety of adjectives. Strange. Over-the-top. Interesting. Unique. Uncomfortable. Take your pick. All these things combine to make it the theatrical experience that it unashamedly is.It feels like a gritty, twisted blues song come alive on screen. It's a character study, and if you have any hope of enjoying it then you must accept the fact that the film doesn't shy away from showcasing the underbelly of a very disturbed young woman and the path she's traveling.No, it's not for everybody. But love it or hate it, I feel safe in saying you likely won't see anything else like it this year. Proceed at your own caution. Just remember, everything is indeed hotter down South.THE GISTBlack Snake Moan is the type of film that makes you stop and examine your audience before deciding who to recommend it to. It features very solid acting, a great atmosphere, and a strangely different story. But it also gets a bit sick and twisted at times and has no problems doing so. Take my words to heart and then go with your instinct on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Jackson and Ricci shine.,"The title of this movie comes from a 1927 blues song by blind lemon Jefferson and has two startling performances from leads Jackson and Ricci, he a Christian blues man called Lazarus, she Rae a troubled white trash teenager. The unusual pairing of these two troubled souls is the basis of this bizarre story of redemption and love. Set in the Deep South we meet the promiscuous Rae, sexually abused as a child and now looking for love in all the wrong places, she seems set up with Ronnie until he leaves to join the army and she returns to her old ways. After one debauched night of drink, drugs and sexual assault Rae is given a lift home by Ronnie's friend who beats her and leaves her for dead on the side of the road only to be discovered by Lazarus the next morning. Like a guitar playing Good Samaritan Laz puts aside his own problems to nurse Rae back to health and what follows is a beautiful and strange relationship that sees Laz helping Rae through hard life lessons, the bible and blues. Jackson is astonishing as the grizzled old guitarist who's wife has left him and finds some sort of solace in trying to help Rae exorcise her demons and in turn hopefully help him a little too along the way. Ricci is simply stunning as the abused nymphomaniac all attitude and fire wrapped up in hot pants and a vest top. The characters are properly backwater and the music is really powerful, especially when Jackson performs the title track in a lightning storm during one of Rae's haunting flashbacks. Yes its overly sexual, yes I think some people with take the film the wrong way but in the end you have a great little film with a great cast and great story. The performances carry most of the weight of the movie but it is also the sum of its parts that will stay with the viewer after the credits have rolled.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
surprising movie with a good message,"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and,yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Christina Ricci needs a burger,"Any movie where Samuel L. Jackson chains up a scantily clad Christina Ricci to his radiator to cure her of her nymphomania has to be at least worth seeing. What I didn't expect is that it would turn into a respectable drama by the end. And that's wherein the disappointment lies. It is a good movie. Christina Ricci and Sam Jackson are both excellent, the story is well written and it's different from anything else I can remember, even if it does end up endorsing the boring old status quo. The film could have been a lot more memorable if it had just stayed sleazy throughout. Still, it has its moments. The first sequence where Ricci discovers the chain around her belly is gold. You have to love Sam Jackson's titular song. And the sequence where Ricci writhes sweatily to another Jackson-belted blues number is hot as hell. Certainly worth seeing, but wait for rental.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Craig Brewer convinces us that he is for real and Samuel L. makes sweet music,"Just saw this fantastic film at the Sundance premier and cannot sing its praises enough. Last time I saw Craig Brewer he was singing Ike and Tina to the audience and turning Sundance upside down with his breakout film Hustle and Flow. This time around he fulfills on his big Sundance payday with another unique vision thats going to get everyone talking about Samuel L Jackson, and if you thought Christina Ricci was just that girl in the Addams Family movies then think again. Ricci plays Rae a complete mess of a women who without her beloved Ronnie, played by the getting better all the time Justin Timberlake, has an uncontrollable need for all things sexual. When Ronnie leaves for the a tour with the Army, Rae's demons send her tumbling down a bumpy road that leaves her used and abused left for dead on the side of the road. Along comes old blues-man Lazarus played by the great Samuel L Jackon, Lazarus himself has a few demons lurking around in his head as well, notably his ex-wife who done wrong by him. Lazarus gets to think about this young women and after some soul searching he takes it upon himself to cure her evil ways with some love, some lessons and a 40 lb. chain. I don't want to reveal too much so I'll just say there's some dark moments, some very funny moments and whole lot of great acting. This movie isn't by any means Hustle & Flow 2, however Craig Brewer does tie the two films together with his hope for redemption and change for the better for even the most unlikely of people. Audiences will find a movie worth watching here and worth thinking about well after it ends.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Well made and original guilty pleasure not to be taken literally,"A fantastic elevation of his southern-fried cinema form, Craig Brewer proves that there's a lot more to the durty south then rappers and pimps with his exciting and unique third feature Black Snake Moan. Replacing the crunked- up template that helped garner Hustle & Flow all of it's gritty praise, Brewer shifts the focus to a way older musical tradition in the South, the Blues. Proving the opposite of a one-trick-pony, this noticeable young writer and director weaves a potent spell of sleaze, laughter, terror, and redemption around Samuel L. Jackson's troubled, God-fearing bluesman and his fateful meeting with quite the tortured young lady.Setting up and concluding this original and entertaining scenario proves overwhelming when compared to a tense centerpiece, but is still executed with enough flair and personality to maintain a certain integrity the entire time. It is in these harrowing, yet comical sequences of chained delight (excelling, no doubt with a near-perfect score) where two entirely different souls learn to benefit from one another in this peculiarly endearing way, that will have audience members shouting at the screen in joy for some of the new year's most hilarious and wicked scripting- that is if they are not offended past the point of realizing how unrealistic it is all trying to be.Jackson, in a positively refreshing return to character acting roots, offers some of his strongest, most perceptive line readings this side of the late 90's, finally helping to burst my cynicism about all the similar, lazy characters he has been coasting through for nearly a decade. Fans of this icon will be in heaven to see Mr. Jackson finally give out another noteworthy and memorable performance, which sees the former Jedi and Hit-man slip into guitar-slingin, dirty blues mode without batting an eyelash. Similarly, Christina Ricci's go-for-broke intensity and vulnerability will leave few forgetful of the receding star's talent; the film serves to highlight both a return to form as actors.Brewer may not have known exactly how to finalize all of the unique elements his morality-as-exploitation film implements-some of the behavior of it's characters remain laughably sensationalist, and the underlying thematic resolution, as gained by these two main players coming to an understanding of each other, feels slightly forced (exemplified in a tacked-on end), but he is not trying to make a documentary-like piece of fiction here, he is striving for something equal parts sinister and joyous, and in that effect has largely succeeded with this wonderful piece of Dixie pulp.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Moan hits Home ..,"Just got back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... ""skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator"" ... I hate when ""critics"" miss the point of a film. Now I suppose it helps that I live in Memphis ... and have lived in Mississippi a couple of times too. It may also help that I am the former Director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewer's simple ""redemption tale"" is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story ... but I believe it is highly effect as a ""blues"". It would be my hope that people don't read all the hype ... and/or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties ... get past Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (which he plays very well) ... get past ""Snakes on a Plane"" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... as he has transformed himself into a very believable Mid-South blues man. If you know little about Mid-South culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOWS how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film. Not one to tell endings ... so go see this movie ... and yes I will agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Heal Thy Snake,"'Black Snake Moan' was certainly different from what I had expected. The poster/DVD cover give a different impression and so does the trailer. However, it turns out to be a different kind of movie and a pleasant surprise. It tells the moving tale of a bluesman/farmer and a young nymphomaniac. Brewer's writing is solid as he laces humour into a film that is otherwise brutal and graphic. The dialogues are funny and the characters are well written. Christina Ricci is fabulous. Rae's anguish is well depicted and she does draw sympathy from the viewer as she is very convincing as a victim of sexual abuse. Samuel Jackson is stupendous as Rae's potential saviour. Both characters are trying to battle with pain. Though Laz's method is less self-destructive, he sees an opportunity in Rae and that's where the story starts. Here too Jackson plays the angry man but, thankfully, with a gentler, more compassionate touch. Justine Timberfake's bad acting almost sticks out like a soar thumb but thankfully the two leads are strong enough to overtake that. Brewer's film is a touching tale about second chances and how compassion and kindness can heal a lot. As a last addition, I would say that the soundtrack is a must have for blues fan.",,Anonymous,Music
"Completely Wacked-Out, Heartwarming Southern Gothic","Black Snake Moan on the surface could go one of two very different ways, in worst case scenario it could have milked a white trash exploitation scenario complete with porno sex, but instead turns out to be possibly one of the last great Southern Gothic films reflecting the 20th century American South with sincerity and accuracy. While BSM was released in 2006 I feel it very much captures something that has faded or all but disappeared which was still a simple fact of life in the 1990s south.This is the kind of feeling that cannot be replicated by someone who has come from ""the outside"" to make fun of Southern people or paint them as frightening or exotic. Craig Brewer was born in Virginia, and I'd honestly like to know more about him, since he spent a significant part of his childhood in California, but then returned to the southeastern US to make Hustle and Flow, then Black Snake Moan, back-to-back in Tennessee.The first 20 minutes or so aren't that great (aside from a brief clip of the nature of The Blues being described) but serve the purpose to set up the background of Christina Ricci's character being a poorly educated trailer park dweller who drinks heavily and has casual sex with nearly every man she meets. Samuel L. Jackson is simply depicted as recently divorced from his wife, but religious and earnest in his character. The film does get better from the point in which they meet, where the plot goes completely over the top into the kind of ""big fish"" eccentric drama and exaggeration-told-matter-of-factly common to Southern Gothic as a genre of storytelling...yet surprisingly ends in a heartfelt manner.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Absurd, Southern-Fried Melodrama Never Transcends Its Audacious Premise","It would be too easy to dismiss this strangely unsatisfying 2007 film entirely because I can't tell whether director/writer Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow) is trying to satirize the Southern Gothic sensibilities of a Tennessee Williams potboiler or replicate the excesses of an early 1970's blaxploitation movie. Either way, he cannot seem to pull off his audacious premise which involves a cuckolded blues guitarist appropriately named Lazarus who enchains a nymphomaniac to his radiator. If the film was played out as over-the-top as the premise, then it might have had a fighting chance, but as it stands, Brewer is too ensconced in his chicken-fried fable to mine the potential black comedy in this hilariously preposterous exercise.The hackneyed plot centers on Lazarus, a self-righteous man stinging from his wife's decision to leave him for his younger brother. Meanwhile, a skeletal nymphomaniac, Rae, is so distraught over her boyfriend Ronnie leaving for the army that she goes on a hedonistic meltdown involving alcohol, prescription drugs and indiscriminate sex. A violent episode leaves her unconscious on the road where Lazarus finds her limp body. The rest of the film focuses on how the principals change from the ordeal but not before facing a lot of inner demons along the way. However, unlike Hustle & Flow, I cannot really say that I cared about the fate of these misbegotten characters at the end. Brewer just can't seem to connect the absurdity of the central situation with anything resembling real life, which ironically may be exactly his point here.The actors try hard to breathe empathetic life into the overripe characters, but they are ultimately defeated by the lurid dimensions of the story. As Lazarus, Samuel L. Jackson almost makes the situation palatable and even sings several blues numbers with surprising conviction, but Christina Ricci makes Rae a primal stockpile of white trash clichés on top of a condescending back story. Justin Timberlake is completely out of his league as Ronnie and neutralizes every scene he's in with his amateur standing as an actor. Look for former child star Kim Richards (Escape to Witch Mountain) as Rae's defeated mother and a doozy of a fight scene between the two in a grocery store. The 2007 DVD has plenty of extras including an enthusiastic commentary track by Brewer and a half-hour making-of documentary, ""Conflicted: The Making of Black Snake Moan"". There are a couple of shorter featurettes about the music and five deleted scenes.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Well-made. Not profound or provocative. Worth watching.,"I attended a screening of this movie. The acting was great. Justin Timberlake did a decent job (I use that word loosely, and I'm probably just saying that because he wasn't on camera a whole lot). Christina Ricci and Samuel Jackson had such great on-screen chemistry; I really enjoyed watching their characters interact. They were quite interesting.Ricci's character was so pitiful. At first you hate her, but then you grow to feel bad for her throughout the movie. Jackson's character, Lazarus, has got to be my favorite, though. He was a mixture of funny and crazy, and Jackson did an excellent job. Ronnie (Timberlake) was so pathetic, though. I really wanted to see him get cut out of the story. I didn't like that character at all.My only real issue with the movie was that it isn't very profound. You don't get to take anything with you. It's just sheer entertainment, no life-lessons to be learned, no philosophical concepts (a la The Matrix). Consequently, it almost felt like an 80's movie, but its story was just so interesting, albeit bizarre that it's certainly worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Tamer than you'd think,"For a film about a young, sexually voracious white woman who's chained to a radiator by a God-fearing older black man, BLACK SNAKE MOAN is surprisingly non-exploitational. Instead, it's an intriguing enough character piece, juxtaposing two entirely different protagonists and exploring their relationship when they're forced together by circumstance.Christina Ricci has the physically demanding role of the trailer trash, playing the entire movie near-naked and being variously beaten or humiliated for much of the running time. However, it's Samuel L. Jackson who (unsurprisingly) gives the best performance as the conflicted gentleman faced with the unenviable task of trying to 'cure' Ricci of her sex addiction.As the film begins, it does feel slightly self-conscious; writer/director Craig Brewer seems to be going out of his way to create a sub-Tarantino style atmosphere. Still, the humour works and as the story progresses it gradually finds its feet and you realise where things are headed. The ending may be a bit much for some, but for the most part BLACK SNAKE MOAN is a piece of watchable (if not exactly gripping) cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Less salacious than you might think,"How's this for a precis of a movie? Ageing blues man Samuel L. Jackson endeavours to cure sexpot Christina Ricci of her nymphomania, by chaining her to his radiator.There was no way that I could miss that film, and I didn't.""Black Snake Moan"" is actually really good. Although it is true to say that there are a fair bit of Ms. Ricci's assets on show, ""Black Snake Moan"" is more than just a latter day exploitation movie. It is a lot less salacious and a lot more thoughtful than you might imagine. Some interesting points made about childhood sexual abuse leading the sexual dysfunction in later life, and the way that the surface image of a person is not necessarily the true image.Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson both act their socks off, but I doubt that either of them will be nominated for anything for ""Black Snake Moan"". Shame. Good performance as well by Justin Timberlake as Christina Ricci's absent boyfriend. The only man who can keep her under control, but also a man with issues of his own.Interesting film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Bold Bite,"If you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? Well then, you best get ya wits 'bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously, there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it.In the third offering from director Craig Brewer, we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims, everything is hotter. While there we're introduced to the Godfearing bluesman, Lazarus as previously said played by Jackson, and the almost always half naked Rae; a role bravely taken on by Christina Ricci. In the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that, then we'd be a lot better off. The question of if this will be understood, or be accepted by all who see the film is another story.One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here. You'd think with the role of a sex-crazed woman, overacting would be a given, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date. Then we have Jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is. Sadly, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake who plays Rae's military-bound boyfriend isn't all that great. At the start, he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard. Later on he steps it up some, still he's far from the level he reached in January's 'Alpha Dog'.The other thing 'Black Snake Moan' boasts is a splendid soundtrack. Containing tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, pieces from the score done by Scott Bomar, & of course four, count 'em, four tracks from Jackson himself. It's actually one of his songs, the main performance of the film, 'Stackolee' that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection. It alone is worth the ticket price. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Bomar's 'The Chain', 'When the Lights Go Out' from the Black Keys, & the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night.The efforts of Craig Brewer can't go without mention though. His last film 'Hustle & Flow' which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map. What he has done with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry. He not only directed 'Moan', but also wrote its screenplay. The end result is a story that is surprising and clever. As you watch you feel like you know exactly where it's headed despite its valiant composure. Just as you think you've predicted the next move Brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route. There are however some blotches within the screenplay. The background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing. It left me craving for something more exciting. After so many highs I guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film.I imagine the majority of people who see 'Black Snake Moan' won't enjoy it due to the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are. The depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely, even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received. It's the issues of race, religious motives, & sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything. The idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it. Simply put, it's not for everyone. Like I said, to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind, or else you're just wasting your money. For those of you who can do that, I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Antithesis of the poster...,"Based on the badly construed poster, inadvertently countering the whole essence of the movie, ""Black Snake Moan"" comes off as a misogynistic throwback tribute to sexploitational / blaxploitational movies of the 70s, much owed to the Tarantino school of film. Surprisingly however scriptwriter and director Craig Brewer wistfully decapitates expectations, albeit dangles uncertainty through some stylishly promiscuous scenes featuring the nymphomaniac excesses of Rae (Christina Ricci), before entering into the actual gist of the story. One that is painstakingly similar to the plot summary of the up-and-coming Lars von Trier movie ""Nymphomaniac"".When compulsively oversexed Rae is left by her one love Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), who joins the army in search of educational prospects, she enters a frenzied bout of loose activities, as if possessed by a slithering demon of wanton. After one such escapade Rae ends up beaten and left for dead on the side of the road, where she is consequently picked up by an old farmer Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently abandoned by his wife in search of fulfilment of wild pleasure, that he himself was unwilling to offer. As a deeply religious man Lazarus decides to take care of the young soul and after experiencing firsthand Rae's sexual bouts decided to chain her up to a heater and exorcise her inner incubus. After initial attempts to escape Rae comes to accept her situation and recapture reasons behind her behaviour...Albeit certain hints of inner contradictions are present with sexuality use as story tool for preaching restraint in an almost religious manner, ""Black Snake Moan"" manages to overcome bad marketing, which diverted attention from the movie to wrong crowds. After the opening sequence concentrated on sexual frenzies of Rae and several scenes verging on exploitive (with Lazarus taking Rae for 'a walk'), which essentially complement the misinforming poster (inadequately suggesting a sexual type of relationship between Rae and Lazarus), the movie dramatically shifts gear to take a step back and catch the blues. Literally.Lazarus, an old blues musician, punctuates key moments in the story with songs, that give the music a creative power to change people and their behaviour. The song ""Black Snake Moan"" coupled with a thunderstorms and failing lights, as if taken from a horror movie, serves as a tool to discover and fight inner demons, while a blues concert gives Rae a channel to dispose of sexual tension through dance. Rae herself ventures into song to portray a soothing of her anxieties, a subtle change in character and development of inner strength, one that she later on will want to pass on to Ronnie. Meanwhile blues legend Son House features through archival footage at several junctures of the movie to offer insight and meaning, as well as present the essence of blues. Music and sound (most prominently snake hisses announcing Rae's attacks), skillfully intertwined with picture, creates the backbone of the movie, capturing the ear first to then pull into the story.After being captivated little space is left for attentively following the story, which despite several admirable qualities, does come as pretty straight-forward, somewhat hurried and featuring several dramatically incompetent sequences, lost due to both acting as well as directorial flaws. Cristina Ricci comes off best as the lost soul with bulging tension and relentless sexual drive, while Jackson admirably performs several blues songs to rapturous applause of viewers, but simultaneously hits several false notes in the acting department, most evidently when supposedly losing control during a tirade about his wife to the chained Rae. Despite its trashy side and a lack in character depth the end product is pretty admirable. All in all the music makes this movie, with the blues both thematically and rhythmically offering it a distinct and worthwhile vibe.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not What You Expect Going In...Pleasantly Surprised Walkng Out,"Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it. If it tried to take itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, but instead it carries itself through humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good acting by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side.I would definitely recommend this movie, if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An interesting take on the root of the blues!,"A very well made veracious examination of race, sex, religion, abandonment and neurosis. Undertaken through Ricci's (childhood abused, sexually crazed) nymphomaniac character Rae and Jackson's (equally sick and neglected, moral searching) musician character Lazarus. In believing that God has placed Rae in his path, Lazurus uses his musical skills, of playing the blues, to aid both characters in finding each other under these desperate circumstances. The narrative of this film tells of the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town and how they deal with the issues of divorce, soul-searching, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. The film is violent and comedic in parts, the best example of this being when Lazurus tells of losing his virginity ""it was out behind my uncle's barn with my second cousin"", although this is comedic it is also very telling of the films ideas and aims.Black Snake Moan is an interesting concept that many audiences will relate to and understand, especially if big fans of the blues. However the film is deeper than that and this is evident in our reaction to the characters handling of the films themes as some will feel compelled to contrast these issues to the more developed areas of the western world and a primary example of this being carried out is the town minister, who defies logic by grappling with his own problems through becoming the counsellor and mediator for the lead characters. Directorially the film is very good and Craig Brewer has managed to set himself apart from fellow beginners in the industry, his framing, scene arrangement (misc-en-scene), lighting and general story-telling are very good and almost unmatched in contemporary Hollywood. The film features very solid acting, from both leads and is probably Jackson's best performance since Pulp Fiction, my only doubt lies with Justin Timberlake's character, but on a second viewing I'm sure I'll know the answer to that.Finally, this film is definitely one of those that will make you stop and examine your audience before deciding who to recommend it to. It is a film with a thoroughly human story that really speaks to the root of the blues.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great film!,"I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I would have to see it. I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film, which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake, but also his own...yet it's so much more than that. It's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty, sticky, sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward.The characters are (for the most part) multifaceted and very well-written and performed. The accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly. However, there was one weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can say for him is that he can pull off crying...it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he was trying very hard. I would definitely give him another chance.Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively) have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other. This is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and, luckily, both of the actors were up to the task.The music was very bit as good as you would expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal.On the technical side, all was brilliance as far as I could see. It was well-edited, well shot, and well-mixed...everything was great.

It isn't new. I also do not like Christina Ricci. Neither her acting, nor her scantily-clad body. But I was surprised. The well-written dialog stunningly delivered by Lazarus (S. L. Jackson), and some interesting points in the plot had me glad that I watched it. Again, S. L. Jackson is responsible for giving a movie some powerful and memorable lines that I cannot image any one else delivering. ... ""No. You ain't right yet."" ... The Reverend (John Cothran Jr.) was more than just a secondary support character. He helped give some real character-building to Lazarus. His speech about heaven was a pivotal part in the movie. This movie is much better than any of the Movie Posters or stills hint at.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Lame,"I saw this last night and thought it was just silly. Watching bony little Ricci wriggling through one of her ""spells"" was ridiculous. I have always admired Ricci and was embarrassed for her and Jackson because instead of being gritty, funny, soulful or whatever, it was just insipid. Great actors, stupid script. However, Timberlake's bad performance was perfect. I don't care for him in general and I think he was perfect for the part of a whiny little dolt that I didn't feel any empathy for. The only redeeming quality of the film was the music. It wasn't award winning, but it was pretty good. Oh yeah, after all that girl had been through, how did she keep those panties so white.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"The world is in need of  his character,many cry out for help!!!","An excellent movie which clearly demonstrates that we are all connected in this world.The sensitivity, perseverance,and wisdom Samuel L.Jackson portrays ,shows the tenderness of his heart to make his character come to life. The parallel is true in real life, you forget about your own problems when helping someone else. With all the sexual acts in this day and age being committed against young children, this clearly demonstrates the scars on every level (psychologically, personally and within the community)for this young girl. Her promiscuity doesn't overshadow her innocence which finally surfaces. It is a pleasure to see. We are created in God's image and his likeness. Although it was a movie, Samuel L. Jackson was an instrument in helping this girl find the authenticity of who she was. Seems like I see this in every day life. A wonderful movie, my heart was touched, I would loved to have been her psychotherapist. I was at peace as I watched the plot unfold and was wishing the best for everyone involved. Something for people to learn from this one, the road to healing from sexual abuse is a long one which takes self-love and the love of others to erase the traumas of the mind. Think about it! Sexual abuse a reality in our world on every level. How do you heal it?",,Anonymous,Music
A different kind of movie,"Black Snake Moan (2006) is a very interesting movie, it's one of a kind. It has an A list Hollywood cast. Veteran actor Samuel L Jackson, child star Christina Ricci, and singer Justin Timberlake. The actors are well cast and I think they all did a pretty good job with their individual roles. Jackson plays a man who's wife has left him for another man. And Christina Ricci plays a sexually abused women who's boyfriend (Justin Timberlake) has left for the military. Ricci's character is left beaten and bruised on the side of the road, and Jackson's character finds her and brings her into his house to care for her. Then that is when the movie really takes off. The movie executes its plot in a way that gives depth to all the characters, so that is good, but there are times where you aren't sure how to feel about certain characters and there are moments that feel kind of awkward. Luckily those times aren't rampant throughout the film, but they are there. Overall, the movie isn't one I would 100% recommend to any and everyone, but I liked the connections made between the characters. This movie is probably worth watching just once just for the connections and deep characters. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

This little light of mineBlack Snake Moan,"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. From here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationRae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear.Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive/patient. You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well. Also, the character of Rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue, but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out.While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with ""This Little Light of Mine"" singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, though, is when Jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been, or how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don't have saints here, but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I've had it with these motherf**king snakes on this motherf**king plane!,"BLACK SNAKE MOAN 2007 (SAMUEL L. JACKSON, Christina RICCI, JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE) DIRECTED BY: CRAIG BREWER ~ THE RUNDOWN: Brewer's 'Black Snake Moan' doesn't warrant much more than a whimper, ignoring the tale's great potential for dark humor and presenting the simplistic story in a tedious and sometimes laughably melodramatic fashion. ~ The story, although very simplistic, had the potential to achieve both humor and entertainment on a massive level, but neither was achieved. Brewer, instead, chose to go for our hearts a little too often and, for the most part, his efforts resulted in hollow, melodrama comparable to your typical daytime soap. The path he chose with this movie did indeed make for a very watchable film highlighted by a remarkable, vibrant performance by Jackson and an equally amazing and believable performance by Ricci, but the film's set-up was seriously screaming for some humor and it was denied. Jackson, after all, can be hilarious, and I honestly think if the movie hadn't taken itself so seriously it would have maybe reached immediate cult status. I also don't think it would have sacrificed its themes either. And, while I'm on the thematic aspect, I admire how Brewer didn't keep the secrets to the film's title out of reach, yet managed to not smother us with them either. ~ The film was definitely shot with style and care; it was pretty cool how much feeling was conveyed at times with no dialogue but just music and good directing. Furthermore, 'Black Snake Moan' is definitely a more original experience than what we're used to seeing these days, but it could have reached originality on like a Tarantino level, which it definitely failed to do. ~ Overall, to reiterate, it simply doesn't live up to its potential; it could have been far more entertaining and should have been hilarious. And, guess what? Style, originality, good acting, and an interesting title don't add up to a good movie...basically just a pretty good one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Black Snake Moan (2006),"What does Black Snake Moan mean?
Personal demons
As explained in the bonus features on the DVD, the ""Black Snake Moan"" represents personal demons - the ""voice that won't go away.""A God-fearing bluesman Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson),takes to a wild young woman Rae (Christina Ricci) who, as a victim of childhood abuse, has become the town tramp she looks everywhere for love, never quite finding it.This is an unusually bold film, but it's also a morality tale.
Christina Ricci wears little but a pair of skimpy white underpants as Rae, a properly mixed up Tennessee gal who has an insatiable urge for sex. Lazarus, a local farmer (Samuel L. Jackson), with gold capped teeth, grey hair and woolly beard, has his own problems.When Lazarus finds Rae lying unconscious from drugs, alcohol and abuse near his property, he takes her in. ""God seen fit as to put you in my path and I'm going to take this wickedness out of you,"" he tells her, wrapping a thick industrial chain around her tiny waist, to keep her from running away. Deception, freedom and redemption all weave themselves into a moody tale that held my attention for most of the time, compounded by Ricci's stunning beauty, striking performance and waif-like appearance.Ricci is like a wild cat in heat as she struggles to free herself from the heavy chain. Her performance is incredibly fierce and free. It is reminiscent of Ida Lupino's bold, performance as a crazed women who looses her mind in 1940's 'They Drive by Night' or Elizabeth Taylor's performance in a Taming of the Shrew. Christina Ricci's performance is unbridled and gritty. What I would give to have a conversation with her as pick her brain about how Christina prepared to dive so emotionally deep to give such a raw and unflinching performance . She is first a rate actress.Delightfully outrageous, Black Snake Moan is an explosive mixture of sex, race,and redemption in the Deep South. It may be the most peculiar films I have seen. I love the way that both Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci take chances pushing the boundaries of the content with there no- holds- bar acting chops. Such movies defy all categories and really need to be experienced. Any of you cats want to barrow my blu-ray I will post it to you. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sledgehammer subtle, but compelling regardless","In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking). And that's not to mention the archival footage of musician Son House, ruminating on love and death (and heavily foreshadowing things to come, of course). Yet in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of ""Black Snake Moan,"" the tale of aging Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently dumped by his wife (for his brother, no less), who comes across near-death nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, easily giving the hottest portrayal of trailer trash on celluloid ever); nursing the girl back to health, he chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully redeem his own fallen self. While there is a definite prurient appeal in watching Ricci fall out of her skimpy outfits, her performance is risky and mature--not a trace of Wednesday Addams to be found, and she easily holds her own with Jackson, who personifies ""the blues"" in his portrait of a flawed, God-fearing man. While heavy-handed, the scene where Lazarus sings Rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm/blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there. The setting is strong, and a case can be made for the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who haunts Rae's libido) being a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. And it is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that lends ""Black Snake Moan"" much of its strength--the committed performances of Jackson and Ricci make this a film that goes from wrenching to uplifting with, well, seamless grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot contrivance I could have done without, neither he nor the sledgehammer subtlety can keep this from being a fascinatingly meditative film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Weird Tale of Faith, Hope, Love and Blues","In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.""Black Snake Moan"" is a weird tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The gifted Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives. It is amazing the versatility of this actress, and probably this is the most mature work that I have seen Christina Ricci perform. Samuel L. Jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Entre o Céu e o Inferno"" (""Between the Heaven and the Hell"")",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Ricci Sparkles with White trash Brilliance.,"This movie is a solid effort, it is well done and because it is well done I have some problems with it. That is, to make more clearly, that because I actually liked this film I wanted it to be perfect. Easily Christina Ricci's best performance which isn't saying much compared to her other films Love Actually, the opposite of sex and numerous other poor choices and less than stellar performances. She shines in this, or rather radiates a troubled young girl who somehow is still sexy with band aids on her knees and bruises on her face not to mention eyes that make her look like she has been on a year long extacy and morphine bender. Sam Jackson as always does a great job.Here is where my complaint comes in, why Timberlake? Why not cast someone who we haven't seen much of before for his part? He looks way to pretty to be playing the part he plays and doesn't seem nearly screwed up enough, at least not enough to match Ricci's performance. Also, it is hard to get it out of your head that you are watching an actor and not Justin Timberlake.The plot is solid, the acting very good, it is obvious the writer/director has talent and is going to produce some good films in the future. He uses slow motion in some interesting ways and knows how the camera should capture the action, he also mixes music well with the action. All in all this film is worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
My wife gone left me... and now I'm all alone... and to make matters worse... I watched Black Snake Moan!,"Unless you're a big fan of diminutive cutie Christina Ricci, and are desperate to see her wearing very little, there's a good chance that you won't stay the distance with Black Snake Moan. At over two hours long, this slow-as-molasses Southern-style tosh is enough to give anyone the blues, despite its promisingly salacious storyline.Ricci plays Rae, the nymphomaniac wife of soldier Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), who screws around whilst her man is off serving his country (her insatiable lust is apparently the result of having been abused as a child).After one of her drug-fuelled quests for indiscriminate sex, Rae is beaten up and left on a dirt track, where she is found by a god-fearing blues-man, Lazerus (Samuel L. Jackson), who takes the wayward hussy to his home, nurses her back to health, and sets about curing her of her wickedness (by chaining her up, preaching to her, and singing the blues).Lazerus and Rae eventually form a (platonic) friendship, but when Ronnie returns home unannounced (discharged due to high anxiety), discovers from a friend that his wife is a slut, and finds her shacking up with Lazerus, he loses his cool, grabs the nearest gun and goes looking for the old musician.Given the right treatment, this could have been a delightfully trashy slice of exploitation, but with earnest direction from Craig Brewer that shows no hint of being tongue-in-cheek, a dreadful performance from Timberlake, and umpteen laughable Southern stereotypes played completely straight by the stars, Black Snake Moan is rather dull and ultimately disappointing (except for those who are only watching in order to check out Ms. Ricci's knockers).",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Good tale of the blues.,"I have to say that ""Black Snake Moan"" is a pretty powerful film though it's tough, gritty, and shows sadness and sorrow it shows what the blues is all about and lets it get to our souls. Set in the rural deep south in a small town atmosphere a young girl named Rae(Christina Ricci) who's been abused and mistreated sexually as a kid is now a young adult who's turned into a white trash trailer park slut who's sleazy and very sexually experienced. The pain starts again when Rae's boyfriend gets called off to fight in war as Ronnie(Justin Timberlake)goes away. Then on the other side enter Lazarus a man who's feeling his pain after his wife has left him for another man the blues are coming down upon him. Then one day Lazarus makes a discovery of a badly beaten up Rae along the countryside and he decides to take her in. And what will develop is a very strange and somewhat odd love relationship really a tough and gritty bond of friendship. Yet in the end an understanding and love respect for the blues is developed as both Rae and Lazarus learn to take sadness from one another and grow it into happiness and maturity slowly. The performances are tremendous from Jackson and Ricci as Samuel is tough and fiery plus Ricci is very erotic and sexy in a trashy and dirt way. Overall one of the more underrated films of 2006.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Performances In A Movie Horribly Marketed,"Given the talent involved, I'm surprise this failed to find an audience as both Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci are superb and Justin Timberlake in a smaller role is very good too. I can only assume that it was horribly promoted and marketed, because the artwork I have seen online make it seem like it's a more sex orientated movie than it is.Plot In A Paragraph: Mississippi bluesman (Jackson) who holds a troubled local woman (Ricci) captive in his house in an attempt to cure her of her nymphomania after finding her severely beaten on the side of a road.I have seen some reviews that completely miss the point of the movie and just see a young skinny nymphomaniac white girl chained to an older black mans radiator, whoever did the marketing and promotion for the movie seems to think the same thing!!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Another moving southern blues mobile.,"A great, deep, richly told narrative set in the south. Gonna have to check out more of what this done, cause his work here is quite new and impressive to watch. He captures blues culture quite realistically. This film is not quite down and dirty, yet still, the rebel atmosphere is all over the place.The character work as well, unpredictable, deep. We have Christine Ricci in a very as a sort of nymphomaniac. Someone who can't seem to turn off those impulses and overtake her. Jackson plays aging down on his luck blues singer. He finds her and sets to clearing her of her wicked ways. Yet he is not perfect either. He has a falling marriage, yet keeps to the right.The way all of these things leap in and out of each other is right where it needs to most all the time. The acting as well, all-around good. Chemistry solid, Rccis southern accent, unrecognizable, wonderfully vulnerable. Of course, simply have to address Jacksons singing voice, so damn good. I'd listen to a whole album with it.In the end, this not quite a love story, not quite a music film. It is about failed love, human wickedness, and using the sounds of the south to get back to those things respectively. It may not be perfect, the pacing could use some work, also a few awkward moments If attempted comedy, yet it still works great for all the others. If you go for these sort f stories, this may not go in your shelf with the best of them. Still, it may fall in somewhere down the line.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Black Sanke Moan,"The trailer of this movie was impressive. It surely showed that the theme of the movie might be different. It also showed unusual images that are never seen before on screen. Let me unfold the story for you first.The story is about two lead characters, first Lazarus (Samuel Jackson) who is a god fearing person, ditched by his wife; second, Rae (Christina Ricci) who is madly in love with her boy friend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), but insanely seeks love and sex in Ronnie's absence (due to childhood abuse)  who has gone to serve in the Army. By circumstances badly beaten up Rae lands up near the farm of Lazarus who shelters her. But finding Rae's intense sexual urgings literally chains her in his house, and showers immense amount of care and love to therapeutically cure Rae from seeking sexual gratification of her desires. When Ronnie half-way leaves the Army and comes back, he suspects an relationship between this two characters, but on knowing the truth  the story ends happily by Rae and Ronnie getting married and Rae using Lazarus's love to cure Ronnie's fears.The setting seems to be in the hot Texas region. The Director Craig Brewer has managed to come every time with an innovative story line (in all his last 5 directorial ventures). The language is too American with regional lingo, and at times becomes difficult to grasp. The script is tight and the story is told with an uneven pace  sometimes holds high interest, whereas sometimes slows down to artistic cinema. There are strong early scenes of sex and nudity to depict the crazy life of Rae. I found the slight bent of Lazarus character towards religion a bit too clichéd  without a moral and ethical angle of religion, the director could have let Lazarus' character be neutral and intensely human.The music  especially the guitar chords are brilliantly played and that gives the depiction a different but interesting shade.For me, who am from the eastern culture  India; such movie experiences are a bit too shocking. Just to imagine that people in America  especially young boys and girls  live their lives with such irresponsible sexual orientation, leaves me disturbed and amused.But a unique film experience to watch.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Underrated,"When I saw this for the first time I knew it was going to be either loved or hated by the audience. I don't think there is much middle ground. The plot is very simple and straightforward, and it unfolds in a predictable way. The acting isn't great, despite what you may have heard. Samuel Jackson can't sing a lick, and Christina Ricci is only mediocre in her role (though softcorily attractive. Neither actor completely nails their part nor commands the attention of the camera, and this movie suffers partly because of it.But the lighting, cinematography, music, film editing, and direction are absolutely stellar. The character development is so deep that you feel you actually understand them in their messed-up, crazy actions, and because of it nothing seems too far-fetched or out of the ordinary, even when it is. The movie presents itself to be about sex, but it is about far more than that. It is about loss, redemption, determination, and overcoming the mere physical pleasures in life to understand the deeper meaning of love.It is a film about music. While sitting in the theatre, I found myself lost in the poetry of the old blues lyrics. By understanding the art of blues, the audience is able to more fully comprehend what this film is about. Much like 'Hustle and Flow' tried to explain what Hip-Hop meant to it's hard-core ""real"" fans, 'Black Snake Moan' shows how the free-style, yet structured world of blues can act as the guiding light to those lost in the realm of physical pleasure. Blues is playing what you feel, but never straying from the main form that got you there. In the movie, the camera might stray from the norm of what we're used to seeing, but it never completely loses us. The editing, lighting, and direction is freestyle, but not in an Oliver Stone 'freakishly annoying' kind of way.The blues is what leads to the final understanding between the two main characters. Music offers the understanding, redemption, and calmness through loss. If Sam Jackson had a better singing voice and Ricci didn't seem to force her part so much I think this movie would have been nearly a 9, but since it wasn't, my review gives it an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Are any of the positive comments from African Americans?,"Just wondering whether any of the glowing reviews of this film were from African Americans, after reading that last comment from a white guy who didn't see the movie but thinks it is racist against whites (if that post was even for real -- can anybody be that narrow?) Personally, I thought the New York Times critic said it best:* * * The character, played with his usual fearsome wit by Samuel L. Jackson, is a tried-and-true Hollywood stock figure: the selfless, spiritually minded African-American who seems to have been put on the earth to help white people work out their self-esteem issues. No doubt ""BlackSnake Moan"" is a provocative title, but a more accurate one might be ""Chaining Miss Daisy to the Radiator in Her Underwear."" * * *Personally, I'm tired of racially formulaic movies, no matter how well-executed a piece of entertainment a particular movie might be.Imagine Samuel Jackson in a real role worthy of his talents, instead of these ersatz Quentin Tarantino blaxploitation / sexploitation vehicles.Unfortunately, it's a lack of imagination in Hollywood enables such hackneyed, stereotypical tripe to pass as edgy.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A disappointing film,"This film is about a black man trying to teach a young girl some lessons about life by rather unconventional methods by use of a chain and a lot of preaching.The plot is rather unbelievable, if not ridiculous.

Justin Timberlake's acting is poor and wooden, and his character is shallow and dispensible.

I expected more from this film, but I personally do not think it delivers.",,Anonymous,Music
"Sharp and entertaining with a total disregard to the rules, although it pulls it off for the best part.","In Black Snake Moan, you have a film that covers so much ground that I don't think even it realises where it's gone and what it's done. The film goes through so many emotions and inflicts so much pain, regret and suspense on its characters that by the time it's entering its final act it doesn't know weather to keep on the straight and narrow screwball comedy road it wants to go down or if it wants to develop into a darker, more tragic film involving deaths of characters we've come to actually love but this is what makes Black Snake Moan the experience it is.The next man may be able to stand up and say that he or she has seen more films than I have but Black Snake Moan is, to me, a one of a kind film. It manages to integrate comedy, sometimes black, sometimes screwball and sometimes teen sex; horror; romance and tragedy. Even if Black Snake Moan never quite makes up its mind which of these its going to settle with, the content and chemistry the film has on screen with its audience works quite well. Rae (Ricci) is a girl who certainly doesn't break any boundaries in terms of how we look at women in films or how they are portrayed: she's sort of a cross between a femme fatale from a film noir; a dumb blonde from a teen sex comedy and a porn star from, well, a porn film.Rae may dress in nothing but a top too small for her and little white panties that get progressively dirtier but her character grows in leaps and bounds. I said that Black Snake Moan is a number of things and one thing it certainly includes that impressed me was its character development. Ronnie (Timberlake) is Rae's partner at the very beginning and gets sent off to 'a' war thus interrupting their romance. This is shown in tandem with Lazarus' (Jackson) scenario and how he's lost his love through that old down and outer divorce since his partner is no longer in love with him but seemingly with a long time friend of the two. Thus, the set up is complete and the audience are invited to 'side' with a character: which situation best fits you? Perhaps if you're male you identify with Lazarus, female means Rae is your girl. What's interesting is that under this smokescreen of genres and little outfits for Ricci to wear and get everyone all excited is a statement: Rae is lost after Ronnie leaves; she goes to parties and desperately tries to have fun, forget her troubles and attempts to perhaps fall in love again but she only finds more pain and anguish at her attempts to fit back into society again and regain a sex life. Lazarus' experience is more that of playing the blues and drinking whiskey; although reminiscent of a film noir, the mise-en-scene and music work well to tell us what he's feeling.Black Snake Moan also does the clever thing and leaves the setting ambiguous. The cars we see everyone drive around in a reminiscent to those massive American cars you get in the 1940s and 50s but it is a poor area of Deep South America after all. Rae wears outfits reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s at first with her teenybopper top displaying the confederate flag, making her look like a character out of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre but she later matures through what she wears: a dress. Where Ronnie goes off to to fight is also interesting. I said 'a' war earlier on; is it Gulf War II or the War on Terror? Or is it perhaps Vietnam? Nothing is really set in stone creating a timeless, 'could happen anywhere, anytime' atmosphere which was quite clever. From memory, I don't recall anyone using cell phones or computers but again, is this just due to the poor area the film is set?Black Snake Moan is a film that has fun with itself. It gets Christiana Ricci wearing next to nothing, it combines loads of genres, it has fun with its setting and resembles a screwball comedy at times what with Rae on the leash, standing in a seductive pose in the middle of a field  that twinned with the fact Lazarus has to chase her around the farm now and again to stop her escaping; all of it similar to the way Henry Fonda had to chase Barbara Stanwyck around that boat in 'The Lady Eve'. Black Snake Moan is a film that's fun but it's smart because it knows it's fun. It's also smart because it knows what it's doing and how it's going to deliver it: comedy in its portrayal of women; tragedy in its lost love narrative and horror in Rae's flashbacks. I could recommend Black Snake Moan as a comedy, as a love story or as a film in which people are just trying to find out who they are; on those notes, it's good enough to be a success in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Exploitation, but with heart","Y'know, it's funny, the only thing I'd heard about ""Black Snake Moan was that Samuel L. Jackson chains Christina Ricci to a radiator. Which, in and of itself, will leave you with the wrong connotations. But it's not until he actually does fasten her down that the movie finally gets interesting. Prior to that moment, this was some harsh subject matter, and I wasn't sure I wanted to stick around to see more punishment. But that brutality pays off in a redemptive second half, which is where - thankfully - the black humor is allowed to manifest. Both of these characters are human with their own demons to exorcise, and there's actually some love there. There's a growing bond that we're able to hang onto as an audience. This is a worthwhile story, no question, and the message seems to be healing through restraint and good old fashioned blues. Unconventional, but also kinda refreshing.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Ricci is on fire.,"Entertaining with great performance from Ricci. I've rarely seen such a courageous performance, and if you add that to the remarkable range she has throughout it's one of the better performances of the year. Also, when the hell did she got so hot and skinny? Jesus Christ. Justin Timberlake was also surprisingly good, displaying some strong acting skills. It's a shame that him and Ricci had absolutely no chemistry. I also loved the blues music scattered throughout. It really gave the film a great ambiance and put the viewer in the mindset of the characters. The main flaw of the film for me was the fact that I didn't care about any of the characters at all. It was also incredibly unrealistic how the minister was perfectly fine with a girl being chained up in Laz's house and that the boy didn't tell anyone, amongst other unrealisms. I really liked it though, a lot more than I thought.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I hurt"" kinda blues","""Black Snake Moan"" is about the blues, baby. Those low down, beat down, ""Sweet Jesus, I hurt"" kinda blues. I believe it was Craig Brewer who said in the extras that the film is like a blues album. It isn't so much about the story as it is about the feelings, the hurt that people carry with them and strive so hard to share...or forget. Not that the plot isn't interesting. It's a hard driving story. Brewer puts us right in the cauldron where blues was born. Jackson and Ricci deliver intense performances. (It's probably the performance of Ricci's career.) Don't let the cheesy, 70's, sexploitation, film poster put you off. ""Black Snake Moan"" is an original emotional ride with plenty of knockout music and memorable characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Wednesday In Chains,"First off, Christina Ricci is gorgeous; whether she's a chubby, busty brunette or a stick-thin, dirty blonde as she is here. She's always had enormous eyes and, now her face has gone so thin, they look even bigger.She plays a loose young girl called Rae in this. In the old days, she would've been called a nymphomaniac. In these days of politically-correct, blameless labels, she'd be called a sex addict. Others would call her the village bike (everyone's had a ride!).Samuel L. Jackson plays a lonely man who sees Ricci's wicked, wicked ways and decides to chain her up in his house to ""save"" her.Jackson usually plays himself in every movie he's in, but here, he at least seems to be making half an effort to do something different (although his character has a lot of the fire and brimstone of his Pulp Fiction Jules character in him.) The scenes where Ricci gets ""attacks"" of sluttishness are unintentionally hilarious. This woman literally has penis withdrawal symptoms.The story is kind of an update of the Jesus and Mary Magdalene story with chains and blues music. We're left in no doubt of the biblical origins of the story as the writer calls Jackson's character Lazarus, the name of the man Jesus brought back from the dead, just as Jackson's character hopes to enact a spiritual resurrection in the girl.There is also an interesting dynamic between Ricci and Jackson, demonstrating the Stockholm Syndrome when a hostage shows paradoxical signs of loyalty to their captor.Justin Timberlake is Ricci's hothead soldier boyfriend and the film kicks off with a sex scene between him and Ricci (I can only imagine this is why Ricci would want to do the film as she spends most of the time being naked and/or abused in some way.) It's a strange film, you could say deliberately quirky, but that's a good thing. You can only see so many action scenes and CGI monsters before your brain switches off.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A little gem,"This is one of those little gems that I propably wouldn't pick up if it wasn't on TV. This drama is a full package. Good acting, meaningful story, skillful directing and blues! Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci are very good tandem in this story of dysfunctional girl somewhere in America. She is sexy and disturbed and SLJ is good as always ( did he ever had a bad role? ). We have some chains and a lot of pain that needs to be cured!

Black Snake Moan is a Study in Redemption,Black Snake Moan. Just the Title conjours up pictures of the steamy delta south with old blues men playing after a hard day. Craig Brewster created a masterpiece here in this film about people hurting after being used and abused by others and looking for a chance to strike back or make things right. Sam L Jackson man isn't there anything this man cannot do? His performance as Lazarous ranks as one of his best in an underrated film. the movie centers on two people Lazarous a older bluesman whose wife has left him for his brother. Laz is a Christian who wants to do what is right he was a hell raising bluesman once. But he left that lifestyle years ago to be a farmer and live a simpler lifestyle. and the second person is Rae a hellraising nymphomaniac who is a drug user and uses people. Rae has finally found a man named jimmy who is going into the army and is leaving Rae behind. Rae decides to go party and in the process gets high and gets beaten by a pal of Jimmy's he leaves her for dead at the side of the road. Laz finds her and decides to nurse her back to health But Rae is delusional and is suffering from a fever. Rae tries to seduce Laz and he gets terrified A black man in the south with a young white woman who was beaten and left for dead can still leave a bad message. Laz confuses her with his wife and decides he's going to pull the wickedness from her he Chains her to a Rad in the house. What happens next is amazing as Rae struggles to get free and Laz trying to get rid of his demons become Friends. Well friends of a sort and with that Redemption comes as Laz frees Rae from the chain telling her he was wrong it's not up to him to change her life it's up to her. The courage Rae exhibits in trying to change persuades Laz to pick up the guitar and become a bluesman again. This movie Shows that not only is redemption possible even for the worst of us IT'S Needed by us to move on to for us to live our lives. Sam Jackson displays great courage in doing this role and brings to it a strong and incredible conviction. Plus hearing and seeing Jackson playing the blues is alone enough for me to say this movie is worthy of ten stars. an outstanding movie made with an outstanding cast with an unflinching story that pulls no punches. Go see it.,,Anonymous,Music
A decent tale,"The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along. Maybe it's just me though, but I think poor Lazarus should've had his story focused on more. He's a hurting man after his wife leaves him, but we never fully see how helping Rae resolve her past pains heals him too. It's just implied that it does--in essence, he plays the wizard that helps the young Rae overcome her curse, through a big ol' chain and some blues.I like the story, but I wish it were a bit more even and didn't have to rely on the sensational. The side characters were fairly decent, if simple and I liked the music. The acting was good enough, although I can't be certain if the Rae character is fully believable. But that might just be my naivety.All in all, I liked the film, but I wasn't compelled by it. Maybe it's that I'm too critical, but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so, while it all seemed very cool, I could never truly buy it. The chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. Still, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Black Snake Moan,"A tale of an unusual companionship set in the southern USA. A troubled young woman named Rae (Christina Ricci) is leading a promiscuous and self-destructive life, especially after her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves the town to serve in the National Guard. One night she is severely beaten up and left unconscious on a roadside where she is found by a religious farmer and former blues guitarist Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), himself no stranger to trouble. He takes her to his home and decides to help her get on her feet again a lot more wholesomely than by just mending her physical wounds. His methods are highly unorthodox, however.In the beginning the movie portrays the poorer regions of the South as a depressing hellhole where people are just too disillusioned to care about the ever-present emptiness in their lives. The colours of the cinematography add to the atmosphere of sunburned, old and worn out environment. Over the course of the story the characters grow more sympathetic and the sense of forlornness diminishes, but a feel of sadness is always retained. The actors have internalized their roles well: Christina Ricci really gets to wallow in the depths of her character's personal state of decline and the always charismatic Samuel L. Jackson is great as the bearded farmer who has been through many disappointments in his life.Besides the fitting visual look of the film, the music also deserves a special mention. Both the score by Scott Bomar and the songs performed by Lazarus and his band are enjoyable and powerful blues pieces that perfectly capture the spirit of the hardened people living in the world of Black Snake Moan. Especially the menacing title song, performed by Lazarus during a thunderstorm, is a very haunting moment and the best scene in the film.However depressing the beginning, the film concludes with a hopeful message: we all have our personal burdens to carry but together we can overcome them all. Fortunately the ending is not presented in a forcibly positive way but instead leaves a feel of vulnerability lingering in the air. Despite all the good qualities of the film, there are some things I didn't like as much though, such as the sparseness of motivations for Lazarus to do what he does. Showing more of his past experiences could have helped to justify his actions to the audience better and make him feel even more like a real person, even though it's not like he lacks charisma as he is now. Also, I don't feel Justin Timberlake's acting is quite on par with the two leads. In any case, the film is worth a recommendation for fans of powerful character dramas and anyone interested in blues music and the culture of Southern USA.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Black man chains white girl to radiator, we all learn a lot.","Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. The music is great, and cinematography focuses greatly on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige and it works. Samuel L. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, as well as play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool doing. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%#, but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
It's a miracle!,"A movie made to capture the lifestyle and essence of ""The South"" as in Southern USA and they didn't have that moment where a white man blatantly gets racist with an African-American. That alone was just so refreshing to see. With the main characters of the movie you get a great look at 3 levels of acting with Samuel L Jackson being an upper echelon elite actor who can just make anything work and make it authentic and natural without even trying. Then there's Christina Ricci who has a pretty incredible actor in her own right. She really nails this role and I just worry after not hearing much about her after this movie if she got so deep into this role of a woman struggling with sexual promiscuity that it sort of tainted her image and limited her ability to continue getting roles in big movies?! Her acting is really great and while it's not as natural and easy as Samuel's compared to JT you would think she was related to Marlon Brando! Timberlake has the 3rd dynamic part in this movie and it just seems like he's trying to hard to act, but at the same time it gives a great gauge on just how great Ricci and Jackson really are. The Blues music inspiration and base of this movie gives it such warm personal character. What a great job the director did if keeping that constant ""blues"" energy from start to finish. I give it an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music

unique story about the town tramp,"This movie had something different, unique, which in my book, always makes it better than a lot of other movies out there. Christina Ricci plays Rae, the town tramp, whom suffered from childhood abuse. Sam Jackson is Lazarus, a blues player whom finds Rae nearly dead along the side of the road. He sees this as a chance to change Rae's life by putting her though a religious suffering. He finds out about her being such a tramp and wants to change her ways. He comes up with the idea of chaining her to the radiator in his house and caring for her and trying to give her self esteem. He treats her cough and buys her some decent dresses. He memorizes her with his blues playing, and the songs Laz plays in the film are all very good. Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie, returns home after deciding not to go through with enlisting in the marines. And things work out for them in the end. As one complaint I have, the ending is just a little to perfect for both of them considering how messed up emotionally each of them are. I just didn't see a happy little ending for them.FINAL VERDICT: Unique story, interesting film. I recommend checking it out, but for adults only; it does have lots of bad language.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Sexist LCD Garbage,"This is the kind of movie where a man shows a woman how to act like a woman. The problem here is that it somehow assumes that a male chaining up a woman is anything other than a form of abuse. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? I could not even watch the full movie because I was so annoyed. As a rape victim, this disgusted me. It is never OK to treat a woman like this.This movie guises itself as a coming of age drama, but really, It was just meant for men to get off on. I see no other usage for this film than sexual fantasy fodder, and affirmation that women need men. Even worse this is his spiritual duty. It's some crazy Christian propaganda. Women's sexual freedom bad!! SINFUL!! Male dominance good, control that nasty out of control WOMAN!! Wear the clothes I THINK are appropriate, Act the way I think is appropriate.

A dark southern blues,I'm got start by saying this movie is dark this thing starts out dark. Every character has some type of problem whether it be sexual abuse or wife leaving you for your brother do think you will be in a good mood while watching this. It starts out kinda slow you see this girl who at first you think is just the town trash because she is sleeping with every guy. Then you have good old Samual Jackson playing this honest guy who's wife left him for his brother. I'm not spoiling anything this is in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Later in the film Lazerus (Samual L. Jackson) finds this girl without saying what happens to her lets say he feels the need to fix her turn her into a honest girl. Now that to me is deep in its self and you just want to see him succeed.This is directed and written by Craig Brewer which I haven't seen anything else he has done but he has talent. The music in this if you like southern blues you will love the music in this I'm not even into the music but in this movie your foot will be tapping.There isn't many flaws worth mentioning because it wasn't slow or made you feel dumb the acting was good and the plot was great. The thing is and this is me I don't see myself ever watching this again I do recommend it but it is just not one of those movies you watch over and over. Overall see this film you will enjoy it maybe more then I did.,,Anonymous,Music
I aim to cure you of your wicked ways.,"After Hustle & Flow, I just knew that Craig Brewer would present another great musical moment and a story of redemption and renewal. Although this film does not live up to his earlier success, it is, nonetheless, a film worth watching and has a strong message of hope.The draw is not only Craig Brewer, but the outstanding acting of Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci. A great supporting cast, including John Cothran Jr. and S. Epatha Merkerson, made this film more than enjoyable.The only thing that kept this movie from being more, was that it gave less than it should. The idea was great, but there really never was any effort made by Laz to help Rae except chain her up. He left all the hard work to the Reverend R. L., and gave up before she could really be called changed.The psychological effects of child sexual abuse are severe, and the denial by Rae's mother is all too common, but they really stretched it to have some pain traveling down from her head to her uterus, with the only cure a hard f*ck. That detracted from the real trauma experienced by Rae that drove her behavior. You see how she changed in just one week by foregoing alcohol and drugs. That message should have been stronger.But, I am not here to bury the Snake, but to praise it for the great music, the fine acting, and a story that really was worth telling, even if it had some weaknesses.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A rather odd little movie,"Here we have the charming Deep South tale of Samuel L. Jackson finding beat-up nymphomaniac Christina Ricci lying unconscious by the side of the road and bringing her home to cure her of all that ails her by chaining her to his radiator. Wait, run that by me again? Yes, it's safe to say you haven't seen many movies like Black Snake Moan. There's a lot of weirdness for sure and the movie certainly does have a number of flaws. But when you put the total package together the movie does seem to work, but by just the slimmest of margins. It's not a great movie, it's not an awful movie. It's OK. You could do a lot worse.Anyhow, as detailed above, the plot is rather simple. Jackson plays Lazarus, an old blues musician who nowadays makes his living as a vegetable gardener. His wife has just left him and this deeply religious man's faith is being sorely tested. Ricci plays Rae, whose boyfriend has just gone off to war, and now this rather disturbed young woman is looking for sex with pretty much anybody anywhere. After one encounter ends rather poorly (to say the least) she's more or less left for dead on the road leading to Lazarus' house. Lazarus scoops her up, brings her home and...chains her to the radiator? Lazarus is certainly determined to cure Rae of what ails here, both physically and emotionally. His methods? Quite interesting that's for sure. But he's not going to let this woman go until she's cured. Thus the chain. And thus begins one of the strangest relationships you've ever seen in any film.For material such as this to work the two principal actors are going to have to be very much on top of their games and Jackson and Ricci are up to the task. Their solid performances allow you to buy into the admittedly strange story being presented. This material requires the actors to take some chances and really go for it to sell this story and Jackson and Ricci sell it well enough to make the film passable. The film has some lulls and the story is after all a little bizarre but it works more often than not. You even get a few pleasant surprises as Jackson does a pretty fine job singing some blues tunes. And Justin Timberlake, playing Rae's boyfriend, turns out not to be as completely terrible an actor as you might expect him to be. Well, a backhanded compliment is better than no compliment at all right? All in all it's a film which has its lesser moments but the good marginally outweighs the bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Surprisingly a good movie.,"At first I thought this would be a low rate movie, being that Justin Timberlake was in it, but dam, he can really act. Seriously, he's like a pro. The boy's got talent. Overall, the movie was good. I only gave it an 8 cause I felt some parts of it required better closure,... like the incident with the guy that beat Ray in the truck. He deserved far worse for what he did to her. The music was really good, I haven't heard blues like that in awhile, and now I remember why I love blues music. Blues is transcending when you get it, when it's in the right perspective. Some people will never get it, which surprises me; but understand the essence of it. Happiness can be faked, but not the blues, not sadness, not suffering, you can't fake that. That's what I got from this movie. And, I also got a totally different opinion about Justin Timberlake, there's much more to him than what I first thought. He is quite a good actor. Samuel L. Jackson, of course, goes without saying, was superb. A 10 triple A Actor. Ricci also did a superb job, heheh no pun intended. Her acting is also flawless,...well the singing was a bit scary, that's okay, it fit the character. And, lastly, the tone on that guitar was deadly, whew,...I've never heard a Les Paul sound that good. Sure it wasn't a Fender ? Peavey Amplifier LOL, never heard a Peavey amp sound like that either.

Music saves this film: makes stereos sound good,"For men who love music and half naked women and the sexy Christina Ricci, I am surprised that there isn't a post already about Black Snake Moan. The promotion of this 2006 makes it seem like a far dirtier and raunchier movie than it really is. I don't know if even today a black man could keep a white women in his house without a getting a legal lynching, but Craig Brewer's story is a an indelible portrait of the south, poor people and the rhythm of blues that runs both of them.Samuel Jackson is wonderful as the blues playing farmer. Like Brewer's Hustle and Flow, this movie carries an under tone of the importance of music, but in this case, it is not a means to business, but one of expression.It is the music that saves this film. It is the love of the blues that lifts the typical Jackson character, from the strong but good man of the hood out of a simple, but hard life story into something bigger and better, for all concerned. It is the music that makes this more than a simply titillating tale. If you like Ricci's awesome performance in Monster, if you like Jackson's moral men, if you like Oh Brother, Where Art Thou, if you like movies about music, you will like this one too. It sure makes stereos sound good.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Even Jackson on fine form couldn't save it from being pretty average at best,"(57%) First off straight away the movie doesn't work, it leans too heavily into exploitation sleaze as well as lacking real substance for it to be in any way a thoughtful drama, and it's not entertaining enough, and dare I say it, too well made/performed for it to be truly fun drive-in movie throwback. What comes painfully close to saving this movie is Mr Samuel L. Jackson giving one of his better performances yet, he really is superb; while Christina Ricci puts out a no holding back performance of a character who wouldn't be out of place in a 1970's softcore sex picture with the direction almost ogling her largely semi-nude screen time at every opportunity.

Black Snake Moan (2006) **1/2,"I rented this expecting some sort of sleazy sexploitation craziness from straight out of the late 60s or early 70s, but that turned out to be false advertising. All the same, I mostly came away with an appreciation for what turned out to be a pretty good drama by the time it was all over. Samuel L. Jackson was very good as an old former blues musician and now truck driving farmer named Lazarus, whose wife leaves him for a more exciting life. One day he finds a young woman (Christina Ricci) beaten up and lying in the road and he takes her back to his shack to try and nurse her back to health. The girl is a local nymphomaniac with an uncontrollable need for sex, and who's slept with just about every man who crosses her path. Lazarus believes he can help ""cast the devil from her"" and find his own salvation through his deeds. At first it's difficult to care much for this callous and bitchy slut, but as the film progresses we learn the root of her troubles and, partly due to Ricci's good performance, we become invested in her character and even begin to sympathize somewhat. Justin Timberlake, I almost hate to say, is decent in this as Ricci's spineless and anxiety-suffering boyfriend, who goes off to the military but is sent back due to his nervous condition. The movie also offers some fairly good music here as well. While watching the deleted scenes on the DVD later on, I felt that many of them would have benefited this film, and director Craig Brewer might have done better to leave them intact. He would have had a much better movie. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Due to certain circumstances, she ends up on the road beaten up and unconscious. A black man (Samuel Jackson) finds her and takes her into his house. From there, they develop a strange relationship where they both try to help each other from their personal demons.When I saw the trailer and read the story about this movie, I thought, ""oh well...another crappy movie."" However, the movie was quite good. It certainly was different. This movie is not for everyone but then again, who knows. I think if people gave it a try, they might like it. It is gritty drama with moments that will make you laugh and perhaps cry.I thought everyone did a good job except Justin Timberlake. He was not bad but not good either. I rate his performance as OK. I understand why they chose him. It will certainly give the movie more exposure than without him.I also have to criticize the movie studio for the improper advertisement. If you see the trailer and the advertisement for this movie, you might think this is some sort of sadomasochistic movie involving a sex starved white female with a black man but that is far from the truth.A good movie with an original story and an excellent acting by most of the crew---sans Justin Timberlake.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This film is quite a bomb,"I must admit I was impressed, this film is pretty cool. Both Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci do a good job acting out these two character's and the relationship that grows between them. You got some kick as music here, some hard hard blues that suits the mood of where our two main roles find themselves in their lives. The Black Snake is a thick metal chain. Samuel L Jackson is downright cool with his pink guitar, really suits him in same way the girl does, two opposites as black and pink, they are not even opposites but its so interesting how well they match. This is cabin fever. Christina Ricci must have tortured herself to lose all the weight she lost of recent, not that I am into this sort of subject but its downright scary and obvious but it pays off, she looks downright hot hot hot and sexy here.....a very dirty girl until Jackson finds her and saves her soul and with that his own.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Thought-provoking story, solid performances","Well worth the ticket price, Black Snake Moan offers audiences a well-written, overall enjoyable movie. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci both play believable versions of their characters, and honorable mention to Justin Timberlake, who filled his role with credibility. The setting is very realistic, both inside and outside scenes, and the costuming/makeup is on par with the rest of the film's production standards. The story tests viewers with initial questionability, wanting you to choose either Ricci's or Jackson's character as your hero, and leaving you feeling fulfilled either way. A healthy exercise in modern cinema and acting, Black Snake Moan comes highly recommended to anyone curious about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen,"This is an unusual movie in that I instantly detested all the protagonists. It is hard to enjoy a movie when you don't care what happens to the protagonists. I would have been happy to have a church fall on all of them.I hated Rae (Christina Ricci) from the first seconds and never warmed to her. She was so full of herself, and so selfish. She blocked traffic just for the sheer hell of it. She dressed like a rape victim then viciously verbally slashed any male than noticed. She smoked and drank incessantly. She slouched her way through life in a screw-you pose. She was a slut. That rarely bothers me in a character, but she just rubs your nose in her trashiness. She was literally a nymphomaniac who pounced anyone with no discrimination. She is quite disgusting, like some animal of another species with a yen for human coupling. You are supposed to excuse her behaviour because she was molested as a child. I know lots of women who were molested, but none behaved anything like Rae.Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) was a religious nut who kidnapped and a chained woman. He lived out a sort of heavy duty Taming of the Shrew fantasy.Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) left his girlfriend to kill people in the army. He expected his slut of a girlfriend to be true to him, and was crazy jealous and violent.The preacher pounded out treacle and ignored the fact his friend Rae chained up in his kitchen.Even the 15 year old virgin who Rae pounced was such a stupid twit he did not report Rae being chained up.Other extremely unlikeable people included Rae's mother, Ronnie's best friend and Lazarus's friend who bates Ronnie for returning early from the army.About the only person in the movie close to pleasant is the pharmacist with a bit part.Rae spends most of the movie in her panties with her boobs falling out, often pretending to be masturbating or at least in heat (a phrase from the movie). She is chained and beaten repeatedly. This is soft S&M porn, that tries to redeem itself with some Christian glob piled on top.About the only good thing I could say about the movie is Samuel L Jackson sings quite a few times, and does a creditable job, especially the bar scene. That scene with dancers is roaring fun romp.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is outstanding,"This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. Yes, it's gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. Isn't that the best reason to see a movie? Those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A surprisingly wonderful film,"I was surprised by how great Black Snake Moan turned out to be.Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson id figure id give this a try.Well when this was over I was just left stunned by how great this film truly was.I mean everything was dead-on great and very accurate for that matter.This film shows how the great director and writer Craig Brewer(who made Hustle & Flow another great film) can just take anything even something that seems ludacras and make it into this.Well, I like how it is just a good time, like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way.Also I love that it doesn't show big steroeypes of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very reconisable.The cating in this was just phenomenal especially from Christina Ricci(who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did a great job as well.Overall almost everything is great about this, and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time.

"The most stupid, sexist movie I have seen in a long time","I thought this movie could have been quite good, but actually it failed miserably. What is sold here is Christina Ricci's body as we see her walking around naked (and may I say needlessly so) throughout most of the film. It has no depth, does not go into the childhood abuse enough and does not portray Laz's (Samuel L. Jackson) chaining Rae (Christina Rcci) as brutal as it is. Instead it tries to portray it as slightly 'funny' or as a 'game'.Also what is this uncontrollable 'sickness' Rae has? If the director would have wanted this to be a 'religously' themed movie, he could have done so much better and not have brought a 15th century concept of 'witch' into the über-sexy environment of the 21st century.Awful cinema, which nobody should be exposed to, especially not 12-17 year old who will go and see this nonsense. As far as I am concerned, the only decent thing in this film was the music! 3 out of 10",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Craig Brewer Directed,"What a treat! Feast your eyes and ears to this sensual down home saving of Christina Ricci by Samuel L. Jackson and Justin Timberlake as Ricci's boyfriend. The score scores put together by Scott Borman with pieces played by Jackson and one sung by Ricci. The pace is great and crests with Jackson singing and playing the guitar in a bar. I don't know what genius put Jackson, Ricci and Timberlake together, but it is magic. I have always loved Jackson and Ricci, but never could imagine them starring together.

Prepare yourself and let it all out with the Blues!,"Here we go again folks! Another Saturday night double feature which I admit it made me feel as a triple feature, but there's good news and I'll get to that.Throughout the first half of this small marathon of 4 hours and 45 minutes dizziness was the main result, and for that I say do not get fooled by David Fincher's previous works, Seven or Fight Club, and just try to avoid the 2 hours and 40 minutes of ""zodiache""; it simply hurts. Because of such a long dragging torture I will even spare any comments of the few good moments in the movie. So let's move on to the second part.I felt the night was heading towards an endless abyss of pain but suddenly a great surprise: bliss!!! I left the theater with the exact same feeling when I first saw Pulp Fiction back in 1994. The movie Black Snake Moan will be a new classic. The ones who know me might watch the movie and think that the ""music"" influenced my decision to write with such emotion about it, but I guarantee you that I never had the intent to fool anyone by getting mixed feelings about my personal taste and the admiration for art (although this statement can be tricky, I understand). I try to be fair, and that's it.The story is about loving one another which seems cheesy or corny, but is just a sea of appetizers that floods ones' soul (note Tennessee after Katrina as background). The acting is the main course in the film. And again the similar feeling I had with Pulp Fiction it is due to the extraordinary performance of Samuel L. Jackson (note some parallels with both characters in both films). Here Jackson was given the main role, not a supporting, as his previous best work, and kicks ass! And that's not it! Finally I can shout to all four corners that one the best new coming actresses have nail it! Christina Ricci is superb as the southerner white trash Ray, again her best effort yet. Perhaps due to the great characters along the story, which all actors (John Cothran Jr, etc) embodied and gave their best as well, Ricci could ""let it all out"", stressing and relaxing with a great sense of gravity (the blues can really be a soul healer). S. Epatha Merkerson repeats the same charm given in Lackawanna Blues and shines in her supporting role. At last, the great revelation was Orlando Bloom's cousin, Justin Timberlake. I mean, if you look at both, they are either cousins or the same person, kinda like in Adaptation, a double-imaginary-based on true events-Coehn Fargoish feeling anyway where was I? Yes, no restrictions in Timberlakes' casting.No matter if you are a blues lover, as long as you can be open-minded for this creative new-style love story, then satisfaction is guaranteed. By the way, choose the right theater to catch this movie; a good crowd will create an even greater sensation. Forget the matinée also and try the last show.I hope you can enjoy it as I didRotildo",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Samuel L is awesome,"I just got back watching Black Snake Moan at The Studio on the Square in Memphis which was pretty cool knowing that its kind of Craig Brewer's Graceland. I think everything he's ever made has played there. Music is great in the movie which is what everyone will talk about, though most people may not mention how authentic the southern feel is to this film. Other movies seem to just insult the south like Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown, but with Brewer from Memphis there's just a real 'you're there' feel to the whole movie. It does what every great movie should do. It makes you think, forces you to react, and actually has a great message of forgiveness and being judgemental in probably the most unconventional way possible without having a bit of preachiness to it. See this one in theatres.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"a pure Blues movie, if not a great one, with Jackson in one of his coolest performances","I didn't quite get what I expected from Black Snake Moan, but by the end I didn't mind too much either. I went into it thinking I was going to get a real low-down, Southern-Fried exploitation flick where race relations get turned around in a small town and the ""wickedness"" that Sam Jackson's blues-man character is trying to rid of Christina Ricci's wily nymph would sort of parallel that. In short, pure, unadulterated outrageousness of the Sam Fuller White Dog variety. It goes without saying that the central 'gimmick' (and it is nearing a gimmick I think) of the chain around Ricci- and particularly one moment where Lazarus (Jackson) is letting out Rae (Ricci) for a walk like a dog around the his field he farms- is meant to be outrageous, as are the moments when Lazarus's young assistant farmer-boy walks in on the itching-for-sex Rae and gets jumped by him for 'it'. But really, the intelligence of Brewer's script and how he handles the characters is that we get to see these people not just as simple caricatures but as real people, with histories, and it actually becomes a story of redemption, for both Lazarus and Rae as well as Rae's anxiety driven dishonorably discharged army man Ronnie played by Justin Timberlake. These characters do have the blues, and their own personal discoveries are put against this gritty, small-town Southern setting.But there are two very important factors that Brewer has going for him not just in the dramatically sound and fairly original script: the music, which strikes up some of the best blues music I've heard in a long time (including the great usage of songs by the late R.L. Burnside, an epitome of true blues), and the performances from Jackson and Ricci (more so the former). Ricci goes on a brave route playing Rae, who has some skeletons in her closet (which provides the bare-bones of why she is 'this' way, even if it seems a little lacking for full psychological depth), and who is completely without inhibitions. That she is in panties and a small shirt for most of the movie is only scratching the surface, but it's definitely a high point in his career. But even more so this goes for Jackson, who taps into what makes him such a magnetic talent in American movies- he's super-cool, to be sure, especially when he's playing the blues songs (one he plays on stage at a blues night at a club brings out even funnier 'mother-f-ers' than one heard in Snakes on a Plane). Yet the range of emotions are on display just as well, with the hurt and wisdom, and the craziness that is sort of underlying Lazarus as well as a sinner-cum-bible thumper. It's certainly the best I've seen from him in years, possibly since he last teamed up in Tarantino's Jackie Brown.Not to say that Brewer doesn't come close to confusing what kind of movie he's making. One might wish he had made just a straight on exploitation film out of the 70s, where the roles get reversed from one of those 'Pam Grier in prison' flicks. And there are moments of that, and the more trashy side of my taste in movies almost wanted more of that. But I was also very pleased to see Brewer's maturity with the material as well, and in not going for the very big statements like a Paul Haggis or something. It's not even about it being a white woman and a black man- not that there isn't a moment or two that's obviously called into question by supporting characters- but about two lonely, psychologically screwed up folk who, if only by scratching the surface, un-earth things that have been going wrong for them: for Rae, her unwillingness to deal with commitment and her sexuality, for Lazarus his peace of mind and relationships with women and the Lord, and for Ronnie about what it means to be with someone like Rae. It's highly charged, darkly funny, and touching, and it's likely to be under the radar, albeit not without its cult audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Could have been a lot better,"Went to see this movie because my husband loves the Blues. We had seen the trailers and didn't expect much. My husband liked it; I didn't. The movie is difficult for women, especially Black women to sit through. The story is really incomplete and would have been a lot more interesting if they had focused on Lazarus' story more than Rae and her husbands marital, sexual and anxiety problems. I would have liked to know what happened between Lazarus and his wife, beside what he told us. What was his marriage really like? Was he really the innocent victim he makes himself out to be? I seriously doubt it. That would have been very interesting if the writers had chose to pursue it. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
The Blues is Powerful,"Lazarus's(Sam Jackson) wife just left him for his younger brother. He's been left to his little house out in the southern country wallowing in lonely bitterness. Rae's(Christina Ricci) boyfriend(Justin Timberlake) and love of her life just went off for a stint in the National Guard leaving her alone. The problem is that sometimes she gets these crazy, emotional and physical urges to pretty much make it with whoever is nearest. Basically she's a nymphomaniac and the town whore. Of course one night this gets her into trouble leaving her laying half-naked on a dirt road, beaten bloody. Sam Jackson finds her there and brings her to his house. Originally he just wants to only help her - don't ask why he just doesn't call the authorities - but soon it becomes his mission to save her in another way, which is to rid her of the beast inside her and get her to respect herself. So with a bible in one hand and the chain he's put around her waist in the other, he begins the task of setting her right.One thing this movie had that I didn't expect so much was power. The scenes were wonderfully crafted to evoke as much emotion as possible. A help to this was the great musical sound of the blues. Just a guitar and a voice that pound their way into your brain.We all know that Samuel L. Jackson is basically some sort of God sent to earth to better it with his greatness. The man is a great actor and he plays it absolutely perfectly. I couldn't think of a single other actor who would have fit so well as he. Christina Ricci did an equally amazing job. She's become known for throwing herself headlong into projects and giving it everything she has. She becomes this little souther town tramp with zero respect for herself or her body, which is half nude throughout most of the movie. Even when she's put on clothes to go to a party. Justin Timberlake actually did a pretty good job, though i'm sure someone out there could have done better. To be fair, he mostly had about two emotions to convey and those were rage and panic from the severe anxiety attacks he suffers.Warning: you do see some sex scenes and Ricci's bare breasts a number of times. This movie has much to do with sexuality and it goes completely hand in had with the blues.In the end this movie is about coping with heartbreak, healing, and being with someone you truly love. I know. It sounds wussy, but as Son House says in the beginning of the film, ""Ain't but one kind of Blues and that consists between male and female that's in love.""By the way, Son House also says ""Sometimes that kind of blues will make you even kill one another. . .""Get ready for an emotion-ridden blue fueled ride. I hope you have some blues music handy for afterward when all you want to do is immerse yourself in it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Wish Christan movie makers would learn from this,"This is a move that I love for all the right reasons and know that the potential audience will refuse to watch it for some of the wrong reasons.This isn't a ""Christian"" movie but I wish those who made Christian movies would watch it and learn a thing or two. Some of the things I like the most, the characters are all flawed, Samuel L. Jackson's character is having serious issues, his wife is having an affair and leaving him, he is petty and vindictive when she leaves but still wants to salvage the marriage because of the importance of the vows. I'll just admit it, I can totally identity with his behavior more than I like to admit.The girl has some serious issues and left out on the street beaten half to death in front of Jackson's home. He takes her in to help her, risking his life in the process (black guy with a beaten white girl chained to the living room heater won't fly well anywhere. Won't ruin the events leading up to that).The Pastor is unlike any pastor in a faith based movie I've seen, and sadly, it's kinda refreshing. Usually in Christian movies, pastors are perfect and flawless. I've yet to meet one like that in real life, but here Samuel L Jackson reminds the pastor, rather forcefully, that her reputation isn't important, her status as a human who deserves to be helped is.I would seriously give this movie a 10 star rating if it exercised more implied situations rather than the graphic content and remove the nudity. The course language doesn't bother me as much, mostly because when she swears Jackson is always critical of it and eventually she'll catch herself and apologize, showing that she's beginning to respect Jackson and grow.This is a great movie with several positive messages and if a Christian studio were to take the concept of this type of plot and use it as a template for some of its production, it could be a great movie doing what movies of this type should be doing. Showing the same grace that we've received and show how lives are transformed by being exposed to that type of grace",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Moan indeed,"Anyone who paid good money to see BLACK SNAKE MOAN in a theater must have wished they could find a coral snake and end it right then and there. A balding, bearded Sam Jackson plays a poor southern black who chains the town's nymphet (Christina Ricci) in his home in an attempt to keep her away from the bad boys, who have treated her roughly. Meanwhile, her beau (Justin Timberlake, of all people) is returning from the service, which leads to a showdown with Jackson. I thought Timberlake likes boys. Oops, tell me I didn't just say that out loud. I did. Anyhow, Jackson strums an old guitar and sings badly, Ricci strums his guitar and sings even worse, Timberlake flourishes a pistol and then breaks down and cries ... and, well you get the idea. Ricci spends some of the movie in panties and a ripped t-shirt, but she is anything but erotic. Jackson buys her a dress and takes her to a blues bar, where he performs while she dances sort of like Elaine on SEINFELD. She also spends most of the movie sporting a black eye and other assorted and distinctly unpleasant bruises. BSM is for those who like their movies in the mode of TOBACCO ROAD.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Fairy Tale For Black Males,"Rae, a beautiful young ""dirty blonde"" white girl (Christina Ricci), a nymphomaniac, whose orgasmic response to males, white or black or to no one at all, dominates her life. After an interlude with a boyfriend, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), he severely beats her and kicks her out of the cab of his pick-up truck, leaving her on the side of a country road, where she can be easily run over. Instead, a blues singing truck farmer, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds her lying there, nearly naked and carries her back to his little house, which is heated, improbably, by a radiator. A religious man, Lazarus does not take advantage of her naked charms, but says that he intends ""to cure you of your wickedness."" When she attempts to run away, he chains her to the radiator, keeping her under his control (shades, perhaps, of ""Paris, Texas"" (1984)). The theme recalls the title of one of the greatest recordings of Charlie Mingus, ""The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady."" The patient care and gentle kindness of the aging black man redeems the fallen young white prostitute. Hallelujah! A well-made reverie for a patient audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Movie Unlike Which You've Ever Seen,"After her boyfriend leaves for the military, Rae (Christina Ricci) goes out for a night of partying and has a little bit too much fun. Beaten and left for dead on the side of the road, she is taken in by Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), whose wife has just left him. Together, they will overcome their losses.I walked into this movie knowing practically nothing about it. I had seen the trailer with Jackson hauling Ricci around with a large chain. I like Jackson, I really love Ricci (I've been a fan as far back as ""Casper"")... and I like chains. It seemed like a good idea for a film. I got Ricci, Jackson and the chain... but not in the ways I expected. A religious Jackson? A movie with strong blues overtones? Not expected at all.But I don't mean to say that by unexpected it was bad. Definitely not. This might be Jackson's best acting ever (Kevin Smith says it's the best since ""Pulp Fiction"", but personally I think he was better here). And Ricci really does a fine job. I think many people will go to see her naked through much of the film, but she really does play a strong role and a strong character. Even Justin Timberlake, who I had low expectations of, was decent. When he got violent, his ability to channel himself was pretty darned impressive.This film comes across as ""independent"" in the best possible way. A fresh idea, the courage to push the lines of appropriateness (though thankfully not as far as ""The Brown Bunny""). And it was more artistic than entertaining (which many won't like, but it's a better, richer film in many ways).Great film, great acting, great cinematography. I also loved the music -- Jackson learned to play the blues and I think he plays a pretty mean blues in this film (with his trademark potty mouth, of course). Many won't like this movie, most will probably not understand it, but expect it to return around Oscar time next year. Great, great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Unchained Medley of Blues,"Greetings again from the darkness. What to make of the latest from ""Hustle and Flow"" writer/director Craig Brewer. Hopefully, this one was designed as camp. I see it living on as a cult favorite for midnight movies. I kept waiting for Angie Dickinson to pop up as the town bordello matron! Christina Ricci spends two hours writhing around in her underwear trying to fight off the built-in urges that don't seem to be cured by the cough syrup Samuel L. Jackson borrowed from the pharmacy lady who has a crush on him. Oh, sorry ... forgot to mention much of her writhing occurs while sporting the heavy 50 ft. chain that Mr. Jackson locked around her waist and his radiator as he sets about trying to cure her.All of this happens while Ricci's true love goes off to join the military. Except he comes back a week later because he gets frightened by loud noises. For that reason alone, one would think he would stay away from Ricci! Sorry again, forgot to mention that the sensitive military failure is played by ultra-sensitive, tough guy wannabe, Justin Timberlake ... who may be the only one who doesn't sing in the film.Watching and listening to Mr. Jackson play the blues is funny enough in itself, but when he hits the stage to a packed house who view him as the second coming of Robert Johnson ... again, I laughed! Did I mention a preacher shows up a couple of times? First to counsel Ricci about breaking the chains of her evil ways and again for couples counseling after a tearful and shaking Timberlake fails (yet again) to kill Jackson.This one is definitely not for everyone, as you might guess from the drugs, cursing, boozing, wild sex, assault, kidnapping, bondage, nearly naked people, frequent underwear moments, blues club dance moves and an overabundance of fringe religious bellowing. If you are a bit twisted, you will definitely see the humorous and campy moments and please don't take any of it too seriously.

I read some of the comments on Black Snake Moan and am thankful I didn't read them prior to my viewing this movie. So, I didn't have any expectations - good or bad. I actually felt this movie. The music, acting, and story line really goes through you. At times I felt thankful to the actor(s) for trusting their innermost feelings of fear, shame, heartbreak, and struggles to me. Even though I know it was a movie, it was so believable I felt as if a friend was confiding in me their deep feelings and was swept away with empathy. What a true movie of strength and courage. Not like the movies there are today where courage is shown through a gunfight or forced down your throat as if you have to be held by the hand and forced to feel.

Trashy and Dreary,"The town slut wakes up to find herself chained to the radiator of a man who sings the blues. It sounds like a great premise for a comedy, but this is a serious film. Ricci has little to do here except look slutty but she does so quite well. Jackson turns in a solid performance as the man who tries to cleanse her of her sins. It's hard, however, to get past the ridiculousness of the script. Another problem is that the film goes on too long. Once the premise has been established, the film has nowhere to go really, and it begins to drag. The promos for the film try to play up the angle of a luscious, young white woman chained by a black man, but it fails to deliver even as a trashy guilty pleasure.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

It can be difficult initially forgetting Justin Timberlake as a singer if you grew up on 'N Sync as I did, but I found him perfect for this role and he has done very well developing as an actor in my opinion. This movie was able to induce real emotion as I watched the characters' struggles, a testament to its depth.

If you feel mercy to someone who is lying helplessly on the road, you may actually be healing to yourselves. The love is complicated - but the most important message is that the one you may love ""just for one night"" may be loved deeply by someone else. Even if you successfully manage to intervene such relationship you may feel the difference between yours urge and the actual love... Even the poorest whores deserve some elementary respect. Be kind to other people. They may be kind to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
this movie is worth seeing,"this movie is on my own personal top ten.i was impressed by samuel's jackson voice and the feeling that passes to the viewer through the songs.now, it depend if you like Christina ricci in general(like me)you will love her in this role.she is a trouble girl who is been through family violence and she thinks that her life isn't worth a lot and thats why she has a kind of trash life,trash friends,she looks like she is trying to find a meaning in her life to feel a gap.thats when samuel jackson helps her to earn her self respect back.another thing i liked its how samuel's jackson life is the complete opposite than hers.they live in the same city but their experiences there are quite different.ricci is an outsider who everyone looks at her with pity and jackson is the honest guy who experience a society where people actually help each other.thats how i saw the movie i recommend it sincerely and even if you don't like blues i think you would love thesethank you for reading my first review",10.0,Anonymous,Music
There comes a time that we have to deal with the skeletons in our closet,"A classic example of the phrase ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"" Most of us had a bad way of life in the past that has a way of making us who we are today. Sure we hide it most of the time like Rae did but we know it is never very far from the surface. In real life, I've traveled the same road as Rae but lucky for me, I found my Lazarus, help from the most unlikely people you would ever think. There's a lot of truth to this movie, I think more than we care to admit. Mr. Brewer done an excellent job showing us that race is never an issue with the one who seeks help so desperately. Also, Black Snake Moans gave me an entirely different view about the Blues and where it really comes from. It tells your story but more so, it bemoans the hurt and pain that usually comes from a broken soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Pefect Film from Start to Finish,"After hearing the title ""Black Snake Moan"", most people are immediately turned off by the film. After bad marketing, I knew the movie looked very interesting, and after seeing it, I was ecstatic. Black Snake Moan is one of the best movies to hit theaters so far this year, and it's impressive mix of comedy and drama makes it a real gem. Black Snake Moan features Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Timberlake, and is written and directed by Craig Brewer.After finding her beaten on the side of the road, Lazarus (Jackson) takes in the extremely troubled Rae (Ricci), whose boyfriend, Ronnie (Timberlake) is away at war. Rae has a severe problem; she can't go very long without having sex with someone. After a troubled childhood, Rae has developed many problems of her own. Lazarus chains her to his radiator in the hope that he can, basically, rehabilitate her and ""cure her of her wickedness."" Ronnie returns from the war shaken and stirred, and he goes on a desperate search for Rae as she begins to take a daughterly liking toward Lazarus.The plot is wild, twisted, and very original, and it never really feels boring or contrived. The love story between Ronnie and Rae feels very real, and the violence and sexual content is extreme, but used very well. Lazarus is a sad character, and by the end, he finally finds someone he can relate to.As for the acting, Justin Timberlake proves he can act once again after his ground-breaking performance in Alpha Dog. Despite that most said he had a very miniscule role, Timberlake plays a central character that is prevalent through most of the movie. He plays Ronnie with saddening sincerity, and he brings a lot of depth and heart to the character. Christina Ricci, in possibly her most trying performance yet, never disappoints, and she really shines here. I loved every minute of the love story between Ricci and Timberlake. As for Samuel L. Jackson, he was likable for the first time as the pathetic but headstrong LazarusNormally, I'm not a very big Jackson fan, but he was at the top of his game here playing a soulful lonely blues man who has just emerged from a rocky relationship.Another plus to the film is that it goes very deep in terms of meaning and symbolism. The title is symbolic in more ways than one, and many other factors have several levels of meaning. Black Snake Moan is a truly extreme film that holds nothing back and weaves a careful web of character development and an amazing plot. Black Snake is sure to be seen as a classic in the years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie!!!,"Unbelievable Movie!! I loved it! The acting in this movie is AMAZING!!!!! There is No black and white, there are just people! Black Snake Moan is SO not what I expected, but much better! The actors are perfect, they all compliment one another, throughout the entire film! I CAN NOT believe that it took me so long to watch this movie!!Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson are transformed into their characters completely!! You can actually relate to the characters and their ""problems""/lives! Laz and Rae (Jackson and Ricci) lead two very different lives, yet they connect with essential the same dilemma! The language is a little rough at times, but helps tell the entire story! I recommend highly!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Watchable do its acting, but overall drag","There is good things and bad things in this movie. The good things, Ricci and Jackson bring their A game in their acting, some of the cinematography is good. But the story itself is quite tedious and boring. This is movie that could put someone to sleep. Had some drama in some parts, but their is long drawn out parts, that are pointless. I know is about setting up a mood, but It didn't do it for me. I don't mind the vulgarity of many parts of the movie, it did add a more real dimension to the movie.It was watchable film, the acting was great, but some of the plot was just kind of lame.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Packs a lot of punch but doesn't pull it all together,"First off, this Black Snake Moan probably has the best written reviews I've seen yet. Seems like everyone is trying to capture that bluesy Southern voice in their writing to good success. This film does have a rhythm to it that does get you talking in that voice, thinking in that voice and feeling in that voice. It's got a catchy thing going and a lot of kick like cayenne pepper but at the end of the day isn't as inspiring as it wants to be. Not to say you don't feel for the characters or like where they get to from where they come. But like blues there's a part that doesn't quite make sense even if you can feel it. And like a raw tune there's some loose ends and some of them have twisted together but the others, nah. I was waiting for a final collision at the end which doesn't come. I was wanting a deeper low and a higher high to carry off the film to a deep and resounding impact with a catharsis I didn't quite get. And in this film about addiction you do want that catharsis somewhere even if someone has to get a little more bruised to get there. I'm giving this film a 7 but it's a 7.5 leading to an 8/10. I'll recommend but the film is not the classic I wanted it to be.That said this movie does hit right in lots of places. Others call Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) the weak link of the film who should be cut out, but to me he was a believable weakling who I nonetheless rooted very much for, same as Christina Ricci's character Rae. I call him a weakling because he has a very big crutch on the inside-severe anxiety-which does make him act out of both ""malice"" and ""compassion"" as another reviewer very rightly said of all the characters. I like that Black Snake Moan doesn't put rose colored glasses on the weaknesses it's characters have. The preacher in the film R.J. Is always gone on about each and every one of us having sin and the trouble in most films is they don't deliver on they words but this film at least does. Changed my mind. Giving this film an 8/10. In a way this film does hit home even though not immediately in an impressive way, but it gets there on reflection.There is some very sexual contexts in this filmof course but actually it's not that graphic. You get the idea in dream like visions more than you are shown it. And with ideas like childhood sexual abuse you do want to allow privacy there. I think this film does nod to Rae's sexual exploits with some nudity and white drawers it seems like she was wearing for a couple days but there is a dignity to where it's important and if you know what the film is about you know what you're getting yourself into, but there isn't much of what I would call gratuitous. So good on the filmmakers for that.This film has great tone and flavor and sound and rather good consistency, development and execution, especially in giving the characters their shade and light (and some good cinematography and editing to boot), but I did wish for the full meal rather than a very good appetizer. There are some cut inserts of a blues man talking about the blues and what it does to people, and to me Black Snake Moan is like a blues song in its stark poetry and sometimes mumbling and slurring and a feeling about calloused fingers and the steel string. It's an artistic success but probably would've worked better either longer or shorter and it hits an in-between. Watch if you want a good story and are a Samuel L Jackson fan because he does say ""motherfu--"" while hitting up a purple guitar.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not bad...but over-rated,"I am of the opinion that Black Snake Moan is 80% of a truly great movie. If the writer/director had taken the time to really develop the characters I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more. As it is, I feel like I was force-fed tired, 2-dimensional, stereotypes with some quirks that MIGHT be interesting, if they were ever properly introduced. I think Ricci and Jackson did admirable jobs, all things considered.And that's the part that really kills me. It's not so much that the script was empty...or the characters 2-dimensional. They were obviously intense characters...but the audience is offered only the tiniest glimpse of their depth. The movie hints at characters and stories...without telling much of either. I found that wholly disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Very Good Film In An Odd Wrapper,"This is a film where the slogan, ""It's not what you think"", holds true. The film is about redemption and hope in the face of tremendous difficulties. The main character Rae, played by Christina Ricci, is a nymphomaniac. Her main man Ronnie, played by Justin Timberlake, has serious emotional problems. Both are adrift in a world that that is intent on devouring them. One of Rae's ""lovers"", Gill, played by Michael Raymond-James, who happens to be a so-called friend of Ronnie, severely beats her up and leaves her for dead. But this is where the story begins and I can only give you a few more details without ruining it for you. She is found unconscious and semi-naked the morning after Gill beat her by a black man named Lazarus, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who tends to her and helps her. I cannot give you any further details. See the film with an open mind. You won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Film, Not what was expected!!","We were basically forced to see this movie by my brother. It was him and his wife's turn to pick. I really did not know what to expect, but I was very leery simply from the previews. Let's just say I was very pleasantly surprised! While it had it's dirty moments, it wasn't a soft core porn like I was expecting. LOL It had a great concept, the acting was amazing and it left us all talking about it after wards. Samuel L. Jackson was as emotional and complex as ever. He has a way of making you feel exactly what it is he is feeling. This was a far cry from his Snakes on a Plane character. But I forgive him, all actors make mistakes! LOL Christina Ricci was in role I have never seen her in before. While it took some getting used to, it wasn't long before you either couldn't stand her character, could relate to her or felt pity for her. It was most assuredly not Casper! Justin Timberlake was a surprise. Since he has started acting, I have been curious to see if he had what it takes. I do believe he does. He is still green, but he has a way about him that I think will carry him far. Although I am not sure I cared for his character in this film to much.I believe the marketing of this film could have been handled differently. And unfortunately, many will not see this great film simply because of that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Credible Blues and Incredible acting,"I'd heard about this movie for years... usually attached to the fact that Ricci went a portion of the movie topless or scantily clad. But in the scheme of the movie...it wasn't about sex and nudity. it was about realising what you got, and what happens when you jeopardise what you got. It's also about The Blues too!Yeah, Jackson ain't the best singer... but damn, he sure can play! Numerous times my foot was tapping away.Ricci and Jackson were really involved into their characters (Ricci staying in 'character' by staying scantily clad on set much to Jackson's chagrin and Jackson learning to play the guitar) and it certainly showed on screen.Timberlake certainly showed promise as an actor as this was one of his early movie roles and was a credible supporting actor.By the end of the movie you learn that the one that can control your issues are you, yourself.

Brewer understands the Blues,"Okay, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you really should lock up the kids, throw some beer in the pickup and try like hell to find a theater...no, a drive-in showing ""Black Snake Moan,"" the second feature from the neo-Memphian who gave us ""Hustle and Flow."" What other movie in recent history takes outrageous clichés from 70's exploitation films and inverts them to produce a movie about redemption? What other movie can boast a good-hearted black man having everyday conversations with fellow-businessmen, a potential girl-friend or his preacher while the whole audience is chuckling to themselves ""yeah, except he's got a half-naked white chick chained up in his living room!!!"" What other movie has a scene played like a classic horror movie scene  ""Kid, whatever you do DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR!""  except what is behind the door is a very different kind of terror.But seriously, even with the over-the-top aspects of the movie (really not so ""over""  twenty minutes into it I was thinking ""Gee, I used to live next door to that girl in Memphis""), this is really a movie about people who are about as real as can be: good-hearted, wanting to fix life's problems and above all, looking for love even as they are hurting, conflicted and offhandedly profane. Watching this immediately makes you compare it to other depictions of ""Southern Culture"" (Dukes of Hazzard anyone?) and the comparison is like eating shredded pork from a can all your life, then discovering the slow-cooked contents of a blackened smoker under the stars of a warm Memphis night.The critics are all over the map on this one, and it seems like the more seriously one takes (or believes Craig Brewer takes) the surface trappings of the movie's genre, the less one likes it, while the more you see something both playful and deeper going on...well, check out the rather surprising review at HollywoodJesus for Pete's sake. This isn't an exploitation film, no matter what it looks like. What the movie really is about is the conjuring up of the spirit of the Blues, and there is a scene, a figurative raising from the musical dead amid a raging thunderstorm, that may well push you towards the nearest guitar shop as soon as the movie is over.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I still can't believe how good this film was!,"I had no clue as to what to expect when I decided to rent Black Snake Moan, I never heard of it and wasn't sure if it would be a good movie. But when I checked IMDb for the rating and the user comments, over all it's pretty good, so I rented it yesterday and just watched it a few moments ago. I have to say that I was actually very impressed with this film and how good it was. I know I might get bashed for this, but I was in awe that Justin Timberlake actually did a good job of acting. But it is Samuel and Christina that truly take this film. Together these two had incredible chemistry and really made the story work it's way into your heart on those who just need a hug and a reminder that life can be hard, but you just have to keep strong and know that there are better ways of handling life.Rae is a girl who just lost her boyfriend, Ronnie, he's going to fight the war. She's left in her little town where she has a bad reputation of sleeping around and she doesn't mind it either. But one night Ronnie's best friend gets mad when Rae insults his manhood and beats her up and leaves her at the side of the road. A divorced black man, Laz, finds her and takes her to his home to help her and make sure that he purifies her. Rae struggles at first, but after talking with Laz and his friends, she discovers that there's more to life than just hooking up with guys and that maybe she's worth something a little more.Christina Ricci has come such a long way since that little girl in The Addams Family, she is truly growing as an actress and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if she gets an Oscar nod in the future. She was really incredible in this film as Rae, she broke my heart and was very moving. Samuel did a great job as Laz as well, his scene where he's singing to Rae about his ex-wife and their life together made me cry, he was so wonderful to watch. I would recommend Black Snake Moan, it was a pleasure to watch and the story was inspiring to never give up on yourself.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I'm talking' about the Blues...""  Son House","The rhythm of the Blues is birthed down and dirty like Georgia clay or Mississippi mud. It is where the musician's feet seek out the surface to beat against which matches the cadence of the emotional flow that first quickens the heart to react discordantly to the pain of love gone wrong. As Son House, legendary blues singer and guitarist, tells us: ""I'm talking' about the Blues... When two people, supposed to be in love, when one or the other deceives the other through their love..."" It starts with a wail, a scream, a guttural cry from the throat of a seasoned songster or, maybe a saxophone will tell that part, and next the story behind it all is laid out in spades. Then, we cry. The Blues. There is nothing better on earth by which to heal a broken heart, whether that broken heart be from a failed marriage, loss of a loved one, a broken friendship for no good reason under the sun... All loss is like death, and listening to the blues is like having someone, even a stranger we just met at P.K.'s Place, who understands our innermost feelings sit right alongside us to grieve them to the ground.What 'Black Snake Moan', the movie, does is move us deeper to explore the underbelly of pain. It exposes the sheer ugliness of it, a portion of the malevolence of that which causes it and then it tears off the veil of the lie that says it can go away if you just want it bad enough. Moreover, it does not devalue the persons who experience pain and its effects. Is their (Rae and Ronny's) plight hopeless? Who knows? There has to be hope or let us just grant every nation permission to push the big red button that will allow us our collective journey to stand before our Maker. The fact that Laz reached out to help while mired deep in the newness of his own blues tune added a redemptive note. How beautiful with that gospel tone insinuated into his own despondent melodia. And, finally, the key to that redemption in the tone of black - sharp, but steady on. He found this ivory skinned doll, laid flat and damaged and then chose to take her in and let the melody of his father soul fuse with that of the child and ... well, you'll just have to see.Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci are two very fine actors and this movie is great for their contribution. S. Epatha Merkerson is an excellent addition to anything she is involved in, and this is no exception. While Justin Timerberlake may not possess finely honed acting skills at the point of this movie, what I saw in 'Social Network' certainly shows steady, quality growth. For crying out loud! He started out in a boy band, and now he's in an Academy Award winning movie. He's no slouch.Another aspect that makes this movie work is the combination of gritty country scenery and great Blues music. The fact that Samuel Jackson can hold his own on a song is certainly a benefit. Overall the whole piece is something this director can be proud of and I can't wait to see what else he comes up with. Craig Brewer would be an interesting man to have a conversation with considering his mind and heart wrote of the spiritual aspects built into the hard living, tough talking lives of these characters who still looked to their God.

Southern Themes without control,"Craig Brewer follows the success of Hustle and Flow with another, no holds barred, movie quest.

Timberlake simply does not have the depth of emotion needed to play the part of the messed-up boyfriend - fortunately he isn't on screen for long.The biggest sin in my book is taking a superb actor like SLJ and trying to turn him into a southern blues singer. He can't sing - he can't even do a southern accent, let alone mimic a blues-man. It's not his fault, but he just looks uncomfortable trying to live though his guitar. He has tremendous presence as always, but that's not really how I think Lazurus should be.I guess the entertainment factor is high, and the supporting cast are all very proficient.

Wow... Much better than I was expecting...,"I really didn't know what to expect with this movie. It was sold on its ""sex"" and Samuel L. Jackson, but it was so much more than just that.

It's great to see such an original movie made so well. It's quirky and unusual and completely original -- and best of all: It doesn't fall into the clichéd traps that you expect it to. It's not gory for the sake of it, the sex is actually a huge part of the storyline and it has a great sense of morality.

"Atmosphere, mythology, redemption, blues and a unique vision","Black Snake Moan is uproarious. It is over-flowingly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the American South almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a Fantasy or Ancient Greece epic. And yet as far high above us his movies hover, they are still rooted; rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is.As in traditional fairy-tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and stark character traits, when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in Pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film. But Brewer doesn't begin his film with ""once upon a time""; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; a dark, Gothic fable of sex, prostitution, and ultimately, redemption. These themes run through the film's veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, brooding setting.But despite these harsh extremes, Brewer treats his characters like humans, and creates extremely well-executed, three-dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized with their relationships with Lazerus' friend at the pharmacy, Angela, and Rae's mother.The acting is, all-around, quite perfect. One gets the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so severe; it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters. And they succeed admirably. Samuel L. Jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character's he's played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft, and others, he has crafted for himself a typecast of the ""ultimate bad-ass"". In Black Snake Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything he's done before. And frankly, it's just fantastic. What comes as quite a surprise, though, is the casting of Justin Timberlake, and more specifically, the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable. Sure he doesn't have much screen time, but like what Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he actually gets Timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do, and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating.But what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere Brewer creates. The rural Southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark, dirty, grimy, crusty, rugged kind of texture to the entire film, which more than fits in with the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects. And by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of cicadas when Rae gets her itch, or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as Lazarus plays his ""Black Snake Moan"" blues number for Rae, Brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world, an undermined mythology to the rural Southern setting. And it works so utterly fantastically to craft Brewer's unique vision.And one can't talk about a Craig Brewer film without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he utilized a soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision. In this film, the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere. It is a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. And it sounds just absolutely fantastic.In all, it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old, broken, lonely, god-fearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania, there may have not been very much to write home about. But this film is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as they are crafted in the film regardless. No, this film is about the vision  and what a unique vision it is! It is about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. It is about anger, fear, redemption, and most importantly, the blues. And it's all wrapped up in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable ribbon. Brewer has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising up-and-coming directors list, and with such a solid follow-up to a great debut film, Hustle & Flow, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects.It also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've heard yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An Story with Depth,"Initially I was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the DVD. In fact, this held true with friends of mine who didn't rent it due to the art and the mental image(s) it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me (or to my friends). But, I rented and watched it and was truly amazed.I agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual inferences, so it is definitely not something I'd want young children to watch (and doubt seriously if they would understand it anyway).I enjoy movies like this whereby the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a no-nonsense, direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad. The acting done ... was it acting? Ricci and Jackson performed so well, I was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting. Same thing with the story ... may seem far-fetched somewhat, but it was done so very, very well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so were well-defined.I found much depth in this movie with the character's involved, so feel that everyone involved (from the cameramen to the actors) should be commended on a perfect fit/result. After viewing this movie, I had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like I did, so after hearing my comments, they rented and watched it. They, too, were quite surprised at how good it was. It is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off. I can see now how the art applies, but I'd not heard of this movie before, and the art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales/rentals.These characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the ""feel"" for each. I felt I could trust the movie to flow well, and it did. So, with the jacket art aside, I would recommend watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Let it shine, let it shine, let is shine","Black Snake Moan is an exploitation film that is sort of classy and presentable. Its focus isn't on gory violence or action set pieces, but characters, their pasts, and their present. Here is a film that has great actors, and set its sights mainly on their performances rather than their actions.The story centers around a blues singer turned farmer in the Deep South named Lazarus (Jackson) and nymphomaniac Rae (Ricci). They each pack their own emotional baggage, with Lazarus's wife cheating on him, leaving him frustrated and angry, and Rae's boyfriend Ronnie (Timberlake) leaving for deployment in the National Guard.Rae stumbles into Lazarus's clutches, when he finds her laying beaten and mutilated at the side of the road. He takes her in and lays her on the couch, before her awakening frightened and worried. Lazarus doesn't want to hurt her, but plans to lead her away from the life of promiscuity she has chosen to pursue. She has sex with anyone, and what will happen afterwards is a mystery to us and to her.To make sure she doesn't escape, Lazarus ties a huge metal chain around Rae's waist and the radiator. He is surrounded by thick, heavy wilderness, so it is certain no one will hear the madness unfolding. Thank goodness, because Lazarus and Rae exchange a number of four letter words and bitter dialog throughout the film, relentlessly achieving greatness in their performances.Samuel L. Jackson is marvelous here. I've read that he spent hours learning how to perfect blues music, and Ricci walked around scantily-clad all the time and ate a very minuscule amount during filming. In order to achieve a great performance, actors/actresses must immerse themselves in the roles of their characters. Jackson and Ricci do, and that's the main reason why the film works extremely well.Writer/Director Craig Brewer has done a fantastic job at not only showing the seamy atmosphere and troubles that exist in the Deep South, but also at creating characters we can sympathize with. Main characters we can not have an strong opinion about, show affection to, or sympathize with, in my book, are worthless characters.Black Snake Moan is constructed well, and never sees a dry moment. It has a keen sense of grittiness and possesses a desire to go as far as it can without being too implausible or cutesy. The performances are strong, the delivery is subtle, and the atmosphere is contagious. If there was a way to depict the Dirty South as a seamy place of optimism, then it was done perfectly.Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Timberlake. Directed by: Craig Brewer.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
not at all what you might expect,"The plot is like something out of one of those decadent-Southern melodramas by William Faulkner or Tennessee Williams:A morally righteous, blues-playing cuckold finds a scantily clad nymphomaniac beaten to a bloody pulp and left for dead on the side of the road. He carries the initially unconscious woman to his shack where he proceeds to nurse her back to physical and spiritual health. Oh, and, by the way, did I mention that she's chained to a radiator a good deal of the time?Based on the overheated premise and imagery alone, ""Black Snake Moan"" could easily have been either a sadomasochistic horror film or a kinky sex fantasy (or a twisted combination of both). Instead, writer/director Craig Brewer clearly sees this material as a return to the great Southern Gothic tradition of the literary past, replete with hints of potential madness, elaborate sexual perversion, and an undercurrent of racial tension to go along with all the heat and humidity.It is difficult to pigeonhole ""Black Snake Moan,"" for it is neither a parody of an exploitation film nor an exploitation film itself. Very little of it is actually played for laughs, and that, I think, is what makes the movie successful in the long run. It attacks the material with such a knowing earnestness that we are swept up into the drama despite being supremely conscious at all times of just how preposterous the whole thing is.As a thoughtful artist, Brewer uses his disturbing imagery to plumb the turbid depths of his audience's subconscious. The sight of a young woman helplessly chained to a radiator, for instance, inevitably conjures up images of slavery, rape, sexual and racial dominance, etc. in the viewer's mind (the irony, of course, is that, in this case, it is the black man who has the white person in chains). Yet, once we strip away all the aberrant imagery from the story, what we're ultimately left with is a simple tale of two bruised and potentially self-destructive individuals reaching out to one another in ways that the society around them and even they themselves can't quite understand. The relationship between the farmer, Lazarus, and the nympho, Rae, is a richly detailed and complex one, for despite his distasteful approach, Lazarus is, in reality, a compassionate man reaching out to a stranger in need to show her that there is a better, more spiritually fulfilling way for people to live. Through their superb performances, Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci (who has lost much of her baby-fat and moon-face and become very sexy indeed) turn what could have been two ""decadent Southern"" caricatures into fully-rounded human beings. There are also very fine performances by Justin Timberlake, John Cothran Jr., and S. Epatha Merkerson in support of the two leads.Brewer has paced his film just right, giving the two characters time to develop their relationship amidst the more sensationalistic plot elements floating around them. He also makes the sweltering Deep South setting an integral part of the drama.Don't let the more unsavory aspects of the imagery and the plotting scare you off this movie. ""Black Snake Moan"" is really an inspiring and moving story about how spiritual redemption and emotional healing come through simple acts of human kindness.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Sammy the Snake strikes again!!,"Not every day do you see a film that can present mindless humor in a mindful thought-provoking masterpiece. Fortunately Black Snake Moan is definitely one of these movies. Samuel L. Jackson delivers another solid performance complete w/ gritty guitar-playing. Christina Ricci delivers a well-acted performance, although she can be a bit annoying at times. I'm gaining respect for Justin Timberlake since the SNL skit and after seeing his performance in this movie, things have never looked better for him. Some of the scenes w/o Sammy can drag, but the movie's themes balance it out and make for an enjoyable time for all. I don't know how Sammy stumbled on the snake theme, but it's definitely working for him. Maybe Hollywood will remake one of those crappy Anaconda films and cast him as the lead.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Nutshell Review: Black Snake Moan,"This movie oozes sexiness, attitude and wacky fun, with loads of quirkiness all round. With stars Justin Timberlake, Christina Ricci and Samuel L Jackson, Black Snake Moan is a movie with some of the more unconventional characters put on screen, and with Jackson on board, you can be sure that he brings forth some of that mo-fo traits that features prominently in his movies.Ricci plays Rae, the village bicycle who is ridden by almost everyone in town. And I really mean almost everyone. We'll find out the reason how this condition was inflicted, but in the meantime, she's more than eager to shed her clothes to get her sexual fix, or doesn't bat an eyelid to prostitute herself to feed her drug addiction. With her white trash reputation, only her love for Ronnie (Timberlake) is true, but that doesn't stop her from cheating on him behind his back.Jackson's Lazarus has just emerged from a broken marriage, the victim of being cheated upon. A God-fearing man, I would've half expected he start to recite some verses in the Bible while blowing someone's brains off (oh wait, that's the other movie). But nonetheless here's Jackson in his element, and the story gets hastened when he finds Rae near his home, half naked and battered. Not knowing what else to do, and taking it as a signal from God, he takes it upon himself to nurse Rae back to health, and through religion and friendship, tries to exorcise those evil demons within her.And he does so by firstly, chaining her up. While there are suggestive shades of S&M here, there's nothing kinky about it, so don't expect Jackson and Ricci steaming up the screens. Much against her wishes to have her movements restricted, Lazarus ""will not be moved!"" in inflicting cold-turkey styled treatments on Rae, and most of the fun comes in when they go head to head in a battle of wills.But as expected, a deep friendship ensues, and Lazarus becomes a surrogate father of sorts, which brings us to other highly anticipated moments in the movie, when Jackson sings the blues! Armed with his guitar, perhaps those segments are the most entertaining of the lot, when he goes into full swing and performs with cool, slick attitude to boot. I haven't heard of any blues tunes with profanity, and only Samuel L. Jackson does it best when on form!And what of Timberlake you say? He plays the lovelorn boy who volunteers for the army, and for the most parts is not on screen. Not surprising too is that he doesn't sing anything (as per his role in Shrek 3), and his character is actually a wussy. This movie definitely played on Ricci and Jackson's strengths and chemistry, which they have delivered most excellently.Sex, violence, and Samuel L Jackson. Now aren't those reasons enough to watch Black Snake Moan? It doesn't take itself too seriously, so as long as you're not expecting some Oscar worthy material, you're in for a rip-roaring heckuva ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Fantastic!,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen! It was definitely not what I expected when I rented it, but it was a pleasant surprise.

Two great leads can't save cliché filled tripe,"""Black Snake Moan"" drips in atmosphere, but it's clichéd, meandering, and mostly offensive. Samuel L. Jackson plays a Tennessee blues man looking for redemption and find his chance by ""helping"" stereotypical white trash Christina Ricci. After finding a drunken, half-naked, and beat up Ricci along the roadside, he chains her to his radiator in order to provide tough love until she agrees to change her party girl ways. Yep, the film is just that offensive! Jackson and Ricci are both strong actors and are compulsively watchable, even when they're saddled with garbage like this, but it's only their screen presence that makes this film barely watchable.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Truly Underrated Film,"I finally got around to watching this film last evening. I had avoided it based on some reviews and the nasty impression most of the film's publicity and advertising gave me, especially the images. I believe that by pandering to that part of the public that looks for nothing but ""sex and violence"" in their entertainment, the publicists removed any opportunity for the film to be taken seriously. And it should be taken seriously.Had this film been a foreign film produced during the 1960s or 1970s, for example, it wouldn't have been promoted so inanely and at such a primitive level. It would have been pushed as a sensitive study of two very troubled lovers caught up in a tangle of suffering and misunderstanding. Minus the level 50 IQ posters of half naked women in chains, the story would have a chance to be seen for what it is.I like this film. I like it a lot and it had nothing to do with Ms. Ricci gallivanting around in the all together. I liked it because I understood it and my guess is that most of the critics that panned this film haven't seen enough life to understand what they were really watching.Bravo to the writers, cast and director for a beautiful, sensitive piece of work and shame, shame on the low life Hollywood hucksters that brought the entire advertising campaign of an adult film down to their own gutter level juvenile thought process. This film has my highest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An aging southerner's life collides with a young troubled girl's in an unexpected way,"This movie is nothing like I expected it to be after seeing the trailer; less kinky, less dirty, admittedly, than the ""theme"" of having a young chick chained up in an aging man's house might evoke. It ended up being a pleasant surprise, a good watch. Acting is excellent, especially Ricci and Jackson, but even Timberlake surprised me by a good, human performance. All the characters who appear are believable.The makers did a good job on accuracy; a girl who gets hit still has a bruise days later, things don't miraculously disappear overnight.The whole film breathes, exudes the atmosphere of blues, of the American south really, really well. The imagery is at times so evocative you can almost feel the sun and smell the soil and the hot summer air. While a drama and at times grim, and definitely not a sappy Hollywood comedy, this passes as a 'feel good movie' to which I'm likely to return (re-watch).And the soundtrack is to die for.

"A solid, little second film...","A solid, little second film...As he demonstrated in his far superior Hustle & Flow (2005), Brewer has a solid feel for the milieu and vernacular of rural, working-class Southerners, black and white. There's a down- home, gritty verisimilitude to both that film and Black Snake Moan, which is only enhanced by Brewer's use of music for emotional texture. Unlike Hustle and Flow, however, Black Snake Moan is a vague and unfocused film, pitched uncertainly between steamy exploitation flick and character study, which promises far more than it delivers. Touching, albeit in cursory fashion, on long-standing social and racial taboos vis-à-vis the power dynamic between Lazarus and Rae, Brewer apparently loses his nerve at about the halfway mark, for the rough, sexually charged edge to their relationship dissipates, giving way to a safe, surrogate father- daughter bond. As it turns out, all poor little trampy Rae needs is a hugditto that for Lazarus, who rediscovers his love of blues by performing at a local juke joint. It's a simplistic and unsatisfying narrative turn, regrettably one of many in the second half of Black Snake Moan, a frustrating film that ultimately leaves you singin' the blues about Brewer's dual failure of imagination and nerve.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

What Hollywood thinks the South is like I suppose,"This movie isn't too bad but it isn 't too good either.I suppose this is what some Hollywood snot nosed producer thinks the South is all about.A down and out blues singer turned roadside vegetable peddler hooks up with the towns local white trash slut and he attempts to cure her unquenchable desire to be porked by any man she sees.The plot was OK and the story was pretty original and the acting was good but all in all this movie missed the mark.The unbridled sex desire of the girl was a bit over the top and the music that the bluesman,played by Samuel L Jackson,was throwing down was pretty lame.This movie would have been much better with some real blues song by someone who really knew how to do them.The watered down music in this movie really fizzled out instead of adding to the movie.Christina Ricci is partly naked most of the movie and she keeps her white panties spotless has she endures endless porkings while rolling around on the floor,ground,or truck seat.Anyway this movie is a bit silly in places,okay in other places but never really dull which rescues it from being a total waste.So all in all its a middle of the road watchable movie which in this day and age is about as much as we can expect from most of the films that are made.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Samuel L. Jackson's best performance in years,"It's a shame this film didn't do so well at box office, I can see why. But it's still a good film. I liked the movie ""Hustle and Flow"" so I decided to check this film out which is done by the same director. The plot is about a girl Rae(Christina Ricci) who is a broken down girl and doesn't give 2 cents about herself, mainly cause of past and just goes around sleeping with anyone. And Lazarus(Samuel L. Jackson) is a preachy kinda guy that tries to get Rae's life back together. Samuel L. Jackson put on a excellent performance in this film and he really did impress me a lot, probably his best performance in years. His character was detailed and complex in a way that really does draws in the audience's attention. Justin Timberlake, plays Rae's boyfriend who goes into the military, he acting was okay for a pop idol, I guess.

Gripping Blues-Fueled Tale of Salvation,"This movie blew me away. I'm not sure what I was expecting going in, but the poster art had definitely grabbed my attention. I had seen director Craig Brewer's previous hit, HUSTLE & FLOW, and thought it was great. Brewer continues the music theme with BLACK SNAKE MOAN, a blues-fueled tale of one man's search for salvation through his attempt to help rescue another. Samuel L. Jackson is Lazarus, an aging blues musician whose wife just ran off with his brother. One morning, he comes across the beaten unconscious form of Rae, a local girl with a wild reputation as a nymphomaniac, on the road outside his home. Lazarus takes her home, nurses her back to health, and decides to help her change her wicked ways; to ensure she doesn't run off in the meantime, he chains her to the radiator in his living room.This stands out as one of Jackson's best performances and I feel it was a crime that he received no awards (or nominations) for it. His character is a deeply troubled man who's come upon hard times and this is no better displayed than when he busts out his guitar to belt out some blues. Jackson performs his own vocals and even learned to play the guitar for this role, giving his performances that extra authenticity. Christina Ricci is equally perfect as Rae, injecting her with Southern sass while letting bits of purity seep out as Laz's lessons finally begin to reach her. She was the best possible choice to play this role; I don't believe any other actress would've been as able to bring the same beauty, strength, and eventual innocence to the character. Probably the biggest surprise upon viewing this movie was how well Justin Timberlake did in his supporting role as Rae's boyfriend Ronnie, a boy with severe anxiety who's departure for the military sets off the chain of events in the film. I had not seen Timberlake act prior to this film and I was beyond impressed with his capabilities.The film is strengthened through the wonderful supporting cast, particularly John Cothran as Laz's best friend and local preacher R.L. Still, the most important supporting player in this film remains the music. Brewer uses the blues as a tool for Lazarus and Rae to exorcise themselves of their demons and this is best displayed in a scene where Laz performs the title song (""Black Snake Moan"") to Rae one stormy evening and we watch as Laz pours his heart out while Rae struggles to cope with traumatic events from her past. The film culminates into a third act that didn't have the same emotional kick as the rest of the film, but still leaves the characters with hope for a better future. I've seen that many attribute this movie's poor box office performance to poor marketing but I hope that through word-of-mouth this film will find a grander audience, as it's a powerful movie that I recommend to anyone who's ever had the blues.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.

Than every once in a while a movie comes along that just shines with originality and has a story and plot line that hasn't been seen before. Black Snake Moan has just that, it's different from any other movie out there and thats what makes it a great movie, along with excellent performances by Samuel L.

Great Movie,"With movie icons such as Sam Jackson and Christina Ricci, how can you go wrong. Justin Timberlake does very well for his first time out. This movie may not be Oscar material but still a good movie. Jackson plays his role well and is a believable character whose good will is partially due to the loss of his wife to his brother and his inner struggle for meaning and purpose due to this loss. He is a Christian man doing what he thinks God as ordained him to do and heal a woman spiritually and socially who he finds beaten and unconscious near his rural home.

"Fantastic! ""Suffa"" this and you won't be sorry!","Black Snake Moan came and went kind of fast at the theaters, so I wasn't sure what to expect. WOW! This is one terrific movie! I honestly don't think it could be much better, and for me thats saying something. I'm really not familiar with Craig Brewer, did see ""Hustle and Flow"", but he is something to have written and directed something this cool.Sam Jackson is often called the ""Coolest MF on the planet"" he proves it here. He is just superb as a wounded blues-man. Christina Ricci is also excellent as a out-of-control nymphomaniac. And even Justin Timberlake (!), is fine.The story is bound to be judged by some as misogynistic and silly, but I found it riveting. Who knew Sam Jackson could sing? He does a fine job. Christina as Rae, just hits all the right notes, I've seldom seen an actress with more guts, she spends most of this film in her underwear! She just perfectly portrays a girl who can't help it.There are loads of powerful scenes in this-Laz playing to Rae during the thunderstorm, Lincoln coming to find Rae chained to Laz's radiator. There's plenty of faith and good humor here. It is graphic, this is not for children, and I did have a slight problem with the Blues club scene, the language and primal cane seemed a bit at odds with the cathartic stuff Laz tried to save Rae with before. In fact my only complaint in this is the pervasive profanity. If you talk filth all the time isn't it in you? But that aside its great. The last scene in particular, after the wedding, is an extremely important and well-acted closer and both Ricci and Timberlake do very well. It's the type of closure you don't expect in Southern Gothic like this. Awesome movie. See it!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great,"Black Snake Moan (2006)**** (out of 4)A washed up bluesman (Samuel L. Jackson) finds a broken and beaten town trash (Christina Ricci) on the side of the road and chains her up in hope that he can cure her of her sins. Writer and director Craig Brewer caught my attention a couple years back with the brilliant Hustle and Flow, which I picked for the best film of the year and he's back again with another settle yet very powerful film. It's rather amazing to what such a young director take a simple story and do wonders with it but Brewer is proving himself to be one of the best talents up there. On a technical level he can do more with a lower budget than most directors can do with ninety-million. The visual style of this film hits all the right notes with the beautiful heat and passion of the South crashing through the screen creating such an atmosphere that you can feel the sun beating down on you. The way Brewer frames the shots or simply moves the camera helps tell the story so well even when nothing much is happening on the screen. Ricci gives the best performance I've seen from her as the white trash with a load of problems but the real standout here is Jackson who finally shows up that when he's not playing the bad mother that he can act. Jackson has become rather boring the last several years by just playing the cool and tough guy that I had forgotten how great he can be when he tries. He also did quite well when it comes time to sing the blues. Justin Timberlake also turns in fine work, which after this and Alpha Dog shows he can act. The film takes its time in delivering the story but it leads to a very emotional, powerful yet quiet ending, which the director pulls off without having to preach or beat the viewer over the head.",,Anonymous,Music
"""You are my sunshine, my only sunshine...""","Samuel L. Jackson is one of the most admirable (and greatest) of living American actors. Every performance he gives is imbued with immense passion and life, even when he's reduced to punching snakes and sword-fighting with philosophic Muppets. Black Snake Moan is certainly no exception. It can easily be called one of his greatest performances right alongside Pulp Fiction, Changing Lanes, and Jungle Fever.Jackson is Lazarus, a Southern farmer and gifted bluesman who's in the middle of a volatile divorce from his wife, Rose (Adriane Lennox). One morning, he looks and sees half-naked Rae (Christina Ricci) beaten bloody and lying in the middle of the road. He picks her up, takes her inside, and nurses her back to health. Oh, and he attaches her to a fifty-pound steel chain so she can't escape.See, Rae is a nymphomaniac, and occasionally has ""spells"" where she gets antsydown there and has to have it fixed right quick. Her boyfriend and main nookie source, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), has just shipped off to war leaving Rae to look to the local boys for satisfaction. After one particularly rough encounter with one of Ronnie's buddies, she ends up in front of Lazarus' house.The film rises above its seemingly ludicrous premise by correctly doing everything that a great movie is supposed to do. As mentioned before, Jackson is superb as Lazarus. Needless to say, he nails the character's rage perfectly, while also capturing Lazarus' damaged faith and empty heart to perfection. That's where Rae comes in. Brilliantly played by Ricci, Rae has a deeply damaged past and Lazarus is just what she needs: a strong and positive father figure. In a wise move, Brewer keeps the sexual tension in check, releasing just enough to keep the story interesting and believable. This isn't a story about sex; it's about humanity, and how even in the ugliest of circumstances, we have the ability to heal each other. There's a haunting and incredibly moving scene where, with the assistance of his guitar, Lazarus helps Rae confront and defeat the demons at her door both literally and figuratively. It's one of the most powerful I can remember in recent years.Even Justin Timberlake comes across as impressive. When Ronnie returns and learns of Rae's relationship with Lazarus, he confronts the situation head on. The scene could have come across as contrived were it not for Timberlake's performance and Craig Brewer's excellent direction. Another strong supporting performance is delivered by John Cothran Jr. as R.L., Lazarus' preacher friend. He delivers some of the film's best writing in an excellent monologue, questioning modern Christians' emphasis on heaven rather than doing good while you're alive.In a time of stunted originality and overused ideas, Brewer is a godsend. Here, he expands upon the immense promise he showed in his previous film, Hustle and Flow, which garnered Terence Howard a much-deserved Oscar nomination. He has a clear, innovative vision and follows it through to the end. And isn't that the first sign of a gifted filmmaker?",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Film That Will Stay With You,"I saw this film cold ... hadn't read reviews, hadn't seen any ads, didn't have any expectations. And it blew me away! The story is about people searching for their souls and you just might find your own in the process of watching it. Like the ""blues"" played throughout the picture, you're high, you're low, you're happy, you're sad, you're hungry, you're thirsty, you're satiated, you're alive. And what makes you feel best in life is doing both for yourself and for others.I walked away from the film with feelings coursing through me and thoughts jumbling out of my brain. True art is supposed to move you emotionally and intellectually and this movie certainly did that for me.The leads are sensational ... they are their characters without ever a false note. And the supporting characters add a perfect punctuation to the piece.I don't suspect everyone will like this movie -- it's an odd little piece that's difficult to pigeonhole. I don't know if I could watch it again -- possibly too emotionally exhausting. But it's certainly a film I'll think about for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Black Snakes on a Moaning Plane,"There are very few true pioneering directors left, especially in Hollywood, and Craig Brewer is definitely NOT one of them. Whenever you see all the hob-knobbers, insiders, and ""critics"" fawning over how ""genius"" or ""real"" a movie or director is, and all the a-list actors scrambling to be involved (and patting themselves on the back for how good of a job they did), you know that 99% of the time, the crap factor will be off the scale. This is not a message movie. There are no deep life lessons learned by the characters, and no moments of catharsis. No complex social comments either. Sound just like ""Hustle & Flow""? You betcha! If you like meandering exploitation flicks that appeal to lowest-common-denominator, no-IQ audiences, and you like ""keepin' it real"", then you'll love ""Black Snake Moan"". But if you want to see serious and/or subversive movies about race relations, Southern stereotypes, sexual politics and the like, you'll do best to go back to 70's cinema. Watch Larry Cohen's ""Bone"" and you'll see what I mean. There are no movies like that being made these days. Hell, even the old Pam Grier sexploitation/vigilante flicks are more interesting than any Bush-era, ""breakthrough"" green-lighted crapola being squeezed from Tinseltown's swollen, polyp-encrusted rectum. Of course, there are a few exceptions, both inside Hollywood and out, but I won't turn this into a movie list. Besides, this is my first review on IMDb.com. I'm not even sure why I picked this movie to berate. I guess I just got angry watching the DVD extras, with all those bloated, clueless, no-talent pablum-pushers trying to emulate intelligence. My first baby poo had more grit and variety.",,Anonymous,Music

Great acting and plenty of culture.,"Y'know, culture. Like all the characters just seem so real and the places lived in and all that. What was cool was I quickly felt like I knew the people and wanted to help them and get to know them. That's rare. Usually we're given cardboard cut-outs and dramatic music. Here we got the blues. And a nice sense of the location. And I just love the spirituality that all black people seem to share almost from birth. The natural performances and directing mean that I can enjoy observing these fascinating people and all their well-established ways of livin', talking', walkin' 'n' whatnot as if I was actually there.Christina Ricci seems to somehow completely embody her character. Same sort of thing with Samuel L. Jackson. Because of his strong personality, it can be a little frustrating at times that all of his roles end up seeming too much like only slightly different sides of the exact same person. But here we get something different. Less of the arrogant confidence and more of a person in need of redemption. Old wounds or something. Fascinating to just watch and reflect on. When he plays guitar, we get the impression he really understands the blues. Like he's telling a story. And as if there's so much hidden in the voice that all you want to do is listen. I liked the part when the pharmacy woman sang for him. Just a nice moment. The healing power of music. Soothing tones falling on open ears.Whatever, I just liked this. There are moments of humour and plenty of drama. No particular reason or rhyme, like life itself. Great blues music. The kind that everyone can love because of what it means. No pretensions. Just music. Singin' yer soul out. I liked how the priest guy was always encouraging his subjects to let it all out. To go on talking it through. Like therapy. We can all use it (need it) at times. Peace and freedom and religion. Was that the point of the movie? Sure, that was part of it for me. But it let's you choose. Who knows what life's about anyway? So maybe 'twas the directness of the movie that I liked. Truth. Pure and simple. And then beauty and humour and love and meaning and yada yada yada are abundant if you can just see them.Recommended especially if you're open minded. In any case, it's a different kind of story. Like really visiting a place. Some'll enjoy and remember it better than others. So go watch it :)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
good lord almighty,"this is a great movie. good music. awesome performance by Samuel l Jackson. good writing. it's unapologetically religious, which i suppose if a movie has to be religious it should be all ""aww shucks"" about it. the presence of Justin timberlake is a distraction although minor. but here's what it comes down to. Christina ricci is scorching. she is so hot in this movie she could singe lead. it's embarrassing how hot she is. i felt the uncontrollable desire to fertilize her through the screen via some metaphysical conjuring trick. watching this alone in the theater i felt somehow dirty. it was difficult, truth be told, to even give much thought to the plot, dialogue, camera work, visual strategies, cinematography or much of anything else in the movie because she was such a marvelous feast for the eyes. i like Christina ricci perfect 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
great performances by Christina  Ricci and Samuel L Jackson,"I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed by Sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is great as Lazarus' love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's boyfriend Ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A poster doth not a movie make,"I believe it's a oversimplification to think people would be turned off the film from simply seeing the Black Snake Moan poster. There are far too fans of Samuel L Jackson, an actor known to take risks in his choice of roles, to summarily dismiss a new picture simply based on one image from an entire film. I knew from the title it had to have something to do with the Blues, which tweaked my interest immediately. For many, that alone will spur enough interest to want to see Black Snake Moan. Most people who eventually see it will have seen the trailer, as I have, and the effect of the poster will have no bearing at all. Merely the fact Samuel L Jackson is in it is reason enough to see Black Snake Moan.",,Anonymous,Music
"Good film with humor,drama and good performances","Rated R for strong sexual content, language, some violence and drug use.Black Snake Moan is a film starring Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci.I was interested in seeing this film because I think Samuel L Jackson is an excellent actor.He shows us his acting skills in films such as Pulp Fiction.This film is no exception, he is great in this as well.I am not a big fan of Justin Timberlake but even he surprised me with his acting skills.The acting in this film is great overall.The film is about a born again Christian who sings the blues.He finds a nymphomaniac woman who has been beaten and left for dead on the road and picks her up.This all happens while her boyfriend is gone.The blues-man tries to help the girl get her life together with some funny results.But overall this film has a lot of heart and is a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Is this what they call a sleeper?,"Wow. Once you get by the beginning with the red neck girl flapping her tits around this evolves into the movie of the year, in it's genre. Samuel L. Jackson has never been one to take on easy roles, and Christina Ricci has proved her grit. I totally agree with the projectionist, this movie should not be grouped with ""Snakes on a plane"". It tugs at the heart strings, illustrating the close bonds of the coloured community in the south, and at the same time showing their compassion for anyone in need. The long term effects of sexual abuse of minors is not thrown in our face, but made quite evident. I am very happy the writer and producer chose a happy ending. There was an easy out for an unhappy one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Very good performances from Jackson and Ricci.,"I thought Black Snake Moan would be one of those Walk The Line type of movies but I was completely wrong as Samual L Jackson adds another interesting character to his already impressive CV. The story is what attracted me to it in the first place, about a deeply religious blues player named Lazurus whose missus has just left him and he is pretty cut up over it but tries not to let it get to him as he holds his faith near to him whilst on the other side we have Rae (by far Chritina Ricci's best role to date) who is one could say a version of 'the beast in the heat'. The plot is not really that big , but what the film does show us is that if you take away all the stuff that is going on around them they are at the end of the day two troubled souls reaching out for love. Chracther development was the main the thing that this film focused on and done a wonderful job of people going into Lazurus and Rae's lives. Samual L Jackson was brilliant as the blue's guitarist and I really enjoyed every moment he was stringing his stuff. Chirstina Ricci'e performance was the one that moved me and I felt she was the star of the show and Timberlake done well with his small performance. To conclude Black Snake Moan was something different from what I would normally see , the film deals with a lot of taboo themes of drug abuse , interracial relations , Nudity etc but it goes beyond that and makes the viewer see it for what the core subject is at hand. I would recommend to people who would like to view something different for a change but I would say check it out when it comes out for rental or on TV.BLACK SNAKE MOAN - 8.1 OUT 10Everything IS HOTTER DOWN SOUTH !",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Raw and dirty - like a good blues song,"""Black Snake Moan"" is hardly the film it appears to be on the outside or how it was initially promoted, which was some sort of exploitative black man chains up white girl type scenario. True, that basic element does exist, but Craig Brewer's film is something far more. Appropriately coming from the filmmaker whose breakthrough was the hustler-turned-hip-hop-artist semi-masterpiece ""Hustle & Flow"", ""Black Snake Moan"" is a filmed blues song with its spiritualism, grittiness, and organic feel. Although it occasionally plays out more like a modern day parable than with a straight-forward plot, the film tells the story of a wild and young small town woman with a sordid past who crosses paths with a recently separated God-fearing man in search of redemption. Through several methods that serve the salaciousness of the cinema and the emotive musical scope of the film, the man struggles to heal her of her ill ways. This is all very interesting, and seemingly original stuff here that has a lot to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It's not about the south...,"I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.It's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. It's unorthodox, but well worth the time. And, my goodness, is the sound track hot.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I hate Justin Timberlake.,"Sitting about bored i decided to search Netflix for a film and whilst scrolling along the title ""Black Snake Moan"" caught my eye. I had seen this film when it was released, but as i was younger it didn't invoke as much interest as it did now.This film is sensational. The story is riveting and what can be said about Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci? Both knocking it out of the park; completely in sync with each other....in sync....N SYNC!!!!! Which brings me to Justin bloody Timberlake.This guy is a scene sucking, drama devouring waste of space. I just cannot comprehend why, why any director would sacrifice the overall brilliance of a film by casting someone because of their success in another field of entertainment. He is a singer!!!! Not an actor. He is terrible. Every ""emotion"" he extracts shows this obvious desperation and it is a punch to the face of the viewer. Watching two powerhouse performances and then a little cretin coming onto scene and destroying the credibility that was once soaring to great heights. Brought back down to earth with a FUD.By the end of the film i was trying to hold onto all the great moments in the film; Jackson's soulful music, Ricci's captivating cry for help. But at the back of mind is this little sting, a prick if you will, that because of a certain somebody the film feels tainted.Damn you Timberlake, i hate you.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
9 bullets right to the M----- F------- Chest!,"I must admit, I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. I also didn't expect Samuel L.

They advertise movies in the lobby, get you all excited about seeing it, and then disappoint you by not showing it...I Expected that with such a great cast of Jackson and Ricci and even a former N'Syncer (Timberlake), that this movie would at least have shown for a week. But nay, at that time if I remember correctly MI3 was showing on 3 screens (that or some other type of supposed blockbuster).Like Blues Brothers, and Crossroads, this movie incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about. Passion, and hard times. Religion and Sex. Hell Hounds of the past. Redemption. I mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work.This was just a good all around story. Of course, not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging spiders. But it does have Samuel L.

A Surprisingly Great Film,"Votes 0 +0 / -0 thumb up thumb down Black Snake Moan (2007) Genre:DramaPosted on 7/23/10 10:51 PM I believe this movie is excellent. I have nothing to complain about. The characters are so well established that they feel real. I felt like I truly understood them although I in no way could relate to them (not a complaint, of course. They're just incredibly different than I am), which shows great character development.The actors were great. I can't think of one I had a problem with. Samuel L. Jackson was great in his character, really convincing. I haven't seen many films with Christina Ricci, but now I want to. She was terrific. I couldn't even imagine playing the role she did. Incredible! Justin Timberlakewell, I was kind of skeptical about him, as I am with all music to actor crossovers, but I wasn't disappointed. He seemed really sincere. I felt his plight. I felt his love.The romance of the movie was perfect. Not too much, not too little, and best of all, not cheesy disgusting. It was actually a treat to watch the relationships develop. I laughed a lot in this movie, I definitely enjoy the sense of humor this film has. The drama was certainly felt. I knew when it was a serious time, and when it was, I could pay attention. It was not overdone. I love movies that have slow motion occasionally, and this one did. It was executed perfectly, made me get into scenes more without messing up the flow. The music of the soundtrack is mainly Blues. It enhances the Southern feel of the movie and sets the tone very well.The plot was interesting. It doesn't remind me of any other film I've seen, and I love that. It's original. It's basically a bitter, pained, religious man trying to help a beaten nymphomaniac he found on the road outside his house. I try to keep to a one sentence plot description because I don't want to give too much away.So yeah, I definitely recommend this movie for a watch. I own it, and I'm proud to.

Sam L. Gives a Tour De Force Performance,"I went to the theater, intending on seeing the 300. But it started to late and I wanted to have dinner first. So me and my buddy settle on Black Snake Moan. Now the movie started off a bit shaky for me and to tell you quite honestly, I had no idea what the movie was going to be about. All I knew it started Sam L Jackson and Christina Ricci, two actors I admire in past movies. The film takes place in an unnamed hard-times town in the south somewhere. Sam L is going through some stuff separately from Christina Ricci. Fate brings them together and the movie really takes off. You don't know if he is crazy, but you definitely know that she is. The poster gives you no hint on what happens next. Sam L amazed me with all of his abilities. And there is a scene that is definitive to the movie and I don't want to say, but you know it when you see it (and here it). Special movies have those scenes (i.e. Harrison Ford's gun play in Raiders, Holly Hunter dance scene in Living Out Loud, Brad Pitt scene at the end of Seven, Uma 88 scene in Kill Bill Pt1). Some movies just have those definitive moments which makes the movie great and this memorable scene, lets just say it involves a storm, will transfix you. I didn't think I would like the movie and I ended up loving it. This is, by far, Sam L Jackson best performance to date! Even better than his bible verse quoting Jules in Pulp Fiction. And to tell you quite frankly, the man needs to do more work like this and less films like The Man or Deep Blue. Samuel L Jackson can act and he GROWLS in this film. And I didn't even mention the fantastic job that Christina Ricci does. But, by far, Sam L is the star of the pic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Very good movie, a surprise for me","OK, so I'm an European that doesn't really appreciate all that struggle between black and white people in the USA. When I went to watch it I was sure it was supposed to be about differences between white and black, and it somehow is. In a bad way, but it gets saved by the religious thing that surrounds this film. Ricci is a nympho and she has a boyfriend that goes in the army (another cliché that i don't appreciate, but hell, I love Green Day and that song ""Wake me up when September comes""). It's really good to see that war is introduced in a story that doesn't show the war. I am really pleased about this. Now. Samuel does his job very good, like every other film i've seen with him, I just love the actor. He can play the role of a black man at the country side as he can play one in a big city. You will love how he plays in this movie. Justin... well he did his best, a bit more of that redneck accent would've been better, but remember, this is a white guy that tries to be a black man in his music so you can't really blame him. Ricci... what can I say? Great body, great performance, not so great face but nonetheless, she played the hell out of her role. I would give her an Oscar for her performance. Overall, the film is about a guy that leaves to join the army, leaves his nympho girlfriend home and she just goes wild (what did you expect?), that ends up saved by a black old man that just split up with his wife. No sex between them, even though at some scenes I was like ""omg, Samuel, just hit that!!!!"". I was happy to see that whoever wrote the script had common sense. Even though I don't like all this struggle between black and white that keeps getting on the big screens all over the world. I gave it a 9, very good movie, great soundtrack (even if you don't like blues, you'll love it) but I couldn't give it a 10 because of the cliché about differences between black and white in America. That's all I could find bad in this film. Enjoy it, it will surprise you.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Deep South Meets Deep Healing,"Black Snake Moan is a redemption story cleverly set in the hillbilly South. The acting is superb, including a performance by pretty boy Justin Timberlake. Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) and Rae (Christian Ricci) are two lost souls, seemingly acting off impulses neither one can control. Lazarus, an elderly, black, blues guitarist, is torn up that his wife left him for his younger brother. He turns to booze and music for comfort. Rae, young, white, and the town slut is addicted to sex and can barely wait an hour after her military boyfriend (Timberlake) leaves for his enlistment before her next dip.Their lives intertwine one night, when Rae, high from a party is raped and beaten and left in Lazarus's driveway. I know this sounds brutal, but this is not done in a heavy, depressing manner. On the contrary, this story has a whimsical tone peppered with lots of deep fried Southern flavor. Yes, Rae is attacked, but she doesn't seem to mind. She knows it's a natural outcome of her behavior and doesn't really seem to expect much more of menfolk, a clue to the truth about Rae's past.Lazarus, raw from his wife's abandonment, decides it's his job to deliver Rae from herself. Initially, he just plans to tend to her bruises and send her on her way. But when he realizes what this lady does with her time, he decides he is God's messenger (""I will suffer you,"" he says to Rae.). As soon as she can walk again, Rae is ready to hit the town again. Lazarus responds by chaining her to his radiator. She begs, please, cajoles, and seduces, but he won't unlock that padlock.Rae assumes Lazarus wants from her what every other man wants and tries to seduce him. Lazarus is outraged with her assumption and responds by turning to the Good Book. That's right, Lazarus is an alcoholic Bible beater. And so starts a clever chess game as each tries to get the upper hand over the other. By all outward signs, Lazarus seems to be the stronger of the two. After all, he is not the one chained up. But Rae starts to figure things out about Lazarus and uses these truths to pry into his brain. They have more in common then they realize and gradually, they grow to need each other.There is a telling scene when Lazarus start giving Rae a lecture on how her sleeping around is impacting her for the bad. But as he keeps talking, it becomes clear that he is not talking to Rae but his own wife (""You sleep with my brother; kill my baby!). Are Lazarus's intentions as pure as he believes? Is he doing this to help Rae or punish his wife? How do these two who mostly scream at each other throughout the movie find healing love in their friendship? You will just have to see.The acting is great; the soundtrack is hearty. The music sets the mood for this film and plays an important role in creating tension. When Lazarus plays the tune ""Black Snake Moan,"" Rae sees a man from her past in her mind and clings to Lazarus's leg for protection.Rae has a lot of sexuality, but her relationship with Lazarus is more like father and daughter. Lazarus has someone to be a hero to, and Rae has a male figure she can rely on for once. The movie ends with hope, something we all need.Once again, let me say, if you didn't know Timberlake could act, you are in for a treat. He plays a reasonably good unstable male!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Good Movie,"For me, the movie shows what really matters in life: emotions, sincerity, ethics and other values. And for this, I give it a 9.The atmosphere is very nice with the small-town setting, the farms and nature. The simplicity of Lazarus' house aids in that direction. It's as if everything has been stripped off to allow the viewer to concentrate on the essence.The blues is another terrific part of the movie.Very nice scene, as well, when the black-snake moan is being sung, how Rae's being framed in the picture, with her silhouette outlined and an old lamp in the back.OK, granted, there's a lot of semi-nudity involved but this is far besides the point. If it hadn't been there, the movie would be crippled.A very nice atmosphere with all these blues.In the long run, its a movie that throws down the taboos and invites us to look at life clearly, boldly and calmly.As a movie per se, I would like it to have a bit more of variety - but then again keeping it simple passes the message..!! Nice effort!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
What a surprise!,"I opted to watch this film for one reason and one reason alone...Samuel L. Jackson. I happen to like him, a lot. I had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film, so went into it with no real expectations.Jackson didn't disappoint as Lazarus, a down-on-his-luck blues man in the Deep South, and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a vapid airhead in real life, who took the role of the sexually-abused town tramp Rae and made her a believable, almost even likable character. Watching the decidedly non-sexual relationship evolve between Lazarus and Rae was simply amazing.Justin Timberlake, pop star turned wanna-be actor, should go back to causing ""wardrobe malfunctions"" and prancing around a pop stage. His mostly forced performance was distracting, at best, from the real story here.This movie is raw, gritty, and at times quite ""in your face"". Not everyone will like it. Those that do, however, will be quickly moving it to the top of their favorites list.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"potent mix of sex, blues & the bible","In rural Mississippi, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is a fire and brimstone blues musician farmer. He's full of rage especially after his younger wife leaves him for his brother. Rae (Christina Ricci) is a wild sex addict who is struggling after her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves for the military. She gets trashed at a party and left on the side of the road. Lazarus finds her bloodied unconscious body and tries to treat her. He finds that she's got the Sickness and chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away.Some take offense to the perceived misogyny and the sexual content. I don't dispute other's perceptions. Everybody is entitled to their own. The movie can definitely be seen through that light. It's actually kind of funny with a potent mix of southern style, sex and religion. The two actors are dynamos powering a very charged movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Another Cinematic Portrait that is Lost in Hollywood's Attic!!,"OK, First off.. IMDb.. 7.6 stars?? come on!! This movie is nothing short of genius. The storyline alone is enough to keep you glued to your seat let alone the REMARKABLE performances of Jackson and Ricci as well as the graceful support of Timberlake... YES... JT!! A lot of people approach films with a fixed mindset based on the poster, the trailer, or sometimes (sadly) the cast.. approach movies with an open mind.. let the director reach you and shape your imagination.. if he fails, then trash the movie... anyway back to the Snake.This Movie tells a very bizarre yet touching story. As you screen it, you can't help but empathize as well as sympathize with almost all the characters. The score and music of the film are brilliant.. each song and tune chosen to trigger a string in your emotional instrument.I cried, laughed, frowned and finally applauded as I watched this film.. how Samuel L Jackson is not a major Academy Award Winner baffles me.. WATCH THIS!! I GUARANTEE YOU WILL WANT TO OWN IT!! IF NOT FOR ANYTHING MAYBE TO JUST WATCH SAMUEL GET DOWN WITH THE BLUES!! Mr Brewer... congrats.. you have done it again :)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Support,"I was pleasantly surprised by this. This is the first of Brewer's films that I watch, though I will certainly keep his name in mind for future reference. He's got an interesting style, and the form enhances the content, rather than attracting attention to itself. Also, he seems to do sequences largely driven by the music(well-composed, by the way), and without the movie coming off as an extended music video(*cough* McG *cough*). The acting doesn't let down, either. It's no surprise that Ricci(who yet again astounds with the unrestrained performance that we can count on her to give) and L. Jackson deliver something powerful, but Timberlake is actually pretty good, as well. The rest of the cast are marvelous, as well. This follows a disillusioned retired Blues-player, who finds himself dealing with a young, wild girl who can't seem to stay out of trouble. The plot is nicely engaging, and this is well-paced. There is a little humor in this, and it is appropriate, not messing with the tone of this. The rating is a fair indicator... this is *not* for everyone, and if you don't think you can handle it, you may not want to chance it. The cinematography and editing are great. This has solid writing, and everything comes off as being psychologically credible. There is sexuality and language, if neither are frequently all that strong, in addition to disturbing content. The DVD contains an (optional) informative and worthwhile director's commentary, for the flick and the deleted scenes alike, three featurettes of varying length, all of them well-done, and a photo gallery. I recommend this to mature audiences, whether or not you're a fan of anyone involved in making it. A magnificent piece on not giving in, and being there for others, even if they've made mistakes. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Very original movie,"I think my favorite thing about this movie is how original it is. I've never seen a movie like it with characters acting like them. No movie that I've ever seen or heard of has had a white female locked on a chain as a black man's ""guest."" Samuel L. Jackson plays his part so well. He really makes you laugh and feel terrible at the same time. Christina Ricci also plays her part well. I'm sure it wasn't the easiest thing running around in underwear throughout the entire movie. Her character's development was the most moving part. Justin Timberlake plays his part exceptionally and really makes you feel his pain. He does so well in this movie and even better in Alpha Dog. I, overall, really liked this movie based especially on its originality.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
If you liked Hustle & Flow...,"then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man. The story had heart, and was very influential.The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes.No doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.Go out and rent this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Sizzles with Achievement.,"'Black Snake Moan' may very well be one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen, and surely last year's most uniquely remarkable achievements. But do these oddities define Craig Brewer's follow-up to 'Hustle and Flow'? I'm extremely excited to say that no, no it doesn't. 'Black Snake Moan' breathes of life, boasts startlingly powerful performances, and soulful blues to get your foot tapping.I feel warranted to say that the story itself that is told here on-screen - about a Southern man who, after his wife left him for another man, chains up a bruised and beaten promiscuous young lady he finds on the site of a street in hopes of curing her of her 'disease' - is not to be taken completely literal. It is more or less a metaphor, but as the viewer we have the fortune of seeing such a memorable and textured story unfold before our eyes in innovated fashion. It immerses us with the rich culture of the deep south, giving the picture a thick atmosphere we can sink our teeth into. It's sultry and sexy, a fitting tune for a homage to the Blues.If cinema's ultimate goal is allowing audiences the opportunity to escape to a new world and leave this one behind, 'Black Snake Moan' achieves like few others. Samuel L. Jackson delivers a harrowing and tormented performance that may be right up his alley, but something only he could pull off. Christina Ricci, likewise, pulls off what may very well be her best performance to date. It's a challenging role, but Ricci's dedication is disturbingly evident and becomes a very memorable experience to watch. Combine these two excellent stars with a killer soundtrack and you have a transfixing story that captures the heart and soul of Blues while telling a poignant tale of redemption.'Black Snake Moan' is like none other, a unique brand of film held completely intact by writer and director Craig Brewer. It may sound outlandish, and it is. But this beautiful American portrait transports us to an entirely new world that entertains and uplifts at the same time. One of 2007's overlooked gems, 'Black Snake Moan' is toe-tapping brilliance that deserves to be seen. See it for the insanity. See it for the music. But perhaps most of all, see it for Christina Ricci's mesmerizing and sexy performance.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Dwells on it's two performances of Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci,"(2007) Black Snake Moan
PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA/ MUSICALVery good drama and character study with some good blues played and sung from Samuel Jackson! The film written and directed by Craig Brewer, that has no plot with it's basic premise of chaining a young girl up, so she can 'straight up and fly right'. The chemistry or the rapport between it's two stars builds itself from there! This film would've never have worked without the performances of it's two stars of Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricca (her singing was quite horrendous though). The only person that I felt typecast is real life pop/ soul singer Justin Timberlake playing Ricci's boyfriend- you have to wonder why Justin should stick to singing pop songs and stay away away from acting since it's terrible, especially when he's singing ""Blues"" songs. Still a very intriguing film and an adult oriented film nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Deeper than Sex and Blues,"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die. It is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself. It reminded me strongly of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you may just see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty, but they are real.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Black Snake Moan,"I overall was expecting for this movie to be intense just after seeing the trailers and previews for it. The first time I watched it, I only ended up watching it half way through and wasn't really all that impressed because I wasn't really paying attention enough to the storyline and the actors. But as for the second time that I watched the movie, I was automatically hooked. The whole overall feeling of the south and the religious undertones were kinda soothing in a way. When Lazarus was determined to free Rae of her sinful ways, it was like releasing the devil from her body. It's got kind of a basic theme, where love is still involved but it's got a sexual twist to it I think. The soundtrack to the film was really good as well. The whole blues concept really tied in well with the tone of the movie. Never really been into movies or anything but from the works that I've seen Samuel L. Jackson do, I wasn't too shocked that his performance was on point. I love how he really took his character seriously and really nailed the whole grittiness of the film. Christina Ricci was also excellent in this film. I don't think there are really any other actresses out there that could have performed this part and really brought the character of Rae to life. The only thing I would have to say would be the role of Justin Timberlake when he portrayed Ronnie, the military boyfriend was discharged from the military and came back into town just in time to witness Rae and Lazarus's relationship unfold. I don't really think he was the best choice in casting him as the anxious and intense character that Ronnie was. I mean, it's Justin Timberlake. I'm a fan of his music, but sometimes there are those few individuals who are better kept singing and not merging with the movie industry. What really surprised me though was the little money that the movie ended up making. Really overall, I think the movie was excellent for an independent film. Too bad it didn't turn out to be something greater.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Equally sultry and silly,"In the interests of honesty, I'll state up front that my main (about 98%) interest in Black Snake Moan was the fact that it had Christina Ricci in it. Mostly naked. Okay, so, that said, let's get on with the film. This obviously has one of the most outlandish concepts that's been filmed in recent years: ageing, bitter, blues singer chains up trashy, abused nymphomaniac in his house in order to ""save"" them both. I mean, really, who greenlit that?! Anyway, the end product is oddly tender, with a romantic message that somewhat flies in the face of the salacious set up. Sam Jackson is excellent throughout, and Ricci is both brave and effective (and, at times, unintelligible  I had to use subtitles once or twice to translate her drawl). It's been accused of copping out at the end, but such an odd story ought to be seen as a sort of fairy tale, and in that context it works and is, all round, pretty good. Oh, and Christina Ricci gets mostly naked!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I've done a bad thing, cut my brother in half""","Samuel L. Jackson makes like 5 movies peer year, most of them are just not good. Still I was expecting maybe hoping to found Black Snake Moan as not just another decent movie. There are some things that helped a lot Black Snake Moan in order to be what I was expecting. Jackson is really good here as the old Lazarus who is an old blues player now suffering due to his wife, now ex-wife and with that founding the blues again. Could have like a dream for anyone what happened to Lazarus. He found a semi naked girl (Ricci) in the middle of the road, a girl who has been suffering a lot. But the dream will be for that girl, not immediately and less with that chain of course. She is part of other story with her boyfriend (Justin Timberlake). A couple that will be separated due to the war. Timberlake can't act but I will write about the cast a little later. This movie is basically the story of a girl who suffered since she was young abuse and that bring in the present the consequences that we are watching. She found like an effective medicine for her sickness in the character that Timberlake plays but she found a cure with Lazarus.During the first part f the film we see Ricci in underwear all the time and during that part we have also some funny situations, with Lazarus' young helper for example. When Timberlake arrives again we can see again the bad actor he is and we have an anticipated conclusion but by then we have already enjoyed Ricci and some great music. I think there are only like three songs in the movie (I'm not counting Ricci's since it's like a country song). I saw this one with some friends and my cousin who, like me, recently watched Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. We could not take the blues songs seriously here; it was like every time a blues note started he was like "" cut my brother in half"" and stuff. Don't watch this with someone who you know is funny and that has seen Walk Hard.Samuel L. Jackson's performance is good but definitely is not any kind of a special performance just like the film is not any kind of a great one. But it wasn't in absolute a complete waste of time so it's basically your decision.",,Anonymous,Music
