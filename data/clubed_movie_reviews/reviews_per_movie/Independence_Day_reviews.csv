Look at the size of that thing,"Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.Taking the 1950's invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90's audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it's unlikely to do the same to today's overstimulated audiences, it's still an incredible visual feast. What's more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn't so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They're relatively safe bets.Watching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That's right folks, it's an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.Needless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they're quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can't really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A guilty pleasure. After all, action and tension is what Independence Day wants to deliver. It is not about complexity as his artistic expression resides in entertainment","Roland Emmerich is, without a doubt, the Master of the catastrophe films. On his resume, the director not only has Independence Day, his first dive into the sub-genre, but also Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012, all marked by mass destruction - global most of the time - and a complete absence script or quality performances, absences that open the way for the visual spectacle in computer graphics with several memorable sequences. Here, Independence Day literally encapsulates the spirit of all those similar films from the 70s such as the series Airport, Earthquake, Hell in the Tower, Poseidon's Destiny, copying almost entirely from the classic formula, which usually addresses family nuclei or friends before the tragedy in a slow narrative construction and the consequences after the apocalypse sets in. And there's nothing wrong with that, actually, as Emmerich lends his ability to create epics - Stargate was his immediately preceding film, which already demonstrated his ability to handle science fiction well - and creates a film that will be guaranteed fun. Just ignore the various poetic licenses in the script and embark on the guilt-free adventure.With an estimated budget of 75 million, Independence Day stifled Spielberg's intentions to remake the classic 1953 War of the Worlds to present an alien invasion on an absurd scale. Since the first teaser trailers, with the shadows consuming tourist spots accompanied by the expression of astonishment from passers-by, the feature film has already come with the proposal to shape America's basic formula of self-destruction: if terrorists could not find access - until then - , a flurry of blockbusters began that featured the United States being threatened by natural phenomena and alien forces. As a masochistic pleasure intensified by the approach of the end of the millennium, the result could not be other than a lot of destruction, with sensational effects from impressive models, and the exaggerated patriotism, capable of putting the American president himself on a fighter to face the enemies. Interplanetary.Don't ask how, but even though the United States government communicates with other nations through Morse code, television continues to quietly broadcast the news with naughty information to the viewer - commonly, us - and that's even after the attacks. It doesn't help the spectator to wonder how David managed, in less than six hours, to pick up his father, get out of downtown New York faster than the whole crowd, and still arrive in Washington, about 330 kilometers from distance; And why bother with the fact that aliens, coming from beyond the solar system, count time in the same measurements as we do? After all, who cares? Forget it, after all, we are back in 1996, a time when the characters use gigantic cell phones, while the aliens have a touchscreen.Regarding the script of the film, it is fair to say that it is the factor most detonated by the specialized critic. The focus of the production really is to bring elaborate scenes of destruction, leaving the likelihood in the background. There is a lot of patriotism to the United States, to its July 4th holiday (which becomes a world holiday) and to the American army. The script also does not seek to deepen the personal dramas of the characters and some situations are quite fanciful. But the truth is that this was never the intention. Director Roland Emmerich sucks at character development - it would be prudent to say that he may not know what that actually means - but, on the other hand, he is efficient in his action sequences. And since they tend to put the protagonists and large crowds of people in danger, it is easy to gain public empathy, since we on this side of the screen prefer to think that, instead of those figures, we would also survive - right? Big explosion and collapse of a tunnel? No problem, you would go through this to drive a truck and save the First Lady of the United States. Drag the body of an extraterrestrial across the desert, even without supplies? Of course, if you, like Will Smith, can punch one of the damn aliens right in the face. Escape from a colossal explosion at the last second by just a few feet with Air Force One? Only if we can get rid of an even bigger explosion, in space and on board an alien spaceship. Emmerich may not take the human side of his characters very much into consideration, but he is great at instigating the superhuman in them, which hits our ego right in the middle - after all, if they succeed, why not me?If, on the one hand, the narrative is poor, Independence Day stands out in the technical part. David Arnold's great soundtrack, simply contagious, manages to electrify in the intense scenes and manages to thrill in those more dramatic scenes, as in a moment when an important character dies. The composer manages to bring a track with melodies that help and a lot to give the mood of the film. The editing of sound effects and sound mixing mixes well the noise of explosions, the shouting of people, the shooting of ships and falling buildings. It is no coincidence that he competed for the Oscar for Best Sound.The general shots taken by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, which Emmerich brought from Stargate, work very well to convey the magnitude of the attacks. David Brenner's montage (The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, The Man of Steel) also deserves commendation for not succumbing to the spectator's bewilderment. Using Lindenlaub's broader photograph very well, he connects the sequences in a way that makes the beating - even in the complicated final aerial attack - logical without losing its energy. And what about the visual effects, which won the Oscars? Today they may seem a little dated, but nothing that gets in the way. And when reviewing the film today, it is actually impressive that many scenes remain current. The grandeur of the ships, the destruction of buildings and the White House, the final air battles, everything remains exciting.The film is shallow and somewhat empty of content - the theme ""union of nations"" is beautiful, but if we squeeze it, nothing comes out - but it is undeniable that the director and his script partner Dean Devlin manage to create captivating characters, who they carry the film on their backs. Will Smith in his first big hit, in his burst stage. The star has always lavished charisma, mainly for his comical crazy things and in the action scenes. The best jokes and jokes come out of Smith's mouth. The star Jeff Goldblum (from 'The Fly"" and 'Jurassic Park') always with presence and a restrained performance. Bill Pullman plays with respect a well-intentioned and convincing president. Veterans Randy Quaid and Judd Hirsch are surprisingly funny. The synchrony of all of them is something that helps us to care about the characters and cheer in the end.Independence Day is a beautiful example of the catastrophe film, almost a return to the seventies past, which seems to have been the decade that ""created"" the genre. This work by Emmerich will remain in the viewer's memory even if it is due to its exaggeration and absurd technological freedoms. A true guilty pleasure, of those who leave a pleasant smile on the face after the projection. It's another great guilty pleasure - that movie, which is essentially pretty bad, but you have fun watching it - directed by the filmmaker specializing in catastrophe films. After all, action and tension is what Emmerich wants to deliver. It is not about his ""sophisticated and complex"" plot that he wants to base his feature film on, as his artistic expression resides in entertainment. Who cares about ufanism - I would say implicitly, if the foreground was not an American flag - and cheesy melodramas when Bill Pullman is giving such an ""inspirational"" speech? Anyway, they say that there is that kind of film to ""turn off the brain"". I say that for this we have those we can call ""bad"". Independence Day is not to turn anything off, but rather just one of those event films that requires less from the intellect of others - which is different, and by no means a demerit. After all, features like these by Emmerich, however disposable they may be, will always find shelter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Just a good bit of fun!!,"I don't usually comment on this, I don't like to portray a movie as being good or bad just on my opinion, as everyone has their own tastes and needs when it comes to cinema.

This film is just damn good fun to watch...the explosions, the suspense, the cheesy one-liners...its not trying to tell you that aliens are coming to blow the s**t of of us...its entertainment.

To put it simply, this is 2 and a half hours of fun filled, edge of the seat (occasionally have a laugh) action...and nothing else.Why cant people just enjoy a independence day for what it is (as mentioned above)...not why its improbable etc etc etc we all know that duh!

"Big and Dumb, but Weirdly Charming, ID4 is a Lasting '90s Blockbuster","Giant, hostile, alien spaceships appear overnight to move on Earth's natural resources; humanity's last, desperate hope is a shaky plan involving a captured UFO from the 1950s and an old PowerBook laptop. Seems like this one was a guilty-pleasure classic from opening day. ID4 isn't well-written and constantly bathes itself in dense layers of cheese, but it tries hard, most the character arcs connect and the big special effects hold up quite well, despite their age.For a movie that's so thoroughly reliant on spectacle, that last point is pretty important. The power of watching the White House or Empire State Building burst into a billion bitty pieces is still there, irresistible, while the magnitude of the invading fleet remains immense, and I think both can be attributed to the production's choice to eschew then-new CG techniques in favor of a large, intricately detailed stable of miniatures. We get a few hiccups, like the obviously green-screened fighter jets or the absurd visual of a golden retriever leaping to slow-motion safety through a fiery inferno, but for the most part it all looks great and it's still easy to get sucked into the experience.Of course, the whole thing is over-acted to death. Roland Emmerich has never been one to bring out nuance from his cast, and this is an awfully shallow effort, even by his standards. Bill Pullman nails the big motivational speech, set to a telegraphed swell of patriotic symphony, but otherwise lacks conviction as a limp, reactive PotUS. Randy Quaid is a cheap xerox of every alien abduction stereotype to ever enter pop culture. Jeff Goldblum is naturally quirky enough to make his role worthwhile, but it takes every bit of his innate charismatic magnetism to overcome the dumb plot developments. Will Smith is the only unequivocal success, barking and fist-pumping his way to bonafide action hero status in a simple but essential role as a beefy marine / pure force of will.From a critical perspective, this is cinematic junk food. Big bangs and shiny lights to dazzle the box office crowd, with a few easy jokes to lighten the mood. But yet, there's something else to it, something essential and inexplicable. It's just raw, simple fun, I suppose, that makes no apologies for how it acts or what it aims to be. It won't make you think or weep, but you'll feel, and that's worth something.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Suspenseful Feel Good Fun!,"I am just shocked at all the negative reviews by pseudo-intellectuals saying the film was heavily flawed, incomprehensible, devoid of any merit, and ""lame"", to quote a few.  What were they expecting?  A remake of 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Sure, I am not going to pretend the film does not has many glaring weaknesses.  The plot is hardly original; its execution is even less inspiring.  Roland Emmerich goes out of his way to use every cliche in the book, over-sentimentality, weak, flat characterizations, incredible jumps in logic and reasoning made on the viewer, and the use of special effects to overcome these shortcomings.  But what some of the reviewers seemed to have missed, and its there as substantiated by the huge popularity of the film, is heart. The film has a lot of heart.  It makes you feel good after watching it.  And although that quality does not make it a great film, it certainly makes it a good film in my book.  The film is vastly entertaining, very suspenseful, a delight for the eyes with dazzling special effects, and even has some dialogue that does just rise above its hackneyed origins.  The acting is adequate all around with no one pulling off a great performance, but a few doing marvelous jobs with what they have to work with.  Judd Hirsch easily out acts his fellow colleagues as a Jewish father with a gift for common sense and lack of tact.  Jeff Goldblum also gives a pretty good performance as his son.  Yeah, Will Smith is just Will Smith..lots of one liners and little meat so to speak.  But he is bearable.  Watch for Brent Spiner in an outrageous role as a hippie scientist.  His performance is a real hoot!  If you are looking for philosophical science fiction, this is not it.  See Starship Troopers(a great film).  This is just good old Americans against the universe stuff, lots of action but little substance. But whatever it may have as its faults, it is a fun, happy, sad, charming, engrossing film to watch...time and time again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Blockbuster!,"What's the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold's music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film. I rate this film a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cheeky. Not complex. But lots of fun,Will Smith at his cocky best. Jeff Goldblum doing Jeff Goldblum stuff. What's not to love. The movie is really funny. Undoubtedly over the top. The story isn't hard to follow. But that suits the pace of the movie. The special effects for the time were excellent and still hold up reasonably well in 2024. The cast is well drilled with no one having a difficult task as most of the characters are pretty uncomplicated. Goldblum is a real treat as is his father and colleague. The drunken pilot is ridiculous. But endearing also. Smith is cocky and slick throughout. Brent spiner plays the emotionally absent scientist very well also. Easy a 7.5. It does not require a brain to watch. It has a load of elements of movies of that era. But it knits them all together into a coherent and enjoyable couple of hours. You can't help but smile and root for the good guys. Great movie. 7.5.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun summer blockbuster that some just took to seriously.,"I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn't the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50's plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70's.  A lot of critics don't like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don't care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like ""The Two Towers"" where it doesn't feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn't as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50's science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70's disaster flick.  If you don't care for either of these genres you probably won't like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
B movie at its finest,"This is a very entertaining movie for sure. I think this is a good line to begin with, because from a movie perspective I see it as a big old B film, hehe...

This is a movie where you just turn your brain off, and just enjoy the fun ride it is, and root for the humans, and especially the Americans (:p) to win over evil!...The movie I must say has a lot of memorable moments... A lot of them comes from the great special effects. I remember when watching this as a kid, I was woved by the effects, and they still look pretty good to this day! So to end it all, if you are a movie viewer who watches movies for character development, clever dialog, etc. This movie is not for you.

A couple of points most reviewers seem to have overlooked.,"I wonder why Arthur C. Clarke wasn't given a nod for the idea of the scene seems to have come directly from 'Childhood's End'. I haven't read all the reviews, but it seems some points have not been addressed; for example, world unity. The world is so divided by ideologies, language, beliefs, economic conditions, currency, etc. that it would take a world-wide threat (like an alien attack or another black plague) to unify all the people. This film, shallow as it is in other respects, illustrates that. Also, this film was 'centered' in America, so the film makers naturally concentrated on America, with 'cameos' of members of other countries. I resent being told that 'the worst part of the movie was America' (see above comment about divisiveness, negativism and just plain rudeness). Obviously, I am American, but I have Swedish and English (and other) roots. I consider myself a citizen of Earth. The Earth, this little blue planet is my home. So, let's try to take that phrase 'think globally' seriously. I rather liked the movie with it's humor and special effects (I guess I'm easily entertained), and my wife always cries at the sad parts. Movies are like beauty - in the eye and ear of the beholder. It's easy to find fault with things, but much harder to find the good, the higher ground, the motivation. That's why it's easy to be a critic! Makes you wonder what kind of movies the reviewers rave over...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie,"Independence Day doesn't stand up particularly well to a second viewing. It is basically a millenial version of The War of the Worlds with grand-scale effects and a cast which probably cost almost as much as the effects. Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Jeff Goldblum, Adam Baldwin and Judd Hirsch help pick up a surprisingly talented (but underexploited) cast and seem to have enjoyed their parts. Unfortunately, the mediocre script allowed few of the other actors to make their roles shine.The plot is so simple it's hard to imagine a 140+ minute film about it. The earth is under invasion from a highly advanced and merciless alien culture hell bent on intergalactic conquest. Our most powerful weapons can not pierce their shields and their weapons are capable of incinerating cities the size of Washington DC with one shot. After the first wave of attacks, all seems lost, and humans must find some way to fight back.Roland Emmerich's direction is good. There are few dull moments and very little in the way of uninteresting and pointless scenes. Unfortunately, the characters are generally two-dimensional - even Bill Pullman's brooding, depressed President of the United States comes across as an uncomplicated, uninspired and unemotional individual. Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie.The best performances in Independence Day are the semi-comedic ones (note the actors mentioned above.

One of the better high-concept movies..,"As a rule, I don't like high-concept movies. However, Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film to-date by German sci-fi/action director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day (aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title) is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric, it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world, he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.However, its still a damn entertaining film. There is a large ensemble cast of good actors, some in career best roles. Will Smith was really launched as a movie star by this film and he has some very funny lines. Jeff Goldblum actually looks nerdy-cool as a scientist who likes to play chess in the park. And Bill Pullman is the clean-cut American President who proclaims that July 4 will no longer be an American holiday, but a world holiday! The rest of the ensemble cast includes small but meaty roles for Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Vivica Fox. Harry Connick Jr. has a small part but blows it completely.The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of one-liners and the one-dimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures.

Good for its time but doesn't hold up today,This is an entertaining movie but some special effects don't look good by today's standards. I can understand why this was a blockbuster back in 1996. Compared to sci Fi movies and special effects we get to see today this doesn't hold up. Also the way it ended it's like we see that in every blockbuster movie. Nothing I haven't seen before. Dialogue in this movie is average at best. It didn't stand out for me. Infact there were some cringy dialogue moments here and there.

Independence Day - outstanding work of the cinematic art,"Personally I think this is the best movie of the 90's.But then I think South Park is the best TV show of the 20th century. Followed by Twilight Zone and Star Trek tying for second and third place.While there's no accounting for taste in art, I can make reasoned arguments for my choices.The people here on IMDb who hate this movie and provide negative comments probably have their reasons too, but mostly they say stupid things. For example, the one vituperous reviewer who lambasted the film's ""less-than-impressive CGI effects"". Well, duh, they didn't use very much CGI as far as I know. They did special effects the old-fashioned way. This schmuck is complaining about reality not being very realistic?And if box office is any indication of excellence, then the stats are on my side and prove the nay-sayers are tasteless boobs. Make that witless, tasteless boobs. Independence Day is one of the highest grossing movies in history, worldwide sales topping a billion.Admittedly ID4 is one of those semi-rare movies that people either love or hate. And in this case hate with a passion. Why? I'm still trying to figure that one out, but so far I believe the whiniest critics are just your stereotypical jaded art critics: self-centered pseudo-intellectuals with attitude who pounce on any flaws in anything they personally don't like just to show off their own vapid superiority. What do they want? Yes, the movie has flaws, but it also has a lot of plot, a lot of heart, and a lot of action. Dialog? I make fun of the dialog myself... so what? The worst criticism I can lay against the writers is that a lot of the dialog is inane... just like real people talk! That just makes it more realistic. Have any of these critics on here ever listened to how real people talk? In some cases the dialog is sooo frigging inane in ID4 that I marvel at it's brilliance. Or chutzpah.""What happened, mommy?""""I don't know, baby""As for the Apple-alien hook-up... my god, have we become so inured to the miracles of science that we calmly overlook or accept miracles like anti-gravity and kvetch instead about mundane technicalities? Yes, the Apple-alien computer hook-up is a plot hole... so what? I can easily explain that away a billion times easier than I can explain anti-gravity. I happen to know a bit about both.Again. Are there stupid things that happen in ID4? Sure. Checked reality lately? Stupid things happen all the time. But so do heroic things. As well as evil. Typical fare for the ancient tragedies. I believe ID4 carries on that ancient and honorable tradition: entertainment. And viewing it as a work of art, I must say that I was impressed over and over again while watching this film: where most of the studios would have wussed out or flinched, these film makers didn't. They stepped up to the plate and tried to beat the ball to death over and over again with their bat.And you know what? These film makers did it with a hint of humor.

What's with all the anti-American comments?,"I started reading the comments for this movie and was taken by how many people from outside the U.S. were deriding it as being too patriotic. A recurring derogatory comment was ""The Americans save the day, again."" And the movie is ""only for stupid American children and rednecks.""I don't understand what those people are thinking about. This is an American movie, made for, oddly enough, Americans! Would those people also be surprised that Americans are biased for America? I personally agree that the RAH-RAH factor was too high in ID4, but not all my countrymen must have felt that way. The movie made over $300,000,000 domestically, so more than kids and hicks must have liked it. And despite the fact that, overseas, the IMDb commenter's seem to dismiss the film as propagandistic pabulum, it made almost $500,000,000 in foreign sales, so there must be a lot of American rednecks in other countries too.Now, if foreigners want to watch American films, that's fine with me (and I'm sure it's more than fine with U.S. movie producers), but they shouldn't be surprised if our movies are ""Pro-American."" I would expect that Russian films are ""Pro-Russian"" too.If anyone is offended by our films, the solution is really simple - DON'T WATCH THEM. I found French films to be pretentious, low rent, chick flicks, so I stopped watching them. Not watching foreign films is easy to do, so feel free to show your disgust by never watching an American film again. In fact, if all foreigners stopped, maybe Hollywood studios would start making films just for them, although you shouldn't hold your breath.If Germany, Japan, or any other country could make such big, booming, over-the-top films, I'd probably watch them, but no other countries have production companies that can afford to throw a hundred million dollars (or more) into making a film. If you want wiz-bang, high-tech, blockbuster films like Harry Potter, Terminator 2, Spiderman, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, ID4, etc., you're going to have to view an American film. And if they have to put some patriotic RAH-RAH in there to make sure they at least make their money back domestically (in case the film doesn't work overseas), well, that's what they'll do. Movie making is just a business like any other. If movies don't make money, they'll stop making them.Remember- Movies like ID4 and X-Men are just mindless FANTASIES. They aren't meant to be taken seriously. They're meant to be harmless fun on a Saturday afternoon. I don't know if I'm a typical American male, but I do like to just kick back and watch things go ""BOOM"" once in a while.However, if you wish to view a nice, high concept, artsy-fartsy, thought provoking, low budget, snooze-inducing talk-fest of a movie, feel free to watch some of that hokum coming out of France.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Easy watching,"I used to have this mate that was utterly convinced that this was the greatest film ever made, and I was like ""What? This one? Really?"", and she was like ""Yes it is, and if you don't agree then you're just plain wrong and stupid"". She was always saying stuff like this, I guess that's why we probably grew apart. To be fair I can be a lot like this as well. I think that might have been what went wrong - people who are too similar don't often end up getting along. It's quite normal for me to resent characteristics in others that I also have and dislike in myself. I think my therapist said that I'm ""projecting"" or something.

Lobotomy Day,"Here's the plot of this story: Aliens in (what else?) flying saucers come to earth to take no prisoners and to destroy our major cities in seconds. They succeed unhindered.  Billions of people die in horrible deaths and life as we know it has ceased.Meanwhile, in America, Will Smith cracks jokes, people get married and everybody is really happy.  Even the dog didn't die!Now, here comes three Americans to the rescue: a moronic wisecracker, a drunkard, a U.S. President who looks like a used-car salesman that just turned 30, and, of course, a brilliant scientist who nobody knows is brilliant!In a few hours, the scientist has it all figured out: create a computer virus and put it into the mainframe in the mother ship! The Aliens use Microsoft too, after all! And we don't have to worry about security or passwords!  Heck they won't even see us flying around! And even though they have psychic powers, we will be undetected!  When we are done, we will just fly back to Earth.  And the Aliens are so stupid that they don't use Norton's Antivirus software!The wisecracker chips in by figuring out how to fly a 40-year old alien spacecraft that he never saw before (and which was conveniently found in - where else! - Roswell). Then the drunk and the President decide to fly around a little and destroy those big ships.  The Americans have won again and tell the rest of the world how easy it really is.  Just recruit the local neighborhood drunk and send him straight up into the weak spot (never mind that the ship is as long as Manhattan Island and has  death rays that can obliterate an entire city in seconds).    Heck, you can get rid of a few neighborhood drunks too while you're at it!At one point in the movie I shuddered a scream!  Hollywood has done it, they really have done it!!

"Incredible visuals, brilliant action - Independence Day delivers!","Independence Day is really just patriotic drivel in means of plot and adventure. But the film comes into its best moments when the action sequences hit the screen. Buildings explode and men die in beautifully choreographed fashions that raise the bar for many modern action films today.The film is predictable, and none of the characters are particularly memorable - you aren't really bothered whether they live or die. The plot is so much like War of the Worlds, with more sky battles and aliens, that you may feel that it is just another remake under the same title.But Roland Emmerich (the director) deserves to be called the undisputed king of action movies - he beautifully directs his films, and the special effects and sound in his films are truly stunning. This was his biggest success, and deservedly so - though The Day after Tomorrow was just as spiffing.The script ain't strong and the plot ain't great, but this is an action-epic film, and on that scale, Independence Day delivers. It is an extremely memorable experience, and beats action flicks that are being made ten years on. A stunning job that deserves to be called a huge success (in the box office, of course).

Still a great flick,"This movie is TRULY one of the best and names itself the Science Fiction version of ""Top Gun"". The actors were great. Will Smith got ""jiggy with it"" as a hotshot F/A-18 pilot in the movie; Randy Quaid (the older brother of Dennis Quaid) proved to be the comic relief; Bill Pullman's character transformed from a President with the problem of a nation into a reborn veteran; and Jeff Goldblum became more brilliant than ever! The only difference between ""Independence Day"" and ""Top Gun"" is that the 2 adversaries were humans and aliens instead of Americans and Soviet pilots.

Fun alien invasion movie that I watched.,"I really enjoyed watching this movie throughout and is pretty fun. The story is your standard alien invasion with the characters trying to figured out how to defeat the aliens before they kill off of the people. It is pretty predictable to guess what happened next and goes through the same tropes. But the movie itself is fun and entertaining to watch throughout. We get to learn more about the aliens and the human plans to stop them from attacking. There's a lot of action that happened during the climax that is suspenseful and enjoyable to watch. The characters are pretty weak with them lacking any development to them and plays generic roles throughout the movie. But they are likable and do anything to stop the aliens from attacking.I really like the visual effects of the movie with the giant spaceship, and the alien design looks pretty good on the work they put onto it. I also like the explosion scenes that are both great and terrifying to be in the same spot as the characters in the movie.Overall, it's a fun movie to watch throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I miss the 90s,"Action, love, loss...to has it all. Bring in Pullman and he steals the show, who would have known back in this day he would have a boss epic performance. Earth is on the line from the locusts and Will Smith and Goldblum are there to tag team for the potential save. This move is a classic. I shall show it to my children, and their children if Im able. The mighty F16 gets lots of love and we all know this jet has been the king of the air for more than 50 years. Respect is given. Randy Quaid wow, from Christmas Vacation to this (oh and Vegas Vacation) he crushes as the insane alien abducted former military pilot. Can I stress that the Pullman 4th of July speech may well be the best ""pep rally"" speech of any movie, ever. Enjoy with popcorn, a beer, your family, or solo. This one will not let you down.

The definitive summer blockbuster.,"My Take: Perfection in its own silly, explosive, action-packed way. A highly entertaining blockbuster.I love the summer. It's the time every year or so, that we could sit back, relax and try to get back to your lazy self. You can go outside, fly kites, ride your bike across the countryside, go to the beach, stay at home and watch television, or go to the theaters and catch the latest in summer blockbuster releases. It was way back in the 1990's that these blockbuster flourished. It was almost every year or so, we get a film that tried to top the other. It was the busiest time for Hollywood.I wasn't much frequent on watching movies on the big screen back then, and only manage to watch these movies on video. I watched INDEPENDENCE DAY many years later, having missed it on both its exact release date and decade. I saw it on a post-summer night, just a few weeks after summer vacation just ended. Upon watching, I found myself enjoying everything about it. Rating it on a summer movie meter, it's terrific entertainment. The definitive summer blockbuster.INDEPENDENCE DAY has no moment to spare. It starts out quickly with the sight of a gigantic alien spaceship hovering over the craters of the moon, heading towards the Earth. The film has the usual news on Earth, like all invasion flicks, having the news spread, starting from a small organization investigating extraterrestrial activity, then to the military, who then phone calls The White House, giving it full news to President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman), who obviously remembers Michael Douglas' president performance in THE American PRESIDENT (but I didn't say lampoon), who stares in a moment of shock and disbelief.Before the sight of the alien spaceship hovering above the cities around the world, we first get a glimpse of the many characters in the film. First, there's computer engineer David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, in an excellent performance), playing chess with father Julius Levinson(Judd Hirsh) at Central Park. David is divorced from his wife (Margaret Colin), who happens to be the President's Chief-of-staff (see the connections). Then it switches to Kansas, where the focus is a small family. The father, Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a crop-dust farmer, believes he's kidnapped by aliens and is willing for payback, much to the dismay of his teenage kids. We also get introduced to a soldier (Will Smith), who both longs to return to NASA and reach for the stars (literally), and to propose to his girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox).Well, enough of that. It's time we see an invasion, and, boy, did we get one. After the discovery of the invaders plot (using the Earth's satellites to plan an attack), we get a mind-blowing sequence after another at incredible pace. The destruction at the streets of New York are just the first great effects-laden sequences in the film. Lets see, we get a STAR WARS-inspired dogfight between fighter jets and alien spaceships. And we also get a suspenseful sequence of an alien in laboratory (Talk about a close encounter), INDEPENDENCE DAY doesn't fail when it comes to a good visual feast. Admittedly, some of the effects are cheesy, seeing how much CGI has improved over the years, but they still provide an eye-filling experience.INDEPENDENCE DAY runs for a long 145 minutes, but director Roland Emmerich fills it with lots of fun and excitement, it just seems to pass by. Director Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spares no moments and doesn't stop for a break, giving the film a roaring pace without a dull moment that can't be interesting. The photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the film a good look, while composer David Arnold serenades the film with a rollicking and patriotic score.Forget its stereotype problems, INDEPENDENCE DAY is terrific summer entertainment that never fails to have me entertained.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
They'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper,"The 4th of July is almost upon and what movie is fitting for Independence Day? Of course, the movie ""Independence Day"" by Roland Emmerich. The premise is simple, aliens have come and attacked Earth on the 4th of July and the planet but mostly America has got to stop them. I've watched this movie years ago so rewatching it will be a very interesting experience.One thing I've remembered while starting this movie is how amazing and tension-filled that intro is. The scene with mankind's footprint on the moon getting blown away by the alien ship and the people on earth panicking about the ship in the sky is good stuff.My biggest praise for this movie has got to be the visual effects though which still look great even today. I think everyone remembers it since it was all in the marketing but the iconic white house getting blown up by the alien ship is just phenomenal honestly. Looking at how the movie was made and finding out that they built a miniature white house and blown it up which is cool. All the action scenes in this movie are just very thrilling and exciting to watch with its fast-paced air battles and spectacular explosions. The first act with the alien destruction and the final third act with the war is just so good! The movie contains a lot of comedic moments especially from Will Smith and they all gave me a slight chuckle and work in the movie's favour.Speaking of Will Smith, this and Bad Boys are the movies that practically launched his career to action fame and watching this movie again I can see why. Will Smith is extremely charming, funny and awesome as ""Captain Steven Hiller"". He punched an alien in the face while giving a cheesy one-liner, what more could you ask for? Jeff Goldblum is also likeable as the tech expert ""David Levinson"" and Bill Pullman is charismatic as the American President ""Thomas J. Whitmore"" and gives one of the most memorable speeches in movie history. The supporting cast is also great in their variety of different performances from the weird to the serious and they all do a great job.The negatives of this movie are very clear and it is that the plot is just very thin and bland. However, this is kind of expected since the movie is just an alien invasion but the movie runs for 145 minutes which is LONG. So the director does a lot of padding which ruins the pacing of this movie. This is especially noticeable in the second act where it feels like everything is slowing down and coming to a halt just so they can find a way to bring all the characters together and it just drags. Additionally, the movie has to find a way for humans to fight back and win but it is not very convincing. You are required to ignore questioning the logic of the plot and characters and dialling down the sense of believability for this movies plot to work.While I did praise the actors for their performance, the characters themselves are very lacking in depth. I don't feel like I understand any of the characters motives or backstory and none of the main characters changes by the end of the movie either. I never really cared for any of the characters dying and there are moments I've feel where they want you the audience to feel something but it doesn't work because none of the characters is that interesting for us to care. Well except for the dog who is a character we all care for and has a great moment in the movie. Rewatching the movie I've noticed how stereotypical the characters were which is probably why this movie was a product of the 90s and wouldn't be allowed today necessarily.Overall, the movie is still a fun movie to watch and even to rewatch. The true main star of this movie is the visual effects with its stunning action pyrotechnics giving us some of the best destruction in movie history. The production and set design are great and the amount of practical stuff is astounding as well. However, the movie is pretty cheesy and dumb with a very stupid conclusion which I've still find dumb even during my rewatch. One line still sticks to mind is ""they'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper"" and honestly I still think about that because it shouldn't affect ones flying ability but apparently that is important. Nevertheless, this movie is just pure spectacle filled fun and no doubt watching this movie was an enjoyable time which is all that matters in over the top, cliche movies like these.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Boy is this film entertaining!!!,"Independence Day was released in 1996 and was a box office smash hit. It managed to be the year´s highest grossing film! But reviews for the film at time of release the film had mixed reviews but since release has gotten more positive reviews. The film had a $75 million budget and made over 10 times the amount back. The film had a fantastic trailer which is probably why so many people watched this film. The film was directed by Roland Emmerich who beforehand did Stargate and would later do the sequel to Independence Day, the critcially panned Godzilla 1998, and other disaster films like The Day After Tomorrow. This film is often criticized for being unoriginal, sterotypical characters, but has been praised for special effects but I have a few things to say about that.The plot follows aliens coming to invade Earth. There are spaceships everywhere. Los Angeles, Washington DC, and New York just to name a few. The aliens destroy the major cities and it is up to a group of survivors to prevent a bigger attack.Most of the negative feedback from this film surrounds the ¨sterotype"" characters. I would have to agree with this. You have the redneck sterotype, the Jewish sterotype, the hero sterotype. But I do not consider this to be a bad thing to be honest. I think it adds to the entertainment value of this film. I quite actually enjoy every single character in this film. Likeable, memorable, but definitely not the best written characters of all time. The acting is fairly solid too. Will Smith does an amazing job in this film and is often cited as the best actor in this film but lets not forget Jeff Goldblum who gives a Goldblum performance. I couldn´t ask for more. Randy Quaid is not the best actor but he manages to give a memorable performance to a memorable character. Bill Pullman does a good job as the President. In all, when a character dies, I geniunely feel sad. Yes, the story is not the most original but it was the first time we got a movie like this on such a huge budget and has paved the way for films of similar nature. The effects are hit and miss for me. The minature effects are done pretty well but anything involving the use of CG is a huge miss but that is coming from someone who watched this film years after its release. So, the effects have not aged really well. The musical score in this film manages to be one of my favorites of all time along with other films like The Terminator and Star Wars. I have seen some complaints about the length of this film and how about 30 minutes could have been cut from the film and I DISAGREE. Sure the film is almost two and a half hours but this film is so entertaining that I don´t care about the run time (I should note that I did watch the Special Edition which includes 9 minutes of extra footage). I love the setup of the film how it goes from normal life, to the invasion, to the destruction, to the big battle. The whole tone of this film envokes fear that maybe the humans will not be successful. The President´s speech, while sterotypical and silly, does give me hope for the human race.While this whole film can be deemed as silly, and let's be honest this film can get silly, this film is entertaining as hell! Fun characters, fun setup, this film is just a fun film to watch. It is truly something to admire about this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One big cliché, but still entertaining...","""Independence Day"" is essentially one big cliché after one another, from the start to the end of the movie. And it is as much pro-American as you could possibly jam into a single movie.That being said, it is still an entertaining action Sci-Fi movie.

And while director Roland Emmerich managed to put every movie cliché and stereotype into this movie, he still knows what buttons to push in order to make a crowd-pleasing movie.The effects in the movie were good and that is essential to a Sci-Fi, as the special effects are make or break for a Sci-Fi movie.

"Yeah, I know—it's stupid, but....","Independence Day, the massively successful summer blockbuster of '96, is a deeply flawed, predictably dumb, jingoistic, gung-ho piece of mainstream sci-fi/action nonsense that depicts the USA as the saviours of mankind in a desperate battle for Earth against hostile aliens.Funny thing is, as formulaic, clichéd, moronic, plot-hole-ridden and over-sentimental as this flag-waving claptrap is, I don't find it anywhere near as irksome as I probably should, in part thanks to the great cast, but mostly due to the simple fact that it is just so much fun, a switch-your-mind off-and-enjoy-the-spectacle, slam-bang crowd-pleaser packed with exhilarating action and top-notch special effects.Sometimes, all I need to pass the time are massive explosions (they don't come much bigger than this), slimy aliens (that they are), and a Jewish cable company employee uploading a virus to an alien mothership via his laptop, and that's precisely what ID4 delivers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The greatest bad movie of all time,"Much has been made of the flaws of this film: the cardboard cutout characters, the cheesy Hollywood storyline, the plot holes so big the alien mothership could fly through them. Normally these things turn me off to a movie. But ID4 is too much fun, I don't care how bad it is.Paying homage to 50's invasion movies, 70's disaster movies, Star Wars, War of the Worlds, etc., ID4 digs right in as huge alien saucers drop into our atmosphere and hover ominously over the 30 most explodable landmarks in the world. They soon reveal that they're - gasp! - unfriendly and start wiping out humanity city by city. The rest of the movie follows several groups of characters trying desperately to come up with a way to fend off the slimy visitors.The fx, of course, are top-notch. There are a few battle scenes that are amazing. The acting isn't all that hot, but Will Smith is his usual perky self (I enjoy describing Will Smith as ""perky""), and Bill Pullman brings what he can to the presidency, including a scene late in the movie in which he rallies his attack pilots before the final battle; this over-the-top monologue is by far my favorite movie speech ever.

ANOTHER OVER-HYPED HOLLYWOOD FLICK.,"Absolutely the worst movie that Hollywood has delivered to the theaters and video stores.  I expected it to be equivalent to the 1953 classic ""War Of The Worlds,""  but it didn't even come close.  The plot was so stupid, that I'm sure it would insult the intelligence of an adult with a 3rd grade education.  The film tried to include some satire, which was not the least bit funny.  I thought that the film was legitimate at the beginning. Unfortunately, it became bogus during the scene where Will Smith is dragging the alien and talking in ""rap-language.""  From then on, the films plot and acting got progressively worse.  I give the special effects a ten, but give the remainder of the movie a negative ten.  Ten plus negative ten equals zero.

An excellent blockbuster that's far superior to its sequel.,"I really want to write a review that's aimed perhaps more to those who saw the sequel of this movie prior to watching the original upon which it was based. The general perception (mine's included) was that the sequel was a horrible blockbuster that was inferior in every way to the original. To judge the original based on the sequel would be wrong.1996's independence day was the breakout movie for Will Smith and it's a simple story of alien's invading earth. Now what makes this blockbuster different from many movies of this type that came before it and after it (including the sequels) it didn't just rely on a ton special effects and stereotypes to draw people to the cinema. It had the ability to make a wide range of characters who at the beginning of the movie are spread across Washington DC, New York City and California. The writers make us care about them, their outcomes, we feel their pain, their frustration etc. They're not just cannon fodder for the interstellar aliens to wipe away without a thought. I grew attached to many of the characters due to great performances by both the adult and children actresses and especially charismatic nature of Will Smith. Even though aliens might seem like a wild idea. I really believed that this might be how people would react to a global invasion. Its grounded in a way other films aren't.The special effects rely as much on minatures as they do on CGI effects but believe me. They still stand the test of time well. If anything they look a little more realistic than some computer generated effects I've seen. But they're not perfect. But alas I'm not watching movies only for CGI. In recent years (on disney plus) it seems the movie has been upscaled and released in HD so if you've seen it in the past you have the opportunity to see it more clearly than ever before. I first saw it as a kid on VHS. Now it looks way better. Please watch this movie before going onto the second movie. It's not the godfather, it's not the avengers in regards to CGI.

Clichéd but in a fun way,"I have to admit that, as far as Hollywood blockbusters go, 'Independence Day' has always been a favourite. The film starts on July 2nd, when the planet is thrown into chaos when number of alien starships enter the atmosphere and settle into orbit over various key cities worldwide before launching a devastating attack. Survivors-- including the American President and his staff, an Air Force pilot and his girlfriend, a drunk and his three kids and the cable repair man/genius who first discovered the aliens' intent-- congregated at a secret facility at Area 51 then on July 4th, they launch their counterattack.The characters were stereotypical but the actors, including Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch and Robert Loggia, all gave decent performances despite the cheesy dialogue they were sometimes lumbered with. Even then, the 'good' characters were all likable enough and you wanted to see the good guys strive through and win (unlike Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' where I wished someone would just dish the main characters up to the aliens) while the token difficult, arrogant politician played for 'boos' with good effect.In terms of the storyline, it was predictable and, at times, sugary but it was fun! It has everything from action to romance to humour to drama and even handled death with some degree of poignancy, and all this before the standard geeky character saves the world using the 1996 version of HG Wells' virus idea. The special effects used for destruction of the cities were impressive, even eleven years on, as was those used to depict the combat between the American planes and the aliens. It was quite breathtaking when I saw it in the cinema back in '96.The main complaint about 'Independence Day' seems to be over the depiction of Americans saving the world. As a Briton myself, I do find the idea that every other country would sit back and expect America to save us a tad idiotic, not to mention I like to think the majority of mature Americans don't need to be spoon-fed patriotism, but you can't expect deep thought from a blockbuster. And the President's nauseating Independence Day speech was good for a laugh.Overall, this is a fun film that was the first to update the whole 'disaster' flick genre. Don't nitpick but just kick back and enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The aliens launch a massive attack. Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is a military pilot on the counter-attack.Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep.

"Spectacular Sci-Fi movie including noisy action, massive images of destruction and breathtaking aerial scenes.","The aliens are coming and their goal is to invade and destroy Earth. Their main target: Annihilation on the human race. Fighting superior technology, mankind's best weapon is the will to survive. US President (Bill Pullman) leads the defense and along with the brave pilots (Will Smith, Harry Connick Jr., Randy Quaid) go into action. They messed with the wrong planet. We've always believed we weren't alone. On July 4th, we'll wish we were !. These extraterrestrials don't want to phone home...They want our home. The day we fight back! The doomsday ship !. On the Fourth of July, you will have a ringside seat for the ultimate fireworks show. We always knew they'd come back. They want only one thing . . . Destruction!. Humanity's last stand ¡. We've always believed we weren't alone.. But will mankind's new space defenses be enough?. These extraterrestrials don't want to phone home...They want our home. The day we fight back!. The doomsday ship, you will have a ringside seat for the ultimate fireworks show. Earth Take a good look. It could be your last. The question of whether or not we are alone in the universe has been answered. Warning ! Your next stop may not be there ¡.This exciting picture is full of action, emotion, feats, thrills, and it results to be interesting enough. Lifeless roles, effects that vary from overwhelming to cheesy and impossible jingoism are all on show here as America, with a little help from stereotypes aaround the world, puts paid to the power-hungry invaders, Following to the biggest of the new wave of disaster flicks and paying tribute to the Irwin Allen past celebrity-fests. Here Director Roland Emmerich goes on his ordinary trademarks, in fact he is an expert on making movies for the masses and specialist on large-scale disaster movies (Day after tomorrow) and spectacular stories (Stagate, The patriot, Universal soldier), and the epic adventure about global cataclysm that brings an end to the world, titled '2012'. This scrappy, spectacular, juvenile sequel Independence Day: is actually a remake of 'War of the Worlds' and taking parts of other sci-fi movies can be taken at face value. Here we find us again with similar elements to the previous entry, an alien armada descending Earth to cause destruction and chaos. The fate of the world rests in the hands of an unlikely band of Earthlings led by President Whitmore/Bill Pullman, a computer expert Jeff Goldblum and some valiant Marine fighter pilots, while the comic relief is provided by Will Smith and Judd Hirsch. Special effects with some of the more expensive newer technology don't disappoint. Strong cast with plenty of familiar faces and the film developing is full of unstopped action. Dean Devlin and Emmerich wrote Independence day and its follow-up while promoting 'Stargate' after a reporter asked Emmerich if he believed in Aliens. At times, everything feels anticlimatic after the fireworks, but the moral is clear, it's he end of the world as we know it and we feel fine.Followed by a run-of-the-mill sequel Independence Day: Resurgence (2016) with William Fichtner, Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher, Angelababy in a similar style to the original precedent, The story opens in outer space on the alien mothership. A creature is observing Thomas Whitmore's (Bill Pullman) rousing speech during the battle that took place 20 years earlier (from the first Independence Day film). The aliens are coming again and their goal is to invade and destroy Earth, it's an acceptable sequel, despite being an enlarged copy of the original with brief updates.Direction by Roland Emmerich is fitting as in all spectacle film that he makes . Roland Emmerich estimated that at least 2000 digital artists worked on the film. The motion picture was profesionally realized by Roland Emmerich, though with no originality. Roland made his feature length film in 1984 : ¨The Noah's ark principle¨ and he subsequently made ¨Joey¨. In 1997 wrote, directed, and produced the critically acclaimed ""Moon 44"" . Filmmaker Roland Emmerich quickly understood the freedom and malleability that direct in USA presents and has gone about creating some incredibly interesting genre fare in ¨Universal Soldier¨, his first American movie in which displayed an acute understanding of the action genre Roland ulteriorly directed in 1994 Stargate , in 1996 Independence Day, in 1998 Godzilla, 2000 The Patriot , 2004 The day after tomorrow , in 2008 10.000 , in 2011 Anonymous, in 2013 White House Down, among others . Rating : 6/10, acceptable and passable. The picture will appeal to disaster genre fans and Sci-fi enthusiasts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stands the test of time.,Independence Day is an epic movie with a great story and characters who we can all relate too. Not many movies came out with as much hype and excitement as this one and it lived up to every minute of it. 17 years later and with talk of possible sequels coming there is that excitement buzz once again.The special effects broke new ground on how an alien invasion could actually look like with 15 mile wide ships that cover entire cities. Yet the best thing about the movie is the fact that its not all about brawn but brains. For a movie that is 2.5 hrs long it grabs you for the opening scene and doesn't let up. 17 years old and it keeps getting better and better.

Dated & Verging on Slapstick,"This version gets high praises for anachronistic reasons...like compared to what? That's the key. This 1996, pre-internet, pre-smartphone, sci-fi wannabe isn't as deserving as the 1953 version of ""War of the Worlds"". Too many characters in this ""Independence Day"" verge on slapstick...too much more like satire than sci-fi, in the context of the mid-Nineties. Meanwhile, the recent sequel, 2017's ""Independence Day: Resurgence"", gets panned on modern standards, yet is much better storytelling...less frivolity, fewer yahoos! While its release-year context for sci-fi suggests the 1996 version was a big deal, a quarter-century later has it aging poorly; it's still entertainment, but some of the acting is crassly corny. Yep, the 2017 sequel suffers from from character carryover, but the modern storytelling is less slapstick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"My definition of an energetic, old-fashioned summer popcorn flick","Even though it is packed full of conventions, stereotypes, and clichés of the science-fiction genre and its detractors are right in calling it old-fashioned and dopey, ""Independence Day"" is actually a terrific feel-good popcorn flick from Roland Emmerich and Dead Devlin, the Hollywood cognoscenti for the genre. These two filmmakers love the popcorn movie genre, as they have stated numerous times and proved even more times with their pictures. None of their movies, from ""Independence Day"" to ""Godzilla"" to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" to the more recent ""2012"" were created with the intention of being taken seriously. They are continuing the tradition of the silly disaster films from the 70s and occasionally the silly science-fiction flicks of the 50s. Their superlative film is ""Independence Day,"" the box office champ of 1996 that started a broad interest in aliens as bloodthirsty war-mongers again.The cast is populated by a wide variety of Hollywood talents perfectly matched to the stereotypes written in the screenplay. Bill Pullman is the weary-eyed, weary-voiced president of the United States; Will Smith is the smart-mouthed fighter pilot ready to kick some alien tail while shelling out punch lines, Jeff Goldblum is the nerdy but smart TV cable man who figures out before everybody else that the aliens are going to attack, his ostensibly Jewish father is played by Judd Hirsch, and Randy Quaid is the drunken, delusional crop duster pilot who claims he once had a close encounter before.The aliens in the movie are even less original, having been pulled off the shelf of the creatures from the 1950s. The only real update is that they've now been generated using modern-day special effects and not puppets, men in suits, and stop-motion animation. Their ships are also a very good visual achievement, and the sight of a 15-mile wide flying saucer hovering over L.A. looks really darn cool.You would think by the way I've been pointing out stereotypes in my review that I didn't think too terribly much of ""Independence Day"" and that it was too clichéd for me to praise or recommend. You would think wrong. This is just my style of reviews; I point out the good and the bad in every movie I see.So you want to hear what I liked about ""Independence Day."" Three words: it was fun. Three more words: it's a popcorn movie. Four words now: I *love* popcorn movies! This is the type of movie that if done wrong can be dreadfully boring, but if done right, as here, then is sheer entertainment. Sure, we've seen the like of a movie like this before in terms of substance. And it most certainly is a movie with style over substance. Of course ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are better movies because their substance is more prominent than their style. But admit it, every now and then you are in the hankering for a good, old-fashioned flick. Sometimes those kitschy black-and-white films really fill in the void for you. So therefore, I see nothing wrong with continuing this tradition using a bigger budget and modern technology.Another reason why ""Independence Day"" works is that it enthusiastically embraces its kitschy charm. Every single moment of it is played for visual spectacle or an old-fashioned charm or gag. And this stereotyping in the cast is repetitive, but it's used in a way where it is amusing, not offensive. Take Will Smith's character, for example. Even though he is just playing the same mentality of his beloved character from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" (they seldom let him do anything else, after all) he brings a lot of charm and screen charisma to his performance. In the hands of a lesser actor, this role might have come across as annoying. But Smith is such a great performer that he makes it work. Randy Quaid is also in prime for as a deliberately comical drunk with a heart. And his final scene in the movie has deservedly gone on to become famous.And Roland Emmerich is very good at handling special effects sequences. There are numerous highly implausible moments, such as a fighter pilot maneuvering through a canyon while fighting off miniature UFOs, but the directing and the pacing is so tight that you don't stop to really nitpick over it, but embrace it. If there had been more dead air, you would have no choice but to stop and gripe.And unfortunately a lot of people do stop and gripe throughout the film. But even though I do enjoy this movie enormously, I can acknowledge and understand their points. This is the kind of movie you will either welcome and love for what it is or detest and scorn for what it is. As a summer popcorn movie flooded with enthusiasm and testosterone, I think it does its job most commendably. Roland Emmerich has made some really good popcorn flicks, but this is his best one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The acting, especially by Bill Pullman, Jeff Golblum, Robert Loggia and Will Smith in one of his first movies is good.

The alien disaster movies are back with a vengeance,Roland Emmerich is undoubtedly a very skilled director who knows how to please the crowd. This movie has several good points and a few bad points which can be easily overlooked. The good points: 1-The movie maintains good emotional distance not letting the audience lose the plot. 2-The movie was skillfully directed. 3- the acting was brilliant [ especially will smith ] 4- The movie is a technical masterpiece [ the sound and the graphics and the effects are simply great] 5-The fight scenes were skillfully executed. 6- The movie has inspirational quotes. 7-The movies is a visual spectacle. Roland Emmerich's artistic background as a sculptor has helped him. The bad points: 1-One that stands out is the lack of resistance of the alien computers to the virus. 2-The spaceship is not detected till it crosses the moon.Well thats all the bad I could figure out.

"Too many ""c'mon!"" moments.","I really like this movie. It's straight forward good vs. bad, people vs. aliens and the special effects are fantastic, even nearly 20 years later. Great action, some truly funny moments, great space flights, does not bore you at all. HOWEVER, this movie has some HUGE shortcomings. Dialogue - uggh. Bill Pullman as President - yech. Too many stereotypes and caricatures - do the blacks and Jews really need to be the Hollywood cookie-cutter? Sickening. And of course, the biggest 'eye-roller' of them all - giving an alien spaceship a computer virus. Was this plot piece thought of the same folks fell for the Ugandi Prince email scam?? Anyone with half a brain knows you can't just ""give"" something a computer virus - they aren't air-born germs...

War of the Worlds updated.,"Upon viewing Independence Day I immediately noticed that it was basically a remake of The War of the Worlds (finally). Initially the Earth is the victim of a devastating attack by alien beings. Faced with extermination mankind forgets it's petty quarrels and unites to battle the other world invaders. As in the War of the Worlds, conventional weapons are useless and even nuclear bombs have no effect. Finally a ""virus"" helps ensure a successful outcome (as opposed to bacteria). The acting in this movie is nothing great. Character development is just so-so and stone faced Bill Pullman is a bad choice for an inspiring leader. What really makes things happen are the dazzling special effects and David Arnold's sweeping score. Roland Emmerich's fast paced directorial skill keeps the story moving in spite of the B grade acting. However Randy Quade's portrayal of a chronic alcoholic is outstanding. This seems to be a favorite role of his, to the point that he's being type cast. All in all this movie is entertaining, enjoyable, and even patriotic.

Blockbuster shlock,"Independence Day combines valid blockbuster with shlock. It has decent basics: character set-up, a cohesive story, balanced action, and abundant pay-off. However, it's simplistic and often contrived. Thus, Independence Day feels like a story outline rather than a final draft. Characters are one-dimensional, plot points are unbelievably convenient, and emotions are corny. None of this is individually deal-breaking, but collectively seems hollow. Depthful characters, themes, emotions, or creativity would have helped plenty. Meanwhile, the acting is mostly sufficient. Pullman is trying, Smith and Goldblum are having fun, and Quaid does well. It's just Connick Jr. Who's annoying.Technically, Independence Day is fair. The cinematography and editing are adequate, with few heightening techniques. Similarly, the soundtrack flows with the emotional beats, but is generic. Conversely, the sound captures the massive destruction and alien tech. Plus, the alien designs are memorable. Their originality is questionable, but at least they have creativity put in. Lastly, the effects are dated, but complex. Miniatures explode, alien movements are animatronic, and air battles are green-screened. That combination sells the epic nature of the film. Ultimately, Independence Day is far from high art, but has enough to be a solid guilty pleasure.Writing: 4/10

No longer the movie I once despised,"What I remember about Roland Emmerich's Independence Day as I child is the cheesy one-liners, that Presidential speech that has everymen and war heroes alike puffing out their chest with patriotism, and a portrayal of a world where America acts as the sole voice of reason to a bunch of lesser powers who fully embrace their own stereotype. I always hated it, and could not fathom why the movie had gathered such a loyal army of fans throughout the years, even amongst critics. The film was, and still is, very much a modern-day blockbuster, but watching it again 15 or so years later, it now seems wonderfully old-fashioned.Dismissing the more studious, and admittedly more intelligent, first contact movies of the 1970s as liberal wishful thinking, Independence Day harks back to the alien invasion pictures of the 50s, where a more us-against-them approach catered to the Cold War- influenced paranoia of the time, and squared-jawed heroes, loony scientists and military personnel alike put their heads together to defeat a force from outer space. Here, we get Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller, a hotshot pilot who manages to capture one of the tentacled martians after a disastrous dogfight; Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, a genius satellite technician who uncovers the aliens' plans; and Bill Pullman as President Thomas Whitmore, a young ex-pilot going through an image crisis.The posters and trailers focused on the image of the giant alien ship looming over major American cities, and indeed the moments of catastrophic destruction (usually of famous landmarks) and giant energy beams still manage to amaze, with the special effects still holding up 20 years later. Yet the movie spends most of its time at ground level, and crams it with enough characters and side-stories to fill another 3 films. The three central, intertwining stories aside, we also have a sub-plots involving Hiller's wife Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) encountering the wounded First Lady (Mary McDonnell), and a boozed-up crop duster played by Randy Quaid, whose claims of alien abduction have made him a laughing stock. Throw in Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, Harvey Fierstein and Brent Spiner, and there's enough going on to make your head spin.Yet Independence Day manages to burst through the convolution by sheer force, delivering a story that is simplistic, ham-fisted and very stupid, but never unspectacular. The three leads help make their characters memorable and incredibly likable with charisma alone, as the script never allows them to be anything more than an archetype. It's the very definition of big, dumb and fun, and was a bit of a game-changer in its day. Disaster movie audiences were no longer satisfied unless they witnessed carnage on a global level, and blockbusters today are still trying to replicate the success of 'ID4', including the director himself, who tried and failed on an astronomic level with the utterly atrocious 2012 (2009). I didn't see it coming, but my opinion of Independence Day has completely changed. Perhaps the movie's age gives it a nostalgic charm it never had before, so I'm hardly anticipating the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A great holiday film,"On July 2nd, communications systems worldwide are sent into chaos by a strange atmospheric interference. It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species. It's up to the American military -and some unlikely heroes- to put a stop to this monstrous invasion and save humanity.I've watched this again recently like many films recently, partly as I enjoyed them the first time around and partly to see how they stand the test of time. This film is what we British would call Jingoistic. A self appreciating film which puts the US at front and centre of saving the entire planet. However as faux as that sounds, it's still a good film with some memorable moments such as Captain Miller (Will Smith) punching the alien in the face. Bill Pullman badly lets the side down in the acting stakes, but apart from him it's really not bad. There are many things that date the film, but if you ignore the jingoism and the bad acting it's still a decent enough Sci Fi drama. I'm heading off to watch Independence Day 2 now, which I've never seen, and I'm keen to see how some of the same actors fare 20 years on.I would give it 6.5 if I could but IMDB only allows whole numbers so it will have to be a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"So out of touch, even in 1996","Everything in this movie is so wrong.Another reviewer wrote this ""But I enjoyed the movie from start to end, even with all the clichés, the American-ish touch, the sometimes laughable dialog."" I couldn't agree more, and of course there's the religious silliness, but I guess that's covered by ""American-ish"". The logic of that in a movie like this is sooooo faaaar oooout!So why did I give it a 7/10? It's entertaining, and in 1996 this was the first of a new era of sci-fi I think. I am, in general, a massive fan of sci-fi, so I guess that makes me a bit biased as well.Independence Day is a B-movie with an A-movie cast and budget.

The best disaster movie ever!,"I'm a big fan of disaster films and have seen most of them. Independence Day comes out the top as the best one. Action, tension, emotion, fun and amazing special FX executed brilliantly. Made before the annoying trends of shaky-cam and dark filters, it's pleasing to the eye as well. You actually see real colours and the sun, not to mention clear skies before trails became the norm. As silly as some of I.D.'s premises are, it's anchored by an excellent script, great acting and direction. A fun roller coaster ride from beginning to end and one of the few movies that actually delivers the entertainment it promises.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
ID4 Was the Highlight of My Summer in 1996; It's Lost Some of its Luster Now,"If you had asked me what I thought of INDEPENDENCE DAY when it was first released, I would've given it a solid 10 out of 10. I was twelve years old when it first came to theaters and I remember seeing it that opening weekend. It blew my mind. I immediately went out and started buying the action figures and the alien fighter, and I even bought the movie novelization. I still have one of the big alien figures with motion sensors that make it roar and open its head cavity to reveal the little alien dude inside. I found it at a Salvation Army for something like $10 a few years ago. Of course I bought it because I seriously loved this movie as a kid. Now? Well, I still have a soft spot for it but it doesn't hold my attention as well anymore. I've grown and seen countless movies since INDEPENDENCE DAY hit theaters. My tastes have expanded and there's very little room for Roland Emmerich's alien invasion, other than nostalgia. Pretty much everyone has seen this movie at one point or another and are at least vaguely familiar with it. Aliens arrive at Earth on July 2nd and their enormous saucers settle in over major population centers while humans around the world lose their minds. Eventually the aliens begin a devastating series of attacks and send the survivors scrambling for some means of defeating them. Their ultimate solution: Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and an Apple computer.There's no denying the sense of fun that comes with any of the big action sequences in the film. Watching the movie again after all these years, I love the dog-fighting scenes just as much now as I did then. And you know what? They still look great. I was recently made aware that most of these big action sequences were done with miniatures and motion-tracking, and that's really incredible. These dogfighting battles are chaotic with jets and alien fighters swarming and blasting each other out of the sky, and I never would've guessed it hadn't all been done with visual effects. There were some in there to give it that extra flair but a lot of those are miniatures. No wonder I can watch it now, 20 years after its initial release, and be just as engaged as I was the first time. And of course there's the massive destruction sequences for which the movie is famous. Everyone knows the shot of the alien beam weapon blasting down on the White House and exploding and, again, it was done with miniatures and it still looks amazing. From a technical and visual standpoint, INDEPENDENCE DAY is still marvelous. Watching it again now, it's no surprise that twelve-year-old me loved this movie so much. It's got great action, great FX, and some of the coolest creature designs I've seen in a movie. The aliens in INDEPENDENCE DAY are still one of the best designed science fiction creatures I've seen in film.My problem with INDEPENDENCE DAY is that any scene that doesn't directly involve the aliens or the big dogfights is sort of dull. There is a lot of boring extra material in the movie and, at over two hours long, it could've used a trim. If they had edited this movie down to a solid 110 minutes, I'd probably still love it. Did we really need the whole Randy Quaid subplot? For those who don't remember, Randy Quaid plays Randy Quaid as a drunken crop-duster who we follow as he packs up his stepchildren in an RV and evacuates as part of a huge caravan where he eventually crosses paths with Will Smith and gets a chance for redemption in the big final battle. Who cares? Cut it. It added nothing to the film. We can also cut down a bit on the Vivica A. Fox subplot where she rescues the injured First Lady from a crashed helicopter and collects survivors in a tow truck. Don't cut it (her reconnection with Will Smith in the third act is nice) but trim it down. We don't need to spend as much time with them. Keep the focus on the alien invasion and how the government is dealing with it. Smith, Goldblum, and Bill Pullman as the U.S. President are the film's heroes and we shouldn't be cutting away from them so often; all the real interesting stuff is happening with them. No one thinks back on INDEPENDENCE DAY and fondly remembers Randy Quaid arguing with his son or Vivica Fox having a fireside chat with the President's wife. We remember Will Smith being chased by an alien fighter through the Grand Canyon or the captured alien awakening mid-dissection to tentacle-choke Brent Spiner in a crazy horror scene.That about sums up my thoughts on INDEPENDENCE DAY. All the cool stuff you remember is still cool, and it's even more impressive that it still works twenty years later. Will Smith knocking an alien unconscious with a single punch and muttering ""Welcome to Earth"" is still awesome. But there's a lot of filler tossed in there to give this movie a more epic scope that just doesn't interest me and it can make the film's bloated runtime difficult to get through. Even moreso if you're watching the extended cut with an additional fifteen minutes of footage. It tries to take itself a little too seriously for a movie with Judd Hirsch cracking wise in Area 51 but, even with its flaws, it's still a classic in its own right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best seen big screen but okay,"Watched this on telly last night and it didn't have the same impact. The story is okay, a bit too all-American hero rightly stuffed to take seriously but okay. Jeff Goldblum's dad was meant to be lovable but I found him annoying. I liked Will Smith's girlfriend; a lot. The special effects were good. You just know all the dogs and children are going to survive but who would want them dead? I liked the President being kept in the dark about Area 51 and the flying combat scenes were well done. Genuine popcorn fun for all the family and not a bad way to spend a few hours.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Explosive yet predictable,"Independence Day is a film that undeniably offers a hefty dose of entertainment with its large-scale action and impressive visual effects. The spectacle of the alien invasion and the subsequent battle for Earth is undeniably thrilling, and the film's sheer scale is impressive. The special effects, especially for its time, were groundbreaking and still hold up in many respects, delivering the grandiose destruction and chaos you'd expect from a summer blockbuster.However, despite these positives, I found the film to be riddled with issues that detract from its overall impact. The plot feels highly derivative, borrowing heavily from other alien invasion narratives without adding much new or innovative to the genre. The predictability of the storyline makes it hard to stay fully engaged, as the outcome and key plot points become all too obvious early on.The film's dialogue often comes off as clunky and clichéd, which, combined with its lengthy runtime, contributes to a sense of weariness as the story drags on. The over-the-top absurdity of some scenes, while entertaining in its own right, occasionally crosses the line into the realm of the implausible. This makes it harder to suspend disbelief and fully immerse myself in the film's world.All in all, Independence Day delivers in terms of spectacle and entertainment, offering a fun, if not entirely original, cinematic experience. However, its predictability, overlong runtime, and at times cringe-worthy dialogue make it a less engaging watch than it could have been. If you're in the mood for a high-octane action flick with grand effects, it's worth a watch, but don't expect a groundbreaking narrative or deeply memorable dialogue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"Loved the movie. I won't put any spoilers in. Great acting by all cast members. I have enjoyed both, do hope there's a 3rd one in the future. I will definitely buy it! I just read alot of the reviews so l had to come back to say to the people that scored the movie so low, number 1, it was a fiction movie but it was a great movie. I loved hearing the President's speech, we need more of a speech in the real world today! That speech moved me even though it was just a movie! The part where he wants to join the other people to fight the aliens l thought that was great, again in real life be nice to have a President that cared enough if anything happened in real life would be willing to put his life on the line. That's what made this movie great! I think some people forget it's just a movie, but when l watch a movie l look at the story line, acting, etc. They all did a great job.

"Independence Day: A Spectacle of Thrills, but Not Without Its Flaws","In the summer of 1996, Roland Emmerich's ""Independence Day"" burst onto the big screen with a massive alien invasion, delivering a blockbuster spectacle that captured the imagination of audiences worldwide.The movie's strength lies in its ability to create a palpable sense of awe and terror. The opening sequence, depicting massive alien ships hovering over major cities, is a masterclass in building suspense and tension. Emmerich's direction effectively conveys the global chaos and devastation that ensues, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats.The ensemble cast, led by Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, delivers solid performances that add depth to the otherwise straightforward plot. Smith's charismatic portrayal of a fighter pilot turned hero is a highlight, providing much-needed levity and humor amidst the intense action sequences.Visually, ""Independence Day"" is a feast for the eyes. The special effects, while dated by today's standards, were groundbreaking at the time and still hold up remarkably well. The scenes of alien ships unleashing their destructive power on iconic landmarks like the White House and the Empire State Building are both thrilling and haunting.However, the film is not without its flaws. The script often relies on clichés and predictable plot points, lacking the depth and nuance that could have elevated it to a truly great sci-fi film. The characters, while likable, are somewhat one-dimensional, and the dialogue can feel contrived at times.Additionally, the movie's portrayal of science and technology stretches credibility to the breaking point. The idea that a computer virus could be used to disable an advanced alien civilization's technology is laughable, but it serves as a convenient plot device to resolve the conflict.Despite these shortcomings, ""Independence Day"" remains a highly entertaining and influential blockbuster. It captured the imagination of audiences with its grand scale and thrilling action sequences, cementing its place in the annals of summer popcorn flicks. While not a masterpiece, it delivers precisely what it promises: a rollercoaster ride of spectacle and excitement, making it a worthy addition to any sci-fi enthusiast's collection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Apart from its thinly veiled pseudo-patriotism, this film had many other annoyances, not least of which was the miraculous compatibility between a Macintosh and an alien computer from 90 light-years away.

"Mindless entertainment isn't a bad thing, but this one's still pretty weak even at that.","4 out of 10Collaborators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have time and again proven themselves the most unoriginal filmmakers working in Hollywood today. Independence Day is the epitome of their lack of ideas, as they simply steal concepts from previous movies (better or worse movies is still questionable) and graft it here, typical so that it can lead to stuff getting blown up real good.  That is the extent of Independence Day's appeal, to see things blow up, and believe me, that can get old real fast.A lot of things about the movie have always bothered me, whether it's the unnecessarily lengthy countdown the aliens have toward destruction, as it gives ample time for city-dwellers to escape.  Or perhaps it's how pathetically easy the aliens are to defeat once their shields drop.  Are we to assume that raggedy groups of inexperienced combat pilots could suddenly defeat the ferocious (and far numerous) swarms of alien fighters?  Perhaps taking the cake is the very fact that the alien motherships, when destroyed, actually crash by slanting sideways so as they won't fall on the targets below them.The action sequences deliver sporadic thrills, but they get repetitive very quickly, as it's mostly watching fighter jets and alien spacecrafts blow up. Some variation, perhaps infantry combat, would have been nice.  I think it says a lot about Independence Day when I state that it happens to be the 3rd best alien invasion flick of 1996 (the superior ones being Star Trek: First Contact and The Arrival).  When you realize how rare alien invasion movies are, then it's obvious that being 3rd best is a dubious remark.  There's been talk of a sequel for years now, but come on, do we all seriously believe that won't be a bad film, either?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Blast from the Past!,"Independence Day is a quintessential summer blockbuster that delivers on all fronts: action, spectacle, and a touch of nostalgia.

The destruction scenes are both awe-inspiring and terrifying, showcasing the sheer scale of the alien invasion.While the dialogue can be a bit cheesy at times, it adds to the film's charm and doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment. In fact, these moments of levity provide a nice balance to the intense action sequences, making the movie a fun and entertaining watch.Compared to its sequel, ""Independence Day: Resurgence,"" the original film remains superior in terms of storytelling, character development, and overall impact. The sequel, while visually impressive, lacks the heart and cohesive narrative that made the 1996 film a classic.Independence Day is a must-watch for fans of sci-fi and action films.

"ID4-It really happened...In Mexico, 1519.","I'm actually pleased at the two sided conflict this visually enjoyable but otherwise uneven presentation of a very interesting subject matter (alien invasion) has inspired. Though I don't agree with them, I'm not suprised at the resentment many non-American nationals felt about the films patriotic theme. I also don't feel that ID4 was meant to be mindless drivel. It's excellent first half was followed by a weak second half simply because there wasn't enough time left to set up an equally perfect ending.We must remember that H.G. Wells wrote ""War of the Worlds"" as a commentary on British Imperialism. In other words, he wanted to give his society a vicarious taste of its own medicine. Many ID4 critics dismissed the film as mindless, flag waving claptrap. But did anyone notice the disturbing parallels between this movie and the Spanish Conquest of Mexico? In ID4 giant ships carrying an alien race armed with horrifying weaponry approach the great cities of the world. The leadership of these countries is indecisive on what to do. Some advise attack. Otherwise insist on waiting. Meanwhile, the lesser countries appear unaffected by the invasion. (i.e., Southern Hemisphere Unaffected was seen on a t.v. broadcast early in the film) Before we know it. The Alien Visitors are upon us. And waste our cities. In Mexico, 1519, large unusual ships appear in the eastern horizon. Panic and awe engulf the populace. The alien visitors are tall, white skinned, have hairy faces and terrifying weapons. They ride monstrous looking dragons (horses) and are accompanied by giant, viscious dogs (staghounds. In Mexico at that time, the chihuahua was the biggest dog. And most ferocious, too) They appear invincible. As they approach the great city of Tenochtitlan they align themselves with subjected nations (Tlaxcala, Totonacs, etc). The native leader Montezuma doesn't know what to do. Attack? Surrender? Negotiate?One scene in ID4 moved me. The fear and awe inspired by the arrival of the awesome alien ships.Bernal Diaz, a journalist accompanying Cortez, wrote of the silent awe, fear and fascination displayed by the thousands of  Aztecs lining the road and every rooftop as the Spaniards, clad in metal armor which rattled like an enormous inhuman machine, marched into their doomed city.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One of my favorite sci-fi movies, thanks to the humor","Independence Day is one of the few Sci-Fi movies that I really like. The main reason for that is because there is a certain amount of humor in it thanks to Will Smith. Not everything the man has ever done works perfectly (I really didn't like ""Wild Wild West"" for instance), but in this movie he is more than OK.A few days before Independence Day, a signal is received from outer space and large objects are spotted on a collision course with planet earth. At first everybody thinks they are dealing with meteorites, but soon they find out that these are actually alien aircrafts. Of course they try to make contact with the aliens, believing that they aren't hostile, but as their attempts don't get any response, a scientist finds out that the aliens are positioning themselves on strategic places, ready to destroy the human race. They almost succeed, but the few survivors that are left, will fight back and do everything possible to destroy the alien war crafts...If there is anything bad I can say about this movie than it must be the obvious and overdone American patriotism that can be found in this movie. Nothing else really bothered me. I liked the special effects, the humor was nice, the story more than OK and the acting was very good.

The quintessential Roland Emmerich movie complete with all that entails,"When an alien ship one fourth the size of the moon approaches Earth, several 15 mile wide ships break off from it and position themselves in major cities across the globe. In the United States, Preisdent Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) convenes with his Cabinet to find the best possible solution to their presence. Meanwhile MIT graduate turned cable repairman David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) stumbles across an alien signal believing it is counting down to a unified attack by the ships. Using his connection with his ex-wife Constance (Margaret Colin) whose also the communications director for the White House, David brings his findings to the President who issues a retreat aboard Air Force One before the aliens unleash their coordinated attack. Now with many cities in ruins and forces decimated humanity must unite to fight back against the alien forces.Following the success of Stargate, producers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich got to work on their next film following an offhanded remark by Emmerich about 15 mile wide flying saucers at a press junket for Stargate. Following Devlin and Emmerich's first draft the two sent it out where it was picked up by Peter Chernin at 20th Century Fox a day after being sent out. The film had a massive promotional push by 20th Century Fox including its 30 second spot aired during Super Bowl XXX which featured the now iconic shot of the White House being destroyed and Independence Day is widely credited with how blockbusters are marketed and sold with Super Bowl spots still a very popular way to increase awareness of potential blockbusters. While critical reception was mostly mixed (though more positive than Stargate) the movie did amazing box office becoming the highest grossing film of 1996 and at the time the second highest grossing film of all time behind Jurassic Park (not accounting for inflation). Independence Day was a massive event when it came out and was also the last major production to use miniatures for effects shots (such as the White House blowing up which was a real scale model) before the prevalence of CGI made these types of films more reliant on digital effects in place of traditional effects. Independence Day is often quoted, homage, and parodied, but it's also undeniably a simple ""Earth vs. Flying Saucers"" story only with an oversized effects and marketing budget. Like other Roland Emmerich movies of this type, the excess and ridiculousness is part of the appeal and if that's what you're in the market for Independence Day has it.Independence Day is the movie where Roland Emmerich becomes the director we know using many of the same tropes he tapped into in Stargate and expanding them with an ensemble cast. Much like Stargate we have our ""geek"" character with Goldblum's David, we have our conspiracy theorist/outsider character but TWO of them this time with Randy Quaid's alien abductee Russell and Brent Spiner's eccentric scientist Dr. Okun, our ""Maverick"" played by Will Smith, and a host other character types too long to list. While none of the characters have much depth, we do get a large ensemble so even if there's not much too these characters at least Emmerich knows to keep things moving so we don't dwell on how flat and/or stock these characters are. That's not to say there aren't so good standouts. Bill Pullman is quite good as President Whitmore and there's a lot of fun to be had from seeing him command authority before literally leading the charge in the climax. Jeff Goldblum is at his most ""Goldblum"" and is probably a better nerd archetype than James Spader was in Stargate by virtue of not being as over the top in his dweebiness, and the chemistry between Goldblum and his father played by Judd Hirsch works really well with some humorous moments between the two of them. But easily the biggest breakout is Will Smith who despite appearing in the hit film Bad Boys from the previous year was often relegated to the background in favor of focus on Martin Lawrence's exaggerated comedy. Will Smith gets to show off the charisma and swagger that defined his breakthrough into stardom and even with a flatly written role with not much meat on it he sells every scene he's in such as punching out an alien and saying ""Welcome to Earth"" or his annoyance with dragging an alien corpse through the desert.There's really not much I can say about the plot other than it's basically Earth vs. The Flying Saucers if instead of Ray Harryhausen it was Irwin Allen who made the movie and gave it the same star studded cast and hokey melodrama you'd see in Poseidon Adventure or Towering Inferno. The movie is noted for its silly plot developments like the inclusion of the Roswell UFO crash, the ""computer virus"" plot point, and of course Area 51 which in a rather humorous bit of trivia lost cooperation of the real U. S. military because Emmerich and Devlin wouldn't take it out of the movie. The movie is filled with all those tropes that would be re-visited again and again by Emmerich and Devlin (often to diminishing returns) such as Day After Tomorrow or 2012 and they were never done better than they were here. With its paper thin characters and paper thin plot, the movie does put them through explosive and impactful action sequences, and while this type of carnage is fairly commonplace today the fact these were done with actual tangible models makes the sequences a bit more impressive visually speaking.Independence Day is the framework that shaped many low script high action box office filler for many years to come. While its success inspired imitators attempting to ape its success to diminishing returns I can't be denied that the commitment from its ensemble cast and effects work was a major asset in the film's favor. Like its successors Independence Day has a lot of flash and explosions but not much going on underneath the surface. Regardless of whether you love or hate the movie this is Emmerich at the top of his game, take that for what it's worth.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Ultimate Summer Action Movie...Period.,"This is it. The penultimate summer action movie. Car's don't explode, they fly 50 feet away. Buildings don't fall down, they get incinerated. And if that's not enough, New York doesn't just get busted up, it gets leveled...along with every other major city in the world.There's only one guy ballsy enough to make this movie, and that's Roland Emmerich. ""Big"" just doesn't cut it. Nor does ""epic,"" for that matter. You have to at least admire a guy that completely skips on the kitchen sink and instead throws in New York, Los Angeles, The Presidency, and a space ship that's a quarter the size of our moon. Now THAT'S what I'm talking' about!Of course, it helps tremendously that ""Independence Day"" is immensely entertaining. The action, of which there is plenty, is exciting, and there are more one-liners than there are fingers and toes of you and the person sitting next to you. And, oh yeah, don't forget the creepy aliens.Anyway, the story stars on July 3, when radar picks up a signal coming from the moon. Then, after introducing us to the surprisingly vast array of characters, the alien ships show up. And they're not looking to become your next door neighbor. So after causing massive destruction, a few stragglers gather together to bring them down.Yes, that's vastly oversimplifying things. But for a movie that has so much going on, it accomplishes everything it sets out to do: provide eye-popping action, and a good few laughs along the way. Nothing seems to be left out, and there aren't any glaring mistakes.The cast is made up of a few well known faces and a surprising amount of character actors. All of them do their job extremely well. Of them, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman can be considered the ""main"" characters. Will Smith is one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood, and it's not hard to see why. He has more range than is often recognized, and his screen appeal is undeniable. He also has considerable comic skill (after all, he was the star of one of the funniest sitcoms ever on TV). His performance as fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller is among his best performances. Jeff Goldblum is once again playing a geek, but unlike ""Jurassic Park,"" Goldblum's David Levinson is not an egotistical jerk. He has solid chemistry with his co-stars, specifically Smith, and his father, Julius (well-played by Judd Hirsch). Bill Pullman is the weakest of the three, although that's hardly a damning statement. He acquits himself well enough amidst the surrounding talent, and never fades into the background (which he has done in other roles). The smaller roles are made up of recognizable faces, including Randy Quaid as an alcoholic pilot (played with the off-the-wall panache that only Randy Quaid can give), Mary McDonnell as the First Lady, Robert Loggia as a general, Vivica A. Fox as Hiller's stripper girlfriend, Margaret Colin as a Presidential aide (and David's ex). Cameos by Harvey Fierstein as David's co-worker and Brent Spiner as an off-the-wall scientist are also good. But special mention has to go to Harry Connick, Jr. as Jimmy Wilder, Hiller's best friend. Connick is electrifying, and often steals scenes from Smith (something that is quite difficult).This is summer fun, and Emmerich knows this. There's never a moment where it takes itself very seriously (even though there are a few times where the opportunity arises). Critics weren't very approving of this movie, and you know what? It doesn't matter. This is not an artistic movie of any sort. It's plain and simply entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh, why...?","Here is another super-high budget film, with lots of effects, and lots of everything. The resulting film is quite impressive in the action scenes, but... let me ask...Why...? Why did they have to include such a president (in the best Air Force One style) and not a more credible one...?Why...? Why did they have to include a drunken pilot instead of some other credible character...?Why...? Why did they choose Will Smith for such a role when he was still in people's mind as the funny Fresh Prince of Bel-Air...?Why...? Why a NASA candidate had to be living with an exotic dancer...?I could continue with many more questions, but I think you get the point.All in one question, I'd like to ask:Why do they spend so much money and do the hardest part of the film so well done and spoil the rest of it with so many strange items...?Is it perhaps that the writers didn't receive enough money to write a better screenplay...? Sincerely, I can't believe it. And nowadays there are lots of films in this same style, I mean, with lots of money spent in the technical aspects of the film and horrible screenplay and/or actors.Is it perhaps that they knew that people would like the result? Is it perhaps that I'm wrong and most people really like that trash...?Or is it perhaps that they thought that the film was too horrifying that they had to include comic elements to make it a lighter horror film...?Maybe there is no explanation at all, but in any case I think they failed in their intentions whatever they were.5-6 out of 10 (just for the effects).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

You can love to hate it,"There comes a paradox with movies as bad as these. They're like a bad car accident, you wince at seeing the carnage and realize the tragedy of the situation, but you just have to take in the entirety of it. You are compelled to observe, it proves too difficult to look away. This movie is awful, there is no getting around it. At the same time, I sat through the entire movie, transfixed in horror at how terrible it was. Worse, years later, I was compelled to watch it again, knowing precisely how awful it was the first time around. It didn't get better with the second viewing. The only thing artful about this movie is how they managed to appeal to the primitive portion of our brains that revels in inane stupidity. The sad thing is, I somehow doubt this was their intent.

A pure summer blockbuster,"Big, dumb fun. Everything up to the attack is nearly perfect, save for some rather inane subplots. The suspense and gradual horror is terrific. Some of it is kinda silly, but it doesn't ruin the film. Unfortunately, almost everything after the attack is even sillier, and really ruins the film. The inane subplots from the first half are widened to become the bulk of the film in the second half, and logic and reason are more and more done away with. By the end, it's become hopelessly jingoistic and patriotic, and far too cheesy. The cast is pretty good, with some great chemistry between Smith and Goldblum, and the special effects are still stunning today, which make up for the failings of the plot.

Check brain at the door and you'll love it,"I think this is one of those movies that, by virtue of it's sci-fi and technological nucleus, gets the kind of intellectual analysis it does not need or deserve.

I don't think for a second the director, writers, or producers, had any intention at any step of the way to create a serious sci-fi film on any level. They wanted to create an entertaining sci-fi film.3.) If the ""Yay! America saves the world!"" subtext is too obnoxious or offensive or overdone to some I say so what? I don't see anything wrong with it. In fact I love it. And I believe the vast majority of the audience did as well.4.) The film has a lot of problems that require you to check out of reality for a little while. Once you do that you're fine.5.) I've never seen so many instant fighter pilots step out of so many RV's in my life.6.) Apple laptops can't upload viruses to alien motherships.7.)

Taken on entertainment value alone this is a good movie.,"Taken on entertainment value this is a good movie; its big, thrilling, and action packed.

Great entertainment though.For the most part the story follows Will Smith as an army of alien spaceships attack earth and threaten to destroy the human race. There's a huge cast attached, banding together to stop the invasion with multiple story arcs converging. The initial take down by the aliens is well done, devastating on a global level with fire balls etc.It's one of those movies that I catch myself watching and enjoying every time I stumble across it on TV.I enjoyed Bill Pullman as the president, Jeff Goldblum's banter with his crotchety dad Judd Hirsch.

Have people forgotten how to suspend disbelief?,"I really had no intentions of writing a review of this film, but I watched it tonight in 4K and thought I'd drop in here to see what others had to say. I didn't read a lot of reviews back in 1996 and just thought this was a great film. Don't mistake me, it's not, ""The Godfather,"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but it IS a very watchable film that, for me, still holds up today.I didn't then or now, expect a realistic film depicting what would happen if Earth were visited by alien beings because that's not what this was. It's a summer blockbuster that back in 1996 was a crowd pleaser. Back then, apparently, people were more able to suspend their disbelief at what they were seeing and just enjoyed the film for what it was.Now, it just seems that people want to nit-pick this film to death. Even Roger Ebert did it. I read through his review and then the comments below it and found it hard to accept that either Ebert or the people commenting there were taking this film so seriously. Why did this happen? How did that happen? How come Will Smith left his soon-to-be wife and son behind when he left to go fight the aliens? Why didn't they just destroy everything at one time? The CGI is dated (No, it's not!). And on and on with the buzz killing.I'm seeing this a lot more in the past few years. People just ripping things apart for usually dubious reasons. Will Smith hadn't slapped anyone at the Oscars when this film was made. Randy Quaid was a relatively normal person when this film was made. The Twin Towers still stood in Manhattan. The 2008 housing crisis was still 12 years away. COVID was more than two decades in the future. And yes, Jeff Goldblum always talks like that, and it's wonderful!In sum, I enjoyed this movie tonight as much as I did when it first came out. CGI still looks great, and if it didn't, surely 4K would have made that even more obvious. I don't have complaints about the plot. It is what it is. Some of the cliches people are complaining about actually CAME from this movie. What I did see that I wasn't really expecting was a confirmation of my own opinion that the best possible thing that could happen to America and the whole Earth right now is an alien invasion, because it seems like the only thing that might bring us back together as one human race. Nothing else seems to be working, and it definitely works that way in this movie.It's a good time, this film, and deserves the classic status it holds.

The Ultimate Popcorn Flick,"Independence Day has everything you need for a summer blockbuster: big stakes, exotic location, and larger than life characters.It has the big stake in the form of aliens coming to destroy the Earth.

A sad commentary on the insecurity of a nation.,"This piece of tripe was one of the worst and most offensive movies I have ever seen. 0 out of 10. Negative numbers, even. Was there one, single original idea in the whole film? Not that I could spot. The aliens were a bald faced copy of H.R. Giger's ""Alien."" Their fighter craft were knockoffs of those used in ""War Of The Worlds"", released more than 40 years prior. The idea that a computer virus could be used to defeat an alien technology millions of times more advanced than our own is insulting to anyone with half a brain. It's been done, and the idea comes off as badly here as before. (Read ""3001: Final Odyssey"" by Arthur C. Clarke.)These points alone aren't enough to ruin a movie completely; they merely add to the ridiculousness of it in this case. When ID was released, I read an article in Time magazine that talked about the psychology behind the movie. At the time, the United States had run out of Enemies. The Soviet Union wasn't a threat anymore, and the Middle East had already been pounded into submission during the Gulf War. There was no one for us to pick on, to show our overwhelming superiority to. Sensing the void, Hollywood created a new enemy in the race of planet conquering aliens seen in this film. And they made that enemy seem so invincible that it's all the more remarkable in the end when the macho Americans are able to defeat them single-handedly. Yes, it is the good old USA that saves the day, all by itself. Wil Smith's machismo is nauseating. In a movie that doesn't take itself so seriously (Men In Black) this kind of acting is entertaining. But not here.I am an American, and I take pride in America. But this movie exemplifies everything that is wrong with our outlook. We shouldn't have to build up our self esteem by pretending we are so superior, even to alien races who have conquered space. From a credibility standpoint, this is absurd. Like so many bad sci-fi movies, the producers never stopped to consider the unlikeliness of the scenario. Without going on a tirade about ""alien paranoia""- that is, the belief that extra terrestrial life forms are always hostile and want to steal our planet- I'll just say this: to say that the ""Melissa"" or the ""I Love You"" virus would be effective against their technology would be like saying that a couple of guys armed with pea shooters could take out an entire Panzer tank division.Don't waste your time with this. Watch an intelligent sci-fi movie, like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", or ""Contact.""

More fun than War of the Worlds,"While the 2005 WoTW probably is a much more artistic and carefully made 'Aliens blow up the world!' summer blockbuster,ID4 is much more fun.When ominously large,round alien ships enter the atmosphere,the wonder and awe of meeting extraterrestrial life that Earth experiences quickly fades into abject terror as the ships proceed to obliterate anything and anyone in their path. An ensemble of plucky heroes,most notably a computer technician and chess enthusiast(Jeff Goldblum),a tough and streetwise Marine pilot(Will Smith),his stripper girlfriend(the luscious Viveca A. Fox)with her son and dog in tow,a crazed vet working as a crop-duster(Randy Quaid,stealing EVERY scene he's in)and,of course,the President(Bill Pullman,butched and brooding,as contrasted to his whacked-out turn in the previous ""Mr.Wrong"")who has the task of being both a father and inspirational leader at this time.The plot points are firmly in place,the lines are spit out like professional writers made them(as if!),and there's expositions aplenty. Throw in a tie-in to Area 51 paranoia and some stock side characters(a fried scientist played by Brent Spiner,the put-upon kids of Quaid's character,a tightly-wound General played by Robert Loggia,the President's cute-as-a-button daughter and his doomed first lady, played by an underused MAry McDonnell,Judd Hirsch as Goldblum's character's kvetching dad,etc.)and you've got an instantly accessible hit. And yet,despite the sense of eye-rolling predictability about this film,it still is a fun ride! The action moves at such a fluid pace that it doesn't allow you the viewer to dwell too deeply on the light characters or the overly jingoistic sentiment.People who saw this on the big screen probably got the added bonus of being able to experience the audio intensity of the film's sound editing that you probably won't get from seeing it on video or TV. DVD might give you SOME of that effect,but unless you have a home theater system with surround sound,I kinda doubt it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This film is so so average...but does it predict the future??,"As we all know, this film isn't very good... An undefeatable force of aliens is defeated, by Will Smith. It's ridiculous obviously! But what I want to look at is the proleptic nature of th film.This is a pre 9/11 film and just as well because I don't think it would have been half as successful or entertaining had it been post 2001. This is because when the movie was first seen, blowing up buildings from the sky was not a reality....it was very very cool. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centres taste in action films, particularly American taste, has changed radically.The remarkable element of this film is that it managed to satirise the war with Iraq before it even happened, let me explain:In the film America has some big buildings destroyed by a force they do not understand and are threatened by, and of course they assume that the rest of the world is threatened also without really asking them! Then America saves the day with the President leading the troops from the front line, the only solution is to totally destroy this new life form. Surely this film represents the George Bush dream world in which he, and preferably Will Smith, save the human race.The truth is, this film could be re-released today and modern critics would slate it for being unsubtle American propaganda. The stunning point of this film is that it was made in 1996!As films go however this one isn't that good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fun little popcorn flick,"I remember the hype that went behind this movie. A fairly Super Bowl commercial, a FOX special, a bunch of related shows or something... I don't remember the exact details, but I remember that there was a movement that was pushing this movie as a big deal.So much hype back in the day...Back when it was released in 1996-ish, I thought Independence Day was a fairly satisfying movie. It didn't have the most original plot in the world (aliens attempt to conquer Earth and it's up to the humans to repel them - where have we NOT seen that one before?), but it was still a thrill to see the special effects, thrilling aerial battles, and whatnot. Some ten odd years later, the movie has lost much of its luster, but not so much its fun element.Those ""exciting"" special effects? They still serve a purpose and they're still okay, but nothing special. The plot is somewhat thin and the slow scenes are fairly slow enough to get you out of the mood. Even the tense moments seem predictable and it's not due to repeated viewings. Despite all this, it's still a fairly decent popcorn flick worth killing a night if you have nothing better to watch. It's not a sophisticated movie, it's not a masterpiece, it's just a fun little action flick with aliens and lots of explosions.Independence Day is worth a look if you're looking for a quick fix of action movies, but anyone looking for high art should look elsewhere. Good messy fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Slightly too over the top. Will Smith should've used his right hand to save the world.,"I get what the point of this movie is and I think that there are some good and cool moments for sure. I like Jeff Goldblum a lot and even Will Smith. The guy who played the president did a fine job and the special effects are also done pretty well! It was also good how it eventually turned into a real happy and triumphant story, it's just just a very cliche premise that lacks creativity and wasn't executed in the best way that it could be with all of the 90s cheesiness.

Happy 25th anniversary to Independence Day. Still a fun movie.,"Happy 25th anniversary to the science fiction action blockbuster Independence Day which was released on this day in 1996.Independence Day was great fun when I first saw it and it's still great fun now. Independence Day would be the biggest box office hit of 1996 with its spectacular action and incredible visual effects. Director Ronald Emmerich (Universal Soldier, Stargate) will always be remembered for this classic movie headlined by Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman.Spaceships arrive from outer space commanded by extraterrestrial aliens and incinerate New York, Los Angeles and Washington D. C. with a single laser beam causing a massive explosion leaving behind mass casualties and a path of destruction.Amongst the survivors, satellite technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) tries to warn everyone of the impending spaceship attack however when that fails, he works on a way to penetrate the force fields protecting the spacecraft. U. S. President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) is left to deal with the massive destruction and threat to wipeout mankind as well as finding a way to defeat the hostile extraterrestrials. President Whitmore rallies the military to fight back against the alien invasion. Fighter pilot Captain Steve Hillard (Will Smith) leads a failed attack against the large saucer and manages to successfully escape after the rest of his squadron is wiped out. Though the weaponry on his fighter jet is ineffective, he does successfully cause a enemy fighter to crash land and thus secure one of the aliens to take to Area 51 for further research.Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman are entertaining in their own respective roles as the heroic fighter pilot, the nerdy technician, and the U. S. President. Director Ronald Emmerich turns the action and visual effects up full throttle and the bigger the better. You can either like the plot or you can hate it, but there's no denying that the movie is pure entertainment.I was disappointed that I missed out on watching Independence Day at the cinema, however I was very lucky to reserve a copy at my local video store the weekend the movie was released on VHS. I used to like this movie a lot in my early teens and it was my favourite movie for a while, though not so much now. Though I haven't seen the movie in several years, it's still a fun movie. Independence Day is vintage blockbusting entertainment 25 years on.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If there's intelligent life out there, please save us from movies like this","A friend of mine said that Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich weren't trying to make a demographic movie, but were honestly trying to make the type of movie that would entertain them, a la Spielberg.  That may be true (in fact, I'm inclined to believe it is), but you also need talent, and they fall short there.  The first half hour of the movie has problems which re-occur throughout(like Randy Quaid; never is he more annoying or condescending than when he's playing crazy types), but grabs us at least, and I can't deny the visceral effectiveness of watching the White House being blown up.  But then the story becomes cliche city.  The only actors who survive are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, because they at least are entertaining.  Some do solid work (Harry Connick Jr., Robert Loggia), some are wasted (Mary McDonnell, Bill Pullman), and some are awful (Quaid, James Rebhorn), and the movie is similarly patchwork.  This movie does not represent the end of civilization as we know it, but it's a sad state of affairs when this is the norm and not the exception.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
In the name of the Mankind,"One of the most criticized movies that I remember, and for a large sector that far from seeing its true pretensions, which are none other than those of a pure and carefree entertainment judge for their patriotic messages. They can not argue otherwise than the worn and boring speech ""Americanized"", the same ones who do not mind that concept when they come out of films like ""Save Private Ryan"", ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and many others that according to the director the same message seems to be forgotten, when dealing with more serious issues should be more objective.
In any case Roland Emmerich, he goes through the lining (fortunately) the opinion of critics and is limited to perform the kind of show that he would like to see in a movie theater. For ""Independence Day"", he does not hesitate to take references such as ""The War of the Worlds"" or ""Star Wars"" as well as the cinema of catastrophes of the 70's, recycling what was the day of its premiere a spectacular production with extraordinary visual effects, which combine exemplary models and digitalisations with a result of reference. The story is not new, but if it is, the dialogues are not Shakespeare's, but who cares? when it comes to spending two hours of pure action in which there is hardly room for absurd ramblings. It is therefore an easy target for those who believe themselves to be scholars and try to make those who enjoy this type of products complacent, who at least have a clear objective, to collect and entertain. I certainly had a great time and fully enjoyed this excellent science fiction film, to ""Hamlet"" we will leave for another day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Tremendous visual show, without any logic.","Classic Blockbuster from the 90s, which brought many of us closer to the cinema in our childhood.Like a good summer movie, it's a tremendous visual spectacle, which sacrifices factors such as drama, good dialogue and even logic and the laws of physics to deliver a synchronized dance of spaceships, military planes, explosions and many phrases that raise the status of cool to each of the characters to the detriment of their well-grounded sanity.But believe me when I say that while all of the above sounds like a complaint, it's actually praise for a director who's adept at cataclysmic disaster movies. This time, the budget reached even his most desired filmmaker's wet dreams. Scale models exploding, alien creatures being dissected in laboratories, giant sets that simulate devastated cities and a cast that in those years could have been the envy of many other film directors.The shortcomings are well known and recognized by all. Needless to mention that the effects didn't age well, because it's absolutely evident, among other things.

It is also against discrimination. And the most important thing is that nobody noticed it. So it went under your skin and stayed there without prejudice. Also, all the nations of the world agree to help Earth against a common enemy. It stays that on Earth we are one race, the Human Race.

"3 Good Things, 1 Bad Thing about...  Independence Day","ONE GOOD THING: The sheer ""popcorn movie"" spectacle of Roland Emmerich's Independence Day makes it highly watchable. The film is one of the first of its era that embraces modern special effects to ""remake"" old movies, which couldn't be made better at the time. Although similar (or derivative) of it's predecessors, it fills the screen with an ensemble cast and delivers disaster scenes you couldn't walk away from if you tried (dog out-running an explosion excluded).ANOTHER GOOD THING: The sheer panic/confusion/indifference felt by the different characters is an interesting bit of character study. Some people welcome the aliens with open arms, while others pack the freeways to escape major cities, and still others are sitting at strip clubs regardless of what's going on.EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: The famous destruction scenes of the national and international monuments culminating in the explosion of the White House are quite possibly the finest of their kind.ONE BAD THING: The wooden performances elicited by Emmerich (10,000 BC) are all quickly overshadowed by the inclusion of the Randy Quaid character. Why in the world is ""Uncle Eddie"" (National Lampoon's Vacation films) in this movie fighting aliens? He is heavy handed in his delivery and should of had his character cut out during initial re-writes. Without Quaid (and Harvey Fierstein's over-the-top comic relief supplied for the Jeff Goldblum character) this movie immediately improves its rating by 2 stars.OVERALL GRADE: C+OTHER MOVIES WITH SPECTACULAR DESTRUCTION SEQUENCES: The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Twister (1996), Poseidon (2006), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), The Towering Inferno (1974), Cloverfield (2008).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

good ol' American fun,"I don't care what anybody says, this is the best, big-screen sci-fi epic to hit us since we saw the last of the Star Wars episodes. Yeah, it's schlock and predictable, but it's also unabashed fun and great eye candy. Subtextual lines can be set to the future in anticipation of the holocaust disaster films heralding in the new decade, and backwards to America's hypocritical prejudice towards its takeover by aliens of another breed (read illegal, here). Wrap it all up in the flag-waving mythos of ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" and Hans Solo rebel forces of ""Star Wars"", and you've plucked about every heartstring out there. The cast of characters is equally diametric and dysfunctional, ranging from an alien-abducted drunk to a woody-making stripper, and passing through a scientist that's the incarnation of Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Leary. There's no love lost on the young here like ""Titanic"" or ""Deep Impact"", but the film has plenty of mature sap between its token black couple, its divorced-estranged, career-vs-heart pair, and even a tear-jerk cameo from the President and his dying wife, appropriately played out in the hugging encounters from their young daughter. Typical set pieces like the nagging, Jewish father, the steady, steel-jawed General, the endearing but doomed wingman, and the conniving, weasely ex-CIA director act as anchors for the other, more fleshed-out stereotypes to breathe. Admittedly, Goldblum resurrects is too-many-brain-cells-make-you-depressed doctor from ""Jussasic Park"", but he's soooo smoooooth at it. Pullman's dedicated-but-troubled President is steady if boring, but he's effectively played off Smith's vivacious, life-loving pilot who gets to split all the good lines with Quaid's more besotted flyboy interpretation. After all the pyrotechnics and special effects have fizzled down, the film's still standing from the weight of its characterizations. And that, as the President patriotizes in his Fourth of July speech, is all that ultimately matters.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Fun, but supremely annoying if you're not American","If it wasn't for Will Smith, this film would be one of the most lavishly constructed jingoistic pieces of trash to have hit the screens.  Will's on top form in this one, particularly in his early dogfight sequence (one imagines that he was getting in some early practice for Ali...).The film is obviously aimed primarily at the American market, but if this is how Americans want to see themselves, then the rest of the world has a lot to worry about.  It's spectacularly self-centred at times (e.g. 15 spaceships over the world, at least 4 of which are over American cities!). The few foreign characters are reduced to cartoon caricatures of their nationalities (e.g. the two British pilots (shown in short 'cut-to' sequences) speak with the sort of public school accents that show up in American sitcoms all the time, such as the butler in 'Fresh Prince', & make most British people I know cringe).  At times it appears that the producers picked out nationalities that they assume are top-of-mind (Iraq, Israel, Japan, Russia & Britain feature most prominently) for the American audience (or at least fairly low-brow elements of it) and then sterotyped them.I can accept that, in an American film, it's the Americans that save the world. But the impression you get from the film is that no-one else even TRIES to fight back.  Yes, the other countries do join in the fight, but NO-ONE else shows any initiative.  Would it have been disruptive to show the President consulting with the UN, or to show a Chinese or French plane being destroyed while trying to attack the space ship?Still, it seems silly to complain about national stereotypes in a film that's chock-full of all sorts of stereotypes.  I kept expecting Jeff Goldblum to start talking about chaos theory, and Judd Hirsch even manages to get in an 'Oy Vey'!  None of the writers or actors seem to have had to stretch too far, but Smith & Goldblum make an effective enough team.That said, I still quite enjoyed the film.

Great popcorn movie,"As many I was a big Will Smith fan in the 90s for Fresh Prince of Bell Air. Loved his movies like Bad Boys, but for some reason I've always dodged Independence Day.

Humanity under threat of a powerful, seeming invincible power trying to take over, and with its never-ending optimism they show the strength of humanity.Independence Day has a very popcorn movie feel to it. It must have been a blast watch this in the theater in 1996. If it were to be rereleased it would still look great on the big screen.

This is quite amazing considering that the first half of the movie is almost decent. A little cheesy but very impressive. Despite the total 'V' ripoff.The second half hits rock-bottom again and again and again... I thought Will Smith was going to be the worst element of the movie. I was wrong. He was actually quite fun to watch. The rest is a disgrace, most probably due to the script.Many people think that this movie waves too much with the american flag. I think not. The americans in the movie act like they've never come near the word intelligence.""Yeah, we have this really really really really awesome huge big spaceship. How to shoot it down? Sidewinders? Of course! That's it!""If America had acted like that in '91 we'd be bowing to Saddam right now.Ok, the FX was very impressive but it takes more than a hot chick to sell a motorcycle right?

I picked a helluva day to quit drinkin'.,"I go back and visit this film occasionally as it has all the qualifications for real entertainment.Roland Emmerich, who did Stargate and Godzilla, knows how to put together a film that incorporates great sound, and special effects, with some pretty good acting to boot.Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Judd Hirsch all performed well and kept us interested. They were ably supported by some stars as Randy Quaid, Mary McDonnell and Robert Loggia. In addition, there were some fine beauties sprinkled through the film: Vivica A. Fox as an exotic dancer in her thong; Kiersten Warren and KImberly Beck both appeared in small parts, but their beauty did not go unnoticed.So, overlook the obvious plot holes that come with this kind of movie, pop some corn and just enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very enjoyable movie.,"Many people didn´t like this movie because of some bulls***s in the movie, like the virus that was compatible with the alien´s system. It was really strange, but maybe the aliens use Windows and they didn´t updated with the new Microsoft´s patch, hehe. But in a movie bulls***s like that happens all the time, when I see a movie I try don´t be so realistic, I just sit in front of the TV and enjoy. The action is very good, the suspense too.

Another 90s All-Timer!!,"Full disclosure, I was roughly 6 or 7 years old when I saw this for the first time. It is favorite in the household where i grew up and a yearly watch in my own family's home today. With the nostalgic element excluded from this review, this film is suspenseful, thrilling, action-packed, and emotionally compelling with a sprinkle of good comedic humor to keep it from getting too dark.

A Knockout!,Earth is invaded by aliens.1996 was the year of the alien invasion movies: Mars Attacks! and Independence Day.

We have only ourselves to blame,"I paid to see this in a cinema, too.  In my own small way I  contributed to its financial success.  Forgive me.  Forgive all of us.  This is the kind of movie we, the audience, have created.  Certainly I can't detect any creativity on the part of the writers.Parts are symptomatic of the whole: so I will practise restraint and mention just ONE glaring stupidity.  Just one.  Longer (but incomplete) lists of idiocies may be found elsewhere - the last time I looked there was a decent list on the IMDb itself.  Okay, here it is:The aliens take over our satellites and no-one knows why.  With the same creative reasoning he displayed in ""Jurassic Park"" when he deduced a revolt of the dinosaurs from the movement of a water droplet, Jeff Goldblum works out that the aliens are using our satellites to communicate with each other so that they will be able to co-ordinate their attack.  ""That's IT!"" everyone shouts.  One wonders how the Allies managed in the Second World War.  Did they use German satellites - or did they simply synchronise their watches?  Here's a hot piece of technology we can sell to the aliens: the WATCH!  It's a little device that enables one to TELL THE TIME!  Everyone can have ONE EACH and then EVERYONE will know what time it is!My point is not that this is a stupid weakness in the plot.  I mean, it is, but that's not my point.  My point is that we REALISE just how stupid this is, almost before the words have left Goldblum's lips.  We aren't given a chance to be charitable about it.  A hundred weaknesses will make themselves apparent while you watch, however low you set the relevant dials in your brain (some people can go as low as ""dribbling moron"", but most of us can't).  The movie just stumbles from stupidity to stupidity via bridge passages of stupidity.  There's a bit of purported excitement here and there to distract us from all the stupidity but it's so perfunctorily done that it just doesn't work.  Aliens taking over the Earth: it's a grand theme, but there's little grandeur in the treatment.  There is, however, an awful lot of stupidity.To make matters worse there's some offensive nationalism.  The aliens are threatening the ENTIRE EARTH - patriotism under the circumstances is a good thing, but it's the Earth (or humanity) as a whole that the tub-thumping ought to serve; not the USA in particular.

Independence Day,"Contrary to what the person above said I believe that Independence Day is a movie you can watch time and time again without becoming bored.

It's great to watch for the first time, and the second viewing often has the same effect.

Graphics put to good use,"The movie has everything that has ""U.S.A."" written all over it. The graphics in the movie are put to good use, because the UFO's in the movie look awesome.

Except perhaps for the onetime laugh scene, where Will Smith welcomes an alien to earth.The opening scene of the movie really does the job, and prepares you for a good movie experience.I won't reveal my favorite part of the movie, which actually doesn't last very long, but it's incredibly romantic. So I guess this is a movie that holds a special place in everyone, or it doesn't hold much interest at all. But after ID4, everything that has computer graphics in it has taken a bit off. Take the new Star Wars movie for instance. So, in comparison, ID4 will always be the movie that killed off computer graphic movies, and will always be a classic in my heart.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Gloriously Cheesy Movie,"Twenty years. That's how long it took me to finally watch this movie. I have no idea why I never went to see it when it was first in theaters in 1996--I think maybe my best friend from high school saw it and didn't like it, who knows. All I know is that it wasn't until the sequel, ""Resurgence"" hit theaters that I decided to sit down and actually watch this movie.Now that I have, what did I think? I found this film to be a glorious cheese fest of a movie. It's perhaps the cheesiest movie I've ever seen. That's of course easily done when you've got Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Harry Connick, Jr. all in flight suits playing virtual Galaga for two hours. But in all seriousness, the movie is just downright cheesy, from the plot to the characters to the lines, cheese galore.That having been said, the movie is nevertheless watchable and fun in its own right. There's an element of it that feels almost like it was made for little kids or teenagers--it certainly has the feel of a 90's era video game. But whatever the audience it might have been intended for, it does make for a fun film overall--which is why I've given it 6/10 stars. I wasn't greatly impressed by this movie, but it's just good enough to be considered a ""good movie"", in spite of itself. Worth seeing, perhaps, even after a couple of decades.

American arrogance in a most hilarious comedy.,One of the funniest movies that have been made into blockbusters.We are supposed to believe so many stupid things I don't think anybody can stop himself laughing outloud.To name but a few:1)A major saucer is targeting every world capital and New York.That would be 194 saucers!(2 of them over Rome to take down Rome and the Vatican!).2)The guys that find a way to destroy the alien main computer are American amatures.C'mon give the Japanese a computer and some time and they can do anything.Remember who influence technology today on a global base.3)The pilots who fight the aliens at the end are mostly civilians.How could they have stayed alive when the best military pilots in the world(such as the Israelians)are deceased?4)The only British armies left are in Iraq?How could this ever be possible?5)The presidents speech.Some say every non-American should feel nausea hearing this.I can name at least two nationalities that should feel much more:a)The British.On 4th of July their ex-colony celebrates it's independance  from Britain.How could any British think he should celebrate that day?b)The French.If it weren't for the French and Lafayette they wouldn't be any Indepedence to celebrate in the first place.Funny their only mention in the film presents them as losers.No gratitude at all.How could any French feel good about it?So the president's speech at this point should infuriate the British and the French and sicken all the others.Bah!They go and fight like good Americans.Can anybody take this movie seriously?,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good enough,"It's been a long time now since Independence Day was released, and indeed a long time since I first saw it, and I have since seen it at least three more times. Each time I watch it I can't help but enjoy it but, increasingly so, also can't help but laugh at the triteness of it all. While it is essentially a fantasy story about fighting for your life and winning, it is all SO cute, and SO perfect, and SO convenient that you can never take it seriously.Obviously, it doesn't ask to be taken seriously but there are certain parts that really make you cringe. Firstly, I have to say that, as an Australian, I find it a little ludicrous the central American-ism of it all. Naturally I would assume that, if aliens were to invade Earth, our survival would most likely rely on the US, but I don't feel that the movie deals with the rest of the world in a large-enough scale. It does mention Australia, and England, and the Iraqi desert at times, but only briefly, and completely inconsequentially, and I always think that if they wanted to include them at all, they could have delved slightly more deeply into international cooperation and communication, or otherwise just omit it entirely and just leave it to implication that the entire planet is under threat. As it occurs, the references and brief scenes just come off as tokenism and it's frankly quite annoying.But apart from that little irk that gets me every time, the film is entertaining escapism. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Randy Quaid make enjoyably unlikely heroes, while Bill Pullman pulled off, to me at least, a surprisingly good performance as the President. And it is enjoyable and it is triumphant and it does leave you with a good feeling, so at the end of the day, what else really matters?I just thought I'd put my thoughts to the keyboard.

Will Smith is in his classic character here, full of his usual pep and one liners. The others put in good efforts as well, I particularly like Goldblum's role as the cable repairman.

Misunderstood comedy,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out.

The people are caricatures. The acting is over-the-top. The plot is full of giant holes and even bigger clichés. And yet, somehow, the people on the screen seem to be taking it all seriously. It's hilarious. The only thing that could possibly make it better would be the MST3K crew... but they'd almost be redundant.In short: It's so laughably bad, it's actually good.To make it even better, the action sequences and visual effects (particularly by the standards of the time) are pretty good.If you're looking for a serious Sci-Fi disaster movie, don't bother.If you're looking for an overtly funny parody of a Sci-Fi action movie starring Will Smith...

( 4 + 10 ) / 2 = 7,"Now (7/6/03) I have realized that there are two scales by which to judge a movie. They are: 1) did it entertain?, and 2) is it a good story?

This may turn out to be a good way to judge a movie. Afterall 7/10 is not a bad score.

"Review Of ""Independence Day""","""Independence Day"" is a 1996 Roland Emmerich film starring Will Smith and Bill Pullman. Now, let me preface this review by saying that I'm not really a fan of Roland Emmerich movies. I usually find them to be heavy on special effects, rather flimsy on worthwhile narrative substance, and shoddy in terms of character development. Now before I go on, I know what you're thinking - ""Well what the heck do I care about those last two things, all I need is explosions."" That's fine I guess. It's just that I'd rather have a well crafted story featuring explosions that endanger characters I actually give a crap about than the aforementioned. Now with that said, is ""Independence Day"" the former or the latter? It's a little bit of both. This movie is not total bad but it does have it's moments. Thankfully the good moments outweigh the bad ones. Yes, the character development is rather nonexistent. This is mainly because of the fact that there are way too many characters in this film altogether, so even the slightest hint of any sort of character arc is almost impossible/undetectable. The plot is rather stale, and there are a handful of plot holes and inconsistencies throughout, but there isn't really any dynamic of this plot that is so flagrantly bad one can't sit through it without feeling entertained. I had mixed feelings about some of the lines in this film. Some of them were pumped with so much 90's action cheese It made me want to gauge my eyes out with a pinecone, but there were others that made me laugh/smile some. As most Roland Emmerich films go, the special effects end up looking unbelievable and it's no different for ""Independence Day"". The fact that this film came out in 1996 is still a shocker to me. The acting is great in some places, while lacking in others. Bill Pullman had one of the best performances in the film, as did Jeff Goldblum. Overall, It's apparent that ""Independence Day"" is one of Roland Emmerich's best films, if not his best, and it is indeed very entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
THIS Is How Summer Blockbusters Should Be Made!,"When making a movie of the ""summer blockbuster"" type, there a number of elements that must be present, such as action, adventure, a bit of humor, some sort of seemingly unstoppable enemy, & (if the film studio really cares) some interesting characters to latch onto. The coup de grace comes if the film is able to anchor itself around a significant moment/date either past, present, or future. ""Independence Day"" scores high marks on all those elements.For a basic plot summary, the film sees planet Earth suddenly attacked by aliens bent on taking over the world. With the future of the nation on the line, President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) recruits military man Steven Hiller (Will Smith) & scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) to hatch a plan to defeat the sinister invaders on the weekend of the Fourth of July.To put it as plainly as possible, ""Independence Day"" is primarily a rousing success because of the gravitas the ""Fourth of July"" theme lends it. Without that holiday serving as the backdrop of the alien invasion, it just wouldn't be as epic and would likely fail to get viewers as invested. For example, a speech given by Pullman's character towards the end of the film will bring the hair on the back of your neck to attention due to it being given on our nation's birthday.To be fair, however, this film is well-constructed enough to stand on its own merits. Primarily, this happens because of the all-star cast and their character development on screen. Besides the three primary leads (of which Smith almost steals the show at some points), other accomplished actors like Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin, & Vivica A. Fox round out the supporting roles. They all interact very well with each other and give the viewers some people to root for (a necessity in any quality invasion film).Overall, ""Independence Day"" is easily a flick that can be enjoyed every July 4th (at the very least). It's one of those movies where you pop the popcorn, turn out the lights, and just get swept away in the scope of the action playing out on the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Welcome to Earth,"1996 was a vastly different time for big time blockbusters. Independence Day is easily one of the most famous end-of-the-world blockbusters, but sadly, 20 years later, it doesn't necessarily hold up. With painfully cheesy one-liners and one-too many characters to follow, it's a less than stellar take on the alien invasion genre.One thing that does stand out is the ensemble cast. Perhaps besides Harvey Fierstein, I really enjoyed the entire cast. With a powerhouse like Will Smith bringing the charisma and most of the film's comedy, all you need is some solid supporting cast members to carry the rest of the weight, although let's face it, Jeff Goldblum plays the exact same character he does in Jurassic Park. Having said that, there are far too many characters that feel entirely unnecessary and end up bloating the film to an hour and a half. Cut half of the supporting roles and 30min of screen time and you have a much more re-watchable film.I can't entirely blame the film for having dated special effects, especially since it won an Oscar for them. However, I can blame the film for having a script and direction that doesn't seem to care enough to develop the characters and story into a respectable blockbuster territory. Perhaps it's because we are so inundated with mega-films that do all of these things so well that I got a little upset watching Independence Day. How many times can Roland Emmerich zoom the camera in on someone giving a shocked face at the alien's ship? It happens at least 20 times within the first hour.This film definitely has its copycats, as Emmerich recently pointed out in an interview. But he took a lot from the previous sci-fi epics that came before him. Everything from the music, end credits (visually), to the space battles felt like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek film. With that said, none of those films have as good of a speech as Bill Pullman does as he rallied the pilots before the final takedown. That's right about when I began to accept the film for what it is and forgive some of the horrifically cheesy moments.Although the film is over 140 minutes long, we never really get a sense as to the alien's motivations or backstory as to their appearance on earth, which was disappointing for sure. Why did we need to follow the kids of one of the pilots, who barely had a role, and not get a little bit more insight from the aliens point of view? These are just a few of the issues I had with the film, but really, it's mindless fun that doesn't really need to be dissected to such an extent. Overall, it's half way decent and likely better than it has any right to be.+Will Smith's ridiculous one-liners+Pullman's speech+Mindless fun-Enough with the close-ups-Too many side characters-And they are focused on way too much6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Worst pile of crap ever!,"Sorry, but this film sucks! It is one of the worst examples of American propaganda films. ""We all stand together"" is this film where both the US President and an alcoholic farmer join in the fight against the enemy from space. Not one good thing to say about this film! The acting in this film in really bad. Especially Randy Quaid's ""performance"" annoys me. Of course you would pick an alcoholic farmer to fly an F16 or whatever to fight the aliens. And can you really picture an American President himself jumping into a plane and flying off? No, he would be hidden away at Camp David or somewhere else, curled up into a corner. I know (or at least I hope) that this was not an attempt to make a movie that would win all (or any) categories at the Academy Awards, but still you have to look very hard to be able to find worse acting than featured in this movie. As for the special effects, they did look good when I first saw the movie, but they do not make up for the bad story line and bad acting. If only they hadn't spent all of their money on the effects and only 2 dollars for a story writer. This really is in my top 5 of worst movies ever!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I actually thought the computer virus was credible - almost thoughtful!,"Ok, most of what you've heard is true. It's a B-grade science fantasy with pretty (but not clever) special effects - your basic eye candy.The jingoism is grating to non-US (and many US) audiences (gee, thanks America for letting us share the 4th of July; now we won't have to worry about our own national holidays!!).Apart from that, though, disengage your brain and enjoy a bit of amusing nonsense.I was a little peeved at all the people who complained of the aliens' low resistance to humanity's counter-attacks. I actually thought that part was well thought out and plausible!! The idea goes like this: the aliens have a hive-mind (obvious to sci-fi fans who've seen it all before), and so have absolutely no concept of delinquency. They're aggressive, all right, but not the least bit sneaky.Consequently, their command messages are sent in a code so weak it is broken by inspection; an 'interrogated' alien spills the whole plan just for the asking; their fighters and even space ship defences are foxed by simple tricks; they haven't changed IFF codes in 40 years; and their computer operating systems have absolutely no security.This of course begs for a sequel where the delinquent, dirty-dealing two-fisted back-stabbing humans use the crashed ships to launch a counter-attack .",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining,"I enjoyed this movie, however, I felt it was nothing more than a modernized remake of ""The War of the Worlds"" from 1953 starring Gene Barry. Many of the plot themes in both movies are similar, if not the same. There is the issue of atomic weapons which is the same in both movies. The results were identical. The issue of the common cold in the 1953 movie has been replaced with a computer virus in Independence Day. I hope the 2005 version of ""War of the Worlds"" backs me up and that people who never saw the 1953 movie won't think that the new ""War of the Worlds"" is a remake of Independence Day, which, of course, it isn't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The movie that made Will Smith a star and began a resurgence in alien invasion movies...,"When it comes to sci-fi alien invasion stories, older generations think of HG Wells' War of the Worlds, which spawned a classic radio broadcast and two movie versions, both of which were successful. Then came Invasion of the Flying Saucers, and then Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Star Wars would soon put the genre to rest. In the mid 90s, the directors of the surprise hit Stargate came up with an idea to make a big budget alien invasion movie set on our favorite holiday in this country...Independence Day. The movie would soon break records and gross around $800 million worldwide and sell even more on VHS, laserdisc, and then DVD and bluray and digital HD and pay TV, and the rest is history. Watching it today vs 21 years ago is kinda outdated but this movie is much better than the box office failure that was Resurgence and the movie that Centropolis made two years after ID4, a rehash of Godzilla that wasn't as good as the original one or even the 2014 reboot.

"It's a classic, no questions asked.","Roland Emmerich (who i just found out a couple days ago is openly gay) is my favorite director.

In fact, i don't even NEED to summarize the plot. It's your average E.T invasion film, but feels like the biggest one of them all (for the 90s at least).

Today we celebrate our Independence Day!,"Nobody is ever going to confuse Independence Day with any kind of work of great cinema. It's fun though. Sure, it's cheesy and corny. Often absurd and ludicrous too. But fun. As big, huge, visual effects summer blockbusters go you could do a lot worse. The aliens have come and they're gonna blow things up real good. And for this movie that's enough. Yes, the dialogue is mostly inane and terrible. Yes, there are some characters who disappoint, adding nothing of any substance to the proceedings. Yes, the movie goes on too long. For any movie of this type two hours will more than suffice. Independence Day careens well past that two-hour mark with a misguided attempt to inject some actual plot lines, some drama and real human emotion, into the movie. Plot? Drama? Emotion? Who needs any of that? Aliens invade. Humans fight back. The end.It's easy to bemoan what Independence Day isn't. But you can certainly embrace it for what it is. If you're willing to buy in, and ignore the fact that so much of the movie makes no sense at all, Independence Day can be a rollicking good time. Will Smith is perfect for this sort of thing, Jeff Goldblum falls perfectly into his world-saving scientist role, Randy Quaid makes for an entertaining kook and Judd Hirsch provides some laughs. Some of the other performers admittedly don't fare as well. Harvey Fierstein is an over-the-top annoyance, Brent Spiner makes his bizarre scientist much, much too bizarre to take at all seriously and the key female characters, played by Margaret Colin and Vivica A. Fox are pretty much worthless, total bores. And then there's the President, played by Bill Pullman. Confronted with a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, not to mention personal loss, the guy seems utterly devoid of feeling. My country's three biggest cities were just destroyed? Eh, whatever. An inspiring figure this guy is not. Until all of a sudden he is as, before humanity's final assault, he gives one of the most awesome movie speeches ever. OK, the speech is totally cheesy and corny. But awesome. Of course that final assault is based around a plan which is incomprehensibly absurd, defying all logic and reason. Logic and reason have no place in this type of movie. If you accept that than this movie is easy to enjoy. It's the end of the world as we know it. And I feel fine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

And even if the dialogue isn't the best, it's still interesting. Many of the lines are memorable and fun to listen to as a fan. I'd even heard of some of them used in other TV shows and video games.

Ed Wood would be proud,"It is still amazing to me that this film was the top grossing movie of 1996, followed by ""Twister"", which in many ways was equally cheesy. I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you can suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a crop duster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. Never would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident back in 2003...oops...my bad.The reason I am even giving this film 4/10 is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show. Plus, the ""buddy"" thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well. I'm just glad that Will Smith got to showcase what he is really capable of the following year when he starred in a quality film about alien life on earth, ""Men in Black"".",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ridiculous,"Independence Day has little to no redeemable qualities about it. The acting, directing, editing, and writing are all absolute crap. Moreover, this movie is one hundred and forty five minutes long. I have nothing against long movies; most of my favorites run over two hours long, but when a piece of crap like this, a film that relies completely on special effects, thinks it has enough of a story to last that long? PLEASE! The only reason I'm giving this more than one star is the special effects. They probably pleased some simpleton minds who went to see yet another 'AMERICA SAVES THE WORLD' movie. Don't even get me started on Emmerich, a man responsible for crap like the American remake of ""Godzilla"", the even worse ""Universal Soldier"", and the ridiculously bad ""Moon 44"". Sure, the guy made a decent film in ""Stargate"", but nothing else I've seen from him is worth anything at all. Moreover, I can't even laugh at his crap, unlike stuff by directors like Uwe Boll. Well, he makes money for the studios, I guess.The script remains the worst part however. It's like ""Armageddon"" only even more overly sentimental and even worse acted, and even more cliché-packed if that's possible. So many people go after Michael Bay, but Emmerich should be the target. At least Bay made one good movie (The Rock), Emmerich is just rubbish all the damn time.Ugh, do yourself a favor, and do not watch this movie. 2/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

spectacular,"It certainly doesn't possess the witty repartee of a Woody Allen, or does raise big philosophical questions like a Stanley Kubrick and doesn't even possess the technique or score genies of a Sergio Leone, but what Independence Day lacks in those areas, it more than makes up for it in; special effects wizardry, slick, epic fast paced action sequences and fun, humours performances, that once assembled, combine to make Independence Day a film that is a eye catching, heart pounding, awe inspiring Saturday night extravaganza that will never fail to entertain.Almost from the start it's clear to see that Roland Emmerich burrows extensively from all godfathers of Alien encounter films that came before; from the way the Alien space craft arrives in the sky surrounded in a plume of stormy clouds like scenes from the remake of War of the Worlds, the very look of the Aliens themselves clearly draw comparisons with Ridley Scots 'Alien', then you have the possible extinction of the human race to deal with, similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still. Some may say this is a signal of lack of imagination and originality on writer Dean Devlin part, but the way I look at it, imitation is the sincerity form of flattery, and I see Independence Day as more of a allusion or a homage of the highest respects to those past greats, rather than a mere cheap carbon copy (Well costing at 75million and grossing over 800 million, more like a very expensive and successful carbon copy).Being a typical big budget Hollywood film the premise is as simple as ever, a massive fleet of alien space ships arrive on earth after travelling billions of light years, but there isn't a ET amongst them, these guys mean business! And they didn't come to earth for friendly game of stuck in the mud or a casual stroll in the park whilst sightseeing; instead they are came here to destroy it and everyone on it. But once again, with this being an American Hollywood feature, the only guys equipped to save the world is the president (Bill Pullman), a computer genius (Jeff Goldblum) and a highly skilled jet pilot (Will Smith). Queue the waving of the flag, handing out of American pie and an Elvis Presley greatest hits album. But there nothing wrong with a little bit of patriotism, but Bill Pullman gives the customary great American speech about unity and courage, and the rebranding of an American holiday into a global holiday, Independence Day does take patriotism to a palpable extreme, often venturing into the irritating and ridiculous as it makes every other country seem incapable of coping without out their help. But I digress, after the US army seems incapable of penetrating through the Aliens shield, with all their bullets and bombs, Jeff Goldblum being the computer genies that he is has the genius idea of simply disarming the shields – wow give the Einstein an Nobel Prize right? Well one problem, to administer the computer virus that will infect the mother ship that will in turn disarm all the other ship's shields for around two minutes, they have to get up close and personal to do so – queue loud mouth, charismatic Will smith.To say that Independence Day was high concept film would be a massive understatement; it would be the same as saying Beetles were just a rock band. But I feel films that get labelled as high concept always get such a bad rep. What's wrong with appealing to all four quadrants of the film market, isn't watching films supposed to be an inclusive, communal experience. A film can bring together different; races, religions, genders and ages, surely that something that should be celebrated and encompasses everything that makes cinema so magical. And watching Independence Day was truly a magical experience; you just have to look at the performances, well the performance of Will Smith, who stands heads and shoulder above everyone else, in a film that made him an eventual global superstar. Like I said, he was loud and charismatic, making his character so enticing and exciting to watch. I simply love the scene when the Alien crash lands and tries to get out of its ship, only to be punched in the face by Will Smith, ""Well come to earth"" which would probably go down as one of my all time favourite move scenes and quotes ever. His performance was almost as big and spectacular as the special effects even though they are from 1996, I feel they easily outdo some modern day big budget films such as the embarrassingly bad Olympus has Fallen. Independence Day is a truly enjoyable fantastic film that rightly deserved all its finical success; defiantly looking forward to seeing it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Seeing the final celebration scenes, I wonder if 300 years from now American movies will still portray other nationalities in their basest stereotypes.

I remember the first time I saw it in a theater in '96, and I fully admit that my friends and I had a blast.  The action was great, the characters were likable, and even the humor was cute.Plus, ID was one of the first to really effectively use the theme of massive disaster.  The audience was glued to the screen watching New York and Washington get devastated, overwhelmed by the destruction and loss of life.

"Independence Day is big, it is loud and it is long.","INDEPENDENCE DAY is also instantly forgettable, yet another disposable summer movie with little staying power. It gets off to a relatively engaging start, and the alien destruction of various US landmarks is fun to see. Too bad the rest is merely mechanical without the necessary human interest to keep us involved. Hostile aliens traveling in city-sized spaceships have entered our atmosphere and have made rubble of New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Houston, etc. If they keep this up, Clovis will be the largest American city left standing. Scientists must figure out a way to penetrate the spaceships' invisible shields before the entire planet is leveled and civilization destroyed. Not much has changed since the 1950s when planet Earth had to battle unfriendly visitors in INVADERS FROM MARS and WAR OF THE WORLDS. The special effects are, for the most part, more impressive, though some still look a tad cheesy. Jeff Goldblum seems stuck in his JURASSIC PARK mode, but generates a few laughs as a jittery scientist. Judd Hirsch, who is terribly miscast, is most annoying as Jeff's fretting father. Likable Bill Pullman is very sketchy as the US president, and Will Smith (at the time this movie is made) is far too lightweight to register as a he-man action hero.

"Great special effects, but little else to offer","When I first heard of this movie, I was fairly interested. It does have a great cast and it looked good. But I was disappointed. Granted, I do not think it is Roland Emmerich's worst film, but it is far from his best either(that's The Day after Tomorrow and even that was pretty uneven). The film does look great though, the special effects are very good and the scenery and cinematography are also excellent. David Arnold's score is also serviceable, with some interesting song choices, and the ending is quite explosive. However, the dialogue on the most part is very cheesy and forced, the story is shallow and incomprehensible and the direction is murky. Also the film is much too long, and it doesn't help that the pace is uneven. The acting, despite this great cast, is not good, they all try hard but they can't do anything with the dialogue and with Emmerich fighting them every step of the way it is no wonder. I am not a huge fan of Will Smith but he has done some stuff I like, however he overdoes it here and his character for some reason annoys me. Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum are great actors, but their characters are shallow and Goldblum especially should have had more to do.

Where's the Frank Ifield Records when you need them?,"I remember being blown away by this film when it was released. I had to have it on video and I think I saw it at the cinema twice, which is a lot for me, but even then I remember thinking that they had missed a trick by not uniting the studios across the globe to make a film that showed how the whole world would react to an alien invasion, how it could unite us as a planet, and all these years later I still believe that I could watch and enjoy a story like that.
I don't blame them for making it this way and don't get me wrong, it's still a very good film, but the optimist inside me craves an alien attack or a zombie apocalypse to unite us all against a common foe and eradicate stupid violence because of silly differences. Let the movies lead the way in uniting us all and stop making films that show what the so called differences are. But I digress.
It has an all star cast and they really don't seem to be fighting for attention, which is always a danger. Will looks mighty fine topless and Harry Connick just has a charm you can't resist, but probably my favourite character is played by Judd Hirsch, who, although only a smaller role, gives a performance that represents a lot of the viewers. Someone who can't fly aeroplanes or work out alien codes and he does it with an ease. I could have done without Randy Quaid though.If I wanted to, I could pick many faults with the film, there's a lot that is far too unrealistic and some sentimental moments that really are saccharin and actually there are many similarities to War Of The Worlds, but actually it's just a good watch if I turn off my critical eye. Big budget, big explosions, loads of deaths and destruction. It does what it says on the tin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mindless Fun,"The ultimate encounter when mysterious and powerful aliens launch an all out invasion against the human race. The spectacle begins when massive spaceships appear in Earth's skies. But wonder turns to terror as the ships blast destructive beams of fire down on cities all over the planet. Now the world's only hope lies with a determined band of survivors, uniting for one last strike against the invaders - before it's the end of mankind.I finally get to watch this film and yeah, I know I'm very late because I was never keen to watching it. This film was decent with it's above average action scenes and special effects only with a $75 million budget! The acting by Will Smith was comedic while Bill Pullman and Goldblum were both dramatic and comedic.I really think this film tries too hard to be a good film, which is why it wasn't as good as it want it to be. And I really don't know if this film tries to be funny or dramatic because it tries to be both but you really don't know when to laugh or feel sorry for the characters. It's like a cheesy line in those regular action movies.This will be known for an annual summer movie where you watch this film every summer. It's nothing bad about it but there's really nothing good about it if you want an alien invasion story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Undeniably entertaining,"This film can't be claimed to possess much, if any, intellectual value. It won't change the way we view anything(well, it may have people looking up, and/or appreciating the unblocked view of the sky more than usual). It won't revolutionize film-making. It may not even stay in your mind for terribly long after watching it. But it is an entertaining piece while you do, and hey, it's a chance for Trekkers to see Brent Spiner outside of Star Trek. Also, it never actually claims to be more than what it is, a Summer blockbuster. The film wastes no time introducing the extra-terrestrial element. The pacing throughout the film isn't bad. The plot is decent. Emmerich makes both disaster and action aspects work well. The film apparently holds, and may very well continue to hold, the record for the most miniature model-work in any one movie... that says something about just how much action is packed into this. The acting is fine. The dialog is... not the smartest ever written. The characters aren't bad. The real draw here is definitely the explosions and action. I recommend this to fans of action- and/or disaster-flicks, as well as fans of the actors and/or the director, Roland Emmerich. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Today We Celebrate Our Independence Day! Happy 4th of July,"Today seemed like the most appropriate day to write a review of the classic Will Smith alien film, Independence Day. There are so many memories I have of this film growing up (even the satire).One of the first major films that Will Smith starred in, alongside Jeff Goldblum of Jurassic Park fame and Bill Pullman (not Paxton). Paxton, in my opinion, played one of the most heroic, and best Presidents on screen. Goldblum was not bad, of course most of us associate him with his role in Jurassic Park.Don't forget Will, he was pretty great in this film too as Steve Hiller, probably one of his best roles. Which begs the question, why he didn't return for the sequel?! Oh well!!The technology to make the film at the time, 1996, was really out of this world great. With the films now, in comparison, it looks a bit old. But after 20 some years, they all look that way.Paxton delivered the best line of the entire film, towards the end, he said, ""...should we win the day, the fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: ""We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanquish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive!""TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Hilarious, Action-Packed Trip to the Galaxy's Weirdest Corners","Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones take us on a wild, intergalactic ride in ""Men in Black,"" a delightfully offbeat and humorous sci-fi comedy that blends buddy cop hijinks with extraterrestrial antics. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, this 1997 film is a genre-bending delight that keeps you entertained from start to finish.Smith shines as the charming and cocky Agent J, a former NYPD officer who stumbles upon the secret organization known as the Men in Black, tasked with monitoring and policing alien activity on Earth. Jones plays the perfect foil as the grizzled and no-nonsense Agent K, who recruits and mentors the wide-eyed J into the world of cosmic immigration enforcement.The chemistry between Smith and Jones is electric, with their banter and rapport providing a constant stream of laughs. Smith's infectious energy and comedic timing mesh seamlessly with Jones' deadpan delivery, creating a dynamic duo you can't help but root for.But ""Men in Black"" is more than just a buddy flick. The film's imaginative world-building and visual effects still hold up remarkably well, transporting us to a vibrant and quirky universe where aliens walk among us, often in hilarious and bizarre forms. From the talking pug to the delightfully creepy Edgar Bug, the creature designs are a feast for the eyes and a testament to the film's creativity.The action sequences are equally impressive, with Sonnenfeld deftly blending humor and thrills. The climactic battle against an oversized cockroach-like alien is a standout set piece, showcasing the film's ability to balance laughter and adrenaline-pumping excitement.While the plot itself is relatively straightforward - a rogue alien threatens to destroy the world, and our heroes must stop him - it's the journey that makes ""Men in Black"" so enjoyable. The film revels in its own absurdity, never taking itself too seriously and inviting the audience along for a ride that's both wildly entertaining and genuinely funny.Ultimately, ""Men in Black"" is a testament to the power of blending genres and embracing the weird. With its stellar cast, inventive world-building, and perfect balance of humor and action, it's a sci-fi comedy that still holds up as a classic nearly three decades after its release.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So Cheesy its Good,"Aliens invade Earth's atmosphere using giant space ships with impenetrable defense shields. Modern human military technology is no match against the advanced space ships. As the aliens make final preparations, humans scramble for alternative solutions to prevent annihilation.This movie is an action-comedy featuring an ensemble cast, and a script that is filled with clichés, parodies, and some of the cheesiest dialogue in movie history. This movie is ultra-jingoistic with blind patriotism being a main theme throughout. Although extremely silly, the cheesy dialogue is highly quotable with numerous one-liners that keep the viewers constantly entertained. The special effects are outstanding, and there are plenty of intense action scenes with lots of explosions. Despite the ridiculous plot holes, Independence Day does not take itself seriously and makes fun of itself at every chance.The two lead characters are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Smith portrays a macho-military tough guy while Goldblum is a stereo-typical computer nerd who uses intellect to solve complex problems, but can barely tie his own shoes. Both leads give strong performances with plenty of memorable one-liners.Perhaps even better, the main supporting cast played by Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, and Harvey Fierstein. These three deliver some of the movie's funniest moments and quotes. Quaid plays a doofus crop-duster who suffers from PTSD and claims he was abducted by aliens. Now he wants payback against the aliens for his past experiences. Judd Hirsch plays the stereo-typical Jewish father of Goldblum's character, and the dialogue between the two features endless dry humor. Hirsch plays Goldblum's selfish, helpless, panicked co-worker who's natural response to the news of impending doom is to contact his lawyer.Then we have the government characters to include Bill Pullman as President, Robert Loggia as head military general, Adam Baldwin as second officer, James Rebhorn as CIA adviser to the President, and Brent Spiner as a crazy government scientist who works in Area 51. Spiner's character is particularly funny as he frequently goes off on long tangents about scientific stuff that nobody else understands. Other supporting roles, particularly the ones played by women, are not very funny or memorable, although I liked Margaret Colin as Goldblum's ex-wife and their constant bickering.By the end of the movie, all of these characters are forced to work together to come up with solutions on how to defeat the aliens. The final cigar-scene shared between Smith and Goldblum is a classic moment, where both characters display excellent chemistry for two guys with polar opposite personalities. Another highlight of the movie is Bill Pullman's impassioned speech to the troops and pilots, which is a remarkable moment for a character who is otherwise boring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is what it is,"I watched 'Independence Day' back in 1995 during the 'height' of the X-files-induced 'alien fever' that was so prominent in popular culture that even the President of America at the time had to address the world and point out that the Government wasn't really stashing away bodies of little grey men. Therefore me, like many, were absolutely blown away when marketing material showed a giant alien spaceship hovering over the White House and promptly blowing it to pieces. That one iconic image sold the film alone. However, I distinctly remember the sense of disappointment I felt upon leaving the cinema. I'd seen the (fleeting!) clips of aerial dogfights between fighter jets and UFOs and expected them to make up more of the film. However, what I got was effectively a two and a half hour story about one stupid decision after the next.Despite being one of the most profitable movies of all time, it hardly won any prizes for logical storytelling. If you search Google for articles about the film's numerous plot holes and daft developments (Apple laptop being the highpoint!) you'll see what I mean. I didn't hate the film at the time. I appreciated the amazing special effects (for the day) and a great deal of work had gone into showing the carnage caused by an alien attack of populated areas. No faults there.So, if the effects were really the only stand-out aspects of the film, why did I end up buying the film and still watch it to this day? Well, I guess I appreciate it for what it is. It's the very definition of loud, dumb and stupid. It's a 'popcorn' movie, designed to entertain and keep your mind vaguely occupied while you check Instagram on your phone. Granted today's generations will probably not appreciate the effects, based on the numerous superhero movies where entire cities get reduced to ruins over a period of a half hour battle sequence, but what still holds up is the general sense of eagerness. This is arguably the film that launched Will Smith's career and you just can't help but warm to him. Yes, no matter how dumb and unlikely every situation he's placed in is, he's still brilliant to watch and, along with Jeff Goldblum (who's basically playing Jeff Goldblum – again), the pair of them make the movie still relevant to this day.So, if you want to enjoy 'Independence Day' you'll definitely have to put your brain on hold and know that you're getting what became the template for disaster movies (certainly nineties ones anyway, but then 'San Andreas' was pretty much the same story). You'll also have to be okay with healthy doses of 'pro-America' scripting. If you've watched (the brilliant) 'Team America: World Police' you'll probably be singing along that song of theirs 'America *£$% yeah!' all the way through, as it really is applicable. And then, when you're done enjoying the stupidity, treat yourself to a YouTube video on how these are the dumbest aliens ever to invade our planet (with the possible exception of that lot from 'Signs').",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Unwatchable space opera.,"Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich are two guys who give new meaning to the words ""turn-off"". As in ""turn-off the T.V."".I ""watched"" Independence Day and Godzilla on an illegal black box and sadly, I couldn't fast forward or anything with the former, I had to turn off the T.V. and wait 30 minutes, or watch it the next day, with a different scene. It didn't matter; I hated this film immensely and that once again, people were paying money to see this garbage.Critically-lambasted, Independence Day pays homage to Aliens vs. Earth films of the past. Same plot here. 140+ minutes of boring, unwatchable celluloid.Problems with the film are horrible acting; some of the worst ever. I especially was amused by scenes in which the aliens start attacking and some of the actors are in cars spouting off one-line sentences before going to the next scenes. Yay, Viveca A. Fox works as a stripper despite the fact that her boyfriend, played by Will Smith, has a high-paying job with the government. The film is one-sided, with the aliens destroying everything in their path and the humans are simply helpless until they discover the solution. The same lame dialogue prevalent in these films remain. The biggest sin of Independence Day is that it has no heart and that it gave ideas to Tim Burton for ""Mars Attacks"", another film that I'll have some fun ""reviewing"".Bottom line: If you want to see the otherwise good SFX and stuff and can tolerate sub-standardness everywhere else, jump right in. Otherwise, this movie makes the prior Devlin-Emmerich helmed ""Stargate"" look like Casablanca.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Action Entertaining, Characters Forgettable","It seems like about every holiday has a movie based on the holiday. Frequently, the movies are also named after the holiday as they did it with this movie. Most of the movies named after a holiday are not action movies with exception to this one. This movie is a movie you can definitely expect to see on TV during the 4th of July, as that holiday just happened. A little like how you can definitely expect to see Home Alone and Home Alone 2 on TV during the holiday season, and if you're like me, you'll like watching them around the holidays to get into the holiday spirit. This movie would definitely be an entertaining movie to watch on Independence Day with friends. Seeing action in movies naturally excites us and keeps our eyes on the screen. The action in this movie is definitely one to excite you.So, while this movie has some entertaining action it definitely has flaws which I notice and you probably notice too. Like the biggest example I think has to be getting to know the characters. This movie has multiple main characters, and scenes keep switching from one character to the next. We might remember a couple of the actors that starred in this movie, but we will probably forget the name of the character they played. As the scenes keep switching from characters, it is hard for us to keep up with all of them and a lot of the scenes we see them in where there isn't action are slow scenes. They don't seem like characters you'd write a wiki article after or really care to know about their background outside of the movie. The characters mostly seem like just a group of people from different backgrounds handling an alien invasion. Will Smith also starred in the movie Men In Black which also dealt with aliens and came out less than a year after this one does. We seem to get to know his character better in that movie than this one, and we'd probably think of Men In Black a little more as entertaining, and his character is a little more funny in that movie.Again, the action scenes are cool. The first action sequence has to be the most memorable as it is seen in the covers of this movie. It is sometimes even shown in pop culture, like they show a scene from the first action sequence in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me. The action sequences after that look like scenes from a Star Wars movie, or a video game. They remind me of a video game I used to play, Star Fox 64. Those scenes are cool and can be cheesy at times, but also have humor to them. They also have really good special effects that seem to work really well, almost 20 years later.The plot from this movie does not seem too out of the ordinary. It seems like a common plot of having aliens come to earth. Some aliens coming in peace, and others wrecking havoc like this one, and humanity having to find ways to defend themselves. About movies of aliens coming in peace, one movie which I feel like is way underrated and it seems like half the people who saw this movie loves it, is a movie that came out last year called Earth To Echo. I'd go far enough to consider that the greatest movie ever made, and I'd strongly recommend it. Also, another movie I'd recommend in movies named after holidays which I feel like is slow but entertaining, and the slow scenes in that movie are more entertaining than the slow scenes in this movie is called Labor Day. I enjoyed it when I saw it.One thing I always remember from watching this movie on TV and how it's on during Independence Day and I remember this from many years ago. If you watch movies on TV, they frequently shorten some scenes and go to commercials at the exact same time every year you watch it on TV. I notice that with Home Alone, how some scenes are shortened and one scene in particular from Home Alone that I remember them going to commercials to is after Kevin looks out the window after fooling the crooks of people in the house using mannequins, if you watch it on like TBS. In this movie, from what I remember watching it from like 18-years ago as a kid also on Independence Day. While I don't know this movie well enough to talk about shortened scenes, I always remember how one time this movie switches to commercials is after the first action sequence right after the light bulb in the tunnel pops. A way to keep us watching to find out what happens next.So, the movie is entertaining and in one sentence it's flaws are not getting to know the characters, sometimes cheesy, not a lot of plot, something that doesn't seem too out of the ordinary, and some slow scenes for a 2+ hour movie. This movie has seemed to change how we see movies and action in cinemas since it came out and I look forward to it's sequel. Though this movie doesn't seem like the type of movie that needs a sequel or can go in the direction for a sequel. So, despite it's flaws because of the action and entertainment I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An entertaining big dumb movie, as these things go, but a big dumb movie nonetheless. Overall, ID4 moves along at a fair pace, the action sequences are generally fun to watch, and the characters play well together.

America! F&@k yeah!!,"Independence Day, a big fat ""Yeehaw America"" kinda film... but as stupid as it is, it's bloody good fun. Sure there's nothing complicated about it, it's cut to the chase stuff, spaceships appear within 2 minutes, def cons are mentioned shortly after. Cue lots of booming sound effects to match the flash cuts as we whip around the globe setting up the alien invasion, whilst maintaining the focus on the US Military. Mr President Bill Pullman doing his breathy, I'm really important act, I'm surprised the TV doesn't explode with testosterone. In fact women are pretty much left out of the story altogether. I wouldn't be surprised if a portion of the US population watched this and thought ""Hell yeah, we'd show those aliens!"", truth is though that's not the way to enjoy this film. It's a tongue firmly in cheek sort of ride. ""The LA Police Department asks people not to fire their weapons at the spaceship, you may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war"". I mean it's got Will Smith in it, not to mention Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum. It's a sci-fi, disaster movie farce with a massive budget. A budget largely spent on explosions. Landmarks blown up, relentless fireballs, flying cars, all in slow motion of course and the audio balance is bloody ridiculous, speaker killing pyrotechnics coupled with rousing score, followed by cheesy exposition heavy dialogue at half the volume. Ah... the dialogue, seriously who wrote this script, that speech, it's so cringe inducing it made my face hurt, as the characters bumble through a solution to their impending doom. I guess if hostile aliens do ever attack us, sticking the gun toting nutjob country in the line of fire isn't a bad idea, as long as we can handle the endless fist pumping gloating that might follow. It's not aged badly though, it is what it is, daft over the top fun, but I guess I'm a bit more cynical these days and I seriously doubt anyone would green light anything like this now... although they did make Independence Day: Resurgence a few years ago, now THAT was a disaster!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Only in Hollywood would a nerd and a fighter pilot be our last best hope,"Watching ""Independence Day"" takes me back to that fateful day in early 1996. I saw the trailer right before ""Broken Arrow"" and that image of a wall of fire and debris coming toward the screen blew my 15 year-old mind . Some serious seeds were sown that day. So I guess I've got a soft spot for this movie even to this day. Even now, those fireballs are still pretty awesome, and even after seeing this as much as I have, I still get caught up in it.To me, ""Independence Day"" is synonymous with huge effects spectacle, at least in terms of Summer escapism. In a way, the movie really embodies it. Sure, we've had billion-dollar grossers since then, but can any of those movies really compare? None of them scream the July 4th holiday like this one, even while famous D.C. landmarks are decimated. I dare say that this has become synonymous with the idea of tentpole Summer titles, and even ingrained as a patriotic movie.Bottom line, it's the assured direction and across-the-board likability of the cast that makes this so watchable.

Brilliantly Entertaining.,"I saw this movie when I was twelve and I remember I couldn't wait to see it. As a twelve year old it was the greatest film ever made. The mixture of aliens, explosions and Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum blowing up the mother ship all made up for my favorite film at a young age. While it may no longer hog the top spot (I have grown up a bit since then) the film is still a favorite of mine, owning it on video and DVD and I still find it great fun to watch. Okay, okay, so the American patriotism is a little overdone at the end, but Jeff Goldblum is great value for money, especially when playing the cocky scientist who is destined to be right and mixing it up with a cockier Will Smith this has the basis to be a fun film which it is.While the special effects are what the film relies on the most, it is the affectionate tribute to the many genres that inspired Emmerich and Devlin that makes this a joy to watch. Clearly in love with alien invasion films and disaster films from the 50's and 70's, they have ever cliche in the book thrown into the film, from the frightening, although fantastically done, alien attack that sees some of the most famous landmarks in America being blown up, through to the self sacrifice of a character through to the death of many a loved one who are merely one dimensional characters who serve no purpose other than to be killed and cause a gamut of emotions, Emmerich and Devlin have done their job well. The film is affectionate to the genre's it is paying tribute to and in doing so they have created one of the most entertaining Hollywood blockbusters in many a year. While the film would seem to have a lot in common more with a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay collaboration (explosions, explosions and some more explosions), they do in a less excessive mode and in doing so do create some funny and moving character moments. Goldblum and Judd Hirsch have some fantastic scenes together, while Bill Pullman's president having to watch his wife die is genuinely sad, never have the word sleeping seem so weepy.It is the action scenes where this film comes to life and boy does Emmerich know how to put on a good show. From the aforementioned attack scene to the the retaliation of human kind, the film is a fast paced fun ride that never lets up and never has a dull moment. It may be corny and it may be a film made for twelve year old boys, but seven years have passed since the film was released and I'm going to admit it.

"""Independence Day"" or America as the World in Microcosm ...","Let's get this straight, if only for the visual effects and the thrilling attacks sequences, for the iconic shot of the Empire State Building and White House blown to pieces, without any use of CGI but old good 'miniature' material, ""Independence Day"" is a groundbreaking achievement that redefines the purposes of visual and special effects in the Sci-Fi genre. And if only for that, the movie deserves a certain bit of respect.But when you make such a big-budgeted action-packed blockbuster, and expect to impress the eyes of movie goers and make their hearts pound so hard that they forget to put their salty fingers in the popcorn box, why not make a supplementary effect to improve a script that would justify the use of these special effects, and not let the success of a movie rely only on a technological achievement? In ""Independence Day"", it's like Roland Emmerich was so confident over the success of his film that he didn't care much for the complaints that would be expressed toward the script and its blatant lack of originality.And if it doesn't take a genius to know that some formulas simply cannot fail, it doesn't take an elitist mindset either to find obvious flaws in the way the story is written, and maybe worse, in the way the characters are written, not portrayed because I think the actors did a satisfying job with what was at their hands. Overall, the humans were fine but how about the Aliens? Couldn't have they come up with something fresher? I found hard to believe that these ugly octopus-like creatures could own a technology powerful enough to wipe out the entire human race. Well, never mind, the point is that I don't buy the argument that just because a movie features spectacular effects, one must suspend his disbelief and enjoy the movie for what it is, especially when the most difficult stuff is perfectly handled. I don't buy the counter-argument either that just because you criticize some elements of the plot, you're some kind of movie buff with a precious taste and a particular dislike for mainstream movies.I genuinely liked ""Independence Day"", I enjoyed it and not just as a guilty pleasure. I will never forget the experience in the movie theater when even as a 14 year old kid, I couldn't help but cheer during the President's speech. Oh some parts probably made me cringe, but it's nothing compared to what was thrown to my eyes that night, it was a great year for action films, ""Eraser"", ""The Rock"" but on that level, ""Independence Day"" was a class on its own, that till now, stood the test of time. But the more I thought of it, the more I realize that I loved the experience much more than the story ... well, the result is pretty much the same, and the film was the highest grossing of the year but this indicates the main flaw on special-effects-driven film like ""ID4"", they leave as great an impression as a ride on a roller-coaster, but as ephemeral too. Their inner ambition is more to garner the most viewers than to leave an indelible mark on cinematic papers. Again, the team did a good job, but it just could have been so much better on the story department.I don't want to fall in the wisecracking trap by numbering all the clichés that structure the plot; it would be a pointless exercise, because whatever plot was, it was relying on an overused concept anyway. And the film features every single stereotypical elements so cherished by the disaster genre, a lot of social and racial backgrounds presented through the classic external focus with the maximum of diversity as to sustain the beautiful vision of America's melting-pot. In a way, it's more economical to show all the racial minorities that constitute America than the whole world, America as the microcosm of the World. Hell, the liberation from the Alien invasion even coincided with the 4th of July. I hesitate between two words starting with P: pretension or patriotism, but when things are so obviously over the top, I guess it's a more of a clever reminder than we're only watching a film  as if we hadn't noticed before.""Today we celebrate our Independence!"" Did that make me cringe as a non-American? Not quite and I doubt the people in the theater pushed their thinking as far as I'm doing right here in a totally different context. In cinemas' darkness, movies affect us more, creating a deeper connection with the protagonists, in that case, a charismatic country. America entertains the world, and never is the empathy as strong as in theaters. I remember how the crowd cheered during that speech, and while I'm not sure people would look at the film the same way now, it makes me realize how these times were still innocent. These lost years between the Gulf War and the September 11th Attacks, when nothing was as religiously and politically lauded as today, from every side. I still look at the attack sequence with cinematically fascinated eyes, but I'm still lucid about the way some people would consider, now, the sight of the Empire State Building's explosion.And I wonder if that works as a critic or an alibi for ""Independence Day"" ... world has become a very dangerous place by itself and maybe this is what makes the film an innocent and immature entertainment. Let just think that the real enemy for men is the Alien, when it has come to men vs. men. There's even a sort of sentimental fatalism in the way it shows that it's only in the case of Alien attacks that Humanity will join its forces and be united.Finally, if the movie ever sinned, it's from a childish naivety  or was it deliberate? Or have we become just so mature that we changed our whole mindset regarding movies?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What are you all complaining about?,"I've noticed this a lot with films that make a lot of money - people seem to HATE them. Not just a small amount of dislike, real hatred. Why though? I saw this film years ago, as a child, and I'm NOT American, so the patriotism thing really should get to me... right? Sorry, but I'm able to look past that and see a good movie. People have a go at the script - but it works. There are some plot holes, but have you ever seen a film without one? People have a go at the acting - I saw nothing wrong with it. People say it's very 'God Bless America' and yes it is, but if it was 'God Bless The World' people would complain that it wasn't 'God Bless America' so really, look past that. It's got amazing special effects, great action, funny lines (Welcome to Earth is the best line ever!

"Well, It Could Have Been Worse","Welcome to WillyT Reviews. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, and aliens. Now that's a recipe for success. Independence day takes place over a three day period and between those three days the world's population is reduced to basically nothing after a wave of aliens attack. Bill Pullman plays the President and he is probably my favorite portrayal of a US president on film. Jeff Goldblum knocks it out of the park again as the smartest man on Earth. Then there is Will Smith who matures from The Fresh Prince to a pilot in the army and even though he is playing a role with more seriousness but still has his wit and comedic charm. There is a lot to talk about with this movie but my limit is 1000 words, here we go.The opening scene, if you have followed my reviews recently I talk a lot about the opening scenes and other than the cliché REM song ""It's The End of the World as We Know It"" the movie zoned me in right away. It starts on the moon and the spaceships just hover over and descend towards Earth. I feel like the movie kind of jumped into it and had very little character development in the beginning but they made up for it in the middle and end. The ships fly over major cities all over the world and the first act concludes with the destruction of cities and the death of millions.Like I said earlier I love the characters and how they develop in the film, especially the president. Bill Pullman starts out as an unpopular President who has made poor decisions in the past. As disaster strikes he grows a backbone and becomes a strong leader. His little speech about Independence Day was really inspirational. It was a little cheesy but it did its job and I liked it. Jeff Goldblum learns how to love again and he becomes a stronger person and a better man. Will Smith grows up in a way and his dream comes true. It's a little weird but the destruction of Earth and the almost extinction of humanity was kind of a good thing for these people. In a way it makes the world stronger and one can assume what happens after the credits roll and my imagination went wild, which is never a bad thing.My favorite character is David's Jewish uncle. I forget his name but he is hilarious and steals every scene he is a part of. Was his acting memorable or amazing, no, but I feel like the actor was just being himself and he did such a fluent job that reflected on screen. His lines fit well and are smart at the same time witty. Towards the end he is praying in a circle. He invites a man to join him, ""I'm not Jewish"" he says ""Nobody's perfect."" He responds. In the time of disaster and fear he still cracks a joke and made me smile. He was a perfect blend to the movie.Let's talk about the aliens. Now I have a few problems with them. They look OK, a little unrealistic and silly but it could have been worse. I like how they use technology and communicate with each other but they have shields around their ships. That's cheating and makes it almost impossible to stop them. I thought it was lame and the movie could have worked without them, maybe even better. Finally, they have no reason for the attack. They literally go from planet to planet and kill everything. ""They're like locusts."" The President says after he actually communicates with them in my favorite scene. I wanted a better reason. After the buildup in the first act and half of the second act it made me think, wow that's it. That makes no sense. The aliens are so smart and are basically invulnerable but they make so many stupid mistakes. Watching the movie conclude I didn't really buy it. I was OK with the ending and I enjoyed it but it was not as good as I expected. I won't spoil the ending but it's not like War of The Worlds where they just die from the parasites and particles in the air. My feelings on that is for another time. When it comes to alien movies I have been let down so many times by the ending. Signs, War of the Worlds, and now Independence Day, out of those three movies this one had the best ending but I don't think it was enough because it wasn't realistic. Overall, Independence Day was a good movie with really good special effects. I could watch historic buildings all over the country being blown up and the wall of fire tearing cities apart all day long. The lead characters were strong, the acting wasn't terrific but it worked and they developed well. Side characters were fun and fit nicely, specifically the General and David's Uncle. The aliens were OK, foolish but still scary. The story was really good and presented well but had a disappointing ending. I see this movie on TV all the time and whenever it's on I can hop right in and watch it while still being entertained. It is a good movie to watch alone or with a group, it can be a background movie so I give Independence Day the Willyt Honorable Mention for its characters and their development, the awesome special effects and its entertainment value.

A movie where the trailers turned out to be better than the feature.,"I saw Independence Day twice in the cinema during the summer of 1996. The first time, i thought it was action packed, with stunning special effects with fantastic set pieces like New York and Washington D.C. being blown to pieces by the invading aliens. Then i had to see it again. This time i went with some friends.When i walked out after the second showing i realised that the film was disaster rubbish with sit com comedy dominating the entire feature. The proof is in the daft stereotypes. Jeff Goldblum takes the film seriously for about five minutes (during the arrival of the massive ships over the New York skyline) after that as far as Goldblum's concerned its Laurel and Hardy time with Will Smith's fighter pilot when they team up at the end to take on the mother ship. Then there is Will Smith. The director must have just said to smith 'Just be yourself' meaning Fresh Prince of Bel air in a military uniform. Smith is much better in Men In Black (a real comedy) and the excellent i, robot so it is a shame he just made his character into a complete parody of the Hero.Special mention must go to Randy Quaid for playing one of the most annoying characters in movie history. Rand's character is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the later Star Wars prequel The Phantom Menace.The potential to make a great invasion thriller with measured humour and stunning thrills and chills is lost amid silly comic capers and daft one liners between insipid characters. ID4 made a lot of money but for me (and my friends) it was one of the biggest letdowns of 1996.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst ever.,"This movie was just on cable, so I thought I'd give it another look for the first time since I saw it around it's original release.  As was the case the first time, this movie stinks.  Maybe aging a few years (me - not the movie) is to blame, but this film gets worse each time.  Special effect/Summer Blockbusters usually have little value outside of their visual presentation, but this one may be king.  Terrible acting.  Lame attempts to be funny (if that's what they were trying).  Pathetic script tugging at American (and world) pride.  Far-fetched scenes too numerous to mention (My favorite - Will Smith punching and knocking out an alien that we later learn is protected by a special coating).  This goes in my Terrible Top 10.  My only enjoyment in this film is rooting for the aliens.  If only they could evaporate Hollywood studios responsible for this crap.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Crude, but highly entertaining summer film","A series of large alien spaceships move to planet Earth and destroy the largest cities of the world. After the invasion, Earth, led by the United States, has no choice but to fight back. their first attempts failed, but the presence a computer virus renews their hope for survival as the countdown for 4 July-- US Independence Day-- begins.Super-lick, witty sci-fi movie pulls out all stops. The all-too-familiar Alien Invasion plot is revived with a series of twists thanks to the eye-popping, Award-winning special effects (the spaceships are flawless!). The 3 leading characters steal the show and make the movie fluid and likable. David Arnold's unforgettable and sweeping score also contributes positively to the film's atmosphere (leading to nominations in a number of institutions). Randy Quaid is hilarious as the alcoholic Vietnam vet volunteering in the fight against the invaders. It also manages to sidestep Sci-fi clichès since there is NO single leading character that show the way to battle the Aliens.But there are flaws as well: the human stories are very dumb and sometimes nonsensical; the movie is overlong and takes a while to get started, and the over-the-top patriotism in this movie sometimes gives the movie a slightly cartoonish feel. There is a high number of needlessly stupid and flat supporting characters.Despite of that, the movie became the most successful movie of 1996, earning more than $300 million in the US and over $500 million worldwide.

An summer action blockbuster.,"In 1996, the highest grossing of the time was an science-fiction film called Independence Day. It was one of the biggest movies of the summer. It shocked and was seen by thousands of movie audiences. What made Independence Day the biggest action movie of the summer of '96? Well, Independence Day is a alien invasion movie about aliens from outer space coming to invade Earth. Soon then, the world become suspicious when these very giant alien ships float above us turning day into an dark place. The President of the United States, played by Bill Pullman, alerted the people that they are in a state of emergency. The alien ships soon destroyed major cities in the U.S. including Washington D.C, L.A. and New York. This was something very extraordinary. The screen is then set ablaze as the ship fired on the buildings and destroys everything in it's path. So, an Fighter plane pilot, played by Will Smith takes action to eliminate these unearthly beings. The movie has a lot of great visual effects, good camera shots of the big alien ship hovering over New York. The action scenes are very exciting. This is a good popcorn fun action movie that really works for the audience who wants excitements, thrills and fun.

"Take a second look, it's not that bad.","I have heard many people ripping into Independence Day as one of the worst films that they have seen in a long time, I disagree. In 1997 the film won an Academy Award for best visual effects, and was nominated for sound. For the time the CGI in this film was amazing, and the sound wasn't too bad, the nominations and awards were deserving. The film was also the movie that basically launched Will Smith's carreer into stardom, that says something too. I am having to write a college paper on the movie, which has caused me to watch the movie three times in one day, and I must say that the acting hold through the entire movie, and the storyline isn't as bad as one might initally think, The President isn't overly agressive, and violent minded, the aliens are obviously greatly superior, and there isn't too much time taken in Star Trek style explaining, rather the problems are shown to be solved or explained within the natural dialouge. Yeah, there are holes in the story, yeah this isn't the greatest movie ever made, and yeah some of the dialouge is corny, but remember it's an action movie, and made to be fun, not groundbreaking or earth shattering, just fun.

Main defenders are the President (Bill Pullman), who is in charge, David Levinson, a cable guy (Jeff Goldblum) who finds out how to get through the alien technology, and Captain Steve Hillard of the Air Force (Will Smith) who hates those aliens shooting green s**t at him.

This is extremely entertaining if you can get past a few blockbuster flaw,"Independence Day (1996) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a hostile alien invasion of Earth that seems impossible to overcome. A scientist who intercepts the alien signal and is able to translate it uses his connections to the president to get the intel to him. The President, the scientist and a fighter pilot who was lucky enough to kill an alien partner to predict the aliens next move and take down their defense system in hopes of giving the human race hope for a fair fight.This movie is directed by Roland Emmerich (Stargate) and stars Will Smith (Bad Boys), Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park), Bill Pullman (Spaceballs), Mary McDonnell (Donnie Darko), Judd Hirsch (Taxi), Randy Quaid (Christmas Vacation), Vivica A. Fox (Kill Bill) and Robert Loggia (BIG).This cast is absolutely tremendous from top to bottom and Randy Quaid delivers an outstanding performance. The characters, their background and outlook are well developed and delivered. Vivica and Will's chemistry was perfect and their characters are easy to root for. The special effects are uneven with some bad scenes (the dog in the subway) and some outstanding sequences (every aerial battle). There's an alien autopsy scene in this that I always enjoy. I will say the humans figuring out the alien defense system in just a couple days always annoyed me about this film and the President as a fighter pilot felt forced and over the top.Overall this is a not as good, modernization, of War of the Worlds.

One of the last really good Summer popcorn movies,"Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some fun—if derivative—popcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'.

Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*.

Aliens and love,"With a great story lined up and an A list cast all included, Independence Day broke records when released in 96, and now 12 years on it still hasn't lost any of its magic.Will Smith (Fresh Prince of Bel Air) coming almost straight from being a rapper and starring on a network TV show got the role of a U.S pilot which put him firmly on the market as one of the hottest and youngest actors around.Smith stars alongside Bill Pullman (While you were sleeping) and Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park) as the world comes under attack by alien spacecrafts and the stakes are raised by each of their love lives.With its Oscar winning effects, Independence Day established itself in the Sci-Fi genre with the huge and very impressive spacecraft designs and justified it brilliantly, especially with Smith's first encounter with one of the aliens, a personal favourite moment.And along with the great effects, comes an even better plot which is gripping, tense and extraordinary. The suspense is built as viewers are given glimpses of what is coming, and the world's response is also intriguing, none more so than the political view of the president.There was an interesting political side to the story, what to do and what not to do to save lives, keeping secrets and to use the right course of action, giving the plot more depth.Though at first we are thrust into so many people's lives that it can be easy to forget, we gradually get to know the characters and their situations and though a bit cheesy, are still fun to watch, and at points dramatic and thankfully realistic in context.There are some great one liners, especially from Smith. The acting is far from brilliant but the effects and the suspense in the plot is enough for it to be included in the top Sci-Fi thrillers of all time. And though it does wear thin after a few watchers, it never loses its power to entertain and shock.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun movie...,"It's pretty funny to see people rip this movie, even calling it laughingly
bad.  It's no classic for sure, but a fun ride with a classic story (ripped
from War of the Worlds with some twists).Maybe there's not super character development, but we didn't want to see
that, we wanted to see the humans v.s. aliens, and this movie certainly
delivers.  It delivers the same kind of rush as movies such as The
Matrix.There's some solid performances here from Smith, Goldblum, and Bill Pullman.
 Anyone expecting straight drama for the whole flick should look somewhere
else, but there's many good moments (such as Pullman's speech) that are very
well done.  I don't think a comedy scene here and there (funny at that)
detracts from that.  There may be cliches, but they are generally well
done.I didn't see any obvious plot holes in this movie, there's some incorrect
technical details but the main story points are all possible as it's
possible a more advanced society would have less knowledge in certain areas

One viewer wondered why the hijacked fighter would have been allowed inside the mother ship, contrary to what most would have considered the alien order of battle.Also, every time they make a scifi picture, LA always gets demolished. For the life of me I can't understand why they destroy LA time and again. Don't the movie makers like where they live? They ""intrinsically"" destroyed Houston in this one with an atomic weapon aimed against the invaders. So they should try destroying Houston by itself like they did with the killer bee picture in 1978, and leave poor LA alone. Can you imagine trying to get around that 2nd St. Tunnel some night while it is clogged with crew, actors, extras, and cars? Try it on the Pierce Elevated for a change.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Classic Fun That Never Gets Old,"Today the idea of aliens coming to earth to take over the world has become ""cliche."" But Independence Day was the first of its kind that took the darkness out of this genre. This is not to say that the movie does not have its sad moments, but this incredible cast brightens up the day.Bill Pullman plays the lovable fighter pilot who has become President. Jeff Goldblum plays a computer genius who is still in love with his wife (Margaret Colin), but are separated by professional differences. Jeff Goldblum's character, David Levinson joins up with his dad Julius (Judd Hirsh) in which the two add comic relief. Will Smith plays Captain Hiller who's dream is to fly a spaceship and lives with his striper girlfriend Jasmine (Viviva Fox). The list of great characters goes on and on.Each of this incredible cast's story will be affected by the alien invasion. They must put aside their differences in order to save the planet and in the process learn to respect each other. This theme is metaphor for life that in time of crisis, human beings can come together for the good of mankind.Overall just a great movie that constantly adds a new twist to the story. This movie is not trying to win an academy award but, if you take it for its worth, you will have a great time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great dog-fights & fxs, but fails","The plot is enough to attract anyone to this film. Back in 96, this was really fantastic movie. Now, in 99, it was just your basic big budget Hollywood popcorn movie. I wasn't into analyzing movies back then and thought this was one of the best movies ever made. Looking back on it, and having knowledge of the real SETI program and countless other space scientists, I found it to be an implausible, inaccurate, and unreal flick. But it's sci-fi, so it doesn't matter.But my comment could be used in how the filmmakers forget their own logic and use it to advantage: referring to the chase scene in the Grand Canyon. If the ships had shields, how could a parachute penetrate? And in that very first dogfight, the alien ships preformed excellent maneuvers. In the second, when they really needed it, they just stood still and blew up. And you'd think with an alien colony as advanced, as they were, they'd have developed virus protection. Of course, if they did we'd have no movie.But aside from the plot holes and flaws, the fxs were something to watch. I think it was directed well, but needed a few rewrites and a better look into characters and development. I'm not even gonna get into Godzilla. That was just their worst work. It looks like they never learned.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awful,"Fiction and fantasy should keep some reasonable foundations. Rather illogical that you connect with an alien PC and transfer a virus, never experienced how complex are communications between human devices? The American President as a pilot to save the world is absurd.American-centric movie. The typical US army against the evil, in this case the aliens who are not ready to dialog, but just kill us. By the way, how can we pretend to translate Aliens language, not to mention the fact that they have the same logical concepts in their mind.The only interesting features are the various reference to other movies, in this case showing no originality at all.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I D 4 = great Star Wars movie in modern world,"Though some many harsh critics and bad attitude toward this movie, I know that. The story is cheesy, the plot is stupid, and no depth in the whole movie...alright, that can be true. However, undoubtedly, this is still a very good summer popcorn movie and indeed it hit the box office with no surprise. The Visual effects and Special effects during 96~97 were still stunning. Basically, it is quite similar to the classic Star Wars trilogy...aircraft chasing and mother ship attacked. In my personally opinion, the story itself is still interesting. The script writers actually did a good job. They created not single-dimension crisis at the same time, and when people resolved one crisis and then another one just appeared. It made the story intensive and easily grabs audiences' tension. Besides, the reason why there were still so much people feel like it was so realistic during watching in the theater was because the whole story was set in modern world. The Big Apple (where I live) and other important capitals around the world. People are familiar with these places so that people may feel very realistic at that time. Besides, I do love the first person shot and the score. The first person POV shots are really good in the battle scenes. The director Roland Emmerich is really doing a good job - to provide a good and exciting entertained movie during the summer. The score composed by David Arnold is excellent. After seeing this movie in the theater, I just ran to CD store to buy its soundtrack. The music in this movie is definitely can be placed among John Williams' classics. There is no need to take such a exciting sci-fi movie too serious.My rating 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Was this a satire of SFs?,"The thing I liked best about this film was that the actors seemed to be having such a great time.  Jeff Goldblum was much too intelligent to take himself seriously, although I was delighted if he was indeed using a Mac to get the bad guys.  Bill Pullman seemed to have a tiny smile throughout the film that said, ""Don't take me seriously folks; I'm having a ball!""  And Will Smith was just being himself.  If you don't take the movie any more seriously than the actors (most of whom are very good at what they've done in the past), you could indeed leave your brain at the door and still enjoy it.  I like to think of this as satire of SF; then all the silly, unbelievable stuff comes together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underrated,"This movie gets bashed a lot and its surprising to see so many idiots pretend to be pseudo intellectuals who can't enjoy 2-3 hrs of pure unadultrated fun. Sure it isn't the most sophisticated movie ever made but it was mostly very well done and was highly entertaining and polished for what it was worth. The special effects were top notch and the dogfight sequences were great fun even if a bit unrealistic in the actual manuevering capabilties of the aircraft involved. But its not too often that you get to see so many stealth B-2s in the air. If you have'nt seen this, then this movie is recommended as a great entertainer and feel good movie.

The Jolly Rogger,"The Motion Picture Independence Day was a film that wanted to be liked so badly that it bordered on absurdity,however as a film it possessed enough air head possibilities to make it the highest grossing film for the year 1996.This blockbuster film was not so much a film about aliens and the possibility of life existing elsewhere other than the planet earth but about what would occur if indeed these creatures were more advanced and could time travel and almost the whole family show up on the Fourth of July.I was one of the many persons who learning of the extreme blockbuster status that this movie gathered in the theaters went to see what it was about.There is perhaps good reason why reviewsnever get written and indeed I had to think about this blockbuster film to decide if it was worth writing a review.Iam still not so certain that it is worth much of a say outside of the near hysterical non-sense that we get bowled over by,sufficient enough to pick our pockets in exchange for a afternoon at the movies.One of the by products of this relatively new advent of the whole community writing a review about these pictures is that we are encouraged to participate in the activities and become if you will a contributor to its well being.Iam not so certain that such contributions are worthwhile and indeed it is not even the participation which is unwholesome but the fact that there is a very real underpinning to all this that borders on a shameful illusion and it only provides for a lie that gets its way.Some of the problem to judging this film like the motion picture itself, is the value that it provides for,which is not only suggestive but as well unsupported.The boastful goings on of the film are showy and indicate a look at me mentality,however that not withstanding,it isn't where the fault is,it is in the assumption that we all care and that everyone from all around the world is paying attention to the Americans.The undesirable prospect is if that be true then there is reason why this film is so worldly and that is because it wants to be certain that it is noticed and indeed viewed by as many as can be gotten into the theaters.The Gross Figures indicate somewhere around 340 million dollars,second to none for the year.There is an illustration provided as to this films coercive abilities in the two columns along the side of the page.There is a goofs column and a factual/details column and much more.I have never seen so many different errors,details,and goofs at all and yet it sold like a barn on fire.The leveling off is this,the picture provided for a unreasonable assumption that in a manner of speaking was awarded for the ability to do so in its special effects.It does this by creating an idea of importance that some 70 different news broadcasts were used as a means to coerce public opinion,and that if you will is something like a picture within a picture The definition as to the cause effect of the press core and its influence is said to be the equivalent of the event occurring even as suggested only on a television screen.The real point is just how much does so much influence,really influence our daily lives.What in fact is reality?Were paying for it,we certainly have the right to know.This consequence due to non-sense is further highlighted with a series of other questions.The picture being a unsupported position can then be asked what is being encouraged if the premise as to the film is ridiculous? For one thing boasting and showing off and for another,power over another is assumed.That is both blatant in its underpinning as well as seductive.The seduction is provided in the scene where the female who is a exotic dancer is preparing to marry Capt.Hillard.She does a seductive zip my dress up with her angel,who is no more than maybe 9 or 10 years old.I think that that kind of suggestion is inappropriate even bordering on improper.Little boys like Little girls are innocent and though it is suggested that the girls grow up faster then boys,it is the boys who are rebellious. That scene is mean as it is suggestive and even provocative because parents should know better and when they do not provide for the child some moral fiber as to conduct they allow for a fast lane idea which allows a deviate basis as to conduct.Though there is more to suggest all I can say that deviant conduct is not about sexual proclivities it is about crime and a problem in society,all stemming from the child's upbringing.This is not a simple idea and neither is what this film is selling.Hollywood is not such that we should know these back-lots and warehouses lest we stumble upon the next academy award. The special edition provided for the actor Harvey Fierstien making like a Pink Flamingo and planting one on Jeff Goldblum,to everyones surprise.Its not too cool and Iam glad it wasn't the special edition that aired in the theaters.It is difficult to judge performance however the main stay of the film seemed to have actors playing parts but that was the jest of it-It was not much more than that and though this may not mean anything it always seemed that when suggestions were finally set in motion they were objected to inappropriately and out of time.There is a disjointed idea about importance,honesty and this picture and never the twain shall meet.Iam not kidding this really is a very stupid film.The timing and appropriateness of certain comments seemed to be emphasized when the aliens are closing in on closing us out and then we learn that we knew all about them.I don't know but things just had a hard time adding up-the aforementioned columns with the errors and details perhaps will shed some light on all the problems this film exhibited.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Special Effects and humor equals a fun movie,"This is perhaps Roland Emmerich's best film to date. It's not a great film, but it was fun to watch and had me feeling a little patriotic after seeing it on Independence Day of 1996.Like The Day After Tomorrow, another Emmerich film, Independence Day draws a good line between popcorn fun and quirky enough characters that kept me smiling. If I had to compare the two though, Independence Day would fall on top. It is also Roland Emmerich's best film so far.Aliens from another planet are bent on taking over our world with huge ships that block out the sunlight. Using smaller one manned ships, they decide to do battle with our air force. We use atomic bombs as well, and neither one has any real effect on the monstrous ships that loom over major cities to lay waist to everything. All hope seems lost until a simple Cable technician (Jeff Goldblum) finds a way to make the fight more fair for mankind. With help from a cocky air force pilot (Will Smith in one of his better and more famous roles) the two set out to attack the alien mother ship with a computer virus. Will it work? Well if you haven't seen the movie you'll have to.Independence Day was a phenomenal success. It helped make Will Smith a superstar and paved the way to become the biggest blockbuster of 1996. It was one of those movies you couldn't help but enjoy no matter how flawed it may have been. Like many other summer films, Independence Day was pure popcorn entertainment.

They were ably supported by some stars as Randy Quaid, Mary McDonnell and Robert Loggia.In addition, there were some fine beauties sprinkled through the film: Vivica A.

A science fiction spectacle!,"""Independence Day"" is a good old fashioned science fiction spectacle with lot's of stuff blowing up and dying people.This movie is pure entertainment. Don't watch this movie expecting a serious story with any logic in it. The movie filled with dumb dialogue, needless many characters and patriotism. But quite frankly who cares? The movie serves its purpose; to entertain.The best thing about ""Independence Day"" is the action. Not only are the total destructions of cities such as New York and Washington and their monuments totally awesome but also the plane fights versus the aliens are very well made, mainly thanks to some good and convincing special effects for which the movie also received an Oscar.But yes, the movie has too many weak spots to be ever regarded as a science fiction classic such as ""The War of the Worlds"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". One of my main complaints is there are too many characters, just like in disaster movies from the 70's. Problem with the characters is that the creators try to create a story around all of them with as a result needless plot lines and uninteresting situations.The actors are below average. Even Jeff Goldblum isn't in his element and seemed to have been miss cast. Maybe the best actor in this movie is Will Smith in his big breakthroughMindless fun.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

In My opinion ID-4 is one of the greatest movies ever made! Below is an In-depth look at most of the characters in the film!Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore - He is the President of the United States of America. He fought in the Gulf War. He is an excellent pilot and an intelligent man.

Her and Thomas J. Whitmore are a very close couple.Randy Quaid as Russell Casse - This man served in Viet Nam and was abducted by aliens many years.

Meh,"Though this movie does have problems, they are not major and don't really matter. This is because the movie distracts you from the stupidity quite well.

Just think of War of the Worlds meets Top Gun. The characters are OK. That's the nicest things to say about them. Jeff Goldblum plays JEFF GOLDBLUM! That's it. The only actor who's trying is Will Smith, but he makes everything he's in awesome! The movie is just OK. The movie is silly, but harmless. It has plot holes, but the action distracts you from them.

The aliens are coming...,"Independence Day is made in the style and tradition of the 50's B- movies like ""It Came From Outer Space"". It's not supposed to be a deep philosophical discussion about Man Against The Universe, nor an attempt to seriously visualize the possible consequences of alien invasion. It's meant to be good fun, watching Our Heroes struggle valiantly against The Evil Alien Hordes. And remember, this film is brain's candy, not brain's food.This is undoubtedly one of the most fun sci-fi movies in history. The tale starts with a ship roughly 1/4 size of the moon entering orbit of earth, only to send down multiple city sized ships to our cities to wipe out humanity. This is one of those movies where you won't realize you've spent nearly 3 hours in front of your set. In fact, you'll probably want more.. I think there's really nothing particularly special about this film, other than it manages to fit all it's 'block-buster' fair into such a tight package, and casts it so well, that it works. Again, I go on about pacing, but for me it's crucial in a 'block-buster' film. The characters are a distinctly stock: cool, macho pilot, geek who saves the day, drunk who comes good in a crisis, US President who is also action man (cf Airforce One). The special effects are very good, but alone this doesn't explain success (anyone remember Dune?). I think this movie succeeds, because it is fun.

The glut of lessor imitators has shown Independence Day's great use of sets and design and multiple characters and the deliberate pacing and intelligently used destruction. Yeah it's still rah rah USA but less so than I remembered, maybe because it's so much more tame than recent flicks like Transformers.

Only drawback is some (I think unnecessarily) unpleasant moments with the bad guys mid-way through. This is really the 90's answer to the great sci-fi classics of the 50's.

Disaster or alien movie (possibly even action movie) - it just doesn't get better than Independence Day! This 1996 sci-fi action blockbuster is one of the greatest of all time,"When you watch the mega-blockbusters of the 1990s and compare them to each other, it is easy to forget how groundbreaking they really were. Films like Jurassic Park and Independence Day were massively ahead of their time, winning all kinds of awards and launching cinema into a new era of special effects. But Independence Day is much more than effects: the directing, the writing, the characters, the cast, the story, the pacing; everything about this movie is the perfect storm of excellence, enthusiasm, and entertainment. It is rare to find a film that so perfectly blends action, adventure, comedy, horror, and sci-fi as beautifully as this movie. Will Smith was a promising new actor surrounded by high-caliber performances from Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman. Seriously, we need to elect Bill Pullman's Thomas Whitmore as President. His speech to inspire the troops before the climactic final battle is among the most iconic in cinema history!

WELL THIS IS A GOOD POPCORN MOVIE TO ENTERTAIN YOU....DEADLY FANBOYS. yep fan-boys are deadly they think they know everything. Well guess what this is a Great film a movie about Aliens invading the earth to destroy mankind and there is a nerdy scientist the rich president an army fighter and millions of other people who die in New York and also the DAMN WHITE HOUSE EXPLODES that is how epic this movie is. And also the aliens terrified me when I first saw it and really the scene where the alien uses the scientist to talk by squeezing the scientists neck a and forcing him is SUCH A GREAT ALIEN MOVIE SCENE so haters be quiet watch it again and see if you change your mind cause it's fan flipping tastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!6/10,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Keep telling yourself its only a movie,"Its full of holes,its unrelated to anything logical but its a movie made with the intention of Entertaining People. Happily it wasn't full of technical jargon which could give my brain a hernia.It just got on with the main business-how many people could be killed I watched it on DVD and its now 10 years after.I couldn't help but think of how Blair and Bush would have coped with all this! Now that we have computer games on DVD it looks just like that-a computer game. You could ask a million questions about the plot-like when one of the aliens speaks its in English! The explosions are great-but with major cities being zapped out all over the globe the reality is it would have caused massive Earthquakes and floods to say nothing of a communication breakdown.In other words no single computer would have worked.

"Fireworks and fun, but weak SciFi","This is one of those entertainment-only movies that often gets a black eye for being something it's not. Hard SciFi this isn't, although its still up a few notches from the 50's SciFi movies that are its historical roots.Stereotypical or thin characters are required when you have that many actors involved in scenes, although Jeff Goldblum's character, and that of Judd Hirsh as his Dad are quite good. A director makes a choice on the focus, it could follow one character or group of characters and alter the scale to near human dimensions. Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds comes to mind. But more often, particularly if box office receipts are a major concern, it is SciFi as spectacle, and in that realm, Independence Day works very well indeed.I'm just thankful they didn't include one of those ridiculous scenes where the hero blows up the control panel to open the airlock door. Let's see, design an airlock so when power is removed the door opens and everybody gets sucked into a vacuum. Yeah, that'll work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cringingly Awful film,"The words fail me to describe just how bad this film is. Ok it took over $300 milion at the box office, but that is hardly suprising given that the Hype machine was in top gear months prior to release. And I must admit I was as much a sucker as the next man in being conned by it. Apart from the huge plot holes the character stereotypes and the embarrassing cringeworthy flag waving, what is most annoying is that it could have been so much more. In one scene when entering the Alien Mothership, we see thousands upon thousands of ground troops waiting for invasion. Why couldn't we see any of that. Instead we get Will Smith and Randy Quaid from the acting school of the Inept! Have always had this down as THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER, EVER, EVER SEEN!!!!!

What finally kills them is...well, maybe I should not give that away for those who have not seen it.Independence Day has a more heroic ending, though.

A silly but fun popcorn flick,"Roland Emmerich has never been one of my favorite directors, mostly because he has been making the same type of movie now for about 20 years (not unlike Michael Bay in some respects). Still, he does have a great eye for visuals and can create spectacle like few others out there. INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of his first forays into the ""disaster"" genre, and as a large-scale blockbuster, it largely succeeds. Sure, there isn't a lot of attention paid to character or plot, but it delivers on the action and visuals. The ensemble cast is also great, and each person gets their own moment to shine. At first glance, one might be tempted to compare this to Armageddon, but I think that this film edges it out by a small margin. Both movies have essentially the same story beats, but the emotional arcs in this movie feel more genuine and there isn't a sappy Aerosmith ballad, either. The special effects in this movie are incredible, considering it came out in 1996 and I thought that the alien and spaceship designs were creative and nice to look at. Overall, I think that this movie has had, and will continue to have more staying power than Armageddon, if only because it did it first. Generally speaking, I enjoyed it, and if you're looking for a fun, turn-your-brain-off type of movie, you can't go wrong with this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
July 4th is Independence Day,"Roland Emmerich gives us possibly his best film ever, when an alien race comes to Earth and strategically sets up 15 mile wide saucers, over all the major cities of the world. Their sole reason for being here, is the extinction of the human race. They blow up the cities, we fight back and July 4th becomes a world holiday. In 1996 this film was absolutely incredible. It hasn't lost too much of its luster today, which owes most of that to the modern physical effects, that were available in the 1990s. They still hold-up, even though some of the matting is noticeable, but still quite good for the time-period. There is plenty of excitement, action and comedy moments, that keep the film going. As basic as the story sounds, it actually has some meat to it, when you watch the whole film.It is rare that a film like this has time for character development, but this one actually fleshes some of these characters out. You actually understand how they survive the situation they are in. You understand, that they do have the abilities and the drive to complete what actions they need to do, in order to survive. What made some audiences in 1996 not like the film so much, was the primitive people on this fictional, 1996 planet earth, were a little too lucky. Like your typical disaster film, this film contains a huge cast. It's actually fun trying to name everyone that pops up in this film. Look for a guest appearance by Star Trek TNG alum, Brent Spiner (Lt. Commander Data), as a show stealing ""Mad"" Scientist. I have seen this film many, many times since its release almost 30 years ago and my favorite part will always be when Will Smith's, Captain Steven Hiller, utters the words, ""Welcome to Earth"". To those in the audience watching, that means, ""Enjoy the Movie"", which you will. Too bad the 2016 remake was so bad.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hollywood Budgeted Massive Destruction At Its Finest,"C- Lo and behold, it's the only Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin film I actually care for. I saw it at a young age, and have seen it well over twenty times if not more over my years. If you, especially like me as an aspiring film maker, take a gander over the pair's many productions over the years, you'll realize the actual amount of creativity and talent they have can fit inside of a pin head. Their movies are predictable and serve merely as popcorn movies. As far as revolutionary sci-fi goes, it only qualifies in the category of special effects and nothing more. Of course the ships target the most popular cities first, it's movie's basics. My sole praise is to the obvious that of the extraterrestrial ship and body design. Naturally, my favorite part is the alien autopsy scene, the amount of detail put into the creatures. The film's use of miniatures is appreciated as well.As for the characters, Jeff Goldblum is pretty decent, and Will Smith is the usual gun-ho protagonist. Mary McDonnell and James Duval also star in not too bad of roles. The performances don't bother me; it's just that I'm not emotionally invested in the characters because I know who's going to die and who's not. To truly experience a modern sci-fi achievement, check out ""District 9"", a text book example of a fresh take on aliens, or in my humble opinion Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin's at their finest, if that really say's much but a good ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining,"Sometimes it's hard not liking a movie even though it has so many things to dislike. ""Independence Day"" is one of those movies.I remember when the trailer came out for this movie. It was one of the best trailers i'd seen back then. Simply because it really made med want to see the movie. Everything about it just seemed so cool. And i guess when i saw it at the theater i was not disappointed. It was a fun ride. And seeing it now a couple of years later i may not enjoy it as much as i did, but i can sure understand why i enjoyed it the first time around.Because let's face it. Plausibility is exceptionally low here. Goofs are present in almost every shot. The dialog is a joke, the characters are caricatures and the plot is basically ""War of the worlds"" moved to present day. But still, like a video game that may be stupid but can still entertain this is not so bad. Admittedly though the movie loses most of it's entertainment value as it slows down toward the end. But up until then it's a lot of fun.It feels like most people who disliked this movie did so for rather strange reasons. It seems they expected something completely different from what they got. This is a classic matinée movie about peoples fear of the unknown. A classic genre no matter if the unknown factor is Aliens or Russians or whatever. This movie is not trying to be smart, only entertaining. And while the dosage of dull and pompous American self-pride is a little too high, it still manages to rise above it and entertain most of the time.And when i see a movie like this one i first and foremost want to be entertained. That's why i rate this movie a 6/10 despite it's faults, goofs and general silliness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun movie...,"It's pretty funny to see people rip this movie, even calling it laughingly bad.  It's no classic for sure, but a fun ride with a classic story (ripped from War of the Worlds with some twists).Maybe there's not super character development, but we didn't want to see that, we wanted to see the humans v.s. aliens, and this movie certainly delivers.  It delivers the same kind of rush as movies such as The Matrix.There's some solid performances here from Smith, Goldblum, and Bill Pullman. Anyone expecting straight drama for the whole flick should look somewhere else, but there's many good moments (such as Pullman's speech) that are very well done.  I don't think a comedy scene here and there (funny at that) detracts from that.  There may be cliches, but they are generally well done.I didn't see any obvious plot holes in this movie, there's some incorrect technical details but the main story points are all possible as it's possible a more advanced society would have less knowledge in certain areas than us, and certainly less knowledge of our culture/planet.Go see it and decide for yourself.

Predictable but fun and thrilling and shows what America can do when not twisted by politics,"The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!This is an epic guess at what will happen if aliens want the planet but not the humans. Don't watch it back-to-back with ""The Battle of the Bulge"" as I did because it's basically the same story.The structure has three acts: the problem, the ""descent into Hades,"" and the attempt at a solution.The epic scope centers around several families, from the White House to ""trailer trash"" (headed by an amazing Randy Quaid). That's a bit of a problem for these Hollywood types, as Quaid's drunken crop duster, according to the commentary, represents Everyman: i.e., if you're not a part of Hollywood, New York or Washington, you're scum. Thanks a lot.Though the problem is worldwide the focus has to be somewhere so it's set primarily in the USA. Hey, anyone remember World War I? World War II? Who supports NATO and the UN to protect little free countries whose military budgets are jokes?Will Smith is good as a cocky pilot and Jeff Goldblum shows, again, he's second only to Dan Ackroyd at spouting psuedo-scientific gobbledegook in a way that makes it sound legitimate. I don't know the actor who plays the president but he's an old fighter pilot like George H. W. Bush was against the Axis, and the later George W. Bush was in the Viet Nam era. So, a touch of realism there.What I like best is that, while I like movies that tap into the human spirit, this one taps a vein in the uniquely American spirit. I'm glad I didn't see it when it first came out but waited 27 years, at a time when American instititions right down to the family structure are being systematically destroyed by a cancerous enemy within. As an historian it reminds me of what America always has been: a protector of the weak against the strong, a homeland for those who prefer liberty to tyranny; and it shows what America can be again, where due to Liberty we have significant differences which we lay aside when fighting a common enemy (aside from a few grumps).God bless the USA. It's good to see Old Glory flying proudly again in movies, even if it is often shot facing the wrong way.The music, while not by John Williams, has a suitably John Williams-y feel and does what movie music is supposed to do, dictate what we're supposed to feel just in case the rest of the movie fails to take us there.The movie isn't thoroughly enjoyable but they plugged in a dog in danger in case our hearts are too stony to care for people.

It's the end of the world as we know it...,"""Independence Day"" is one of those blockbusters where we know we're basically in it for the spectacle. Yeah, the writing ain't so hot, the dialogue is silly, and some of the performances are indeed broad, but just how much does that matter when the action is as slick and high-tech and impressive visually as it is in this over the top movie? We know we're in for a fun time right from the start when we get a sense of how enormous that alien mother ship is.The story, for those of us who may not have already seen this, is basically an update of films like ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"" and ""The War of the Worlds"", with state of the art special effects. An alien intelligence hovers giant city-destroying spaceships over Earths' major cities, apparently ready to do some damage, and the human race seemingly can't do much in response. U. S. President Bill Pullman keeps trying to figure out the best options, even as the stakes keep changing. Among our other heroes are a swaggering Will Smith as a macho Air Force pilot and Jeff Goldblum as the nerdy computer expert who finds out how to sneak past the alien defenses.This reviewer will admit that this movie can be very groan-inducing (the whole story with Randy Quaids' character especially), but writer / producer Dean Devlin and writer / director Roland Emmerich serve up all of the major set pieces with flair. ""Independence Day"" may be a very long movie (145 minutes in its theatrical incarnation, 154 minutes in its extended version) but at least it's never boring. It's got a supporting cast just full of familiar faces, and the invading E. T.s are such a loathsome bunch - they're compared to locusts - that one simply can't help but want to see the humans rise up and kick some alien asses.Eventually, they get their chance, and in a development we certainly hope would extend to real life, all the countries of the world are united in their one single purpose. One particularly effective sequence occurs approximately halfway through when an alien specimen is prematurely set up for an autopsy, and the entire sequence aboard the mother ship is a corker as well.Overall, ""Independence Day"" provides ""good"" fun for anybody who'd just like to turn their brains off and enjoy some nonsense escapism.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

He is after all a goof-ball ham. He destroyed Robert Conrad's prideful series reputation of the original 'Wild Wild West' with his purely irreverent mockery of the 'Wild Wild West (1999)'. Robert Conrad personally accepted the Razzie Awards for that despicable turkey of a movie to express his disgust about what was done to his source material by the Prince. Sources seem to differ who has top billing for 'Independance Day', the Prince or Bill Pullman. Even the TV Guides on cable indicate the Prince has top billing so I didn't want to watch the movie. I did finally watch this movie on cable with great apprehension and preparing to barf at another performance by the Prince, but I was not disappointed. The Prince was heavily surrounded with such real talent during the movie that his presence in the movie didn't have a deleterious affect. United States Marine Officers do not swagger down the flight line. They do not whine and have tantrum.

I went to see this wanting to watch great special effects and i got it. I only hope Emmerich and Devlin would hire an actual screenwriter next time they make a movie, The Patriot sucked. ID4 is NOT science fiction. SCI-FI contains some explanation of why things work the way they do, like in 2001. This movie boasts great fx and action sequences. The problem does lie with stereotypical characters. However the scenario of fighting back the apocalypse is something we can all root for.

Good for the genre,"Nowadays, the genre of sci-fi blockbusters is an element of cinema which is best avoided. It is a far cry from Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In 1996, the big hit was Independence Day.Earth is invaded by aliens, who destroy major city after major city. The special effects are terrific at times, particularly the attacks on iconic landmarks such as the White House and the Empire State Building. The actors have fun in their roles, especially Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith as the satellite genius and amazingly talented pilot respectively.Roland Emmerich's film, although great fun, contains several unbearably cheesy moments. One which springs to mind is the President's call for the world to declare July 4 as their independence day. Many of the battle sequences, although visually great, seem unrealistic. The dialogue is also poor for the most part.Watching it now, many of the film's elements seem stereotypical, although it is difficult to tell if this is because of the several similar films since, trying to replicate the success of Independence Day.

an ax to grind,"I've waited a long time to lamb baste this movie in a public forum. I hated this picture. Hated, hated, hated this picture. And everyone I have ever met loves this picture. Loves, loves, loves this picture. There is a very precise and scientific reason for that... Everything everyone knows is wrong! Let's look at this differently. Let's look at the facts here (and I'm going to point out some things that may spoil the movie for you if you have not seen it, but that's ok... You don't want to!):1. The plot is absolutely paper thin. Aliens invade earth (the aliens have no intuition on human culture, but they know what tourist landmarks to hit), and Americans fight them. That's it! Roll credits, and it's over. 2. This movie follows a time worn cliche of event location. If something big happens in an American film, it has to happen in the United states exclusively. not in the Virgin islands, not in Switzerland, not even in Canada... America. And, of course, if there is a problem, the Americans will be the only ones able to solve it. 3. Then, if Americans are going to solve it, it's going to be a band of stereotypes. This includes a rural every guy, the know it all scientist, the president (who flies a jet, no less!), and Will Smith. 4. In a really bad mix of product placement and worn plot device, an Apple computer is used to destroy an entire alien supercomputer... That destroys an entire alien superstructure... That destroys a multi million dollar movie super budget. 5. The aliens are never explained! why do they attack Earth? Who knows, but if it looks groovy, who cares? Absolutely no thought is put into the aliens. The only interesting thing about the aliens, perhaps the whole movie, is that the aliens work in space suits that are aliens in themselves. But once again, it is never explained. And the aliens are the atypical asexual non-clothed bi-pedal beings we have come to expect in sci-fi flicks. 6. The design of the alien hardware follows another worn cliche, of design following that of the decade that a movie is made. In other words, being a 1990's movie, expect lots of chrome (ala Terminator2)and compound curves. The 'mother' ships suffer from 'CG-Itis', a curious aftereffect of over indulgent CGI use. The result is a ship that looks like a pizza pie made out of glitter stucco. 7. Same guy who made this movie made Godzilla (American version...which takes place in America, not japan... see a link here?), and scads of other filmed explosions disguised as movies.And there's much much more. But given all that, people still just eat up this movie. And of course, as the response, Hollywood makes more just like it. In other words, people have turned into sheep with no identity or taste, with Hollywood eager to cater since most of the folks there are interested in film as profit and not art.

"A fun, classic 90's science fiction flick, nothing more.","I just watched this this past July 4th for the first time, and it was just about what I expected, a fun action/alien summer flick. It was fun and dumb, and great to watch with family and friends, as long as you don't expect something like Aliens or Predator.Now to get into the details, the movie is casted perfectly, especially Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith as the stars. The script is well written with some of the best one liners of all times. The story is not particularly original, but not cliché to the point that it is not enjoyable. The acting is good and unlike most science fiction movies now a days (I'm looking at you Michael Bay) the characters are like-able.

More than your summer blockbuster,"Independence Day is often classified with the usual summer blockbuster rubbish, but it does rise above it to better quality. It plays upon some good themes, more than action. It examines the true meanings of relationships we have with other people. There is a drunken father who has lost the respect of his children, mostly his oldest son. There is the ambitious wife who leaves her husband to maintain the growth of her career. True, some stereotypes lurk about, but the film is all about putting aside petty differences and concentrating on what is truly important.

Blockbuster Sci-Fi with overdone comedy and inanities,"Released in 1996, ""Independence Day"" (or ""ID4"") chronicles events as the earth is threatened by malevolent aliens who wipe out entire cities. Bill Pullman plays the US President, Margaret Colin his aid and Mary McDonnell his wife. Will Smith plays a hotshot pilot and Vivica A. Fox his babe. Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, James Duval and Brent Spiner are also on hand.I saw this movie when it was released while on vacation during the height of its hype (incidentally, at the very theater in Aurora, CO, where The Dark Knight Rises Massacre would occur 16 years later). While fun and entertaining as most blockbusters are, it didn't match the hoopla, so I've had mixed feelings about it ever since.On the positive side, the main characters are likable and there's a warmth to their relationships. I also like the feel-good quality of the movie in that it brings the whole world together to face a common enemy, despite our differences. In other words, it's not just Independence Day for America, but for Planet Earth. I also like the tie-in with Area 51, which shows that some thought was put into the script beyond just blowing up iconic buildings and whole cities. The scene where the captured alien utilizes Dr. Brakish Okun's vocal chords to speak is well done. Also, Margaret Colin looks great throughout.What I don't like is the mixture of serious sci-fi with overdone comedy and the numerous ""Yeah, right"" moments. Comedy works with serious sci-fi/adventure/drama/thriller/horror as long as it's not overdone. The Terminator flicks are good examples, even Star Trek. In ""ID4"" too much of the comedy and inanities take you OUT of the story rather than take you IN. The comedic asides seem disjointed from the plot rather than enhancing it.Despite the likable characters and warmth thereof, they too often come off empty and adolescent. The story focuses on the alien threat and human response so there's little character development of value. I enjoy a sci-fi flick even when its fantasy extends into the absurd and far-fetched, so long as there is some payoff -- some message of significance, some portrayal of what might or could possibly be, some character development that draws the viewer into the story and provides some basis for caring about what's happening. There's not enough of this in ""ID4.""That said, there's a lot to enjoy as a shallow sci-fi blockbuster with a likable cast and some thrilling sequences. The key is not taking it too seriously since it doesn't take itself seriously.The film is overlong at 145 minutes and was shot all over the USA with establishing shots from around the world.GRADE: Borderline C+ or B- (5.5/10 Stars)",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Way to Make Money With a Sorry Film,"""Independence Day"" earned more money than any other film in 1996.  In the film, aliens from an unknown planet hover over major parts of the world and finally attack.  Almost everything is destroyed and the few survivors who remain band together to fight the un-welcomed visitors.  Needless to say the special effects and technical aspects of the film are pretty solid, but that does not save the film from being a major disappointment.  The direction and screenplay are near non-existent and the characters are woefully flat and uninteresting.

My long relationship with ID4,"I loved this when it first came out. Then as I got older I realized it was cheesy and hated it. Then in my 30s I watched it again and liked it a lot. I was surprised. Let me break down the evolution of my relationship with this movie. As I'm sure this may be a similar story for some of you.I was 10 when this came out. I was more hyped Than anyone could be. I even tried to go to the sneak preview but didn't realize how packed those were and couldn't get it. I saw the movie, loved it and saw it 3 more times. I had the toys, got it on VHS and loved it. I think this is the first movie that I walked out of and thought that I had just seen something life changing and that my life would never be the same again. Of course that's how movies feel at that age.Then a few years later in my teens when I watched it I saw the cheese that I never before noticed. I felt betrayed. How could something so dear to me have been so bad that I didn't notice? I knew then that I was growing up and was developing taste. Star Wars and Indiana Jones weren't cheesy. ID4 sucked then. I laughed at it from then on. I would only watch it to make fun of it.This year, at 35 my wife wanted to watch it on the 4th. I agreed with the stipulation that I could make fun of it. For some reason the movie was much different this time and felt more like it did in the 90s. The cheese was still there but it was small enough and didn't effect the story. And the stuff that's good is really good. And I really appreciated that stuff more. Maybe because they don't make these kinds of movies anymore (good) is what made it stand out. But I found myself enjoying ID4 and it felt good. This movie that defined at least a summer. This was before the Star Wars prequels so this could dominate my prepubescent mind.Many movies that I grew up on I went back to and they were better than when I was a kid. Like Jaws, Alien, Jurassic Park, T2, Star Wars... All the classics. Because they have more to offer than your little brain can pick up on. And they are a superior level of movie making that you need to know movies to get and be grown up. ID4 doesn't really have that. But it's well done and very effective. It doesn't belong with those movies but it's still good. It's still A level movie making. It just doesn't have the subtext that so many movies had that I went back on. And for a while this was a ding against it. Then I leaned to accept that movies can just be really well done and they don't have themes questioning humanity or something.I think being more mature now I can look at the flaws and ignore them or even laugh at them and keep enjoying the good parts. The cheese is there, there's no doubt about that. But it just didn't feel like it dominated the movie. I guess I could enjoy this not as a perfect movie but as a fun one that's well done. Because the core of it is really good, it's just a few little sparkles on top that aren't. I already have to look past the dumb jokes in The Dark Knight so why not this? It feels good to like ID4 again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good,"20 years ago, I watched the movie for the first time. I was too young to apprehend the true message that the movie delivered. The movie wants to say that how weak and vulnerable people are when facing sth bigger and greater than them. What touched me was that people with different backgrounds united as one to fight the common enemy that wanted to take their lands and their resources. The movie had great visual effects (maybe not so good nowadays but this was made in the 90s) and great storyline. The storyline was good because it was not just about fending the earth, there were some stories about families too. By the way, when I watched the movie for the first time, I felt sorry for human beings. But now, I am not too sure about that.

A classic Sci-Fi blockbuster of summer 1996,"Independence Day (1996) is a classic Sci-Fi blockbuster of summer 1996, it was actually released the year that I was 12 years old and this film become a hit in Slovenia and it was released in movie theater's. This movie is directed by German director Roland Emmerich who also directed Universal Soldier (1992) with Jean-Claude Van Damme my favorite movie that I love to death and it is my first favorite movie of Roland Emmerich! Independence Day is the second favorite film of mine that I love to death from this director! I love this film to death, it is my favorite alien invasion sci-fi action film. The film is rated PG-13 and even with less violence this film still brings been entertaining and very interesting action movie. Of all the 90's action movies that focus more on airplanes are only two movies from the 90's I consider been best: Die Hard 2 and Independence Day I love them to death! This film stars: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia and Randy Quaid.War of the Worlds (2005) remake with Tom Cruise is the only movie that I know about alien invasions and I can say is not as a good as Independence Day. I thought War of the Worlds was kinda boring film and too over long. I do have that movie on Blu-ray disc because of Tom Cruise collection but I still I am bored to death with that movie. This film is the opposite of War of the Worlds and the remake can't beat this classic epic sci-fi action film.Plot: Independence Day is a 1996 science fiction action film that follows the citizens of Earth who band together to repel alien invaders determined to take the world by force.The film was be followed twenty years later in 2016 with the sequel Independence Day: Resurgence. I still have to watch the sequel which I am very excited to see that film. This flick has a great talented cast such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Robert Loggia. The movie has a great practical special effects, heroism and characters that are written easily likable and sure the movie it's over the top sometimes and it doesn't hold up as maybe it did 20 years ago but it still does it's job pretty well and it's without a doubt the best film of Roland Emmerich next to Universal Soldier.The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an extraterrestrial race of unknown origin. Along with the rest of the human population, they launch a last-ditch counterattack on July 4 – the same date as Independence Day in the United States.It has good action, good story, good characters, good mix of computer, models and practical effects which still hold up to this very day. A little trivia, when Bill Pullman gave his speech about how they are going to fight back against the aliens, I think when people saw this in South America that they actually believed Bill Pullman was the President which shows how great his acting was in this film. The scene where it is the aftermath after the attack, and we see the Statue of Liberty destroyed that was a homage to the original Planet of the Apes movie where Charlten Heston finds the Statue of Liberty destroyed.I enjoy a lot of great and funny scenes with Will Smith character when he punches the alien and says ""Welcome to Earth!"" and then grabs the cigar and said, ""Now, that's what I call a close encounter!"" I totally disagree with some people who didn't care for it especially critics, it was way better than that awful ""Skyline"" and the ""War of the Worlds"" remake. In my honest I'm definitely not looking forward to the new sequel that come out, but I am going to gave a shot even tough I hear mainly negative stuff about it.Overall: Independence Day is a good movie to watch on 4th of July the same date that holiday Independence Day is in the United States. 10/10 still is Roland Emmerich best film!Independence Day is a 1996 American science fiction action film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox Starring: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Margaret Colin, Vivica A.

Years later and it's still a retarded piece of crap,"Made in 1996, this was an insult to my intelligence. Even as a young adult, I found this to bee too stupid to be entertaining.Of course, I don't live in Hollywood - wait, I did then...for a few months.However, this movie is so full of American propaganda that it hurt my head to watch it.From beginning to end and everywhere in between, this movie was just a nasty mess.Apart from all the flaws that you read on every other post, this made the USA look so bad in the eyes of other nations that instead of promoting the country to something of a hero, it made the US look like a total mess of self serving, egoistic, glory hungry retards.Why had the President and the US Armed Forces not try to contact any other nation's leaders in trying to overcome the aliens? Because the US leaders, politicians and gatekeepers want to prove to the world that they have the answer and solution to even the most insane and unforeseen problem attacking the world.There have been lots of horrible movies, but this one is definitely in the top 20.I knew the US would save the world and I hated the movie for it. I was really hoping that the aliens would blast the zhit out of the USA, so that the rest of the world could possibly try to negotiate some sort of truce with the aliens.As you can see, Germany or England, Russia or Australia did not attack. And the aliens didn't even think of hovering over Canada - even though it's right close to the USA! What happened there?By this film, they stood idly by, watching everything fall to the floor in flames and it was only the US that was able to do anything.What a load of s__t! Too retarded for somebody who doesn't fall for American machismo...too much Hollywood for Hollywood.What happened to Hollywood? Can't they find any more Bruce Willis clones to make action movies anymore?

Ahhh! Mediocrity!,"When this released three years ago, it opened to massive, formulated hype, much like ""SW: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace"". I saw it that Fourth of July weekend and was taken away by it; it was the ""event"" movie of its time. But, as time has passed, and I've become more discerning in my moviegoing, this film becomes less and less spectacular to me.It has its moments. Will Smith brings the charisma; he almost seems born to play the role (the scene in the desert where he carries the alien proves this.) Jeff Goldblum's is not unlike ""Jurassic Park's"" Ian Malcolm; he's likable, if not wholly interesting. Bill Pullman plays another president of cinematic invention; we could only be fortunate to have such a ballsy commander-in-chief like Whitmore. Judd Hirsch, as the senior Levinson, has the more energetic role in the film. His comic relief is well-timed.The effects, essentially the most remembered part of the film, serve their purpose, but disappoint in some spots (the best they could come up with for an alien is an oozing, octopus- like creature?) Little was done that hasn't been done before (aerial dogfights, large-scale annihilation of major cities, et al.) For me, Vivica Fox was the true eye-candy in the whole film. ;-)Of course, the biggest gripe lies with the story itself. The film plunders elements from other sources (""Star Wars"", ""War of the Worlds"", and Toho B-movies, to name a few.) Had the writing been tighter, and Emmerich and Devlin hadn't relied on stereotypes and cliched jingoistic devices like the President's speech, this merely okay movie could have been great.I'm all for escapist entertainment, but when done like ""ID4"", it can grow tiresome.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"You're gonna hate me for this, reader","Independence Day (1996)3.5/4I can't believe I liked it this much. 'Independence Day', a stupid, cornball end of the world thriller, delivers the goods - and really, really well. Here goes. Roland Emmerich does a good job. There. I said it. By making a statement like that on the internet, I may be on the news. But if I had to choose a good movie that he made, it'd be this one - it's non-stop thrills and keeps you at the edge of your seat. We can't really get around here - it's the direction that makes that. However schlocky this movie really is, everything goes into play here, and I loved it. The actors work hard here too; it's got a great cast to top it all off. I suppose I'll explain why I liked it so much.The movie is about (and what a shocker) aliens who invade Earth; their goal is to completely destroy it. As a result, humans are forced to fight superior technology, while their will to survive is tested. It stars Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, and James Rebhorn.This is a big blockbuster action movie, and makes itself bold and clear. It knows what it is, and keeps it that way. Now, I think parts of this movie are disappointing, like the aliens, and what they look like. They could have looked crazy, but instead they went for the generic stereotype. This reminds me of another reason I liked the movie - it reminded me of old 50's sci-fi B pictures. Like 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', it's over-the-top schlocky and trivial, but ridiculously entertaining. All together a great action movie, and one that I'll sure be remembering for a while, even if it's not a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One Of Emmerich's Best,"Roland Emmerich is a somewhat underrated director. Yes, I know he has had a few flops like 10,000 B.C and Godzilla, and even 2012 to some people, but I think Independence Day is one of his best movies. I'm saying that because it is so good all around. For example, the aliens. It's great how the alien ships are so incredibly huge (15+ miles in diameter). In some alien movies the aliens are in tiny ships and they go so fast that you aren't able to follow them. But Emmerich's version of the aliens is huge and slow, so that isn't a problem here. Anyway, the main aspects, as always. First off, the acting. Not the best. Sure, there were people like Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, and they were pretty good, but some of the people like Miguel and quite a few other small characters it seemed like they had no acting experience whatsoever. None. Zip. But the main characters like Smith, Goldblum, and Pullman made up for it. Mostly. Now the special effects. For a 90's action flick, they were really good. To today's standards, they would not be good at all. But they are amazing for 90's standards. In the 15+ miles across ships, there are so many little lights and openings and such, and that most likely means rooms. So that would mean there are probably 10,000+ rooms, not even counting how many floors there would be. Detail like that is not always something you come by in movies these days. Speaking of the aliens, this movie had some really awesome practical effects for the aliens. That means someone put more than one day of effort into making this, which is always good. The special effects people did a wonderful job in this movie.And now, the writing. I can't say it was the best ever, and it was kind of cheesy, but I am willing to let that slide. Some of the lines were just not needed at all, and if you got rid of all of them, the movie would be about 5 minutes shorter. Things like ""We need to pack up"" isn't needed. It's kind of obvious when there's an alien invasion that could wipe out the entire world, it's kind of obvious. And other times, there were supposed to be awesome punchlines, but they come out flat and bland because the actors couldn't execute them. But really, that's the only thing I really don't like about this movie. Fourth, the characters. I didn't think this was a good idea, but I didn't care that much because it all ends up making sense. There were four different families/groups of people. There were the people in Captain Hiller's (Will Smith) family and group of friends, and also Russell Casse's (Randy Quaid), along with President Whitmore's (Bill Pullman), and David Levinson's (Jeff Goldblum). If there were only 3-4 people in each group, I'd be OK with that. But there were at least 5-10 characters in each group, and that's a lot to bother keeping track of. It just takes away from the movie. And for the fifth, the plot. Some of it is original, and some of it isn't at all. The part that isn't original at all is the fact that a bunch of aliens have come to destroy Earth. You see that in about 85% or higher of alien movies. So nothing new there at all. But the part that is original was how Hiller and Levinson (Smith and Goldblum) took down the alien mother ship. I won't tell you exactly how because I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it involved a lot of awesomeness. And lastly, the cinematography. The way Emmerich decided to display the alien spacecraft coming out of the clouds and pretty much anything that involved the spaceships and the mother-ships was just awesome. There was a definite sense of danger and threat in all of those shots, which was nice as well.Overall, I really liked Independence Day, because it is a great and enjoyable movie that I would watch again anytime. 9/10. And it sure is a lot better than 10,000 B.C and 2012. Anyway, thanks for reading and check out some of my other reviews. See ya!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"this is how films should be - huge, loud and great entertainment","Independence Day is a proper film. It is a truly great cinematic experience and even seventeen years on it's still got it! Sure you can get picky about improbabilities and moan on about it's overt American flag-waving and how this little thing wasn't entirely accurate because of so and so but you know what? Don't. There's nothing wrong with this film that a little suspension of disbelief wouldn't solve. Of course it's largely predictable, yes it's lays on sentimentality like a trowel, so what? It's fabulous and I love it. It's got a great (simple) story, lots of laughs, it says something and is good to look at.This film is BIG and LOUD. It was amazing on a big screen. It's action packed, suspenseful, emotive and it's even got a little re-finding of faith in there as well. It has cute children, good looking men in uniform, a scantily clad beautiful woman, a gorgeous dog, humour; Jewish humour AND Will Smith no less, a comedic hysterical gay guy, ridiculous stereotypes of different races & classic world landmarks together with subtitles just in case the viewer didn't quite get that the pyramids and people dressed for the desert with camels in the background is supposed to be Giza in Cairo, ridiculous English accents that make me giggle every time, tense aerial fight scenes, heroism, politics, patriotism, great sweeping vistas, an uplifting soundtrack and theme music, pretty slick SFX (still), a rousing and uplifting speech about the strength of the human spirit and the world coming together to fight a common foe, weepy bits... hell, it's got Data from Star Trek, it's got a Baldwin and, AND it's got long leggedy aliens. And long leggedy Jeff Goldblum, who's just plain awesome. And the lovely Bill Pullman. And Mary McDonnell.See? Just what you want from a film! Someone called it a popcorn movie, and I think that is entirely correct. It's not trying to be anything other than great blockbuster entertainment and it delivers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining Blockbuster,"Independence Day is fun and fast-paced. In many ways its the perfect Hollywood blockbuster. It involves a battle between good and evil and has a clever mix of action, romance and comedy. The characters are smart, brave and likable. It helps if you have a mental age of about 14 and don't take it too seriously. Overall, the film has a good story, superb production values and some impressive explosions. It has the obligatory, feel good ending and will probably be regarded as a Hollywood classic in twenty years time.Bill Pullman plays a U.S. president who has to deal with a alien invasion. The president was a pilot in the First Gulf War and his war record propelled him to the presidency (sic). The president tries diplomacy but soon discovers that the aliens are hostile. Many cities are destroyed and people die in large numbers. The Earth's military forces initially take a beating, but America finds a way of fighting back. This is mainly down to the nerdy genius of Jeff Goldblum and the bravery of Will Smith, a cocky marine pilot. On the eve of the final battle, President Pullman rallies his troops by giving a speech that recalls the patriotic St. Crispin's Day speech from Shakespeare's Henry V. With no irony whatsoever, Pullman depicts the Brits and the aliens as interchangeable evildoers.There are various romantic sub-plots. Smith is in love with a stripper with a heart of gold (Vivica Fox). Goldblum is still in love with his ex-wife, the president's press secretary (Margaret Colin) The film has excellent scene stealing performances from a large supporting cast, including: Quaid, Judd Hirsch, Mary McDonnell, Robert Loggia and Brent Spiner. This film is very entertaining and mindless fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It shows something almost no movies show nowadays, the better side of human nature, the coming together to take out the larger threat that threatens to destroy them all.

A BRILLIANT SPECTACULAR 90S SCI-FI CLASSIC BACK WHEN FILMS WERE FUN AT THE CINEMA!!!,"Independence day is one of those absolutely incredible movies that is totally a 90s CLASSIC!!! A big budget blockbuster that is Action packed with heart,drama & comedy. I grew up watching & loving this film & always loved WILL SMITH as captain Steven Hiller the mouthy Action Hero, One of Smith's best roles & one of his best movies!!! WILL SMITH owned the 90s & was & is still always a hero of mine. BILL PULLMAN was also great as the president & JEFF GOLDBLUM was funny & great as was the whole cast & the Alien FX are still Amazing even today!!! A real treat of a movie. INDEPENDENCE DAY is a 10/10 spectacular blockbuster movie & makes me Nostalgic just thinking about it!!!
This film along with lots really that impacted me growing up in the Awesome 90s was about big spectacular fun on the big screen, ""ID4"" was a perfect summer blockbuster movie, people had Fun watching it like they did with others excellent 90's Summer flicks ""Men in Black"" & ""The Mummy"" & ""Lost in Space"" & ""Star Gate"" you get the point, not everything like today's social media obsessed world was picked apart & over analysed, films could just be big fun pieces of entertainment & nice escapism!!!
I love these types of films & hold them very close to my movie loving heart.
Times have really changed & for the worse, especially with movies & how they are hated on & totally despised before even being released? Now the hate starts from a simple teaser trailer & it's completely ridiculous!!! No one just enjoys what movies are about anymore.
Anyway Will Smith is my all time favourite actor & childhood hero, Smith in movie's means alot me & i defend most of them, especially these days where everyone hates on 90's movie's & only likes ""Stranger Things"" the world is mental!!!Anyway love ""Independence Day"" & it's one of the greatest summer blockbuster movie's of all time!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

How did they do it so well?,"The concept of aliens coming to Earth and shooting us up for the fun of it is stale and cliched, obviously.

Everything movies like Deep Impact, Armageddon, etc. try hard at but fail, this movie succeeds at with flying colors. Sure, the concept is cliched, but it's executed so well that I don't groan at the stale story, but I feel refreshed that here is a rare movie that can pull of that stale story in a wonderful way. Obviously, the ideas of our major cities being blown up by aliens, being able to outrun explosions, etc. is bad. But the movie is so well executed that it's perfectly okay.

"Special Effects, Will Smith...","and that's it! Blech... what complete patriotic nonsense.

I'm sorry but I needed somewhere to gag while watching this.I will give some leeway by saying that the special effects were very well done - that White House scene was the best of the movie, in my opinion (well, it did get blown up which made me laugh). And, Will Smith did a great job... cliched part but he pulled it off with his timely wit.Otherwise the plot bugged me - so cliched - calm, cool president (a hero already no less) has the perfect idea, irritating Jewish dad and son save the day with their intellect and a Mac laptop (my battery certainly doesn't last that long!) and a man who wouldn't pass a breathaliser test flies his plane up an alien's ass... oh yes, very realistic. And these are just a few choice characters.There were some great lines though... the scene in the alien ship just before it blows up was hilarious.

I didn't like the scene where Will Smith pretends that he didn't know what's happening and then look up and see the big UFO. VERY BIG.

Unbearably ridiculous,"I cannot believe that so much money was spent to create this monster. I watched it last night for the first time (some 10 years after its production).

But such a collection of stereotypes makes authors of pulp-literature blush. The USA saviors of the world; the infamous CIA agent; the Jewish scientist; the scientist who cannot keep contact to reality; the alcoholic Vietnam veteran; the sexy although honest lap dancer; the career woman;the intelligent generous president; the tough black ""hip hop"" soldier; the pure and smiling first lady;... I couldn't help bursting laugh out loud when I saw Will Smith knocking the alien, or looking for his wife and finding her at the first attempt, in the middle of a destroyed city.

One hell of a high-octane action-fest!,"TNT packed entertainment, pure and simple. That is what this movie is. Nothing more nothing less. It was obviously made to show off fancy special effects (which won an Oscar) and give film-goers a fun time at the theaters when it was released in the Summer of 1996. And that's exactly what it did, and still does. The ""wall of fire sequence"" was absolutely stunning and frightening when I saw it in the theater and it still manages to impress.The film is, of course, overly patriotic as the almighty USA saves the day, but seriously what did you expect? Deep thought-out political commentary on how the nations of the world deal with a crisis that could spell doom for the world? If so, that is probably why you were let down. From the very first ads to theatrical release the hype about this movie was kick-ass special effects and explosive action along with a feel good story. That is precisely what this film delivered which is why I don't understand the bashing of it. It was never meant to serious. Also seeing that it grossed over $300 million in the USA and over $500 million abroad making it one of the most successful films of all time, the bashers should just admit it: people like this stuff.

Awesome disaster-action movie,"Independence Day is (in my opinion) one of the two greatest disaster movies ever made, alongside Deep Impact. The movie begins on July 2nd, when an enormous alien space craft is seen passing by the moon. The US military soon detect the anomaly. A series of city-sized craft are released from the mothership, and take up position over many of the world's major cities. Electronics expert David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) decodes an alien signal indicating they are going to attack. He manages to warn President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and flee Washington - just barely escaping the city's destruction. The heat rays in the alien craft obliterate all of the major cities that had craft parked over them - and almost all of their inhabitants. They then begin moving from city to city, intending to exterminate humanity. The survivors must regroup, band together and fight back against the alien invaders.The movie is very exciting, with brilliant tension (especially in the half hour before the cities' destruction - man, is that a breath-holder!). The acting is splendid - especially from Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. The movie is also brilliantly plotted. It has a considerable air of mystery about it, which adds to the delightful experience that watching it is.But the special effects in this movie are INCREDIBLE. Quite honestly, this movie contains among the best - and certainly most real-looking - effects I've ever seen (the only movies I've seen with more real-looking effects being the first two Jurassic Parks).

The only bad thing is that the director got carried away by the success of this movie and went and made a crapfest called the day after tomorrow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Clichéd, But Impressive","This movie was hyped more than the average movie before its release in the big 4th of July season, which has become a big opening event for Hollywood. I'd say this movie managed to live up to its hype.  It had awesome visual effects.  And sure, the plot was full of clichés, but a movie like this needs a few.  I guess the message of the movie is how all people should stick together when it matters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Sometimes, you just want to have fun.","""War of the Worlds"" has a history in America.  Based on an H.G. Wells story, it caused mass hysteria during the depression when first broadcast as an (unannounced) radio play.  The 1953 movie of the same name has long been considered a Science Fiction classic.  ""Independence Day"" is the 1990s, Hollywood version of the same story.  There are no real surprises on this three day journey of technically superior aliens invading and destroying the earth, but the trip is well worth it thanks to a great ensemble cast, terrific special effects, and a quirky script.Will Smith heads the cast as Marine pilot Captain Steve Hiller, a one-liner kind of hero whose goal is to be an astronaut, but he is challenged as the star of the picture by Jeff Goldblum (playing David Levinson), the MIT techo-geek who first realizes the threat of the alien ships.  In a wonderfully woven (and very convenient) plot, their lives entwine with those of the President and a drunken crop-dusting Russell Casse. Judd Hirsh and Harvey Fierstein also shine in supporting roles.But perhaps the special effects are really the star as the aliens rampage and thoroughly destroy Washington DC, New York City, and L.A.  As I said, there are no real surprises, but sometimes you just want to kick back and enjoy a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest science fiction movies ever.,"Independence Day is up there with all of those other great science fiction movies. Incredible special effects are present throughout this spectacular, well-cast movie. Will Smith and Judd Hirsch provide a good mix of comedy throughout the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Appalling in every respect,"Nothing about this dreadful film offers compensation for sitting through what seems like an eternity while watching it. The effects are fine, OK, but absolutely nothing else can possibly be recommended it to anyone with more than a single active brain cell. Avoid this rubbish! The characters are the most clichéd of clichés and no viewer will care one jot about them. No-one involved takes it seriously and hamming saves the day in more than one respect. There have been many comments concerning the saving of the world by the USA - again! - but that is not important. What is important is that a reasonable and possibly exciting storyline has been smothered at birth by incompetent translation. All I could hope for was victory for the aliens then we would surely never have to sit through this Hollywood garbage again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rock Awesome!!,"Ok...First of all, I have been reading some of the reviews on this movie and some of the people need to take a chill pill!! Seriously! This movie is fun, exciting, and hilarious!!Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum work very well together and make the whole movie hilarious!! If you want to watch a movie that will make you feel good and end with some laughs and smiles...watch this one!! Pullman does very well in the role of the President....and I swear everytime he delivers his speech it gives me goosebumps!!I have to say I wish the movie would have involved more countries looking like heroes.But despite this, I absolutely loved it! I watch it every 4th of July!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Awesome!!,"Stupid? Illogical? Unintelligent? Come on, gimme a break! If you  want something intelligent, go watch some Swedish dramas, and quit stamping on the most entertaining movie in years. Some say it has poor plot. Well, so does The Wizard of Oz, and I don't hear anybody complaining about it. The truth is, people don't know how to handle entertaining movies any more. The whole story about aliens invading the Earth and the Earth fighting back even has some elements of a fairytale (brave king=the prez, warrior=Will Smith guy, wizard=Jeff Goldblum guy, evil dragon=alien mother ship and so on). Man, if you can't handle this movie, move away and leave others to enjoy it, as they should.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is a Fun action adventure movie!,"I know that some of the other folks here made some negative comments about this movie... but hey it is a Movie! It does not have to be like reality... it isn't even trying to do so! It is meant to be entertaining and it succeeds!Turn on your suspension of disbelief and enjoy! There are great characters, and even character development (a rarity in action flicks). There are lots of great lines!! There are great funny moments! There are even strong female characters... the women don't just stand there and scream! The the little kid pretending to be shooting aliens while his mom and her BF sleep is great! All the little details like that really make this movie! I love this movie! I hope you do too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
God old fashion alien invasion movie,"This movie wasn't made to raise the bar for all other movies. It was made strickly to entertain, and for the millions that went to see it opening weekend, it did.Considering this was one of the biggest blockbuster of all time i think it proves that some people just want to have fun in a theater. I don't want to see some Academy Award winning movie every weekend. I want to drink my soda, have some popcorn and watch stuff blow up and in the end the US/world comes out on top.I'm disapointed in how many people don't understand this and continue to complain about it's bad acting, which wasn't that bad, Old predictable plot(If you where surprised by that when you saw it, I'm amazed you can type enough to write a bad review), and finally it's attempt and drama(which was a good attempt and at a handful of times worked). Nevermind all that, just have fun, that's why that made this film, and that's why it did so great.If you don't like it then, just sit down and watch face/off and stay away from Vin Desiel movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Randy Quaid to the Rescue!!,"Boys, from the looks of these here comments, you'd think that they were talking about 'Heavon's Gate' or 'Ishtar'...Folks, ID4 is actually a pretty damned good movie for what it is-War of the Worlds mixed with 'Flying Saucers Attack'. It is a clichéd 'Airport'/'Poseidon Adventure' sort of disaster film, with all the stereotypical two-dimensional characters, multi-racial/cultural settings, etc.You see their lives, then Boom! The Squids attack. Nothing more or less. Now I agree-having the Fresh Prince and the guy from the Fly up there in a saucer nuking the Mother Ship isn't exactly outta George Lucas, but it IS pretty damned entertaining jest the same. Personally, most folks I knew who went to see this(only the biggest hit of '96 by far-over 300M at the US box office...)knew all this going in, and enjoyed it.ID4 is NOT a Documentary, yeah we know some race of squids smart enough to make 500 mile wide mother ships and fly across interstellar space aren't about to be Mac compatible, Or suceptible to any sort of computer virus we cook up. Fine! But then, these Squids don't exactly EXIST either folks....Personally I look upon that little computer virus twist as being the same as whatever contraption MaGuyver had conjured outta some toothpaste and popsicle sticks, or the Professor's latest gizmo on Gilligan's Island-impossible, but what the hell? It's Fiction, after all. If it works for the contrivances of the film, that is all is needed. Nothing more.And it worked here, quite well. I enjoyed the ending, seeing the Head Squid look Death in the eyes as the ticker counted down right before the bomb(s) went off in the Mother Ship, I enjoyed both Smith and Goldblum together in their scenes, heck even liked Randy Quaid and Bill Pullman. Judd Hirsch chews the scenery, while many of the others there ARE scenery, it is true.But never mind-it works for me, and who can forget the scenes of all those ships coming in over New York, DC or LA? Not me. Like it or not, those images, and the ones where the Squids really let loose, are going to stay round in film culture for quite some time to come yet.Did I enjoy the movie? Hell yeah! Was it as good as Star Wars? No! Better than most of the Star Trek films? Yup! Would I watch it again or go see a sequel? Yeah I would.Gazzo 2's rating: *** outta ****-good stuff! Works!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A gripping yarn if meaning is ignored?  v1.00,"Emmerich's earlier work, Moon 44 (1990). Low budget visuals but an intelligible story of a clash between two strong industrial groups, the clash happening well away from the legal frameworks on earth. Believable, if scary for a weak male to female. Independence Day (1996) maybe adds extra possible sets of meanings to this.Further, I have a problem with how I interpret possible hidden meaning in this 1996 work. It is earthlings against alien invaders and as an underclass I have occasionally noticed that we are understood by many to be aliens, Klingons, we are often warred against.*Going to other sources to try to amplify my understandings of this can be sense, just I really need to look to biblical sources and I am prone to misunderstand those in a big way. Unfortunately that does not stop me feeling a need to try to interpret in that way.Ancient Hebrew law, that some types of legal penalties should not be permanent for those in the tribes. The Jubilee year. A time of freeing those enslaved. But the biblical histories only note one occurrence of that, and in their later years at that, with a rush to back out and re-enslave those freed.That is a fun thing for underclass to note and write experiences of occasionally as around 1992 to 93 I was noting that sort of thing. By 1996 I was in big trouble again, chained. I assume that other underclass will have had experiences too, freedom then loss of that freedom. For me, Independence Day by Emmerich feels like an expression of how the good among the ancient Hebrew might have felt when the slaves were freed. If that is the case I understand it to totally misunderstand the realities of big babies and other such. It is not an expression of a Klingon view but of an Enterprise view.The weakness of the logic of an earth computer virus on alien machines is obvious to many. But I understand it to likely be intended to be a parallel to one of the main ways that Enterprise culture attacks and forms the underclasses. We are led astray and then mangled badly. This suggests that the underclasses are victims in a war that has always been going on, just the belief systems that have been openly dominant since the eighties have made the result clearer, they are a purer form of natural injustice?The aliens having telepathic control fits what I understand of Enterprise understandings about Klingons, see Wet Hot American Summer. Meantime my Klingons' experiences of Enterprise attacks is of them often being akin to that. To quote Spike in Buffy, such actions by Enterprise or anyone are not without side effects. To me, this telepathic control is not about Klingon reality other than that.Whatever, if I forget about meaning then this is a gripping yarn. Even if it is told by Captain Kirk's side.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch out aliens here come the yanks!,"Spectacular, and pretentious flag waving rubbish.  With America saving the world...again.  To bad the aliens didn't zap Hollywood, then the world wouldn't have to put up with such over blown rubbish like this which was full of American stereo types from central casting, and which was clearly made for acne faced American teenagers, and red necks.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Joe McCarthy who???,"Another triumph! A movie worth watching for two reasons. 1.We are reminded that Americans of African decent will continue to keep us safe.2. Quoting the evil alien when one of the stars asks it what it wants, we find a striking resemblance to Republicans when it says ""we want to consume all the natural resources on Earth without replenishing them. Then of course the evil 'alien' is dispatched in a glorious hail of gun fire.I find this to be hilarious to a point nearly to a point of apoplexy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
