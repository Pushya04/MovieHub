Part II.,"Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned...Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underrated,"My Rating: *** out of ****.I dont understand all the horrible reviews for this film. Sure not a great film, but definitely a good, entertaining movie. I enjoyed it just as much as the first Jurassic Park.The Lost World still contains impressive, eye popping effects. These are just as flawless as the CGI as the first Jurassic Parks. There are more dinosaurs and they all look great. The film contains more action than the first and its all exciting. One scene that stands out is the scene with the Raptors in the fields. I love the way Spielberg shot it.This is not a big acting movie, but its not that bad. Jeff Goldblum is good as Ian Malcolm, but had a little more energy in the first one. Julianne Moore is adequate but looks a bit uncomfortable at times. Vanessa Lee Chester is better than the other kids in the last film. The rest of the acting is adequate.Many people thought this film was redundant of the first. I wouldnt call it redundant but it is a little bit too familiar in areas.  The Lost World takes place in a different area but it is not much different from the first one. However, it is an entertaining movie. The action overshadows the story.The big problem I have with The Lost World is the ending. It doesnt make sense how The T-Rex got loose. Its also a King Kong Rip-Off. Its visually stunning looking, the TREX doesnt look out of place at all. But it was showing CGI instead of doing something with the story. Nevertheless, even with its flaws The Lost World is entertaining and not worthy of its horrible reviews.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pretty Good- Not as Good as Jurassic Park, not as bad as JP3","Okay, the best Jurassic Park is obviously Jurassic Park. It was the most faithful to the fantastic Michael Critchton books, plus it was well done. As a sequel, The Lost World does just fine. Of course, I'm used to seeing horrible sequels all the time. Jeff Goldblum does a good job reprising his role as Ian Malcolm, and the newcomers of Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn do well too. The story is a little unbelievable, though. After recently being replaced by his nephew as CEO of InGen, John Hammond(Richard Attenburough) reveals to Ian Malcolm(Goldblum) a site B: A place where dinosaurs run free. He sends him and his girlfriend, Sarah Harding(Moore), technology expert Eddie Carr(Richard Schiff) and photographer Nick Van Owen(Vaughn) to document the dinosaurs, while the official InGen team, led by Roland Tembo(Pete Postlethwaite), tries to capture the T. Rex and transport it to San Diego. As always, there is many bone-crunching deaths, the Special FX are excellent, but the story and plot fall a a bit short. Overall: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good sequel,"The Lost World is the sequel to the 1993 classic Jurassic Park. Whilst this film is not as good as the original it does stand up well as a sequel. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm has been asked to return to another Island were Dinosaurs have been allowed to live without cages. Malcolm refuses but when he finds out his paleontolagist girlfriend is already there he goes with a team of documentariens to rescue her. However several accidents ensue and they are left stranded on the Island with a second party. The film does not have the all round strength of the first and is far more dependant on thrills and its visual effects this time round. It does however succeed as good entertainment and its better than the third installment in the franchise by quite a bit. The Dino sequences are handled well with the Raptors in the long grass being the highlight of those and quite possibly the entire film. The T-rex features strongly again ( and this time there's two of them) along with a new and nasty little green dinosaur compsagnathus. The acting is'nt Oscar worthy or anything like it but the characters do have some charm and when they are put in danger you care what happens to them which is always a good sign. It does suffer a little from a bloated and anti climatic ending that is funny for about 2 minutes but I wont spoil it for you none the less. I give the Lost World its high rating because it does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain us. So I think its fair we overlook some of its flaws as with any kind of blockbuster sequel they are always there.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Above Average Sequel,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is an above average sequel.  I just saw it for the third time and I will still continue to fight for it.  The script (although containing flaws) is a billion times better than its sequel, Jurassic Park 3.  When I look back at the three times I've seen it (Theater, VHS, DVD) I saw very few flaws in an overall exciting movie.  The biggest flaw is that the ""wonder and amazement"" were at a low level.  This is mainly because we were exposed to it in the first film and it is hard to keep things fresh.  Other than that, this film is one of the better sequels ever. Great action and adventure, (3 of 4 stars)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Jurassic Park II: The Lost Plot,"The first Jurassic Park film worked because it focused on the morality of the entire situation, with the dinosaurs playing a supporting role (though quite a large one, considering the incredible visual effects). Unfortunately, the sequel does not hold true to this formula, and instead has idiotic characters doing inane tasks, all the while showcasing the roaring dinos and, in the end, turning into little more than Godzilla.For a basic plot summary, ""The Lost World"" reveals the existence of another island, not disclosed in the original, where the dinosaurs were originally ""bred"" and now live in their own contained environment. Of course, bloodthirsty, money-hungry poaches are out to destroy the ecological paradise, so Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the only significant character to reprise his role from the original, and girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) are sent in to investigate. As expected, things go awry and a certain key species of the dinosauric terrors ends up a bit close to home for comfort.The trouble with this film is that it has absolutely no semblance of a plot. None whatsoever. Whereas the original really inspired viewers to think about the morality at stake in Dr. Hammond's experiments, this sequel only focuses on the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" at the incredibly life-life dinosaurs to be had by potential viewers. In fact, by the end of the film, the script has devolved into nothing better than King Kong or Godzilla fare.That being said, I will give this film two stars instead of one because, gosh darn it, those dinos ARE pretty impressive! Though a bit of the ""wow"" factor has worn off since the first installment, when the T-Rex roars or the Velociraptors begin preying, the hair on the back of your neck will stand up once again. I honestly don't know if the effects could be any better, even in today's Hollywood.Overall, though, this is a terribly constructed sequel that focuses on all the wrong things. It opened to tremendous hype and made a lot of money initially, but the passage of time has shown it to be quite subpar. I'm amazed that a film directed by a legend such as Steven Spielberg could turn out so vapid.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Epic, wondrous and thrilling:  The Lost World remains the best sequel in the Jurassic Park series.","Steven Spielberg's sequel to his Syfy classic Jurassic Park not only follows the same formula that fuels the fire of the original movie but has a rhythm of it's own to be it's own film. It's a darker, sleeker film this time around with a mean streak that delivers the goods ten fold yet never forgets it's roots as an intelligent thriller with a lot of heart. Jeff Goldblum once again provides the intelligent and dramatic backbone that drives the story forward while Richard Attenborough provides once again the majestic presence that makes this movie meaningful. Throw in a wonderful and strong turn by Julianne Moore and a strong scene stealing turn by the late great Pete Postlethweite and you have a stronger cast of characters than you had with the original.Spielberg brings some of his best bag of tricks to this film as well with some of the most show stopping scenes in the series including a falling Trailer scene that has to be seen to believe and to this day, the most scary raptor attack ever put on film. While there are a few viewers who did not like the climax in San Diego, that climax still packs a fun, mean wallop that neither the two sequels that followed (The horrid Jurassic Park 3 and the so so Jurassic World) have top in their entire films.While Spielberg and his main cast of characters did not return for the next two films in the series, nothing can take away from the sheer fun and excitement that The Lost World gives to the series. You never know, Spielberg could just come back again with his crew to bring the Jurassic Park series back to it's former glory.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Overrated sequel that doesn't work.,"My family and I decided to watch this movie after enjoying the first, and this one was ***awful***. I've seen a lot of movies recently, and this has been one of the worst.We spent the entire two hours laughing at it because of how bad it was.The biggest issue is that this movie is entirely based on stupid self proclaimed ""scientists"" making stupid decisions so they end up in danger.Every few minutes another character makes another choice that defies all logic and then it's ""here we go again...""Don't get me started on the action scenes. There was one particular scene where a character was hanging off of a roof with one hand whilst throwing tiles from the roof onto a raptor down below with the other hand. The hell are roof tiles gonna do to a velociraptor? There was another raptor on the roof with her.... Oh, and she made it out alive.That's because all of the main characters in this film keep surviving against all odds despite the awful decisions they make.Honestly, you want them to die by the end of the film.Don't give in to the stupidity of this movie. Don't waste two hours of your life on this rotten excuse for a sequel.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Jurassic Park III was better than this,"A lot of people love to criticize JP3 for a number of reasons, like repeating the last movie or hyping up the Spinosaur so much but in my personal opinion, I think JP3 captures that ""theme park movie"" feel much better than The Lost World does.For one thing, this is a much darker film. I don't just mean how most of the movie takes place at night, but the while the body-count in the original was merely implied, we never really got to see the carnage - in fact, I think there were only three people we saw dying on screen, and not only that, but there were only four confirmed kills in the whole movie. Meanwhile there are dozens of people slaughtered in this film quite explicitly - not necessarily bloody, but it's quite obvious those guys didn't make it. The deaths in the original film, when they did happen on-screen, were relatively quick and didn't linger; meanwhile, some of the deaths in this film are rather drawn-out and even taunt the viewer with the possibility that the character might actually make it, only for them to die horribly. There's also the aspect of the ""cold corporate greed"" which reduces John Hammond to a bit part, and makes InGen far more villainous than Dennis Nedry could ever dream of being. I suppose there is some conservationist argument that could be made that makes so many of the victims supposedly less sympathetic, but outside of like one guy who faces a very ironic fate, most of them just struck me as guys doing a job and most certainly didn't deserve their fates.Then there's a couple of really gaping plot holes without any good explanation for them that really strike as deliberately done just so the plot could proceed in a specific way, such as a character who gets a whole establishing scene to show us he knows his profession, ignoring a pretty massive Chekhov's gun - and you can't even just pretend he missed it, because he's the one who draws attention to it! So after a lot of plot contrivances and characters acting like idiots, the only scene I actually liked in the whole film was the animal control department vehicle speeding away from the scene, which is still funny to this day. A glimmer light in this terribly mediocre sequel, I suppose.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A decent sequel!!,"Jurassic Park: The lost world is a science fiction action adventure movie directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Late Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, Vince Vaughn and Vanessa Lee Chester.This movie is second movie in Jurassic Park Franchise.After watching the first movie I was quite excited and hopeful towards this movie but was quite disappointed after reading the reviews but after watching this movie I must say that instead of going after reviews you should watch the movie first and judge because for me the movie is made decently.The plot of the movie is different from the previous one and has a decent execution. The best part of the movie is that you don't have to wait for long to see the dinosaurs as they are introduced quite early in comparison to it's first part.Acting is great and all the characters had done a decent job. Screenplay of the movie is good but it starts getting bore and slow in between but tightens the grip as the movie approaches to it's climax.VFX and cinematography is good and climax is also good although could've been little shorter and crispier. Background music is decent.This movie stands nowhere in the comparison of it's first part but still the movie has enough ingredients to keep you entertained. Watch it yourself to judge the movie. It's a decent one time watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Charmless,"If you want to see a bunch of humans eaten and mauled by Dinosaurs than this is the movie for you.Steven Spielberg and Dinosaurs so what could go wrong. A lot it seems. When we watch a movie like this, the first thing we demand from the film is people behaving logically. Movies like this go off the rails when people start to do dumb things in deadly serious situations. Hitchcock knew this, his characters are put into similarly intense situations and always act accordingly. They get frightened when the moment calls for it and they immediately try to save their own skin when things get really tough.The second thing we want from a movie like this is the good guys have a fighting chance and even the misguided guys have a fighting chance, This movie in delights in killing off people it deems deserve to die, and even a few who don't, as if to show the Dinosaurs like storms or natural disasters do not care who is good or who is bad. And the humans just have no chance to fight back, we wait for the moment when they do, but it doesn't happen because its not suppose to happen.The worst aspect of this film is that humans always seem to be stopped from fighting back against the Dinosaurs, it's OK for the Dinosaurs to kill the humans because -hey they shouldn't mess with them. But Spielberg seems to be adamant that there should be no pleasure taken in humans killing Dinosaurs no matter how many people they kill. So the movie basically turns into a rather unpleasant kill fest.As for Spielberg; The master seems a little off form here, i would say he is uninspired by the lousy script, but he does give the cinematic world two great scenes. One where our 3 heroes must escape a trailer that us being pushed off a cliff by the dinosaurs in the middle of a rain storm. One of the best things he has ever done. And the spectacle of T-Rex running wild through modern day San Diego.There is a weird cruelty that runs through this movie, which is strange for a Spielberg movie and strange just for any movie that hopes to be popular entertainment. Which is best observed by the death of one of the few likable and pragmatic characters in the movie: Eddie Carr. Who dies while he is heroically trying to rescue the three people in the trailer. His death casts a pall over the movie. This is the problem with this film, its lack of heart and the human touch. Watching people murdered by Dinosaurs isn't really as much fun as it sounds. humans fighting back against dinosaurs and winning would have been more interesting but somebody took the bullets out of the guns, and fun out of this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Defending an Underrated Sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park,"I still don't get the hate for The Lost World: Jurassic Park and the love for Jurassic Park III? Can Someone explain to me why is III in your opinion so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park is? In my opinion III lacks on the story and is not terrible because Steven Spielberg did not Direct the movie but it is terrible because the whole movie makes no damn sense it is too short, it lacks on the story and is really awful to me. It has no character development in III at all and lying to Dr. Grant and trick him on that island is just inhuman and awful. And Why is Jurassic World so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park? I am sorry is not better than the second movie. In my opinion is not, but is at least better than Jurassic Lark III is but is not any better over The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997).An Underrated classic sequel in the series and the last movie directed by Steven Spielberg. I have enjoyed this movie much better than Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World. The movie is very bashed and criticized by their fans of the first film. Just like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom this is the sequel that is very bashed from critics and fans again. This is the first and unfortunately last great sequel to the original Jurassic Park. I think Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore did a good job on there performances. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is like Godzilla T-Rex in San Diego. I still love This movie a very underrated science fiction/action sequel film in The Jurassic Park entry franchise. I think for it's sequel it had a good start running. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is loosely based on Michael Crichton's 1995 novel The Lost World.The film won 1 award for Best Effects and Visual Effects.Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it:The daughter of Ian is black in here,which makes to me no sense since Ian is white.Vince Vaughn was unnecessary to cast him and unneeded. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn,this is a science fiction/Action film not a comedy Vince get this in your head!Vince stole Roland Tembo bullets for his shot gun and with that action Vince jeopardized and put whole people in the camp in the mortal danger and T-Rex come after them and eat bunch of people cause of him. Roland could shot the T-Rex and save people and because of Vince's action he couldn't. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn for this. I am glad he was cut by the end of the film.Peter Stormare/Compys sequences from swarm of Compsognathus knock him and killing him were really unnecessary and unneeded etc.), plus it has a sluggish pace and such.Baby T-Rex in this movie was extremely annoying and his yelling in the trailer and in the car it annoyed me so much and on end of the movie.Thing's I love in this movie: T-Rex dinosaur in a city San Diego, the chase and eating people in the city are awesome. Ian and Sarah drive to the amphitheater harbor and pick up the infant. They make sure they bait the creature with its infant and drive back to the docks and place the infant in the cargo hold of the ship.Sarah prepares a sedative dart and shoots the T. Rex as Malcolm closes the cargo hold door, trapping the animals inside. Awesome!Surviving hunters travel through an open field of tall grass. Ajay tries to warn them, shouting ""DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!"" but none of them listens and are killed one by one by Velociraptors.Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo as famous animal hunter was awesome, I seriously I love the actor and his character, He came to Isla Sorna along with his hunting partner, Ajay Sidhu, in hopes of gaining the ultimate trophy and not for the money a male T. Rex.He survived in this movie. A shame a good actor Pete Postlethwaite died 4.years ago and he is not with us anymore.Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1993) and Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding did a good job on there performances.Returning of John Hammond his nephews Tim and Lex the same actors from Jurassic park (1993). Tim and Lex had a brief cameo but John did had a cameo on the end of the movie.Daughter Kelly to do some a gymnastics and kick a little raptor trough the window was really a bad ass awesome.Cgi and the film effects wasn't that bad either they were really good.John Williams did return as music composer and he did return with his theme music score. Like its predecessor, The Lost World: Jurassic Park was scored by famed composer John Williams (a longtime collaborator with director Steven Spielberg).John Williams didn't write a stereotypical sequel score, but instead developed a wildly different style for the different location, cast, and darker tone of the second Jurassic Park film.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American science fiction adventure film. It is the second installment in the Jurassic Park film series. A sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park.I love Jurassic Park (1993) as everyone do but I also love The Lost World: Jurassic Park.

I like it,"I saw this in a theater in 1997 and I thought I liked it.  I just saw it again on DVD last night, and I now I know I do.  What I can't figure out is why so many people think it's so horrible.   After seeing JP III a few weeks ago, I still think The Lost World is better.  Of course the original is the best, but The Lost World is packed with suspense, witty dialogue (especially Goldblum's), and of course, the usual great looking dinosaurs.  There are a few things I don't like, the gymnastics routine towards the end being at the top of the list.  But other than that and a few silly lines, this movie is almost as thrilling as the first.  Personally, I don't care if the plot of this one is weak.  I've never even really given that any thought.  The first 100 minutes or so are loaded with excitement, then the finale with the T-Rex in the city is, if you ask me, played mostly for laughs. Yes it's like Godzilla, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, but that's the point.  It's like those movies but with 21st century (almost) special effects.  And it's just plain fun to see this dinosaur stomping through the suburbs, drinking from a swimming pool and, wreaking havoc at gas station minimart.  I think if you don't take the San Diego scenes too seriously, and look at it as Spielberg's way of paying homage to *and* poking fun at the Godzilla-type movies, you can appreciate this portion of the movie. Then to wrap it all up with Bernard Shaw from CNN, and an obvious open door to a sequel - what more could you ask for?  Well, maybe a better plot as some people seem to be saying, but I think this is a great popcorn movie and it works for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An underrated sequel,"I grew up watching the first two Jurassic Park movies and I was crazy about dinosaurs as a kid and I used to have lots and lots of dinosaur toys. The first Jurassic Park movie is a classic and is up there as one of Steven Spielberg's best who also one of my favourite directors.But what I can't understand is why a lot of people didn't like The Lost World - Jurassic Park. I mean sure it may not be as good as the first one and it has flaws and plot holes and some cheesy dialogue. But I mean even the first movie had flaws, plot holes and cheesy dialogue as well. But I think The Lost World deserves more credit because it has more characters, more action and more dinosaurs. And I also thought Jeff Goldblum did just as good a job as the main protagonist as Sam Neill did.I also can't believe that this movie was nominated for multiple Razzies including Worst Screenplay and Worst Sequel.

One of Spielberg's Weakest,"I don't hate this movie, don't get me wrong. It still holds some of the magic that this franchise offers. But, I will admit, this wasn't Spielberg's best effort. He and sequels don't seem to get along very well, why? Wouldn't it seem he could make a good sequel if he does so well on the original? Well, he didn't. The choices he made for the film are strange. In the first film we are in a park for the vast majority of it. In this it's in a city? I like the gutsy choice, and the massive chance to use special effects, and he actually does a good job. It doesn't feel fake, but its just the execution that doesn't work. And is it me or does the casting for these fluctuate so much? Why isn't Sam Neill in this, what happened to his character? Obviously he's alive because he appears in the third film. What, did he take a vacation? This is never explained. And we are left with Jeff um uh uh Goldblum. And instead of Dr. Sattler, we get a very young Julianne Moore. And the black girl, was totally useless. As a whole the characters seem to change out so much, its mindboggling.

"Perhaps if it didn't follow such a masterpiece, it wouldn't have been such a let-down.","There are moments, as brief as they may be, of genuine entertainment in 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)'. Flashes of the creative brilliance behind the lens occasionally seep onto the screen, and it is in these sequences that the picture finds its footing as an incredibly inconsistent, at times confusingly so, follow-up to one of cinema's greatest achievements. It does manage to make its own mark on the genre and even deconstruct the formula that would go on to form the basis of every entry in the franchise - including itself, despite its best efforts - while also never even remotely reaching the heights of its predecessor. In-between its select moments of true suspense, frustratingly frenzied action and generally enjoyable moments centred around dinosaur danger is an uneven and, at times, dull film full of bizarre plot-points and an unnecessary third-act that straight-up shatters all credibility (or perhaps even good-will) built up before it. It's all done with the right intentions, though. This, along with its continued technical prowess, actually makes the final result all the more disappointing. Perhaps if it didn't follow such a masterpiece, it wouldn't have been such a let-down. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"a worthy sequel with excellent visuals, but a somewhat underdeveloped storyline","The first film, ""Jurassic Park"" was an enormous commercial, and fairly good critical success worldwide. And it is of no surprise to cinema-goers such as myself that a sequel would be released sooner or later, whether or not original novel author Michael Crichton wrote it in paper form first. I myself have read Crichton's novel, upon which this film was based. And I have, of course, seen the film numerous times. When I was young, this was my favorite out all three films because it had the most dinosaurs and elaborate sequences in it. Now I consider it second-best. And I do have to criticize it for a few flaws, which unfortunately, for it, are very important in a good film. However, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" does pull itself off as a fairly good film for what it was meant to be: an elaborate and heart-pounding action thriller. And it does just that.The dinosaurs in the film are just as good, if not better, than the animals from the first film. They couldn't look any more realistic. They move fluid-like, behave like real animals, react like them, and although we have no idea what a real dinosaur behaved, the creatures on the film react just the way we want them to. They're dangerous, unpredictable creatures with a taste for human flesh. The combination of computer graphics and animatronics were perfect. Nobody can complain about the visuals. What they can, and what I can complain about, is the characterization.That is the major weakness of the film. While the dinosaurs are colorful and creative, our cast of characters and development of the plot is not so high and wonderful. It is in fact a good thing that we cut quickly through the first part of the movie to get right to the island so that the dinosaurs could start to appear and cause panic, as they were intended to do so. Because the way they story starts out, and introduces our characters, it's in need of major improvement. Many characters exist just to exist. They have no real traits or characteristics to make them instantly recognizable or even worthy of remembrance by the audience. Characters come and go, some survive the encounters with dinosaurs on the island, but are never seen again after they return to civilization. Even when they are of some great importance, or intended importance, during the first two-thirds of the film.However, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" succeeds entirely with its action sequences, which couldn't be better. And that's what really works out in a film like this. We want to be thrilled. And the film does exactly that. Once the action started to get going, I didn't even think about critiquing the film until it was over. Steven Spielberg has a natural talent for visualizing complex and heart-pounding thrills that we see in this film, and the first ""Jurassic Park"". The Velociraptor sequence in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a particular favorite of mine. The only thing it was lacking was the realization of the intelligence of the raptors, as was demonstrated in the first film, and third one. The Tyrannosaurs, however, are the main dinosaurs and get the most screen time and have the most impact, especially when we come to a climax which almost seemed natural and is most definitely traditional. Really, the dinosaurs are the cast of the film. And that's okay.The summarize it all up, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is not a perfect film. It could have very much dealt with a few revisions to the screenplay to make our characters and storyline more in-depth and colorful. It would have made our amazing action sequences even more powerful and thrilling and thus, an even better film. But the way it is, it's a worthy sequel. Another fine film by Steven Spielberg.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Plus we have cameo appearances from the kids from the first movie, which is pretty cool. Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore are the stars here, and they were both amazing. A lot of people dislike the San Diego scene, but I felt like it added something new and different that we have yet to see in any other Jurassic Park movie to date.

Makes JP3 look like Oscar winning stuff.,"After the massive success of Jurassic Park, it was pretty clear that a sequel wouldn't be 65 million years in the making; but just because it had less time to evolve doesn't excuse the fact that The Lost World is a sloppy piece of movie-making.Jeff Goldblum returns as eccentric mathematician Ian Malcolm, who travels to dinosaur infested island 'site B' to rescue his researcher girlfriend Sarah Harding (no, not the one from Girls Aloud, but rather the lovely Julianne Moore) who has gone to study the scientifically engineered prehistoric creatures not quite appreciating the dangers she will face.What follows is often spectacular, and sometimes downright brilliant (best bit: Moore falling on to the slowly cracking windshield of a truck suspended hundreds of feet above jagged rocks), but any flashes of genius from director Steven Spielberg are easily negated by some of the dumbest plot developments and unintentionally funny bits it has been my displeasure to witness in a big-budget blockbuster.For starters, there is Malcolm's (African-American?!?!) daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), who stows on board her father's high tech truck in order to lend the film some kiddy appeal. She provides the film with its most ridiculous moment when she puts her gymnastic skills (conveniently mentioned early on in the film to set up this particular scene) into practise by swinging on some makeshift uneven bars and dismounting with enough force to kick a velociraptor to its death.And she's almost as dreadful in the part where good old T-Rex sticks its huge head into her tent, and she wakes up to ask 'What is that?'. Take a wild guess, sweetie!Then there's the gob-smackingly silly scene where one character is so scared of the snake that slithers into his shirt that he'd rather leave the safety of a cave and be eaten by the dinosaur that has been waiting outside. And let's not forget the fact that a captured T-Rex manages to escape from its cage on a boat, eat everyone on board, and then get trapped back in the hold. Or the daft ending, which has Malcolm and Harding lure the king of the tyrant lizards, fresh from a Godzilla style rampage, back into captivity by using its baby as bait.With all this unintentional hilarity, The Lost World can only be seen as a major disappointment, but I suppose we should at least be grateful that there wasn't a nuclear-blast proof fridge in the film, 'cos that would be really stupid!",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cliched & Borders On Boring,"Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come Jurassic Park: The Lost WorldI think this movie is the worst type of sequel. A Box Office sequel. The whole site B idea is awful. We seen eggs hatch and all the Dino DNA on the island in the first one. Lazy. Lazy. Lazy. And, because it doesn't offer anything new or innovative, it seems rather familiar and almost boring.It does have some cool bits. The image of the trail of the raptors approaching the survivors in the field looks great. The trailer over the cliff sequence looked good and was intense when Moore was on the glass, but over all it made little sense and was just one of the movies many action sequences.The human character are as cardboard as they come, and are scripted to do stupid things (than nobody would ever do in this situation) so the dinosaurs can chase and eat them.An awful lot of it is set at night!! The night scenes allow Spielberg to use his most familiar visual trademark, the visible beams from powerful flashlights. Another Spielberg trademark is the absent Dad (this time played by Goldblum) Even a press conference announcing a dinosaur park is held at night.The Lost World was the third highest grossing movie of 1997. Only Men In Black and Titanic grossed more than its $229 million domestic haul.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Least Of The Three, But That's Not All Bad","Of the three Jurassic Park films, this was the only one I thought didn't match up to the others, but that's just my opinion. It was still entertaining and offered the normal amounts of thrills and amazing special effects.The dinosaurs are so life-like that they are always fascinating to watch. The baby T-Rex is particularly realistic in this adventure story, as are the little bird-like creatures. The story was so-so. I think a better ending would have been a shot of the big reptile in front of the San Diego skyline, which could set up the sequel of the beast loose in a big city, but the ending was still okay....just could have been better.Also, there was too much action in here. Some - not a lot - should have been cut out. At a little over two hours, the film can wear you out. Despite the above remarks, it's still a fun-scary-tense thriller and the DTS sound is superb. In fact, this is one of the best-sounding DVDs I own, and that helps make the film enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could this be one of the worst movies ever?,"I saw LOST WORLD on TV and couldn't believe what a mess this movie was. The film is like a chicken with its head cut-off, running in every direction. LOST WORLD simply doesn't know what it wants to be. I didn't care much for JURASSIC PARK (the whole concept of dinosaurs at a PARK is silly!) but at least it had a semblance of a storyline. No such thing in LOST WORLD. It's scatter-shot and at times weirdly incomprehensible.There are two things that stood out after watching this ""film.""The first thing is that Spielberg was obviously obsessed with the idea of having the CGI fx to appear as seamless as possible. It's very difficult to create special effects were the CGI dinos can be seen sharing screen time with other objects. If you watch JP, most of the CGI created dinosaurs are unobstructed by any object in the foreground. Well, not in LW. Practically every scene where there's a dinosaur, there are people or a jeep or trees or building or gas station moving in front of the CGI creatures. It's to a point where it becomes ridiculous. It creates a very monotonous and repetitious look and feel to the special effect. The effects (and dinosaurs) suddenly become bland. They fade TOO much in the background.The other technique Spielberg was obsessed with in LW was having several people talking at the same time. Almost every scene when/where there's acting, there are two or three conversations going on at the same time. It's REALLY irritating! And by doing this, by muddling the dialogue in such a way, it's obvious Spielberg was BORED with the characters, the screenplay, the ENTIRE project.Except for those two obsessive points, the direction is amazingly lackadaisical. The terrible screenplay is all over the map. There are no interesting characters. Julianne Moore is totally miscast. And her acting abilities are terrible in LW. The sets look fake. The idea of the mother dinosaur looking for her baby in San Diego is like GORGO. The in-joke of showing Asians screaming and running away from the rampaging Tyrannosaurus is unfunny.But the worst part of this terrible movie is the action. The scene when the Winnebago/laboratory hangs over the cliff is probably the MOST over-directed scene in movie history. It is stretched to point of ridiculousness. And when the little girl jumps on the pipes and does these gymnastic moves and kicks the raptor through a window, my jaw was on the floor. What were they thinking?!?! This scene is the dumbest scene since, well, GYMKATA, which is one of the best ""it's so bad it's good"" films ever made. It's funny to think that a Spielberg movie has something in common with GYMKATA. And the action scenes with Julianne Moore, watching her tumbling out of windows and falling on the ground are so unconvincing and badly directed that it's unintentionally hilarious. When they run to the helicopter, there's NO suspense or relief. We're just watching them run to the helicopter in a cheap looking movie set.But the piece de resistance is the whole rampaging through San Diego moment, which works like a Road Runner cartoon: the T-Rex is looking for her baby, which is held by Jeff and Julianne and who were on the ship when the T-Rex made its appearance after the boat crashed at the docks (another excessively directed scene). Well the angry dinosaur causes a lot of death & destruction as it follows the two all over San Diego, who, eventually, end up going back to the ship anyway. What was the point of this whole moment? Just the novelty of having a dinosaur running around a big city?THE LOST WORLD is REALLY bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Awful script, unlikely story, nice cinematic Spielberg visuals","Spielberg knows how to frame a shot and make things look good. But he obviously doesn't have a clue about what makes a good script, and good dialogue. Either that or he had no control over the story and script.I recently watched this for the first time (in 2018), and I was expecting a lot better. I then watched Jurassic World and while better, it too suffered from low quality generic themes and unintelligent script.The lines uttered by every character in this movie, are lacking substance, static and wooden, boring, lifeless, generic and uninspired. How do writers get the job? I don't understand how this screenplay made it to production.The story is typical of a bad sequel. Forced, over-produced, packaged, and dull.Again, it's disappointing to see the pile of fake reviews on this site. It appears the marketing teams behind this franchise arrange for good reviews to flood the internet in the hopes of selling more tickets or DVD rentals or video games.

Good followup to Jurassic Park.,"The Lost World is basically a big-budget monster movie of the sort that has been popular ever since the dawn of motion pictures. Unfortunately, like many entries into the genre, it falls into expected patterns. As a result, much of this movie seems like a retread of Jurassic Park (with a little King Kong thrown in at the end), not because director Steven Spielberg is intentionally copying himself, but because there's really not much more that he can do with the premise. If there's a third movie in the series, it will probably follow pretty much the same storyline as the first and second installments. The Lost World boasts several edge-of-the-seat moments. The dinosaurs aren't nearly as awe-inspiring, but they remain formidable adversaries for a group of plucky, overmatched humans. The standout sequence in this film features two T-Rexs, a lot of rain, spiderweb fissures in glass, and a literal cliffhanger. The ending, which takes place in San Diego rather than on a tropical island (where most of the film transpires), is a little anticlimactic.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Excellent Sequel,"Creating a worthy follow-up to a major blockbuster is no easy task. But if all the pieces are in the right place, it is not impossible. Four years after the enormous success of Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg took control of the director's chair once more in an effort to enhance the franchise and add on to his already spectacular legacy. Did he succeed? In the eyes of most critics, no. However, I applaud Mr. Spielberg for an admirable effort and creating another crowd-pleaser, even if it didn't match up to the high expectations.On another personal note, I was very happy to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm as he has always been my favorite character in the series. Since Malcolm is now more aware of the dangers of John Hammond's activities, his personality is less goofy and more serious this time around compared to his previous adventure.It took several viewings for me to appreciate this film to its fullest. At first, it seemed weak because it sacrificed the philosophical messages that helped make the first film great to fit in more action. The philosophy is found in one of the key quotes by John Hammond. ""Life will find a way."" There *is* a point to all the chaos because it is all caused by the humans and their relentless desire to interfere with nature. Every tragic event seen in the film could have been avoided with sensibility and that is the message that is echoed throughout the entire series. Don't attempt to control the uncontrollable.If there's one thing that makes the film worth watching, it has to be the special effects and the dinosaur animatronics. The infant T-Rex featured in this film is so lifelike that I often had to remind myself that it wasn't a real dinosaur. It was *that* convincing.Also be on the lookout for Vince Vaughn (before he became the mega-star that he is today) as one of Hammond's researchers and a humorous scene involving a T-Rex in the modern world.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Extremely bland characters including the lead character results in being less invested in the overall story and plot conclusion,"Just a narrowly acceptable sequel in my opinion. I've been putting off watching the film's entirety for a long while and now here's my take. The concept is original and continues on the sci-fi action adventure plot from the first, but the characters are outrageously bland, particularly Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm. He was sardonic yet also charismatic in the first Jurassic Park. It's crazy how his character is written as a shadow of his former self and left as a two-dimensional character that we could care less about, especially being that he's the LEAD CHARACTER. Same sentiment with the other supporting characters. A positive aspect is the continued stellar visual effects (practical and CGI) realistically bringing forth the dinosaurs on-screen.I think this is a by-the-numbers, appallingly unexciting sequel (largely due to the superficial characters and the anticlimactic final act) to the OG Jurassic Park classic. And I'm probably one of the few when I say I hugely favor the later sequel Jurassic Park III (2001) with Sam Neill as the lead than this disappointing, yawn-inducing second entry in the Jurassic Park trilogy.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

mommy's very angry,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp from the novel written by Michael Crichton. It stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard and Harvey Jason. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kamiński.Four years on from the horrors of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, it transpires that there is a second dinosaur site on Isla Sornar. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) is forced to head off to face the horrors once again when he learns that his paleontologist girlfriend, Sara Harding (Moore), is already on the island as a forerunner to a team John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is assembling to document the dinosaurs in their habitat. Once their, though, the problems soon arise, especially when a team from InGen arrive with other ideas about the dinosaurs on their minds...Given the massive success of Jurassic Park in 1993, a sequel was inevitable. What transpires is pretty much more of the same, it's very safe film making by Spielberg. Coming off of the emotional exertions of his last film, Schindler's List, few can deny that the director was entitled to wind down with The Lost World project, there was after all nothing safe about Schindler's, but although Jurassic 2 is a hugely enjoyable family blockbuster, a jazzy bit of hi-tech fun, it lacks the requisite brains to make it an inspiring sequel.Formula follows the same path, humans in peril on the island, with some added and new dinosaurs (double T-Rex a bonus), and then the ""twist"" in the narrative sees some monster peril come to San Diego, King Kong style, for the finale. There's inter fighting between the good dudes led by Malcolm and the bad guys led by the weasely Peter Ludlow (Howard) who is Hammond's conniving nephew and current head of InGen. Family issues also feature, of course since this is Spielberg after all, while the dangers of tampering with science message remains as strong as ever.Cast are ably led by a witty Goldblum, who is a reassuring presence carried over from the first film, and the tech-credits are as expected, very high. Some scenes soar, such as a sequence shot from under a pane of glass that starts to crack under the weight of a character, others not so, such as having Malcolm's teenage daughter turn into Nadia Comăneci for one credulity stretching scene. But all told it's an honest blockbuster purely aimed at the target audience who helped to see it make over $600 million in profit. Safe often pays you see, and as sequels go it's one of the better ones in the 90s. It's exciting if intellectually stunted.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It was the scene where Sarah and Roland discuss the blood on her jacket from the baby T-Rex.

But neither of them mentions that maybe it would be a good idea to expose of the jacket!!!!!??? Even after Sarah has talked about the excellent olfactory senses of the T-Rex and that it might follow them!!!

Still a good movie,This is still a good movie however the low ratings come from the fact that its story is not believable. The prequel was and is a very fictional but the way it was done and the way the story was presented for the viewers it made an impression of something tangible.

Solid action-adventure film,"""It always starts like this... ooh, ahhh. Then there's running... and screaming.""- Dr. Ian MalcolmWhile in ""Jurassic Park"" both the 'ooh, ahh' parts and the 'running... and screaming' parts were equally enthralling and captivating, it's mainly the running and screaming that's of interest here. Outside of the opening sequence much of the early section of the film just isn't very interesting.The strength of this franchise as a whole is its setting. The creepy, slightly spooky and weird islands with plenty of rain provide a perfect setting for some inventive dinosaur attacks and dramatic tension. This is why taking the dinosaurs off that island and into civilization was a mistake- it's too familiar. It loses the spookiness and distinctive feel of the 'Lost World' fiction sub-genre and ends up feeling cheap and silly. I'd say that from about thirty minutes in until the last thirty minutes this film is on par with the first installment in terms of pacing, characterization, and dialogue... then it deteriorates. The film never gets bad enough for it to be unwatchable but there are mediocre parts here in addition to the exciting parts.The characters are solid as well as the cast. Dr. Alan Grant is sorely missed, but Malcolm is fun enough to compensate. Dr. Sarah Harding played by Julianne Moore is a good supporting character as is Pete Postlethwaite's Captain Ahab-esquire Roland Tembo. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is solid here and although Spielberg doesn't seem to be very inspired here he is a professional and knows how to make a film work.If it wasn't for the dull opening half hour and the misguided final act this would have been a consistently entertaining, action-packed romp. Sadly, it wasn't to be. Still, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is far, far from the garbage some would have you believe it is and is actually a solid action/adventure film.7/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When started to go awry,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is probably still my favorite out of the Jurassic Park film series. It's far from perfect but it's still nerve-racking. Back in the day it stressed me out to watch the poor choices these people were making. It would have been completely unbearable to watch if it wasn't for Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). He was and still is the only one that kind of make sense, his cynicism, common sense, and sarcasm contributed to stop this movie becoming a total train-wreck. He was the character the audience could relate to and also the comic relief of the film. I will admit that sometimes he was borderline annoying but he was saying what we were all thinking watching the film.Unlike the first one it doesn't rely so much on our fear of the unseen. We see a lot of the dinosaurs, they are no longer lurking in bushes off-camera, they are front and center. The special effects looks good but we might have seen too much of them. They could have left a few things to the imagination, it would have been much scarier that way.This sequel, like many, is riddled with flaws, and I'm only going to name a few. The tiny dinosaurs - the compsognathuses -, they started out strong in the amazing opening scene but then *spoilers* their victim survived so how the F*** can they later on kill a full grown man that fast? To this day it pisses me off, she should have died. It wouldn't have been pretty but it would have made me take them seriously.The Lost World: Jurassic Park flaws are big but easy to overlook because the film is entertaining.

"More action, more scares, and more dinosaurs.","This was the first Jurassic Park film I saw in theaters, I was barely an infant when the first one was released, but I was old enough, and accompanied by my teenage aunt to see this film in theaters in the summer of 1997. As a child watching it, I remember being scared a terrified, clenching my butt-hole the whole time, and holding on to my aunts arm tightly.Because of that experience The Lost World: Jurassic Park holds a special place in my heart, as cheesy as that sounds. I know many might see this film as an inferior sequel, but for me personally, I get a kick out of it and still do, despite it being slightly mediocre.This time around there are more dinosaurs, more action, and even more scares. I thought that in this film, Spielberg does a more effective job at creating tension and suspense. Once again Spielberg effectively uses the dinosaurs in every scene they're in, not to mention they look even better. The scenes involving the Compsognathus left me scarred in my youth and it still sends shivers down my spine every time I re-watch this film. The Stegosaurus scene involving Julianne Moore's character Dr. Sarah Harding, doesn't quite capture the magic of the Brachiosaurus scene, but still tender. The Velociraptors are again effectively used for scares and are even more vicious. There are three T-Rexes this time in the film, two being parents of an infant and they are the stars in this film. There's an awesome sequence involving a T-Rex rampaging across San Diego.The film's weak point, as it was in the first film are the characters. This time around Dr. Ian Malcolm is a different man. Jeff Goldblum, although his performance is dry, but it works for his character. He isn't the same man he used to be since the first film so it was neat to see Malcolm become a different person. Aside from Malcolm getting most of the spotlight, the rest of the characters are flat, aside from showing off hints of their personalities. I enjoyed Vince Vaughn's Nick Van Owen, he was full of wisecracks. I also very much enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Temdo the hunter and tracker, who was in a way similar to Bob Peck's role in the first film.Aside from them I didn't really care much for the other characters. I was annoyed with Julianne Moore's character, as with the main villain of the film Peter Ludlow, portrayed by Arliss Howard, who now took over Ingen from his uncle John Hammond. He now wants to capture some of the dinosaurs and bring them to a park built in San Diego, something John Hammond does not want. Vanessa Lee Chester also fills in the void for Lex and Tim. It felt like a rehash of the first film, despite her pretty cool moment with a Velociraptor in the film. It feels as though, while watching this film, the characters are a lot smarter than they appear to be. I mean why would they do what they're doing when they clearly know that everything they're doing is a bad idea. You can't help but wonder these thoughts while in viewing.Despite all this, every moment with the dinosaurs are golden. Even though we don't really care about some of the characters in the film, the stakes are higher and it's fun seeing them in peril, and it makes for an entertaining film. The action sequences are twice as exhilarating, one involving a trailer over the cliff will surely have you grip on to something. Not to mention John Williams's score this time around is more energetic and just as good as the first one. To sum it up this sequel is everything that you'd expect, more action, more dinosaurs, more thrills, and a higher body count. It's a fun ride throughout and provides more than the first film in terms of scale and stakes, but it's not completely refreshing as it's predecessor.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There are plenty of scenes that keep you in the edge of your seat and create an tension filled movie. Also, the acting is across the board solid.Where the film falls short for me is the lack of interesting characters. Outside of Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum, the rest of the characters aren't intriguing.

Rooting For The Dinosaurs,"The first ""Jurassic Park"" was all about the science of bringing dinosaurs back to life. ""The Lost World"" is about the ethics of same. Ethics have always been tricky territory where Hollywood is concerned. That's true here, too.Four years after InGen populated an entire island with dinosaurs, the company finds itself on the ropes. Wrongful death suits are expensive; so is bad publicity. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) goes from horrified onlooker to potential hors d'oeuvre when he travels to Isla Sorna to persuade his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) to come back home with him.Director Steven Spielberg called this film ""my first pure sequel,"" noting his Indiana Jones films are more like installments in an adventure series. But ""The Lost World"" fails miserably as a sequel, offering none of the joy of discovery while doubling up on carnage. It is a weird, grim spectacle film where logic in thrown out and characterization reduced to the broadest strokes.The question I am left with: Are we supposed to be rooting for the dinosaurs? The pro-forma good guys are a motley crew of SJWs whose constant virtue-signaling is about the only thing audible over the raptor roars. In between snuggling up to a baby stegosaurus and bringing an injured T. Rex into her trailer, Dr. Harding lectures a photographer not to smoke a cigarette on the island. ""We're here to observe and document, not interact,"" she tells him.Spielberg could have made a good movie out of this if he dispensed with the idea of making Harding his hero, rather than a big part of the problem. The photographer turns out to be a Greenpeace operative, and we watch him and Harding release some captured dinosaurs which then trample through a camp of fellow humans. They are hunters, so this is apparently positive behavior, even if this ""ethical"" sabotage winds up killing most of the people we see.The CGI is more active here than it was in the first film, and much more artificial-looking. Spielberg's A-Team, composer John Williams and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, plod through the motions in delivering a lot of mood and odd triumphant tones which feel hollow even as they are delivered. The whole film fails as a transportive enterprise, reminding you of past glories while adding nothing new.There's one performance I really liked in the film. It's not Pete Postlethwaite as Roland the hunter, which everyone else including Spielberg loved; he's a cipher too hemmed in by the silly script. Rather, it's Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow, nephew of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who as acting head of InGen is trying to use the dinosaurs to repair his shattered business, and doesn't care who gets hurt in the process.Howard is so smoothly smug and mean, I found myself seeking him out in group scenes. He's really not much of a villain, since his motives are less evil than capitalist (the same thing in Spielberg's world, maybe, but not mine), but he adds the right notes of conflict whenever given the chance, like when Malcolm grabs his arm in an early scene to make a point: ""This suit costs more than your education.""Howard doesn't do much villain work, so I was happily impressed enough to give him my 1997 Doe Avedon Award for great performance in a bad movie.What passes for a plot involves watching the various name characters try to avoid the same brutal fate they bestow on those who meet them, and then try and save an angry T. Rex storming through San Diego. This latter piece is so tacked on it betrays ""Lost World's"" focus on being an effects film. The original ""Jurassic Park"" was that, too, but the storycraft was good enough to keep you watching.No luck here. ""The Lost World"" is as much a slaughterhouse of ideas as it is of people. We can argue about whether Spielberg ever made a worse film (""1941,"" perhaps), but this stands supreme as his most disappointing.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"So stupid, I wished the actors would have been eaten to end the movie.","This is on my list as one of the top ten stupidest movies ever made. I actually wished the leading characters would have been eaten by the dinosaurs for their stupidity. In the movie, a scientist, supposedly an expert in her field, carry's a baby T-rex back to the expedition base camp, to set a broken leg on the baby dinosaur! Can you imagine someone supposedly intelligent, an ""expert"", doing something so incredibly stupid? Guess what! The Mama and Papa T-rex wanted to get their baby back. The cries of the baby T-rex leads Mama and Papa T-rex to the base camp, where they proceed to trash everything in the camp, eat a member of the expedition, and basicly create 20 minutes of dinosaur destruction.

A solid sequel to a classic,"This is a solid follow up to a classic dinosaur crisis movie. I remember watching this movie at the theater as a kid and enjoying the heck out of it. As a kid I just really found this film to be mesmerizing, exciting and entertaining. Watching it now I still found it to be a enthralling and fun movie to watch. The plot is coherent and the sense of action and excitement with the story is put together very well. There is a lot of good ideas and settings when it comes to the dinosaurs and human interactions and action sequences. It all melds together in the good old fashion Spielberg style. To the point it was thrilling from beginning to end. Most of the characters was coherent with the story and it was nice to see Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as the main lead this time around, since he was a likable character in the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie. Although the actress that played Ian's daughter was pretty bad when it comes to the acting department, at least in this film. Overall this movie is most definitely a worthwhile watch and it's one of those films I don't get why some reviewers bash on it.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Another Steven Spielberg Classic Comes To Life,"It has been four years since Jurassic Park was destroyed and the island Isla Nublar itself was drowned by a hurricane killing most of the dinosaurs; now there is a new island (called Isla Sorna) that has been genetically engineering the same animals, but abandoned the project after the company InGen declared bankruptcy.The film's short prologue introduces a rich family who are trying to enjoy their vacation on the beach of Isla Sorna, but their little girl wanders off into the jungles of the beach where she encounters a small dinosaur called a Compy in which she assumes it's a friendly creature, but turns out to have little friends of its own when they start pecking body parts of her off screen.Jurassic Park survivor Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) returns to John Hammond (Richard Attenbrouogh) after being called upon. This time Hammond wants Malcolm to send in a team of specialists to go in and document the island where he wants to show the world that the dinosaurs are safe and not dangerous animals. Malcolm finds out that his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on the island and doesn't realize what she's getting into.With the team on the island, they track down Sarah and realize that Malcolm has another surprise that his daughter Kelly has sneaked in one of the trailers and disobeyed her father's orders of staying on the mainland.Another team is on the island not to document but to capture and retrieve the animals to make a zoo. The team is lead by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard in a bad English accent) who wants to make a profit after the company InGen suffers a lost in profit and damage from the original Jurassic Park. He gets a big game hunter name Roland Tembo (Pete Postelwaite) who wants to bag a Tyrannosaurus Rex as his trophy.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is great entertainment; the special effects are twice worthy than the original. Though I find this film more frightening than the original, it reminds me of the film ""Aliens"" where the suspense gets bigger and twice as scary as the original.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Found it!,"I enjoyed The Lost World more than Jurassic Park, it's a darker, bloodier film with a higher body count, and, visually, it's a lot more complex. It's a shame that Dean Cundey didn't return (Spielberg never worked with him again, and hired Janusz Kamiński this time around) though. The story is almost the same thing done again, but it doesn't have those awful kids in it...much.Set four years after the Isla Nublar incident, Ian Malcolm is forced by John Hammond to confront the dinos once more on Isla Sorna (or Site B), the place where InGen bred the animals before moving them to Jurassic Park. The InGen board have taken control of the company and prepare to move the dinos to the mainland. But not before 80 minutes of gobbling up the lesser characters. Yes, it's derivative, but it gives us less of what made JP bad, and more of what made it good.There seems to be a lot of trims and cuts to The Lost World. It doesn't make for any distinct continuity errors but there are some noticeable jumps in the pacing. There have been many complaints that the film is overlong, however I think that it's more exciting than the original. There are some nail-biting scenes (the trailers hanging over the cliff) and the dinos are scarier this time. I love the ending with the T-Rex storming around San Diego.Again, there have loads of complaints that this ending is over-the-top, which I think is a ridiculous grievance. Action movies build to a big finish and, since JP1 and JP3 had no climax at all, the Lost World has the best ending of the trilogy. There's no theme of mankind playing God this time, just straight-up action, which also seems like a bit of a waste considering Ian Malcolm's cerebral analysis of the situation on Site A. There are some attempts at character arcs, but they fall flat. I really don't care about Pete Postlethwaite suddenly becoming disillusioned after capturing the T-Rex, and they missed the opportunity for Malcolm to tell them 'I told you so' when chaos erupts. And am I the only one who got confused at the fact that the characters of Ludlow and Ajay look virtually identical? Bad casting choices there, man.Despite all of this, I still think The Lost World is better than the first, even if all the cons negate the pros, it doesn't have those horrible children (apart from 3 minutes at the start).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""What you study, you change.""","In the events of Jurassic Park, an entrepreneur's dream of a living biological attraction ended with bloodshed and terror. Despite the threat of dinosaurs rampaging out of control, businessmen would still vie to reap the benefits of genetically-engineered beasts from ""Site B."" This follow-up to the hit 1993 film aims to provide more of the same - wit, color, and action - but on a bigger scale. There are more dinosaurs to behold. People deploy more cool vehicles and weapons to hunt and capture them. More people get eaten, more are chased across the jungle, and it all leads up to a crazy finale where a T-Rex runs amok in San Diego. There are a lot of fun setpieces to behold.There are a few things that mar the experience a little. Characters aren't quite as likable as in the first film; everyone's favorite chaotician returns and delivers plenty of sarcasm, but the family dynamic that's built around him doesn't congeal quite as well as it did with Dr. Grant and the kids in the first film. A lot of the characters in this film seem to make even dumber mistakes than in the first film, and many are unlikable. Some scenes are rather daft. Despite these issues, the plot takes off in interesting directions, showing how far a corporation will go to exploit nature. These events bring the threat of the dinosaur breakout to the civilized world in the end; the T-Rex's downtown carnage tends to be rather silly, but it does expand on the original theme that life cannot be controlled or tamed.This film sports pretty good-looking photography and editing. It is a much more drab and darker film, with a lot of nighttime photography. Acting is okay for what it is: Jeff Goldblum returns with his signature wit, but his character isn't always likable as he's always yelling at others trying to get them to listen to reason. Julianne Moore is playful in her role, but her character makes a few dumb decisions. Peter Postlethwaite is cool, Arliss Howard plays a dork we love to hate, Peter Stormare is the same, and everybody else I could take or leave. Writing is okay; there are amusing lines, but the dialogue is not as effortlessly colorful and fun as the first film. This production uses top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. John Williams' music score takes the original theme and transforms it into a wonderfully adventurous tune.The Lost World has plenty of thrills and fun, some of which is bigger and bolder than in Jurassic Park. It's only hampered a bit by a few characters making a few dumb decisions, and a few silly scenes here and there. I always felt it was a fun follow-up, and if you enjoyed the first film, this should be worth seeing once.3.5/5 (Experience: Pretty Good | Story: Okay | Film: Good)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Yeah, let's just go on an island filled with man-eating dinosaurs. No rational person would ever do this. I have never seen this many dumb characters ever fit into a film, but they managed to do it.It is so cringeworthy and an embarrassment to the first one, which is a classic.I'm shocked to find out Speilberg actually made this.

Less a movie than a chance for more merchandising,"It transpires that a second site had been created as a backup to the original island, John Hammond sends a party out including Dr Sarah Harding to visit the island.  When Ian Malcolm finds his girlfriend is on the island he sets out (with his daughter in tow) to rescue her.  However once on the island the group find that a second group is also on the island, however the second group doesn't seek to study but rather to hunt the dinosaurs.  With the destruction of the groups' communication equipment they find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the islands inhabitants.This cash in title is also based on a Michael Crichton novel.  However it manages to have all the same problems of the original but doesn't have the same excitement in the action scenes.  The plot is quite stretched in an attempt to get everyone on the island.  Once there, there are some really good action scenes - the T-rex attack one the caravan and the raptor attack in long grass are pure Spielberg, but most of it falls a little flat (the final T-rex attack is lazy spectacle).  However it's loud enough and big enough to be enjoyable when it's on the screen though.I found the whole question of genetics a little hard to swallow - I can accept that dinosaurs can be recreated from amber encased blood, but no way on God's earth can Ian Malcolm's daughter be that black!  She is a lot better a child than those brats that were in the first film, but racially there's no way that she's mixed race!  Anyway - she is really good without being irritating.  Goldblum does his scientist stuff again and counts the money.  Julianne Moore is wasted - such a great actress, here she is reduced to running round in shorts!  Postlewaithe at least seems to know he's in a poor money spinner and gives his role a degree of dignity before just disappearing at one point!  Vince Vaughn and Peter Stomare are also good but only do the action man stuff when they are capable of so much more.Yes the action scenes are quite good - but at the end of the day this feels very much like a package rather than a film - see the film, eat the meal, get the toy!

"Even managing to create punctual and memorable moments of action that are undeniably fun, this is not a film with the same magic or heart as its predecessor","This second part of the franchise has ups and downs. The first big mistake in the sequence is its totally confused synopsis. It is very clear how much the script tries to justify the sequence. How do you continue a story about a tourist amusement park located on an island where humans revived dinosaurs and ended up loosening and killing a lot of people? Now, you create another island ""completely"" different where dinosaurs lived by humans also live and where many people will die. Simple. While Crichton's book even took the story of Hammond's dinosaurs and Ian Malcolm's unusual return (read the books to see how unusual) through a deeper, darker and more intriguing path, Spielberg's film seems to follow little of that only in tone, not in essence.All the initial explanation by tycoon John Hammond and the justifications presented sound a little forced, but it is still possible to buy the idea of a second island, Sorna Island, also known as ""Site B"", where dinosaurs were created before being sent to Ilha Nublar - island of the original film - to be exposed to the public. It is here that the plot develops with the conflict between members of the expedition sent by Hammond's nephew with the intention of capturing dinosaur specimens to be exhibited at the new Jurassic Park headquarters in the city of San Diego and the team sent by the magnate himself , who, knowing the nephew's intentions, intends to register the animals in their natural habitat, with the intention of presenting their creation to the world and making the place a sanctuary forbidden for all, thus preserving the species that live there.Spielberg ends up deconstructing the wonderful adventure made in the previous film to build a film with a much darker theme, focused on a flawed script and characters without charisma. The choice to make a darker film is one of the worst ideas implemented. If what made the first one unique was his good humor, here he is totally lost trying to convey an idea of greater danger. And, unfortunately for the script, it is very difficult to buy that, partly because throughout the film no character - with the exception of Malcolm - seems to really convey the danger he is facing. As the mathematician had witnessed the terror caused by the dinosaurs before, he knew well what he would find on the island, justifying his initial reluctance to return to the place. This only gets worse when several other characters join the film. If the script had focused only on Malcolm's small group, until the narrative would have a chance to work, but when both groups of archaeologists and hunters come together at some point in the film, every little bit of character development is discarded and everyone gets together. they make only dead weight to be killed and eaten by the dinosaurs.
This sequel seeks to completely differentiate itself from its predecessor and tries to expand its universe and the themes of the original film in new ways. If the first film dealt with men playing gods, its continuation explores a more direct and conventional route with men arrogantly interfering in the nature that does not belong to them and which promises to fight back brutally. The choice of darker tones and poorly lit places reveals an evolution in the narrative proposed by the director. There was no more room for the idyllic fantasy of Parque dos Dinossauros, on the contrary, what survived was the spirit of hunting and hunter, with man being the main target of hunger. The problem is that none of this is properly explored in the film, not even between the lines. Leaving aside possible interesting questions to make room for new uninteresting characters and sequences of action and suspense that try to match that of the previous film.The film tries to assemble a team following the model of the first, with reduced teams in different locations, only now with Malcolm as ""leader"". Such an approach does not work, even with the efforts of Jeff Goldblum. His skepticism and sarcasm remain here, but the actor still tries to balance the attitude of a responsible hero, a concerned boyfriend, the verbalized exhibitor of all the dangers that the Dinosaurs are about to do, and a careful father. Dad? As a father, the script still comes to invent a daughter for Malcolm out of the blue (but didn't he say he had three children in the first film?). After all, the girl played by Vanessa Lee Chester, is totally disposable for the plot. Here we have Malcolm's girlfriend, played by Julianne Moore, initially well presented, but soon lost completely; and a very poorly developed photographer played by Vince Vaughn. All this weakness is consolidated in the middle of the film, where many other figures appear without being deepened, as well as a concern to show an excess of dinosaurs, causing the protagonist team to lose its strength. To satisfy fans of the original, in addition to the slightly more important participation of Richard Attenborough, we have Joseph Mazzello and the almost adult and beautiful Ariana Richards, returning as Tim and Lex, speaking just over a sentence.If today there is a fear that sequels of highly successful films fall into certain ""trends"" that make it an inferior film and fall short of its original, ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" has become one of the great examples of these sad ones Tendencies. Of course, it is not fair to classify it as a complete disaster. There are several Spielberg brands that make the film excellent entertainment. The darker climate is the main feature here. Besides suspense, fear have never been more present. Janusz Kaminski's great photograph is darker and more frightening with scenes predominantly nocturnal and rainy as in the original film, combined with art direction, soundtrack by master John Williams and impeccable sound complement the creation of the suspense.Interestingly, we can easily see here the influence of the classic King Kong in several references. One of the ships docked at the San Diego docks was called ""The Venture"", the same one that brought the giant gorilla to America. Another point is that after a great adventure in the creature's habitat, it is captured and taken to America to be exploited commercially by man, and just like King Kong, arrives by ship. During the film we noticed a scene in which Ian Malcolm's daughter stays with Eddie Carr in a structure suspended at the top, with the scene becoming very similar to the scene of the island tribe's sacrifice for King Kong. And of course, the scene in which the ""beast"" breaks free and goes out into the city streets causing panic could not be missing. Still in the port, we noticed the dinosaur making a great noise with the view of the buildings in front of it, looking like the scene of Kong on top of the building at the end of the film, giving the perfect contrast of today with a being who lived 65 million years ago. While on the run, the T-Rex leaves causing destruction and panic in the streets, just as when Kong manages to get rid of the chains that bound him. The difference is that the animal was not killed, only recaptured and sent back to the Island. The similarities in several scenes with the classic of the 1930s are evident and used with competence in the formula of this script, again well adapted by David Koepp, one of the most active collaborators currently with Spielberg.
The story condenses in a little more than two hours a good story and that we did not even notice to pass of so well that it flowed. It is also important to mention here the great scenes of this production such as the scenes of chase in the middle of the island's forest, as well as the scene of the fall of the trailer on the cliff, the attack of velociraptors in the communication center, the invasion of the uncontrolled boat in the Ingens, and the entire final sequence of the T-Rex arriving in the uncontrolled boat already without crew at the port of San Diego and all the uproar caused by the city streets, highlighting the scene of the boy and his parents noticing the Jurassic giant in their garden or when the T-Rex attacks a bus.At the climax of the film, which seems to end at a point with the group finally managing to escape the island, we see a kind of Godzilla short film that mixes with King Kong, where we see T-Rex imposing chaos and death in Los Angeles. One third of the film that seems completely added at the last minute to create a giant monster movie ending. A really necessary sequence? No, but it's undeniably fun to watch it unfold. Not only does the T-Rex interact with the modern world in a very believable and palpable way, drinking water from the pool, eating a traffic light and civilians, fighting a bus, all being very well conducted in action and the impressive effects of realists. With Spielberg still taking the opportunity to pay homage to the classic monster film, coincidentally or not, of the same name, The Lost World / The Lost World of 1925 where dinosaurs roamed the human metropolis, installing chaos.""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" is a continuation that nobody asked to exist, but that came to life thanks to the love of its director for this universe of creatures and monsters born of human biology, and for the mountains of money that he raised. Even managing to create punctual and memorable moments of action that are undeniably fun, and the feeling of enchantment of being able to glimpse so many dinosaurs on the scene is still present, albeit little, this is not a film with the same magic or heart as its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of the most underrated films of all time!,"I always loved this film and I never knew why until I saw the review of it by Klayton Fioriti on youtube.
Remember the butterfly effect that Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) explains to Ellen Sattler (Laura Dern) in the first film? Well, we are seeing this effect in The Lost World via Nick van Owen character played by Vince Vaughn.
This film has two opposite characters, the big game hunter white man Roland Tembo (Pete Postlewaite) and van Owen, the hunter who hunts for trophy and pleasure and the envirnonmentalist who wants to save the dinos. 
Seems like the typical bad guy vs good guy fight, right?
Wrong!This film blurs the line of right and wrong and it is so ambitious in its filmmaking that even today the effects hold really, really well!I highly recommend the film! If Aliens was to Alien the different take and style, so is The Lost World to Jurassic Park.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I love this movie because of how different it is compared to the first film.

The actors Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore were FANTASTIC! I really enjoyed Goldblum's character Dr. Malcom just as much as I loved him in the first film! And Julianne Moore as Sara was a very interesting character as well and I loved the connection between these two characters and that she really had a lot to do in the film as well as all of the other actors. I am also REALLY surprised by the special effects in this film! The CGI and the animatronics they used in this film really made these dinosaurs come to life and it looked REALLY GROUNDBREAKING and still looks FANTASTIC to this day! I loved almost every minute of The Lost World and I wasn't disappointed at all! I also don't understand why films like this are so underrated and get a lot of hate, because if you watch and discover the story that certain movies such as The Lost World hold, then I can NOT see you not having fun with this film!

"Much like Jaws, Jurassic Park is far and away the BOLDEST and most entertaining fun you'll have in this genre","Reading reviews does Put decisions into perspective, and you can look at them and argue, or stress a point. For me, what doesn't ""work"" about the sequal will be explained, but the pin-pointed flaws are also some of the stories high-highs believe it or not, and that's before we get into the review, for me this movie was Good, and I'll explain why sooner. So let's jump into the jungle to rate about this Movie, the biggest and the baddest, it's just a Movie, BUT it could still be the baddass T-Rex that makes it funner and fresher.So firstly, the bits of the archaeologists is ONE good thing, it separates itself from films like ""Megaboa"" where yes they might know the terrain and the dangers, but outside of that with not much knowledge of their surroundings. This further proves my point and why I personally find it good, is because we get alot of Knowledge and insight about the creatures and how they can defeat them, why they might feel a certain way. I just find the approach better thought-out rather then just delving into an area that yes might cause for some entertainment. However, it doesn't come without it's flaws and they come effectively here.The Flawed side,The story is flawed in this aspect because the characters make some horror decisions you might as well call it a ""Horror frenzy showdown"" now let's deep dive it, not literally. But the film captures it perfectly with one idiotic decision one-after-the-other, the film will have a girl, around 11, yes 11 on her own in an unexplored island, you can't go further because the action scene is intense and exciting, but the other films mistakes is the characters standing still, as if they've just seen Casper the ghost, or flying cars because NOBODY seems to realise a T-Rex is on board!, yes hello I'm here.That's most of the movies mistakes, aside from that it goes by with flying colours and does do a good job of the world-building and does enhance us enough in the world of Dinosaurs which does make it fun and Entertaining atleast. So for that reason alone, it does work. The Action of the Dinosaurs trying to get their daughter, the girl trapped inbetween the littlest of Dinosaurs, or the man being chased, or the T-Rex near the house. Or the smaller Dinosaurs eating people and getting Karote kicked. Every action scene has a different thing that plays out, is some of it a bit Predictable? Yes. But it doesn't take you out of the scene, because the main characters are still put at high level risk, and the dangers and action is at its best here, the First one set the tone right, and the emotional beats. Here what number 2 gets right, is the type of people in this film, to put it better knowledgeable people, and the sequal gets the action right, which leads me to my next point.I love the variety of locations are characters are hit with, yes the flaws are it's dumb decisions, and hilariously to fast that you can't keep up, but it isn't all a bad thing. As I said the variety of locations is good because it really does give you the sense of danger and you never feel at ease, even next to a Tranqualised T-Rex!Yes the movie has FLAWS...but they are never as apparent or as bad as you'd may expect, because it always leads to a good scene or a creative action-piece that remains as intense and as atmospheric as the last one. The Effects are also as of the same high-standard. So don't be put off, this sequal rocks.I rate it a 7 Because as far as Creature features go it has some great action, laughs and intense and atmospheric scenes that put you on the edge-of-your-seat, Not Bad!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An Above Average Sequel,"Next in the Jurrassic Films to watch for me is the second one the Lost World and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ian Malcolm forced to return to an island filled with dinosaurs to rescue his girlfriend.Main Character
As mentioned Jeff Goldblum is back as Dr Ian Malcolm and this time he is our main hero here and he is great in the film. The character of Malcolm oozes charisma and is so likeable, similar to the previous film it seems like he is the character with the most logic and that he is always right. His motivations for going to the island is well founded and you actually understand why he does it and why he cares about going back there.Supporting Characters
A young Vince Vaughan is in this film and he does a half decent role here, he is an entertaining character and it is nice to see him amongst the crew. The late Pete Postlethwaite is in this film as a kind of anatagonist but he is one of the best characters in the film, he actually has some intrigue and interest to him for sure. The rest of the cast aren't interesting, Julianne Moore plays Goldblum's girlfriend and I just found her quite annoying and actually felt they had little chemistry here and her character could have been played by pretty much anybody. I also didn't care much for the father - Daughter plotline which came down to not really caring much about the daughter in the film. Plus there are lots of characters here and you can tell the majority of people here are just cannon fodder to be eaten by dinosaurs.Story
The story to get Goldblum to the island was well done here. You see his point of view and need to return, I also like how they basically introduced a third party with another group of people on the island which is well done. But as I mentioned I didn't care about both the girlfriend and daughter relationships with Goldblum and the last act feels like you are watching a different movie and that it feels really tacked on.Script
The script has some humour to it especially from Goldblum that made me laugh, but the script is weaker then the first film. The interest of nature vs nurture isn't really here, traded for a more generic monster like film. Plus the drama of the characters plots doesn't work enough for me.Style
The style of the film really comes down to the Dinosaurs and they are fine but not as strong as the first film. When it uses the practical effects especially for the T-rex is still looks great and the action scenes are more dark and aggressive. But this film focuses too much on its CGI, they look more fake then before and it does take you out of the film.Overall
Overall, this film is a fine sequel to Jurassic Park but it is not as strong as it should be for this franchise and will be a let down if you are expecting a film as good as the original Jurassic Park.Rating - 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not far as good as the original off course!,"Spielberg's extreme success from 1993 were doomed to get a sequel. Four years later Steven Spielberg released a sequel to the amazing original and everyone simply had to see it! But most got very dissapointed, because the mystique, brilliance, dialogs and excitemeny is all gone sadly! Although it's still brilliant entertaining and nice made it doesn't stand on own feet.Sam Neill and Laura Dern is gone, so we've got some totally new characters into the picture although Malcolm and Hammond is still there. The story is a bit dumb, getting to know that Hammond had made two islands with dinosaurs on both. One ready to be Jurassic Park and the other were the creatures could live in freedom without fences etc. So Hammond decides to send a small unit down to the island to do some research on the dinosaurs...something that off course they never should have done!The first was stunning; really stunning! This is just entertaining, not more, something I think is very sad! LOST WORLD has got it's sequences that's truly fabulous but threw the pity dialogs, the all-threw mood and the terrible thing that T-Rex reaches the city! The respect is gone and the thrills are now based on the creatures actually attacking, not the mystique how they look like, cause after all; we've seen them! Although Malcolm is a lot more mature and cool in this one, somethings works and other don't, something rare in a Spielberg movie I must say! STARS: 2-3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A moodier take on an instant classic,"Despite having perhaps one of the worst sequel titles in film history, The Lost World: Jurassic Park winds up being a favorable dinosaur outing. One of the pleasant things about the Jurassic Park franchise is that dinosaur films are few and far between, which allows for the ideas and sequences in these films to remain mostly fresh. There's little interference with ""been there, done that"" responses to action setpieces, nor is there a general cynicism to the tones of these films or the imagery (which gets especially moodier in this film). The wonder and elements of peril are still firmly instilled in Spielberg's direction and David Koepp's screenplay, making for a film that continues to really emphasize the thrill of its predecessor through nearly every scene.We focus on Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is hired by InGen CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to document the activities of the dinosaurs on Hammond's second Jurassic Park site after the terrible breakdown of his first site before financiers close the second park. Initially apprehensive, Malcolm turns compliant when he sees his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) packed up and ready to go, in addition to his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) from his first marriage. On the trip, Malcolm winds up meeting an ecological film crew run by Vince Vaughn's Nick as well as a famous hunter known as Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite). As expected, however, the same catastrophe that occurred in the first park repeats itself with the second, making for a frightening and dangerous experience for the long-suffering individuals who recall Jurassic Park's initial failure all too well.The sole thing The Lost World does better than its predecessor is give us a group of more interesting characters and character actors. Seeing Goldblum, Moore, and Vaughn work off one another in a way that channels misfit tendencies very nicely is something to relish, for seeing all these actors in such a goofy, fun-loving project makes the price of admission already worth it. This band of characters, while still not entirely fleshed out, is still a lot better than the marginally amusing cast of characters from the first movie, which benefited largely from the effortless charisma of the everyman Wayne Knight.Still instilled in The Lost World from the original Jurassic Park film is the film's desire to keep us feeling constant danger and uncertainty. Jurassic Park's main attraction, besides state-of-the-art special effects, was the fact that it always made us feel at the mercy of enormous, hulking dinosaurs, regardless of where we tried to hide (or where the camera place us). Spielberg clearly capitalizes on this principle with this particular film, giving us the feeling of minimal safety he did with not only this film's predecessor, but his other projects like Duel and Poltergeist.Then there's the element of darkness in this film that's significantly more present here than it was in the first film. Rather than encapsulating the common attributes of flashy, summer blockbusters, The Lost World finds itself assuming a moodier state of mind, actively showing innocent bystanders consumed by dinosaurs, young people mauled by baby dinosaurs, and more. There's a flood of action and suspenseful sequences that really amount to some fully realized events in this film. Consider the scene when Kelly performs a complex gymnastics routine to save Malcolm and Sarah, or when the dinosaurs are attacking the film crew and Malcolm works to rescue them.In some ways, The Lost World finds ways to be more engaging than Jurassic Park. Its moodier style further exploits the dangers of dinosaurs, and the repeated peril that humans face when trying to assimilate to their world. The Lost World: Jurassic Park continues to affirm this frightening realization while remaining a thrilling piece of blockbuster entertainment, never squandering the opportunity to be dark and violent but also peppering in the occasional one-liner (some funny, some cringe-worthy) for good measure. Much like its predecessor, this is ultimately a variation on the summer blockbuster done well and in a consistently enjoyable manner.Starring: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vanessa Lee Chester, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Richard Attenborough. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
There turns out to be another such island.,"Unlike the first movie, the second one focuses a little more on herbivore dinosaurs and only has one kid, not two kids. That could be seen as an improvement. And that is what it is. Unfortunately, it does not prevent the movie from having the most important events take place at nighttime. Nor does it stop the movie from going insane and using highly unrealistic plot moves. Death scenes deserve criticism as well. For instance, because of how stupid they can be. Or because of the strange tone the movie chooses for how a huge predator eats a human being. It's like you're supposed to enjoy it or even laugh. This does not go for all the death scenes, of course, but it is impossible to avoid mentioning.The visual effects were great again, if not even better that the last time. There are more creatures and they are more mobile, more realistic. The music was also great. They don't just reuse what the first movie came up with, there is new material, strong and memorable. John Williams was very good. As were the main actors in the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A nice sequel but not the one we all expected,"I've always seen those who loved the original Jurassic Park look down on 'The Lost World,' as if it reminded them of a distant cousin with whom they don't want to spend any time with.Now I understand why that might have been the case; it's probably because the sequel isn't on the same level as its predecessor, which I don't think anybody will deny, even those who truly enjoy it, and the second thing that could have gone against this particular movie is the upsetting absence of Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler.Following the massive success of the first instalment, many people became diehard fans of these two fictional figures, and I'm sure they all expected the sequel to incorporate them in some shape or form. But to their utter shock and disbelief, it didn't, and I suspect that upset a certain segment of the audience.So, what about me? What are my thoughts? Well, to be honest, I kinda liked it.While my expectations were not fulfilled, I appreciate what Spielberg dared to accomplish here. He wanted to try something new, thus, he tried to steer the series in a different direction. Yes, it did not produce the desired results, but I genuinely think his efforts are something we all should recognise and respect, at least from the perspective of a filmmaker.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Predictable, Boring and Unnecessary","This film was predictable, boring and unnecessary. While it was nice to see more Jeff Goldbloom, there was not much else to enjoy about The Lost World. The side characters' personalities were grating, the film was too dark (physically) and there was no chemistry between the actors. While I would happily go back and re-watch Jurassic Park, I do not know if I will ever willingly watch this film again.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Light entertainment,"I watched this the day after the first Jurassic Park (which I consider one of the greatest films ever made). I found the film rather disappointing. It simply doesn't live up to the original.Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and other characters travel to an island nearby to Nublar, where the cloned dinosaurs were raised. They are on a mission for John Hammond, whose nephew wants to recreate Jurassic Park - in San Diego! The nephew has also sent a team to the island - to hunt a T-Rex for the park.Despite what that may have sounded like, the plot is actually rather thin. Much of the movie is the people being chased on the island - and eaten. More than halfway through the movie, I was still waiting for it to entertain me.This film is very violent - much more so than the original. It's also scarier. The movie isn't nearly as good as the original.That said, it isn't a total loss. I liked the twin climaxes - which were terrifyingly good (literally), and redeemed the film a little. But the biggest point in the film's favour is the special effects - which are AT LEAST as good as the original! The dinos - particularly the T-Rexes - are frighteningly real.If you're looking for a good scare, this is it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Probably the only worthy sequel in the Jurassic Park series.,"The Lost World follows the same logic of most big budged sequels, bigger is better and louder. Unfortionaly, while it does not come close to the perfection that was ""Jurassic Park"" and it does miss a few targets along the way, it's still one hell of a fun ride with a winning performance by Jeff Goldblum and a scene stealing performance the late Pete Postlethwaite. Add Spielberg's directing, Sam Winston's dynamic Dinosaurs effects and some of the scariest scenes in the entire Jurassic series, then you have a sequel that is truly worthy of the name Jurassic Park. Too bad the sequels that followed did not have this film's playful showmanship to try to bring something more to the table.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Worthy Sequel to One of My Favorite Movies,"Steven Spielberg returns with a sequel to his 1993 blockbuster that I believe was under-rated by many people. I loved the film when I first saw it in theaters in 1997 and, while it didn't seem as impressive on second viewing, I still find it to be one of the best sequels I've seen. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough returns for this short cameo) has discovered that some of the dinosaurs originally intended for his park have been surviving on the secondary island, Isla Sorna. Isla Sorna housed the location of Site B, where most of the dinosaurs would be hatched before bringing them over to Isla Nublar and Jurassic Park. Hammond is determined to send a team, led by a more than reluctant Ian Malcolm, to the island to retrieve photographic documentation of the thriving dinosaurs in an effort to gain public support in preserving the location.Just as the first film, this one retains some primary similarities to Michael Crichton's novel but it also takes a lot of liberties. Unlike 'Jurassic Park', I read the book before seeing the film for 'The Lost World' and so I was more aware of what the film COULD have been. Of course, those doesn't mean I didn't love the movie. There were just a lot of great scenes that were cut from the original story to fit into Spielberg's view.Of the cast from the original, the only returning key player is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm was my favorite character from the first film so it was awesome having him return as the lead. I loved the additions of Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Peter Stormare to the cast (though Stormare's role was small). Goldblum's one of my favorite actors and teaming him with Vince Vaughn was great. In addition to another great cast, this film gives us more dinosaurs than the previous. The audience gets their first glimpses of stegosaurs and compsognathus. We also get not one but two tyrannosaurs in this film AND they get more screen time this time around.Personally, I don't understand why some people complain about this movie. It's just as fun as the first; I don't quite understand what people feel is missing. I doesn't contain the some sense of wonder as the first film because this time we're already seen the dinosaurs in action. I've heard some complaints about the climactic sequence in San Diego. Aside from the fact that it deviated so much from the book with this sequence, I thought it was awesome. It gave the audience a chance to look at the dinosaurs in a new light, a new environment. I stand by my 8/10 rating because I found this movie to be a worthwhile sequel to one of my favorite movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More like a lost opportunity...,"While still containing much of Spielberg's winning suspense formula and an excellent performance by Jeff Goldblum, The Lost World falters significantly from Jurassic Park and is generally disappointing.Spielberg could basically have filmed Crichton's book and had a truly compelling movie on his hands. Instead, he chose to dumb the film down for the audience, a surprising move from such a great filmmaker, especially after creating such a thought-provoking masterpiece in Schindler's List. Still, while too long, the film has its moments, and the scenes with the Tyrannosaurs and Velociraptors are generally well done (the tall grass scene in particular). Don't expect the quality of the original, but fans of Goldblum's Ian Malcolm should enjoy it nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Occasionally thrilling, but often dull sequel","The Lost World is by most measures a somewhat decent blockbuster that is still able to offer a few punchy thrills despite its age, but lacks the sense of awe and wonder that defined the original, leaving something that feels empty and hollow by comparison.The story in The Lost World is perhaps the single weakest point. The book its nominally based on of the same name carried a similar air of obligatory sequel that clearly sprouted from a desire to cash in on the success of the original rather than to expand meaningfully on it. Despite the workmanlike prose and comically over-the-top violence though, Crichton's sequel did at least offer some degree of substance with its long passages of scientific posturing. However incongruous and rambling it may have been, it gave the book enough meat to keep you reading.The film strips this out and instead replaces it with irritating stock characters and pointless action. There's not a single dinosaur attack in this movie that isn't brought on by the character's own stupidity. This might be fine, but the screenplay doesn't seem to be aware of this and instead seems to expect us to root for these idiots, despite the fact that their actions are responsible for most of the deaths in this movie. And though Goldblum and Postlethwaite bring charm and weight to their roles (the latter playing perhaps the only intriguing character in this film), they're not enough to save the film's convoluted and muddled storyline from descending into mediocrity.As for the action scenes themselves, they're of somewhat mixed quality. Most just feel contrived and forgettable, paling compared to the original. However, there are at least three particular scenes that stand out from the rest - the cracking window, the long grass and the harbour scene. These scenes are worthy of anything the first film could offer - tense, exciting, imaginative, awe-inspiring. I'd even go as far as to say that they're good enough to redeem the film and make it watchable, however much the story becomes mired in uneven messages.The effects here are another highlight, despite the 97 CGI starting to show its age. Tthe dinos here are every bit as lifelike and terrifying to behold as they were in the original. But then why does this film still feel so lacking in awe? Even discounting the sequel problem, the whole film is rudderless, never sure if it's trying to convey a deeper environmental message or just be a dumb action film. The result is less a seamless blend than a stitched-together mashup, falling flat as both.For me, The Lost World is the nadir of the Jurassic franchise. It has neither the awe of the original, the simple entertainment of the third, nor the big-budget-action of the fourth. It's not an outright bad movie, not quite - there are some truly fantastic moments, a handful of good performances, and the dinosaurs are as cool as one could hope for. Ultimately though, The Lost World would probably have been better off staying that way.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Julianne Moore, and Pete Postlethwaite hold their own as well, and the action has double this time around, letting the movie have some of the most spectacular, and scary scenes ever to put to modern film.

Has little of the original's heart,"My main memory of seeing Steven Spielberg's sequel to his 1993 mega- hit Jurassic Park is leaving the cinema with one of the worst migraines I've ever suffered. My head pounded so hard that I couldn't even eat my caramel sundae purchased from the drive-thru McDonalds on the route home. Seeing it again all these years later I approached the film with a clear head and a box of painkillers on hand as a precaution. But as the credits rolled after an exhausting 129 minutes, I found myself in pain yet again. Not pain of the physical kind, but the dull emotional pain of sitting through a pretty bad movie. The Lost World's aim is to make everything bigger and better, and while the dinosaurs are certainly more technically impressive this time, there is little of the original's magic here.A few years after the incident on Isla Nublar, the InGen corporation are being hit with lawsuit after lawsuit, and former CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is now a naturalist who has seen the error of his ways. When Hammond's slimy nephew (Arliss Howard) takes over the business, he plans to bring the dinosaurs back to the mainland and make them a sideshow attraction. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is asked by Hammond to visit Isla Sorna, or ""site B"" - a breeding island where the dinosaurs roamed free - to document the dinosaurs in order to gather support for the island to be left to its own devices by humans. He initially declines, but then has a change of heart when he learns that his palaeontologist girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there.Everything is certainly on a larger scale here than its predecessor. Instead of one tyrannosaurus rex we get two and a baby, and there's a whole pack of velociraptors for the group to contend with. Shortly after Malcolm arrives, he and his crew are joined by the Hammond nephew, who brings along a small army and bad-ass hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), the latter of whom simply wants a shot at taking down a T-Rex as payment for his services. Unfortunately, Malcolm's estranged daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) - a character taken straight out of Cinema's Guide to Annoying Children - also sneaks along for the ride, so we get to suffer through sentimental moments of learning the importance of family. The stand- out scene, which sees the characters attacked by the angry T-Rex's near the edge of a cliff, happens because Sarah takes their baby to bandage a wound. It turns out the dinosaurs value family too.The fact that Sarah, an expert in her field, would even try to take care of a baby T-Rex demonstrates how stupid these characters are required to be in order for the film to deliver a set-piece. When you know there are huge, angry monsters out there, why would you park your trailer next to a cliff-edge anyway? So concerned is the film with entertaining its audience, Spielberg and writer David Koepp seem to have forgotten that a scene also requires a degree of logic to truly work. Most of the action falls flat, which is surprising given the talent for the genre previously demonstrated by its director, and it culminates in an unnecessary T-Rex rampage around San Diego. It isn't all bad - the dinosaurs are as wonderful and terrifying as ever and the late Postlethwaite is a fantastically conflicted antagonist - but there's a noticeable lack of heart and effort here.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Roland Tembo is the only good characters over the lot of new characters (seriously there's a lot of new characters, which don't even develop over the movie) But i still enjoy it, but it doesn't have the rewatch ability of the original, i can see see the original one time on a week but i need a month to enjoy this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Worthy Sequel,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)*** (out of 4)Steven Spielberg's sequel to his 1993 blockbuster has a group of researchers heading to an alternate island where John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has more dinosaurs living but what they don't know is that there's another team on the way to the island to try and capture the creatures and return them to America to put them on display.THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK didn't get nearly as much praise when it was released compared to the original but I've always felt that this film is actually better. Whereas the first film gave you a sense of wonder about the dinosaurs, this one here takes that and goes full steam ahead and pretty much delivers a horror film. I've often criticized the director for playing things too safe but that's certainly not the case here because this is a rather dark, mean and at times violent film. I still remember watching this on opening night and dozens of parents removing their crying children from the theater because it was simply too scary for them.It should go without saying but the real ""star"" here are the dinosaurs themselves, brought to life by Stan Winston and his wonderful creations. There's not a single second in the film where you feel as if you're not really watching dinosaurs and it's this authentic feel that makes the film work. If you didn't believe that there weren't dinosaurs around the actors then there really wouldn't be any suspense or drama. The CGI creations all look 100% real and they mix well with the human actors. The live action and CGI mix flawlessly together but this here has always been one of Spielberg's strongest points as a director.Another major plus is the fact that the final hour of this thing is pretty much one long non-stop action sequence. As I said earlier, this is pretty much a horror film from the middle point on and no one is safe. This includes children, dogs and anyone else that gets close to the dinosaurs. I really loved the fact that Spielberg went all out and really tried to scare the audience and show that these dinosaurs weren't any game and that they could be extremely dangerous. Whereas the first film showed their danger, there were several moments where you just knew everything was going to turn out okay and be safe. That's not the case here because everyone was at risk and the action sequences were directly perfectly.Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Attenborough, Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlethwaite are all good in their roles but, again, the real stars are the dinosaurs. John Williams' score is perfect as you'd expect and there's no doubt that the technical stuff is top of the line. This includes the terrific cinematography and some great editing along the way. THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK will never fully get the credit it deserves but for my money it's a highly entertaining horror film with elements of KING KONG but with more of a bite.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Actually where you're going is the only place in the world where the geese chase you!,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp from the novel written by Michael Crichton. It stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard and Harvey Jason. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kamiński.Four years on from the horrors of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, it transpires that there is a second dinosaur site on Isla Sornar. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) is forced to head off to face the horrors once again when he learns that his paleontologist girlfriend, Sara Harding (Moore), is already on the island as a forerunner to a team John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is assembling to document the dinosaurs in their habitat. Once their, though, the problems soon arise, especially when a team from InGen arrive with other ideas about the dinosaurs on their minds.Given the massive success of Jurassic Park in 1993, a sequel was inevitable. What transpires is pretty much more of the same, it's very safe film making by Spielberg. Coming off of the emotional exertions of his last film, Schindler's List, few can deny that the director was entitled to wind down with The Lost World project, there was after all nothing safe about Schindler's, but although Jurassic 2 is a hugely enjoyable family blockbuster, a jazzy bit of hi-tech fun, it lacks the requisite brains to make it an inspiring sequel.Formula follows the same path, humans in peril on the island, with some added and new dinosaurs (double T-Rex a bonus), and then the ""twist"" in the narrative sees some monster peril come to San Diego, King Kong style, for the finale. There's inter fighting between the good dudes led by Malcolm and the bad guys led by the weasel Peter Ludlow (Howard) who is Hammond's conniving nephew and current head of InGen. Family issues also feature, of course since this is Spielberg after all, while the dangers of tampering with science message remains as strong as ever.Cast are ably led by a witty Goldblum, who is a reassuring presence carried over from the first film, and the tech-credits are as expected, very high. Some scenes soar, such as a sequence shot from under a pane of glass that starts to crack under the weight of a character, others not so, such as having Malcolm's teenage daughter turn into Nadia Comăneci for one credulity stretching scene. But all told it's an honest blockbuster purely aimed at the target audience who helped to see it make over $600 million in profit. Safe often pays you see, and as sequels go it's one of the better ones in the 90s. It's exciting if intellectually stunted. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mamma is angry,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is action packed sci-fi flick, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), the sequel to the blockbuster hit Jurassic Park. So, when you'd think that scientists would realize dinosaurs and humans don't mix, we still have rich people trying to be gods. Four years after the disaster in the theme park billionaire John Hammond asks chaos theorist and all-time cool dude Dr. Ian Malcolm, played by Jeff Goldblum, to observe and document the dinosaurs on a second island, Isla Sorna, or Site B where other dinosaurs have been created through DNA cloning, in order to prevent the company he once owned, InGen to take over the island for commercial reasons. First hesitant, Malcolm decides to make the trip when he finds out that his girlfriend, palaeontologist Dr. Sarah Harding played by Julianne Moore is already there. So, we have a rescue mission, which as you might have guessed turns into a survival mode where man-eating creatures prowl around.The sequel is good with Steven Spielberg once again taking control of the director's chair but it doesn't match up to the high expectations delivered by the first. We have a few cool characters but not compelling enough to wow you. The character Roland Tembo played by the late legend Pete Postlethwaite is a world-class hunter who is trying to go man-o-man against T-Rex in order to get a trophy. Great character and such a shame we didn't see much of him as it would've been cool to see more of his hunting skills.The flick has impressive special effects especially with T-Rex hitting up mainland San Diego and coming across civilians and even a pet dog. The acting in this is not at the same level as the first however the character development of the T-Rex parents' are cool as, they due to showing maternal and territorial instincts when their baby is taken from them.There are a few plot elements which does not make sense and my guess is it was put in there just for the sake of it. This includes a massive plot hole aboard the discovered freighter - like how and why? Wasn't T-Rex sealed and contained??Awesome to see Jeff Goldblum back as chaos dude Dr. Ian Malcolm and this time he is less goofy and more serious due to what happened in the previous movie. Spielberg directs an awesome set piece of the trailer dangling off a cliff due to angry T-Rex parents' and where Malcom vs hungry raptors.

Great movie.,"Love this franchise. It is a great sequel to the first and does not get enough credit as being its own great movie. A second Island and a whole new way for dinosaurs to be introduced. I like the storyline better than the first film even though the first is a classic. It keeps the plot interesting and keeps a lot of the same cast from the first. Missing a few of the key characters as it's not perfect. I would definitely say that if you like the first one you are going to like this one just as much and maybe even more. Give it a chance. I know a lot of people hate on it as being the worst one, but I think it's worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The first Jurassic Park sequel really doesn't live up to its fantastic title.,"This is just the first film, done again worse. It doesn't really explore anything new thematically, and serves more as a bunch of cool set pieces (some from the first book!) stringed together. Fortunately its shot well, and some of the sequences are really great on their own. The effects still hold up as well as the first film, plus more Ian Malcolm was nearly as good as it could have been, which is enough.But it feels as if the soul has been ripped out. There are just barely echoes of the ethical discussions about the park that were so good in the first one. I do like the aesthetic of the park being abandoned and overgrown, that is one of the few awesome things about the sequels. But it's not used to its fullest potential.Show the consequences of the islands own ecosystem more. Show how playing with genetics potentially created more than just dinosaurs. How does this new habitat influence their offspring? Show the flora and fauna leaking into Costa Rica like the books did.Instead we just have the antagonists trying to create a dino-zoo on the mainland. Gee what an original idea.So overall I do enjoy the film, and think it's just above passable. It does get bonus points for having dinosaurs, so there is a bias there (there's not enough dinosaur movies, please Hollywood they print money).It's a silly movie with a dumb third act, but it's got high production quality and some fun characters (Pete Postlethwaite as the hunter Roland was kinda cool). It's still at least worth watching, just maybe not right after the far superior first entry.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still quite the adventure...,"The 1997 movie ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is quite a good follow-up to the 1993 ""Jurassic Park"" movie. And luckily it didn't turn out as most sequels have a tendency of doing. So director Steven Spielberg definitely managed to carry on the torch for the franchise back in 1997.The storyline in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", as written by David Koepp and based on the Michael Crichton novel, provided quite good entertainment, as the movie had lots of action, excitement and a fairly good storyline to tell. Sure, it wasn't as bedazzling as the 1993 movie was, but it was pretty close. And something that really was good in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" was the fact that they didn't just go bigger is better, as they have done in the latest ""Jurassic World"" trilogy.It was definitely good to see some of the cast from the original movie return to the sequel and reprise their characters and roles, and Jeff Goldblum was very much carrying the movie quite phenomenally. There were an abundance of new actors and actresses to the franchise with ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", such as Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare, and Richard Schiff.If you enjoyed the 1993 ""Jurassic Park"" movie, then you most certainly will also enjoy the 1997 ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", no doubt about that.The visuals and CGI effects in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" were good, and better than the previous movie, and that brought even more punch to the storyline. I was impressed back in 1997 and I still am impressed here in 2023.""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a movie that you can watch again and again, just as you can with the 1993 predecessor.My rating of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

You'll have to make up your own mind...,"Following up the huge success of Jurassic Park was never going to be easy, but The Lost World manages to pull it off.Jeff Goldblum thankfully resumes the role of Dr Ian Malcolm, and Richard Attenborough also reappears as John Hammond (albeit briefly). While Jurassic Park was seen by many as a stalwart family film, Spielberg took a different direction with The Lost World in making it a darker suspense/thriller movie. This is seen even in the character progression, as Goldblum's Malcolm in this film is notably more sceptical and cynical than in the original. Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn both step up well to the main cast, although one of the film's strongest performances comes from Pete Postlethwaite (playing Roland), who lights up the pockets of screen-time in which he features. As in the original, Spielberg pays great attention to the dinosaurs themselves, with superb CGI and animatronics back in full force to make the dinosaurs seem well and truly alive.Ultimately, The Lost World is disputed among viewers. Some claim it's a strong and worthy sequel that builds on its predecessor. Others argue it's not quite as gripping or memorable as the original.

The Found World,"'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' has all the requiring ingredients of the first movie but it doesn't quite match up to the prequel. It is loosely based on Doyle's 'The Lost World' (though not exactly a great adaptation). Yes, there are inconsistencies and the plot isn't flawless (though I'm glad that the fake British family, who appear in the opening sequence, get eaten). I think the main problem is that it's a little too much of everything, that is, too much of what the first movie has. But, this is also what makes 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' more entertaining. The action sequences (with the exception of the cliffhanger scene which went on for too long and dragged a little), the fierce dinosaurs, the acting all work well. I particularly enjoyed the execution of the scene where, through the long grass, the pack of velociraptors narrow in on the soldiers as they make their escape. The acting is quite good even though the characters were, conveniently, a little annoying annoying. Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite and Richard Schiff make a likable ensemble and do a fine job with what was required of them. The special effects are just as good as in the first and the suspense is well maintained. So it falls a little short on storytelling but it's still entertaining.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dinosaur breeding ground,"In The Lord World: Jurassic Park we learn that after the disaster of the Jurassic Park dinosaur theme park developed by Richard Attenborough, there's been a palace coup in his conglomerate. Pete Postelthwaite his greedy nephew has taken over and they want to exploit another island which was used as a breeding ground. So Attenborough assembles a team to stop them including Jeff Goldblum from the original film and Dian Fossey like naturalist Julianne Moore.It's a well equipped military expedition that Postelthwaite mounts to go to that second island. But if you think that makes a difference to the dinosaurs, it's another think coming you have. For both heroes and villains there is enough heart stopping action for 3 Indiana Jones films.Jeff Goldblum has polished up his wry, ironic character to such a degree one can see the beginnings of Detective Zack Nichols from Criminal Intent in this film. Vince Vaughn has a nice turn as a Greenpeace activist on the Attenborough team.Directed once again by Steven Spielberg The Lost World: Jurassic Park is not as good as the original, but miles better than the third dinosaur incarnation in this series. The last part of the film takes place in San Diego where a live specimen of T-Rex has been brought back for exhibit. All I can say is that someone watched both King Kong and Gorgo for the result is a combination of both those films.Two pretty good ones I'd say.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well worked and entertaining blockbuster sequel...couldn't have asked for much more,"This sequel to the 1993 blockbuster tends to get a bad write-up from all corners, but I don't really know why. People complain about it trying to market the brand too much and featuring too many illogical and inconsistent events; but the thing you've got to remember is that this is a sequel to a fantasy blockbuster...so how can you go in expecting anything else. Personally, I've always found this film to be a far more worthwhile dinosaur themed adventure film than the first film; I held that opinion when I first saw it (in my early teens), and upon rewatching it - I'm retaining the same opinion. It has to be said that the sense of wonder is somewhat depleted, but Spielberg seems all the more keen to capitalise on the danger of the situation this time around, and that more than makes up for the fact that we've seen his array of monsters before. The plot simply follows an another excursion into dinosaur territory, only this time the monsters are on an island named 'Isla Sorna' somewhere near Costa Rica, and the lead is Ian Malcolm; by far the most interesting character in the original film.The fact that the lead role has been taken away from Sam Neill is an overall plus point for the film, as Jeff Goldblum makes for a far edgy lead, which suits the theme of this sequel. Goldblum receives good support from an array of talented stars, including Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare, Richard Schiff and; best of all, Pete Postlethwaite, who brings a touch of class to the film in the role of a hunter. Given that it's a sequel, writer David Koepp doesn't need to spend as much time building up the central plot and therefore we get straight into it...which can only be a good thing. The action scenes are really well done, and a variety of different species of dinosaur help to ensure that the film always has enough up its sleeve to remain entertaining. Scenes involving the Tyrannosaurus Rex early on, as well as an awesome sequence involving Velociraptors and long grass are the pick of the action right up until the end; when Spielberg lets rip with the highlight of the entire series, which sees the main dinosaur rampaging down a busy San Francisco high street! Overall, this is not brilliant or a masterpiece; but it's a very good film for what it is and I wouldn't hesitate to rate it as the best of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Lost World: Jurassic Park: A Solid Sequel,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's follow-up to the groundbreaking Jurassic Park, delivers an entertaining adventure filled with dinosaurs and action, yet its plot pales in comparison to its predecessor. While the film boasts impressive visual effects, well-choreographed action sequences, and a return to the awe-inspiring world of dinosaurs, it struggles to capture the narrative depth and emotional resonance that made Jurassic Park so memorable.The film follows a team of scientists and adventurers led by Ian Malcolm as they venture back to Isla Sorna, where the original Jurassic Park's failed dinosaur breeding facility now operates as a wild sanctuary. Their mission is to rescue the dinosaur offspring before they are captured by InGen, the company responsible for the park's creation.While the film delivers on its promise of encounters with these prehistoric creatures, the overall narrative feels less interesting and lacks the compelling pacing of its predecessor.Despite its shortcomings, The Lost World: Jurassic Park still offers an exciting adventure experience. The visual effects, particularly the dinosaurs, are stunning and continue to impress, even by today's standards. The action sequences are well-executed and suspenseful, keeping viewers engaged. And the film's exploration of themes like human hubris and the delicate balance of nature remains relevant today.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a VERY mixed bag,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park has equal amount of good and awful elements. In one end, I see it as an exciting survival-film but at the other end, I see it as a dull, poorly written film with some bad acting.Let's start with the good behalf. This film definitely had a tighter focus on dinosaurs and survival adventures than the first did. So this makes for a rather exciting and thrilling 2nd half where it's just about survival and no documentation nor 2nd subplots with an occasional clever writing to assist. You're constantly fearful that our main team could be brutally devoured by a dinosaur any minute. Considering even the smallest dinosaurs were revealed to be capable of killing. The CGI, though a bit outdated is still impressive for its time.Now for the bad stuff. I personally thought it was way better if they started to go with Alan rather than Ian since I really don't remember what Ian did in the first film. So that leads to basically a side character suddenly in the place of the main protagonist and Jeff Goldblum didn't rock it with the acting. In the end, it leads to a very tedious, un-interesting main protagonist. All of the action, intense scenes, twists before the 1 hour mark is set up in a really dumb way and make little to no sense at all. Sarah and the daughter are a little stupid and I didn't care about the other characters. So when one of the characters from our central team died, I didn't really care about them but still somehow found a way to entertain me anywayOverall, if you stripped out the first's brilliant writing, fleshed out characters, good execution and replaced it with a tighter focus on the dinosaurs, you would get The Lost World: Jurassic ParkRating: 6.4/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So with the help of his friends, Malcolm tries to stop them in order to keep the dinosaurs from not only being exploited but to save his girlfriend who is also on the island. With that action comes the danger and mayhem that you would expect from a sequel to Jurassic Park. Jeff Goldblum is great once again as Ian Malcolm and the new cast starting with Julianne Moore is good as well and the tension and action is up several notches from the original Jurassic Park. While the novelty of the original is gone, Spielberg's magic is still evident and it still delivers.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The ride is still fun,"It's 4 years after the first movie. News of the Jurassic Park have been scrub and misinformation planted. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) has been discredited.

Malcolm's girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there, and Malcolm decide to go to convince her to return.Spielberg has the touch to create a good thrill ride. But this is just a sequel that contributes nothing new to the franchise. He gets the dinosaurs on screen right away, and it doesn't really stop. The action is a little bit more intense.

A Mixed Bag of Roars and Missed Opportunities,"Steven Spielberg's sequel to the groundbreaking Jurassic Park promised more dinosaurs, more action, and more thrills, but while The Lost World: Jurassic Park delivers on spectacle, it struggles to recapture the magic of its predecessor.The story picks up four years after the events of the first film, with Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) reluctantly returning to the dinosaur world-this time on Isla Sorna, a secondary island where dinosaurs roam free. The premise is intriguing, but the execution feels uneven. The characters, including Julianne Moore as paleontologist Sarah Harding and Vince Vaughn as a photographer, lack the depth and charm of the original cast. Jeff Goldblum, while still delivering his trademark sarcasm, feels more subdued, carrying the weight of a lead without much support.The movie certainly ups the ante with bigger set pieces, like the thrilling trailer-over-the-cliff sequence and the T-Rex rampage through San Diego. However, these moments often feel like style over substance, lacking the tension and awe of the first film. The dinosaurs look great-credit to the improved animatronics and CGI-but the novelty of seeing them on screen has worn off, and the story doesn't provide enough emotional or thematic depth to compensate.One of the biggest issues is the script. While The Lost World flirts with interesting ideas about human interference with nature and corporate greed, it never fully explores them. The film's tone is also inconsistent, veering between serious survival drama and cartoonish action. Some plot choices, like bringing a young girl into a dangerous situation or the bizarre gymnastics scene, feel more frustrating than exciting.Despite its flaws, the film isn't without its merits. Spielberg's direction ensures some visually stunning moments, and John Williams' score once again elevates the action. There's still fun to be had for fans of dinosaurs, and a few sequences-like the Velociraptors stalking in the tall grass-stand out as genuinely thrilling.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is an okay sequel that delivers on dinosaur action but lacks the heart, innovation, and sense of wonder that made the first film a classic. It's a serviceable popcorn flick, but for many fans, it feels like a missed opportunity to expand on the brilliance of Jurassic Park.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good action,"""It always starts like this... ooh, ahhh. Then there's running... and screaming.""- Dr. Ian Malcolm While in ""Jurassic Park"" both the 'ooh, ahh' parts and the 'running... and screaming' parts were equally enthralling and captivating, it's mainly the running and screaming that's of interest here. Outside of the opening sequence much of the early section of the film just isn't very interesting.The strength of this franchise as a whole is its setting. The creepy, slightly spooky and weird islands with plenty of rain provide a perfect setting for some inventive dinosaur attacks and dramatic tension. This is why taking the dinosaurs off that island and into civilization was a mistake- it's too familiar. It loses the spookiness and distinctive feel of the 'Lost World' fiction sub-genre and ends up feeling cheap and silly. I'd say that from about thirty minutes in until the last thirty minutes this film is on par with the first installment in terms of pacing, characterization, and dialogue... then it deteriorates. The film never gets bad enough for it to be unwatchable but there are mediocre parts here in addition to the exciting parts.The characters are solid as well as the cast. Dr. Alan Grant is sorely missed, but Malcolm is fun enough to compensate. Dr. Sarah Harding played by Julianne Moore is a good supporting character as is Pete Postlethwaite's Captain Ahab-esquire Roland Tembo. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is solid here and although Spielberg doesn't seem to be very inspired here he is a professional and knows how to make a film work.If it wasn't for the dull opening half hour and the misguided final act this would have been a consistently entertaining, action-packed romp. Sadly, it wasn't to be. Still, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is far, far from the garbage some would have you believe it is and is actually a solid action/adventure film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A very good sequel with a weak 1st act,"After a surprisingly - and non-common in Spielberg's career - messy first act, this delivers all the goods when embraces all its action and craziness.I think the cliff scene marks the point when this turns from a pretty normal film to a really exciting sequel. From that point we have Spielberg and Spielberg all over again with funny and very well constructed sequences and some of his well known tricks. Another positive point? Oh the man knows how to create and introduce new characters - characters we love and characters we hate!With really impressive visual effects, it's curious that the cinematography doesn't shine - in fact, it's kind of ugly what we see - but it's also curious that the score is quite different from the first one, reminding sometimes some other films in the jungle, which it works.This is not perfect. The plot is weak, it doesn't have the magic of the first one and Spielberg seemed in an autopilot mode for the first 40 minutes. However, it tries to be a totally different film than JP and achieves it, with more action, tension and a much stronger military presence. Oh and the San Diego scene is short but so cool!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Worthy Sequel,"Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland.Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original.Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie.Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame.The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie.Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Just because they could make a squeal, did anyone stop to ask if they should? (Ok, that was too easy)","The only thing good about this film being made was that it gave the team of ILM and Stan Winston a chance to improve their skills with dinosaur simulation technology, other than that it was a remarkable waste of talent.I read Jurassic Park AFTER seeing the movie and loved the book. Subsequently, I read Lost World BEFORE seeing the movie and knew there could be trouble.  The book was extremely contrived so I had hoped the movie under the right direction would prevail.  Well it didn't, in fact it went in just the opposite direction.Not only was the film 100 times more contrived, it suffered from poor casting and direction as well.  At times this film is laugh out loud bad, much so it doesn't really warrant any further discussion unless after seeing it, you disagree with me.With that said, watch this film with your finger poised on the fast forward button so you can quickly get to the great effect scenes. My only hope is that the makers of JP III learned something from the story failure of JP II. I'm not holding my breath.Oh, before I let you go...if anyone who has seen this film can explain to me how a T-Rex (the only dinosaur on the ship) got into the control bridge of the cargo ship and ate the crew (left a hand on the wheel), left the room pretty much intact, then managed to get trapped in the cargo hold before the ship crashed into the dock...I'd like to know.

The first Jurassic Park movie took its time to build tension and explain a lot about dinosaurs. This time, the explanation is minimal and the movie jumps almost right into the action. After that, it's just a series of action scenes in which a lot of people get eaten.The point is, you can tell from beforehand which people will survive, and you don't care about the characters that do get killed because they have no depth at all, you usually don't even know their name. On top of that, a lot scenes seem to have been omitted from the movie, as their is often no cohesion between the scenes, and the 'story' jumps in all directions, including a totally unnecessary trip to L.A.To sum it up: this movie is incredibly shallow and lacks any kind of involvement.

The Last good film in the Jurassic Park series,"The public had to sit though several bad Jurassic films though out the years, at least we have two great movies that at least entertaining enough to keep our interest. The second of the two called ""The Lost World"" is the last good film of the series, which is a shame because they could have continued the series in an intelligent way but they resorted to make B monster movies with Jurassic Park 3 to Jurassic World fallen kingdom. Jeff Goldblum and Sir Richard Attenborough return with a new cast of characters to save the Dinosaurs of Site B from corperate raiders who want to exploit them and take them to the mainland in Spielberg's sequel to his original film,
which is scarier and more action packed. The hanging trailer and the grass scene still pack a wallop and Goldblum is as cool and as funny as ever.

Lost World: Jurassic Park delivers high-octane action and thrilling dino-drama,"""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a thrilling and action-packed sequel to the classic ""Jurassic Park."" The story picks up where the first film left off, with John Hammond inviting a team of scientists and adventurers to visit Isla Sorna, the island where the dinosaurs were created. However, things quickly go awry when the dinosaurs on the island prove to be far more dangerous than anticipated.The special effects in this film are truly spectacular, with the dinosaurs looking even more realistic and terrifying than in the first film. The action scenes are intense and pulse-pounding, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film. The cast, led by Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn, deliver strong performances and bring depth to their characters.While the plot may not be as tight as the original, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" still manages to deliver a thrilling and enjoyable ride. It's a must-watch for fans of the first film and anyone who loves a good adventure movie. Overall, this film is a worthy addition to the Jurassic Park franchise and a great continuation of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"More of a showpiece than the first, but it's left lacking depth","It does exactly what it says on the back of the DVD and i quote - 'The blockbuster sequel with even more dinosaurs, more action and more breathtaking visual effects than its record breaking predecessor'However it does this at the expense of the character development and the plot; both of these are compromised to give more screen time to the dinosaurs and the action sequences, so it really comes down to what you are after in a film. If it's fairly good action and stunning CGI dinosaurs and chases that you want, this film delivers; if your after something with a bit more depth then you may be left wanting.Personally i found this was great fun to watch, but i found myself routing for the dinosaurs, they had more character than the cast, don't get me wrong, the cast is sufficient, their just not as compelling to watch as the dinosaurs.7/10 for the fun of the experience",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This time, the dinosaurs are on another island and a large group of people come to stop the dinosaurs from killing.

Much worse than the first.,"Making a follow-up to a masterpiece is no small feat, but who better to make a sequel to Spielberg's best film than Spielberg himself? Well, probably nobody but that just shows what a hard task this must have been. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is nowhere near as as good as the original. It's not even close. Spielberg's touches are evident in the film, however, and thankfully that means we get a few good sequences (such as the RV scene) that are genuinely tense, exciting and well-crafted. Unfortunately though, these sequences are few and far between, undermined by a seriously silly storyline and screenplay that make this film feel like a parody of the first. Having characters that use gymnastics to fight dinosaurs and ones that would rather accompany the same space as a T-Rex than a snake really highlight the shortcomings of the screenplay. Even Jeff Goldblum can't save this, mainly because the 'Ian Malcolm' in this film is completely different from that in the last. At least the visual effects are up to scratch again (except from the obvious control blatantly seen on one of the animatronic dinosaurs' legs) and the soundtrack by John Williams is good, without being a copy of the first films'. Overall, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is a massive let-down that, apart from everything else, is actually quite boring. 'Jurassic Park' is Spielberg's best film. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is one of his worst. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A sad excuse for a marketable film,"The book was far better. Of COURSE it was. you Cannot have a movie that competes with a book. By there very nature, Books are a more involved and complex medium. So, even though the book was better, I will have to let Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World, stand alone, on its own merits.Suddenly my review drops five points. The Lost World is perhaps the most ridiculous excuse for a movie I have seen in my entire life, a travesty and an insult to science fiction lovers everywhere. the plot is hackneyed, with several characters acting seemingly randomly in order to bring around the next ""twist."" But perhaps the worst part of this already abysmal movie is its ""paint by numbers"" feel.Within every scene in which someone would die, the Velociraptor/Compy/T-rex would take them behind the /Waterfall/Log/Sign and thin watery blood would Drip off its teeth/flow down the river/Splash through the water. Every action sequence is the same, and every dialogue completely predictable.This movie was depressing in its make-up, an obvious plea for money by exploiting an already milked concept. Avoid it. At all costs. And if you can't, or didn't... then I feel your pain",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun Movie with Clichéd Story Line,"I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video.The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same ""monster/alien versus man"", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the ""we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives"" cliché for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene.I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already.The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun.I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating?I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids ""Who wants to go to the park?!"" Going to see ""Jurassic Park"" seemed so natural to take your kids, right??TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster.I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract.Case in point: I recall watching ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there ""weren't enough"". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy.Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers.Over and out.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not That Bad,"Even though this movie is long and very drawn out doesn't mean it's a horrible movie. Hey I know it's not better than the first and the third, but it is sure a thrill ride.

YOU try topping the $913 million 1993 blockbuster!,"I must admit, after viewing The Lost World I felt like I had just experienced a below-par Steven Spielberg film. But, I DO NOT blame him, for the creative genius is at work in this film. The main reason the failure of the movie is the story. A clear indication was given that Michael Crichton was probably pressured into writing a sequel novel just for the sake of another movie. The story seems very rushed, sort of a last minute job. It was going to be hard to top 1993's original hit, so you can't really expect it to be better. The Lost World has its moments as the Spielberg touch is there, such as the raptors creeping up behind the party in the long grass.....but there are so little moments of coolness that you'll think this is just regurgitating the 1993 flick's ideas. The visual effects have improved since 1993, so the dinos (especially the raptors) have much greater movement, which can look good.....but the terror isn't there. The original movie was quite frightening (much like Jaws), but this sequel isn't quite as frightening. It's more like a CG feast. But overall, Spielberg tried with what he had, and got a less than average response. When you have a blockbuster that was as big as Jurassic Park was in 1993, it's extremely hard to top it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining after first 40 minutes,"For the first 40 minutes or so, I had a hard time believing this was directed by Spielberg. The first film had some great writing, especially in terms of every single dialogue that goes along with the themes it wanted to present but here the dialogue is atrocious, the direction feels awkward in a lot of places and the beginning really felt like a bad low budget monster movie. But after the setup for everything is done and the ""action"" starts it gets really good. Then the movie hooks you till the end with everything happening in it. The first movie used a lot of stuff in a smart way, it was supposed to be a park and most of it happened at night. Here a lot of such caution is thrown out. The confidence in the animatronics is a bit too much which I don't think has aged as good as the first one, and the way the first one used the unseen is also not fully utilized here. But the movie is pretty entertaining after the first 40 minutes, wish it had better writing.I'd be definitely down to watch King Lear starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tsunami Sunrise starring Tom Hanks. They gave a lot of thought for a 20 second scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Much more cluttered, far less enjoyable dinosaur island romp loosely trying expand on the first but also head in fresh directions - it just ends up blunt and uninteresting.","Author Edwin Page has American director Quentin Tarantino quoted as saying, upon the 1997 release of Jackie Brown - his third film, that after being asked how he would go about ""topping"" his preceding release Pulp Fiction, Tarantino replied that he didn't think he would, and thus tried ""deliberatley"" to go ""underneath"" his 1994 crime film masterwork; to try and undercut what was a large-and-in-charge genre piece with something a little subtler and a little more underplayed but both equally as substantial and enthralling. It's too bad Spielberg's Jurassic Park sequel came out as early on in the calender year of 1997 as it did, since a similar train of thought needs to be applied to it; the film, a mouthful in itself entitled The Lost World: Jurassic Park, wanting to go bigger and better than that of its 1993 blockbuster counterpart with larger clumps of characters; more monsters and a heavy later reliance on off-the-wall content which isn't even set on dystopian islands as much as it comes across as the director patting himself on the back for being able to pay homage to Godzilla.Returning from the first film is Jeff Goldblum's doctor of mathematics Ian Malcolm, a man now riding subways to meet with the entrepreneur of the last film's titular Jurassic Park, John Hammond (Attenborough), at his stately home home rather than travelling with said gentleman on helicopters to touch down on tropical paradises rich with the latest scientific breakthroughs. Times are tough for Malcolm, his whistle blowing on what happened in the first film has people ignominiously confront or stare at him, whilst his funding from certain institutes has been cut due to these ill received tales. The company predominantly behind Hammond's enterprise, InGen, appear to be taking over; their grey suits and blunt tones replacing that of the kindly elderly man act Hammond fronts for the organisation, as we observe him worn and somewhat frail.The reason for Malcolm's summoning lies with the fact a second site of dinosaurs and such is becoming a nuisance, a second site verbally established as this locale less secure than that of the first film's and much more dangerous; a place Hammond desires Malcolm to venture toward so as to lay claim to it prior to InGen's newfound fondness to exploit. He is only convinced upon discovering girlfriend Sarah Harding, played by Julianne Moore, has already gone there by herself. A scene in a large warehouse full of technology and equipment is meant to help quell fears of these characters not being able to deal with the dinosaur threat, a threat put across during the film's very first scene in which a child wonders from her rich, holidaying family and is mauled by some of the smaller beasties the result of this second site – that sense of the yet unseen larger ones probably capable of a lost worse prominent.Malcolm is stuck with an infant of his own, that of Kelly (Lee Chester), whom came about as the result of his Lothario nature he established himself to possess in the first film. He has a rift with Kelly - like the Alan Grant character and his problem with children in the first film, there is a brief alluding to how they cannot quite connect with one another, and we are lead into wondering if what later transpires within their collative quest will help quell that. We are correct to, but it isn't evident enough throughout the film to actually amount to anything special, and certainly isn't enough in the way of character substance to carry the picture. Goldblum's character is the audience's beacon of recognition once everyone is on the island. Around him are nobodies in the form of his underexposed daughter and two nothing supporting acts in photographer Nick (Vaughn) and weapons expert Eddie (Schiff). Goldblum, a veteran of the first film in the mould of what we are, provides warnings and reiterations toward the supporting acts-plus their sense of being awestruck upon first seeing the prehistorical creatures. These are humorous and self reflective of how easily we were once caught up in the first film and its respective bringing to life of these creatures prior to being caught out by the terror of it all.The film is a mostly underwhelming experience, an exercise in second unit direction that does not carry the wonder of the first nor the sense of craft at work which was wholly evident during the first film. Not long after InGen's own team have arrived with pomp and circumstance does the film wane; Eddie's justification that he doesn't want to shoot a dinosaur threatening one of his own team out of the fact it's protecting its young in stark contrast to InGen's ravaging of certain dinosaur hordes for their own prerogatives. One set piece sees Spielberg manage to riff on the first film too much in one go to keep the film feeling distanced enough from its 1993 cousin, a set piece in which the mud and the rain and the dark act as backdrops to a hapless character trying to tie a tow chord around a tree as a truck hovers agonisingly over the side of a cliff – all this whilst hostile variants of the dinosaurs located therein loom in the area. Where it wants to go broader and better, it just comes off as slack and goofy; a film lacking the rawness and wonder of the first and just ending up confused and sporadic in ways that are, frankly, quite dull.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They managed to ruin a good book,"The film really disappointed me. The first ""Jurassic Park"" was a film with amazing effects where the story didn't get in the way. After seeing ""Jurassic Park"" I read the books, and I think ""Lost World"" was a fairly good book. It also had an interesting message: The ecosystem heavily depends on the behaviour of the animals. The more intelligent life gets (and the raptors are portrayed as rather intelligent) the more their behaviour depends on education - passed from parents to their children. The first generation of animals on that island were or course raised without parents, thus missing their education. Their behaviour was not ""natural"", making a functional ecology on that island impossible. The project was doomed from the beginning.The movie completely dismissed this point of view, rather giving the opposite message: Those dinosaurs will form a functioning ecology if we let them in peace. They left out any intellectual interesting concept of the book, instead relying only on cliches (big companies are evil, evil men are dumb etc.) and on the special effects. Which, by the way, didn't seem to have been improved since the first part.Summary: A mediocre film saved only a little by the fascination we have for dinosaurs.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A very good follow up.,"4 years after the events of Jurassic Park, John Hammond calls on Ian Malcolm and asks if he'd like to visit Jurassic Park Site B, an island without fences or boundaries where the dinosaurs were bred. Hammond wants to send Malcolm and three others to see how the dinosaurs are surviving. Ian initially refuses, but when he finds out that his scientist girlfriend is already on the island, he decides to go on a rescue mission. Upon arrival, the team discovers that Hammond's nephew has sent in another team to capture the dinosaurs for another attraction...This time in San Diego. The Lost World: Jurassic Park features more dinosaurs, more action, and the lack of boundaries gives it a more natural feel, making for a really exciting action film.One of my pet peeves is when a director doesn't want to do a sequel for his own movie. Luckily, Steven Spielberg knew this movie would be good and stayed on. His perfect style of direction is ever present making the style of the movie just as fitting as the first time around. I personally think the plot of this movie is better than the first. I like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World for the same reason. I like a plot that involves dinosaurs running free on an island. It allows for better and more open action scenes. The Velociraptors are far more terrifying than in the first film, and the addition of another T-Rex is genius. All of the new dinosaurs in this film are perfectly done. Quite honestly, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just as good as the first in all ways but one...The acting.Jeff Goldblum was never a favourite actor of mine, but I thought he was okay in Jurassic Park. In this movie, he's back to the way I know him. He talks in that stupid voice all the time that he's been stereotyped with, and he is so wooden that it makes the giant trees surrounding him look like better actors. Vince Vaughn plays the same character he always does, the wise cracker with a funny voice. I'd have to say the best acting job in the film is done by Pete Postlethwaite, who plays a hunter intent on bagging a T-Rex.Overall, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just as good as it's predecessor, but the acting is a little off.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Something has survived.,"Think we saw the last of those pesky dinosaurs from the original Jurassic Park? Think again. This time around we are going to another island, called Site B. It's here where the dinosaurs actually run free, no cages. Which means that the filmmakers have up the ante a bit. Our humans are stuck on this island while another group of humans decide to go hunting. For some strange reason the film finishes with the T-REX running around San Diego.How can a film live up to the original? The first was such a huge moment in blockbuster history. Well we are giving no Sam Neil and more Jeff Goldblum. The sequel, is a little too ambitious that it loses itself in all of its grandeur. How could they raise the stakes in this film? Well, for one they thrown the characters into a world that they have absolutely no control over. No cages, no wires or buildings. This is a natural and free environment, this is the dino-environment. Second, we have a freaking T-REX run around San Diego. Yup, to raise the stakes they needed to bring one of those guys back. In a way it feels like a failed King Kong experiment.The Lost World gives fans what they wanted, more raptors. Yet these raptors are different, more deadly apparently. Velociraptors, yippie, yet they can be taken out by a little girl because she is also a gymnast. Yes, people still moan about that scene and there is a good reason for it. It is utterly ridiculous. I can forgive a character being scared of a snake and getting killed by the Rex, but not that damn gymnastic scene.Vince Vaughn is in this flick and I think after this and Psycho, he decided that comedy was his one and only place to be. Sure he tried again with The Cell and Domestic Disturbance, but both films failed. He's not bad here, but he also seems out of his element. I wouldn't mind seeing him in another film like this though, give him another chance, but his strong elements are clearly comedy.Lost World is not as great as the original, but it's also not the travesty people make it out to be. There are many parts in the film that don't live up to the expectations it sets out for itself. The San Diego sequence is insane and you either love it or hate it. I remember seeing this film in the theatres when I was a kid, my opinion of it has lessened since then. I was 10 then, I'm 22 now. It almost feels like the Temple of Doom of the series. It's something kids love but adults seem to roll their eyes at. But that would have to make Jurassic Park III good, when it's just like this one, mediocre.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Even Tyrannosaurids were at least partially feathered at one point in time. Sure, it looks awesome, but still... *slap in the face to.... yeah*Now take Velociraptor. The actual velociraptor was small. The raptors in the movie didn't even have realistic proportions. people can whine about how it was ""actually based off of utahraptor"" and whatnot, but even after that argument, the creatures shared the same things that velociraptor did, being of the same Dromaeosaurid kinship.I could keep going, but yeah... haha. I'm sure you guys don't wanna hear me moan about this crap anymore. Just don't write a paper in school using this movie as reference. You will be laughed at.Now as i said, its full of beautiful graphics, wonderful suspense, and has a nice pre-historic atmosphere. They do a great job of making these creatures look alive. It is recommended for young adults that love dinosaurs. Older people might not like it that much, aside from the purdy CG, due to the corny acting, But as i stated, it is great for kids.

Plots decent but it takes a while to get interesting,"Way too overhated. I fully understand why people don't like this, there nowhere near as much philosophy brought up and the stuff that is kinda feels like a retread of the original. The plot feels a little forced and somewhat contradicts what we see in the first movie. Ian Malcom returns in this and while he is enjoyable, he feels a lot more boring and weirdly has less personality in this. Ian Malcom is also the main character, however unlike the first films protagonist Ian Malcom has no real arc and isn't quite as investing and yet sadly he is the most interesting character (meanwhile the first was built of almost only interesting characters). All that being said, this film is so entertaining to watch. The action set pieces are so ambitious, tense, creative and really fun to watch. While I don't like a lot of the plot I also think the protective T-Rex is an awesome element to the story. I will say another issue with this film is the first hour is probably the least interesting, it's more about the uninteresting characters and setting up the plot with a small amount of action throughout, the second half though is action packed. Nearly every scene has a cool set piece, and there's a lot of somewhat interesting story elements they introduce. While the final 15 minutes feels incredibly random even that is super entertaining and adds a lot to this film even if it suspends believability a tad. This film has so many great moments and it really does make this it much better than it gets credit for in my opinion. It's no where near the first, but I'm not so sure it has to be it was never going to be better than the first but I think the tense action thriller we got is still a very fun dinosaur movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Unfortunately not even Spielberg cannot make good cake out of bad ingredients. The script and story line is poor, very poor. Acting is poor also.

Jurassic Park II,Jurassic Park is the better movie. I'm sure a lot of fans wanted the second movie to be better than the first movie (Jurassic Park). It just wasn't. I'm not a fan of these Dinosaur movies. I now want to see Jurassic Park II a few times instead of Jurassic Park. The Lost World is more adventurous than Jurassic Park. The Lost World is underrated. I don't get it with these movies - Dinosaur's are no fun. Which characters would want to get on an adventure with them? Just the stupid ones. Dinosaurs are monstrous.

"But If They Didn't Tease the Dinosaurs, They Wouldn't Have a Movie","""The Lost World"" (hereafter TLW) is the epitome of the ""Idiot Plot"" movie. As defined by critic Roger Ebert, an ""Idiot Plot"" movie is one that has ""..a plot that requires all the characters to be idiots. If they weren't, they'd immediately figure out everything and the movie would be over."" Oh, where to start with the inanities this movie's characters commits? From the beginning, I suppose:1. Industrialist Hammond (Richard Attenborough) recruits the decidedly cynical intellectual Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to keep tabs on occasional scientist/girlfriend (Juliette Moore) as she investigates the breeding dinosaur colony on Site B island. Wouldn't more physically adventurous and pragmatic Alan Grant (Sam O'Neill) be a more logical choice?2. Moore's scientist is supposed to study the dinosaurs unobtrusively. So why does she bring a laboratory trailer the size of a boxcar with which to crash through the jungle?3. Moore's scientist startles an infant stegosaurus with a noisy flash camera and nearly gets decapitated by an infuriated adult's spiked tail.4. Ian's high-maintenance brat daughter Vanessa stows away on the trip to Site B and jeopardizes Ian's safety by wanting to go into the ""high hide"" (a suspended cage) when two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer.5. The two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer because solicitous photographer (Vince Vaughn) brings their injured infant for Moore's scientist to set its fractured leg. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the lab trailer is hurled off a cliff, with Ian, Moore's character, and Vaughn's character nearly following suit.6. Ian and company free the dinosaurs that were captured in the round-up conducted by InGen's mercenaries for transport to a San Diego zoo. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the animals stampede and destroy all communication with the outside world, forcing the two enemies to join forces to travel to the interior towards an abandoned radar post.7. An InGen mercenary strays from the group into unknown wilderness to urinate. A herd of tiny Compsognathus fatally mutilate him. Another mercenary would have heard him, if not for his MP3 headphones.8. For some inexplicable reason, Moore's scientist takes a blood-soaked denim jacket and hangs it within her tent, allowing one of the tyrannosaurs to track and nearly slaughter all the group.9. Supposedly wilderness-experienced mercenaries allow themselves to be picked off by the original villains in Jurassic Park in tall grass.10. Why wasn't the captured tyrannosaurus properly tranquilized on the abortive trip to San Diego? Moore's scientist mumbles something about not being able to calibrate the dosage properly. However, when the tyrannosaur is corralled back into the ship, Moore's scientist fires a tranquilizer dart. Why didn't she do that earlier and prevent the rampage?11. The tyrannosaur visits a house with a swimming pool to satisfy its thirst. The family inside takes a picture of him with another noisy flash camera right in the eyes. The tyrannosaur roars (and presumably kills the family).12. Hammond's villainous nephew steals the infant brought to lure the tyrannosaur back and brings it to the ship. The tyrannosaur traps him there, cripples him, and lets the infant practice his killing skills.13. Towards the end of the movie, Hammond mentions that the Site B dinosaurs ""require our absence"" in order to flourish. Now he tells us!Despite this cavalcade of stupidity, I have a grudging affection for TLW and even own it on VHS. After all, we should be grateful the characters teased the dinosaurs because they were quite spectacular, and dynamic, and were the sole reason for TLW at all!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Jurassic Park Movie,"I personally think that Jurassic Park 2 was the best movie of the trilogy, having not seen Jurassic World.The CGI effects in this movie are very superb and the action scenes are played out very well.Jeff Goldblum does a very good portrayal of his previous character Dr. Ian Malcolm,from the first Jurassic Park in this movie, taking a main character role this time around.There's a lot more action in this film than the first one, and there are definitely some parts of the film that will keep you on the edge of your seat more so than the first film.Personally I felt this was a much more entertaining film in the first Jurassic Park and should be treated as such.

Still Remains the best sequel to the original Jurassic Park,"While it does not hold the wow and nostalgia factor of the original ""Jurassic Park"", ""The Lost World"" in my opinion still remains the best and most worthy sequel to that landmark film.

S-O-O-O-O-O much better than the first one,"Even if the plot is just a rehash of King Kong.There is an obvious parallel with Alien(s): Vol. 1 is a thriller, Vol. 2 is an action picture. For Vol. 3, Jeff Goldblum will need a reason to shave his head and/or give birth. There is also a parallel with Wayne's World 1 and 2: the first one was stupid, the second less stupid.Jurassic Park was for kids. The Lost World is a light snack for adults with lots of funny dialogue. This film might be Dumb, but the first one was definitely Dumber. I don't recall a Hemingway joke in Jurassic Park. And The Lost World doesn't have dinosaurs who know how to open doors, or roll cigarettes with one hand (sorry, that last one's a bit of an embellishment).The Lost World does not have a repeat of that horrible, obnoxious, rude, unladylike Laura Dern character from the first one, thank goodness. The Julianne Moore character is the substitute here, although she is not without her problems. She is responsible for the sickeningly cute injured baby dino plot element which is the chief give-me-a-break issue this time around.

Pales in comparison to the original,"'The Lost World' is nowhere near as fun, impressive, or as well done as it's ground breaking predecessor, 1993's Jurassic Park, but on it's own terms, it is still an okay time passer. To watch it at home, especially on VHS with a limited sound system (it isn't even out on DVD yet), is an absolute waste, to fully appreciate what there is to appreciate, you must see it in theaters.The characters are paper-thin, and the dialog they are given is often very unrealistic. In the first movie the script was witty, and fun, in this it is an absolute bore. Jeff Goldblum isn't the best lead, Sam Neill would've been better, but he does a good job with the extremely limited material. As Goldblum's daughter, Vanessa Lee Chester is likely one of the worst actresses to appear in a Spielberg film. Even so, it isn't all her fault, it's mostly the script. The producers made a horrible choice when they decided to ignore Michael Crichton's bestselling novel of the same name, and come up with their own story line, as the one featured in this movie is a small step above horrid.Likely the film's best quality, John Williams somehow created an all-new soundtrack featuring excellent music, similar to the original and just as good.This is probably Spielberg's worst film, and it actually might be a good thing that he bowed out of the third film, at least as far as directing goes.On it's own, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is an okay film, not very deep, but quite flashy on the surface with the wonderful dinosaur special effects. Don't rent it on video, even on DVD, once it comes out on it, instead (only if you haven't seen the movie, and live in a city of 1,000,000+) wait for it to be brought back to the theaters, it was a big enough hit to be resurrected for a showing or two.5/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A decent sequel to a hard to beat original,"There is one thing that Hollywood does to screw itself up, and that is to create a movie that they know will generate sequels, but they make the original too good that it will make the sequels look bad.

Such as trying to be more extreme than the first (bringing the monsters to mainland, and more detailed chase and kill scenes).Although I was not expecting near to the brilliance as the first, and you can't expect that, I thought it this movie would support the first one better than it did.Although not as good as the first, this movie does entertain and is likeable and thus rates a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

More terror and suspense with the dinosaurs,"I couldn't disagree more with those who say THE LOST WORLD is an awful movie.  I have seen it many times in the cinema and on video; and for my money, this is a fine continuation of the JURASSIC PARK story.  This time, it is revealed by ambitious billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) that the genetically engineered dinosaurs on Isla Nublar were actually bred on Isla Sorna, situated 87 miles from Nublar.  Thus far, the Isla Sorna dinosaurs have remained in isolation.  But the Isla Nublar disaster has resulted in Attenborough losing control of his InGen corporation to his unscrupulous nephew (Arliss Howard), who wants to bring the dinosaurs back to the as-yet-unfinished Jurassic Park complex in San Diego.The only people standing in his way are chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Goldblum's daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester), his girlfriend (Julianne Moore), and two other men (Richard Schiff, Vince Vaughan).  More terror and suspense ensue as both Goldblum's and Howard's teams come face-to-face with the island's dinosaur populace.  And while Goldblum only loses Schiff from his team and manages to get the rest off the island, Howard still manages to get one T-rex and her infant back to San Diego.  The mayhem continues there.I give this film a 9 rather than the 10 I gave to the original, because not all of the special effects work is exactly as great as before.  But I think those who condemn Spielberg's sequel out of hand are sadly mistaken.  This has enough Hitchcock-style black humor to satisfy; and the sequence of Goldblum and his team trapped in a trailer being overturned and pushed over the cliff by the T-rex is one of the most hair-raising sequences I have ever seen on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Smashingly good film!,"My vote is 7/10. That means good. Steven Spielberg continues to amaze me and I really enjoyed his ""Lost World"". I learned that Steven Spielberg is the most famous director of all time and that many of his movies are very good. For me it is very true. For me it seemed that the Lost World movie had better actions than in the first part. It had more ""rush"" if you understand what I mean (more running). Steven Spielberg created very good dinosaurs and created such a peaceful, soft music very relaxing. The dinosaurs I preferred the most are the T-Rex. They are better dino and more scarry than the other ones. I saw the film already twice. The actions were so hard and so powerful. Congratulation! The director is a genius! The actors were also amazing in it. They played very well. The two scenes I liked the most were the T-Rex intrudes when they were attacking people on the island and chasing them through the forest. My other favorite one was the big T-Rex attacking a town in America. My brother didn't really like the movie and thought that it was medium like film. He preferred the first part. Everybody has a different opinion.My opinion: 1 Oscar for best action film, 1 Oscar for very good music, 1 Oscar for best dino,and last Oscar for best director. In total I will add 4 Oscars for it.

The movie was made darker than that of the first and it was also a box office success, grossing $618 million worldwide, although the movie itself was not of critical acclaim on the bases mostly because fans had to wait 4 years to see this, and though it did have an excellent CGI, the story was not as thrilling as the first, and the cast was not as engaging.The movie plot didn't have Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) in it at all, even the park genius John Hammond and his grandchildren Lex and Tim, just appeared briefly in the beginning of the movie.The movie focuses on Jeff Goldblum who played Dr. Ian Malcolm the Chaos theorist.The film picks up four years after the events of Jurassic Park, and Dr. Ian has gone everywhere telling everybody who cares to know about what he faced in Jurassic Park. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who had lost control of InGen to his nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), invited Malcolm to his home to ask him to escort a team to a place called Site B.John explained to Malcolm that the island of Isla Sorna, also known as ""Site B"", is the island where the dinosaurs were initially engineered and nurtured for a few months, before being moved to the location of the park.He further explained that after the Jurassic Park incident, a hurricane destroyed the containment facilities on Isla Sorna, and the dinosaurs have been living free in the wild ever since, and they have found a way to survive.Malcolm initially refuses thinking back on the events and his near survival from the park four years ago, but agrees after learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is part of the team and is already there at the island.So we are back with the dinosaurs again with only Malcolm having an idea of what they are capable of.There were scenes in the movie where the camera angles were well positioned, but the movie screenplay lapsed in thrills.Other than the movie not being so a good sequel, many elements from the original Jurassic Park novel that was not in the first film were used here.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Exciting sequel,"A lot of people may not have liked ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", but I'm not one of them. This is Steven Spielberg's very exciting sequel to his 1993 box office smash. It doesn't quite top the original, but it comes close. ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" is a much darker adventure. This time the action takes place on a different island 80 miles from where the first movie took place. Dinosaurs are roaming around and about on this island with no electric fences to block their way like on Jurassic Park. Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who goes to this place when he finds out from Dr. John Hammon (Sir Richard Attenborough) that his girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there. Once Dr. Malcolm gets there, along with a photographer (Vince Vaughn), a field equipment expert (Richard Schiff), and his daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester), he reunites with his woman and tries to warn her of the dangers that lurk around. Then more trouble comes. A second expedition steps foot on the island and what they plan to do is take the dinosaurs off the island to a theme park on the U.S. mainland. Things don't go as planned for either expedition when the dinosaurs begin to wreck havoc. The special effects are just as impressive as they were in the first film, with some new dinosaurs that weren't featured in ""Jurassic Park"". The sound effects are loud and scary as you would expect. But then again you would expect ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" to be a triumph in the technical departments. If there is one weakness here its with the human characters. The characters are a bit weaker than the characters from the first movie. The cast here is a good one though not as good as the cast in the original. One might expect Sam Neill or Laura Dern to drop in.

Spielberg a victim of his own success,"The bar was set so high with Jurassic Park, and the sequel so anticipated, it's unfortunate that The Lost World turned out to feel like such a letdown.John Hammond is losing a power struggle and his InGen company to his nephew, Peter Ludlow. Ludlow plans to raid 'Site B', an island with dinosaurs, and set up a new dinosaur theme park on the mainland. Hammond, in an effort to garner public support in leaving the island as a natural preserve, sends four people, including Ian Malcolm from the first movie, to document the dinosaurs in their natural habitat.The problems first; they mainly lie with the script and the human characters. The plot has numerous holes; notably with a sequence involving a ship and escaped dinosaur near the end. The protagonists behave recklessly, especially around dinosaurs, and their actions put themselves and others in danger. InGen's mercenaries initially appear to be prepared, but as the movie goes on, act as if they've never been in the wild before.Even Spielberg is not on his game here. That being said, he still is able to create more tension and suspense in this movie than any of the Jurassic World movies. I get the sense Spielberg understands the world Michael Crichton created with his novels far more than any of the other directors in this film franchise do. The Tyrannosaurs and velociraptors are still scary; which is never the case in Colin Trevorrow's universe. ""The long grass"" scene is nightmare fuel.The T-Rex probably suffers from overexposure in this movie, whether the San Diego monster movie sequence was necessary is debatable.The Lost World is dark, gritty and violent, more so than the original Jurassic Park was. It is a disappointing follow up to the fantastic Jurassic Park, but it still has thrilling sequences. The special effects and the dinosaurs themselves are still top notch.

Opening scene of young girl feeding a Compsognathus (compy) in the grass and being bitten.2.  Sarah HARDING's character being an expert in carnivores3.  Stegosaurs with offspring4.  T-rex hunted down and shot with tranquilizer dart by Roland Tembo (in 1st JP novel, Muldoon hunted down rex in this manner).5.  Dieter slides down hill to be pecked to death by group of Compies (in 1st JP novel Hammond met his demise this way!).6.

Pteradons appear at the end of the film (they were involved in an aerial attack in first JP novel and this almost became a complete scene with them in this movie but was cut in favour of the  ""Rex does Godzilla"" scene late into production).I personally loved this movie because it included those scenes that I wished were in the first film but didn't appear.This film is Jurassic park part 2 the same way Superman 2 flows into Superman the movie.Well done Spielberg, can't wait for the third in the trilogy.PS The other thing I like about both of the JP movies is that not one dinosaur is killed by a human in either film, thereby not reducing the dinos to the role of simple monsters.9/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Just follow the screams.""","The Lost World: Jurassic Park, or Jurassic Park II as most people have called it, is one of those sequels that existed primarily because Jurassic Park made lots and lots of money. That's not to say that The Lost World is a terrible movie, but it reeked of ""we only made this to make more money."" Even when i read the Michael Crichton book, I had the same feeling. The book did irk me more than the movie did. In the book, Crichton killed off a character who all of a sudden was magically alive in the sequel. At least in the movie, the people who were dead in Jurassic Park stayed dead in The Lost World. This movie follows Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) who becomes the only member of the party who toured Jurassic Park to go public with his story. Now a scientific outcast, Malcom is offered the chance to check out a second dinosaur island for former owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). Malcom goes to the island with a new party of Dr. Harding (Julianne Moore), Nick (Vince Vaughn), and Eddie (Richard Schiff), with a special appearance by Ian's daughter from a previous marriage (Vanessa Lee Chester). Spielberg takes the stories in directions that are not as interesting as Jurassic Park went. The one terrifying scene comes via a cliché moment, with a van's windshield slowly cracking under the weight of one of our heroes. The true story of The Lost World involves another party of explorers, this time funded by Hammond's old company who wants to revive Jurassic Park, this time in San Diego. This subplot ushers in one of the silliest, non-needed series of events to happen in the long career of Steven Spielberg.

Spielberg's touch not strong enough for sequel...,"Not having read the Michael Crichton novels about dinosaurs, I can only base my comments here on the earlier 'Jurassic Park' movie that was clearly more intriguing than this sequel.However, comparisons aside, 'The Lost World' stands on its own as a pretty fair adventure film with the usual assortment of ominous threats from creatures on an uninhabited island where two expeditions find themselves at cross purposes. Richard Attenborough is back as Mr. Hammond who wants to redeem himself for his past mistakes by having an expedition led by Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblaum) reach the island before the other team gets there. Eventually the two groups confront each other and team up for survival.There are plenty of thrills and near escapes with danger ever lurking and emphasized by the John Williams score. If you enjoyed 'Jurassic Park' you won't want to miss this one. Not as creative, perhaps, but the special effects are still pretty awesome--especially in the scene where the team is caught inside a cliffside trailer truck. Some of the action is pretty foolish and I could have done without the daughter who is a gymnast--but if you're looking for escapist entertainment this one fills the bill. Summing up: hokey but fun.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good dino action, but flawed by some lame scenes","Lost World delivers audiences what they obviously wanted from a Jurassic Park sequel: more dinosaur action and violence. It offers some new spins on the dinosaurs running amok motif, approaching the idea now from a hunter's point of view.It is very generous with the blood and gore, that's for sure. T-Rex and its mate are on the prowl again, as are a roving band of sadistic Velociraptors. Both are heard in the forest first stalking their prey, before they are seen in their night time attacks. The raptor attacks are suitably terrifying, as they ruthlessly and systematically wipe out their victims. Other new dinos come along, and one nerd falls victim to a herd of itty-bitty creatures. There's a great scene with a car hanging on the edge of disaster, and these things are all done well.But there are many flaws. First, most of the original cast have throw-away roles, or they're not here at all. Only Jeff Goldblum is featured, and he does do a good job as the lead. But now we also have his insufferably irritating daughter (who somehow stows away on a scientific expedition-an idiotic premise), and a woman he once had a relationship with (not the brat's mother), who is even stupider than the kid. She's a vet or something, and moronically operates on the broken leg of a baby T-Rex, inviting the wrath of you know who. As usual, in a Spielberg flick, the brat is an obnoxious snot, and the ex has an attitude. These two just get on your nerves.There's one scene where a T-Rex pokes his head into a tent. This utterly stupid and embarrassingly contrived encounter reminded me of a 3 Stooges episode. But other scenes are sufficiently logical enough to be scary; the cave sequence comes to mind.Then there's that lamentable scene in San Diego. The only good thing about this portion of the movie, (which is a lame rip off of King Kong to begin with), is the mysterious ship that seems to be sailing in an erratic manner at the very beginning of it. After that, you would swear the film makers are either trying to be funny or they completely lost their minds. It is just a heap of mindlessly campy slapstick nonsense, that makes the cheapest of the B-movie drive-in movies look intelligent by comparison.Apparently, they were trying to give the viewers their money's worth with plenty of screen time for the dinosaurs. In some scenes like the ending, they needed better scripting. Overall, the movie has enough good scenes to be watchable, but it's a far cry from the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg returns to one of his biggest hits with many of the pieces in place albeit not as well assembled,"Four years after events at the ill-fated Jurassic Park, chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) has seen a dip in his credibility in the academic community as John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has been forced out of company InGen with his nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) having assumed control and gone to great lengths in covering up the incident at the park including enforcing non-disclosure agreements on the attendants of the park (which only Malcolm has ignored). At the behest of Hammond, Dr. Malcolm pays him a visit and tells him of a second island, Isla Sorna, where dinosaurs for Jurassic Park could run free before being transferred to the main resort. Despite the dinosaurs not having the ability to produce Lysine as a counter measure against containment breaches, somehow there is now a thriving ecosystem with the dinosaurs having survived. In order to prevent possible exploitation of the dinosaurs Hammond prepares a group to travel to the island in order to document their environment in the hopes Hammond can use the research to persuade others to leave the dinosaurs isolated from humans. Dr. Malcolm initially refuses invitation for the expedition, but immediately changes his mind upon learning his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on the island studying the dinosaurs. Things get complicated when it's revealed Ludlow has his own expedition to the park intent on bringing the dinosaurs back to the mainland for a smaller version of Jurassic Park.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park and a loose adaptation of the novel The Lost World by Michael Crichton. Following the massive game changing success of Jurassic Park, development began for both a new film by Steven Spielberg as well as a sequel novel by author Michael Chrichton despite Chrichton initially having no interest after the first book's publication. Due to Spielberg taking a sabbatical from directing (as well as establishing Dreamworks) there was some initial doubt as to whether or not Spielberg would return to direct the film rather than in a producing capacity. As development of the film and sequel novel were developed parallel to each other, outside of some very basic setting similarities both the film and the source novel are pretty different from each other. With the footprint left by Jurassic Park, Universal pushed the film with a massive promotional campaign with the marketing expenses nearly five times the production budget and repeat with commercial tie-ins. While the film attained the record for biggest Memorial Day opening weekend at that point the film lacked critical support and the holds of its predecessor making a little over $600 million worldwide. The Lost World: Jurassic Park has a very middling legacy (with some even calling it Spielberg's worst film, it's not: War of the Worlds '05 is in my opinion), and while it has the nuts and bolts you expect for a movie like this it lacks the compelling additions of its predecessors.In an effort to differentiate itself from its predecessor, The Lost World largely downplays the adventurous tone and atmosphere of wonder in Jurassic Park that complemented the more intense sequences in that film. Featuring a darker color palette in the filmmaking and a more dour tone The Lost World feels like it's trying to take a book from Aliens' playbook in that if Jurassic Park was more horror based this is trying to be more larger scaled and action oriented. In principle it's not a bad idea in trying to give a different experience with the dinosaurs, but while the action sequences are quite nice most of the characters who aren't Ian Malcolm or directly related to him are either disposable cannon fodder or don't endear themselves to the audience. Despite the film taking a more environmentalist theme to its story (per the trends of the 90s) the most likable new character actually ends up being Pete Postlethwaite's big game hunter Roland who's not only the most competent one of the ensemble, but also shows himself to be pretty altruistic in helping our protagonists so even though he's working for Hammond's greedy nephew Peter Ludlow (a pretty thankless placeholder role) he doesn't really make the other expedition someone to root against.As for the other characters they're either shadows of themselves or just not very likable, Ian Malcolm who made such an impression in the first film just feels bland here (he's given some baggage with a stowaway daughter that doesn't add much) and I never felt he had much chemistry with Julianne Moore as his girlfriend. However by far the worst addition to the cast is Nick Van Owen played obnoxiously by Vince Vaughn and he's the most prominent mouthpiece for the environmental bent in the movie which feels half-hearted and confused at best especially from a character who risks peoples' lives for his ideals (and most likely got a few killed) and says odious things like how he joined Greenpeace because it's 90% women. There's nothing wrong with having environmental messages (I'm an environmentalist myself) but when you make your mouthpiece character this obnoxious and unlikable it seems more like it's attacking that stance rather than advocating it.The dinosaurs once again look fine but aside from a few setpieces based around the T-Rex there's not a whole lot that stands out. A lot of sequences just feel chaotic and lack impact with how little an impression many of the characters make and while there's technical more that happens in Lost World in comparison to Jurassic Park it's nowhere near as memorable except for a climax or more appropriately a second ending. After the movie reaches its natural conclusion things keep on going despite this as apparently it was a sequence that Spielberg really wanted to do so instead of saving it for a potential third movie as originally planned he opted to include it in this movie. It cannot be understated how clumsily grafted onto the film this final sequence feels and not only does it not have any internal logic as to how it happened but it just feels like unnecessary bloat.I guess if you're just looking for dinosaur based action scenes you'll get your money's worth here, but there's so little in terms of character investment it feels more like a series of video game levels going from one action scene to another. A step down from the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Almost as good as the original, almost.",Pulse pounding and very scary follow up to the original Jurassic Park has everything a real sequel to it should have.

Jeff Goldblum once again shines as wise cranking and adventurous Ian Malcolm and Julianne Moore is almost as good as his partner in crime. Thrown in a gracious cameo from Sr Richard Attenborough and a scene stealing Pete Posselweight as a dinosaur hunter and The Lost World becomes almost as memorable as the original Jurassic Park.

A big disappointment,"After seeing the first movie I was expecting a lot from this film and was severally let down. The movie starts off promising, but after the first action sequence, the only good one in the film, it goes down hill quick. The suspense of the first movie is replaced by very bad action. The excellent sequence in the first movie where the protagonists have to stay still to avoid the attention of the T-Rex is redone in a completely unoriginal and worse fashion. The dreaded rapters from the first movie seems to take out extras with ease, but can't touch the main characters, even two on one. The movie goes from worse to down right hooky when a T-rex is set lose in LA. The only thing in this movie that matches the original in quality is the effects, but for 1997 they're nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Uninteresting.,"It is a sequel to the movie ""Jurassic Park"" and narrates a journey of a team of scientists and paleontologists to an island near the park, where they have build part of its scientific facilities, now abandoned and left to the dinosaurs. However, they will find another team of explorers with less scientific intentions. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film has a screenplay by David Koepp, contrary to what happened in the first film, which Spielberg took on the role of screenwriter. The cast, however, remains more or less the same as the first film (except those who died in the first film, of course) and keeps a very interesting level and performance.Many film experts say that sequels are rarely able to have the impact and the mystique of the first film. And if we analyze this case we see that they are right to say that. The change of writer caused a catastrophe in the film and doesn't allow it reaches a level similar to the first, ended up being a movie much less interesting and enjoyable, although it also have some positive notes in between. He even has perfectly boring scenes, virtually copied from the first film. The end, with an angry dinosaur in the middle of a city, is so far-fetched and predictable that turns out to be more appropriate for a ""Godzilla"" movie. Personally, I didn't feel surprised. It was a movie I saw, but didn't pay to see more often.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Yet another dumb block-buster from Spielberg.,"Provides little new, but the special effects remain entertaining. Degenerates into B-movie nonsense towards the end. The scene with the black girl doing a bit of gymnastics to knock out a dinosaur is one of the stupidest scenes I've seen in years. The humour appears forced. Spielberg is repeating himself, just as he has been doing in many of his other films. Again, the special-effects people have done their part well, while Spielberg shows incompetence in making a movie around all these great special effects.Spielberg's late 80s and 90s movies have alternated between profit-oriented cash-cows and ""serious"" dramas. Either he is making another commercial cash-monster, or he is attempting to make another (PC) drama that will win him Oscars. He finally succeeded with ""Schindler's List"", which touches on a sure-fire topic that he knew would get him truck-loads of Oscars. Hollywood is Jewish, and any movie, documentary, or short film - bad or good - that deals with Jews in WWII always gets an Oscar. I haven't seen ""Schindler's List"" and I am unlikely to ever see it; firstly, I generally boycott Spielberg's terrible dramas (which always seem to have the worst casts imaginable), and, secondly, I think that one gets a far better impression of what sort of a hell concentration camps must have been from the numerous hard-hitting and immensely depressing documentaries made on the subject. I've seen some of those documentaries and am absolutely convinced that Spielberg's overly-polished and superficial style can never even get close to that kind of realism.I welcome any director's attempts to bring the holocaust to the attention of a historically-challenged and ignorant American public, but I doubt that Spielberg's motives were entirely noble. He made this film-project look like some kind of a personal crusade to remind the world of the suffering of Jews in WWII, but the crusade was more about winning recognition from Hollywood and its dumb Oscar-voters than anything else. Who really needed ""Schindler's List"" most? Spielberg. And to prove that his search for critical recognition takes over any other interests when making a movie one need only look at the two ""serious"" films he made after ""Schindler's List"": ""Amistad"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". ""Amistad"" was supposed to be for American blacks what ""Schindler's List"" was for Jews, and hence garner him the same kind of Oscar recognition. However, this blatantly politically-correct film must have turned out to be so bad that even the ultra-PC Hollywood decided not to ""honour"" Spielberg for it. (I believe it ""only"" got one Oscar: what a disappointment for Spielberg.) And I mean it must be a really awful film; after all, even the terrible ""Gandhi"" wasn't awful enough to prevent it receiving tons of Oscars. ""Saving Private Ryan"", with its uniquely bad cast of actors who look as out of place in WWII as Sean Connery in an gay indie movie, is another very obvious and cynical attempt by Spielberg to get more Oscars: American men fighting for America's freedom, in a three-hour spectacle. This time Spielberg's true-and-tried tactic worked. How could Hollywood say no? His interviews, his behaviour, and the statements that he made, all clearly show that awards mean more to him than anything else on this planet. He is a recognition-seeker; a true megalomaniac who lacks the ""modesty"" to be known ""only"" as a popular director; he wants unanimous critical recognition, too, and will do anything to get it. He also seems to lack the intellect to realize that awards don't prove at all that your movie is better than the others. When he receives an award Spielberg glows with joy. Obviously, everyone is happy when they win an Oscar, Golden Globe, New York's Critics Award (etc.), but Spielberg puts truly ridiculous significance on it. To prove my point, this man was actually deeply disappointed(!) that he ""lost"" to ""Shakespeare in Love"" (another dumb movie, by the way). Nevermind that Spielberg won the Best Director Oscar - this wasn't enough for him. He wanted it ALL! The man is pathetic. The after-Oscar party of ""DreamWorks"" was reported to have been covered in a cloud of misery! The man is an idiot.Politically speaking, what makes Spielberg even more easy to hate are his obvious and predictable leanings to the Left. This man - this Hollywood hypocrite - who claims to champion the Jewish cause supports Clinton. Clinton's Middle East policy is clearly anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. (And the less said about his bitch wife, the better.) Yet this dumb, self-absorbed Hollywood Jew supports this hillbilly Arkansas moron. Like most American Jews, Spielberg shows a very disappointing lack of support for his Jewish ""brothers"" in Israel. I can imagine how frustrated and even angry most Israelis must get when they just think of Hollywood Jews; only a few of the latter seem to truly understand Israel and even fewer show loyalty to it. (An example: Hillary openly supports and visits Arafat, whom she considers a friend(!), yet advance polls showed that most Jews would still vote for her if she ran for a New York senate seat!) Spielberg stands as a symbol for the worst kind of American Jew: a left-leaning Hollywood hypocrite, who plays the role of a do-gooder, but whose sole interests in life are power and money. And recognition. The question isn't whether he is a hypocrite/scumbag or just an ignorant moron. He is both. And his latest film, ""Munich"", proves more than ever that he is as anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic as Hamas. A little exaggeration, perhaps, but only a little one.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

That is basically what it was a theme park gone wrong with the dinosaurs getting out. To me jurassic park III never happened. They killed off the T rex within the first half hour to replace it with a spineous rex! the lost world brought the intensity full scale they are in the jungle with raptors and T rexs all around them and no fences for protection they are literally in the peoples faces! lost world showed you how vicious raptors are.they didn't open doors but they were relentless same with the t rexes. Just the atmosphere of number two was more suspenseful in the fact that the were in the wild with the monsters. the dinosaurs in number 1 and 3 were not as aggressive. jeff goldblum did a superb job in number two as the leading man.

Contrived but sometimes fun,"To say this film is almost the clone of Jurassic Park (no pun intended) is to give Spielberg credit.  This film is a large drop off from the original and while sequels don't get up to the original, this one does try, but flails.

Sometimes entertaining compared some other c**p, but to view along side the original is a no-brainer.  One other thing, why put the first smashing scene from the first book into the second movie?

It met my expectations,"A team of researchers head to an island to observe dinosaurs who are flourishing on the island. Unbeknownst to this team, another team from InGen have also come to the island with their own nefarious agenda. Soon both teams find themselves having to pool their resources in order to reach an extraction point when a pair of territorial T-Rex's launch a deadly reign of terror...Whilst Lost World is a good film I didn't find its set-up to be quite as good as that which we saw in the first film. In the original, the team desperately try to escape after a power failure lead to them being hunted by the dinosaurs; in other words they end up in this precarious position through no fault of their own in the original. In this sequel, they are sent to Site B to observe dinosaurs and are openly told that the dinosaurs are not fenced in. For a start, I couldn't quite get to grips with what the point of them going there to observe the dinosaurs in the first place? They've been flourishing there for the last 4 years as Hammond points out so why not just leave them be? Given what happened in the first film, it makes no sense for this team to risk themselves when they have no real reason to? At least InGen had an actual goal and purpose; even though they clearly aren't there to do anything of actual worth.Another thing that bothered me was how the chaos actually unfolded in this sequel; Vince and Sarah rescue a baby T-Rex who has a broken leg and assist the injured animal yet the injured T-Rex's cries of pain alert the baby T-Rex's parents which is what seemed to start all of the trouble. Wouldn't it have made sense to tranquilise the baby T-Rex whilst they were tending to its broken leg so as to not draw unnecessary attention? It seems strange that it's only a young girl who seems to realise that the noises from the baby will eventually bring mummy and daddy T-Rex and yet a decorated paleontologist never considers this? It's another example of dumb character decisions acting as a driver to the story...Still I have to admit if you overlook some of these inconsistencies Lost World is still quite exciting and has plenty of tense moments; one of the best moments is the one with the trailer and the cliff. The acting is fairly good and the SFX are reasonable. Spielberg's direction makes up for some of the film's scripting and plot problems and he manages to stage some very good scenes.Those who enjoyed the first film are sure to find this second dose enjoyable as well.

Two Rexes for Part Two,"It's the sequel, so how can we manufacture a way for people to be eaten by T-Rexes and Velociraptors again? Well, there happened to be a back up island full of dinosaurs, we'll call it the break-in island where they could work out the kinks for the main park. This was called Isla Sorna.Isla Sorna, like Isla Nublar, was in total disrepair due to storms. The dinosaurs were roaming about the entire island and had created their own ecosystem and even solved the problem of their ""lysine deficiency."" Old man Hammond (Richard Attenborough) wants to send a team of people into Isla Sorna to study the dinosaurs which included Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Ian is understandably avidly opposed to the idea, but his girlfriend and paleontologist, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is already there, so now Ian wants to save her. Also, on the team was Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) the eco-warrior, Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) the tech guy, and Ian's daughter, Kelly (Vanessa Chester), who was either adopted or the mailman's daughter because their wasn't a trace of Ian's DNA visible on her.Something has to put them in danger though. After all, we're watching this for the toothy large predators, not for big lumbering herbivores. To further the plot and provide excitement there was an aggressive team of hunters there to capture some dinosaurs and bring them back to San Diego where a more affordable theme park has been built. These hunters manage to rile up two T-Rexes and the smaller sleeker velociraptors.""The Lost World"" lacked the essential qualities of ""Jurassic Park:"" the originality and suspense that came with the originality. Now we know what the T-Rex looks like on screen and what it can do. We also know what the raptors look like on screen and what they can do. How can they up their game? They couldn't.

A Needless Sequel,"THE LOST WORLD has the same strengths and weaknesses as the original movie . The strengths are the same breath taking special effects and the dark , moody atmosphere seen in the original . It also features the character of John Hammond who is supposed to Scottish but has an indescriable accent that is nothing like the one myself and five million Scots possess . Unfortunately since it`s a sequel it brings weaknesses of its own to the story . Did you see the trailers where the dinosuar is brought back to America ? Did this give the impression that this was going to be KING KONG with reptiles ? That`s I thought but it`s difficult to believe that this sub plot happens almost three quarters of the way into the movie .

A Worthy Sequel To Its Revolutionary Predecessor,"I don't care! I just don't care if Steven Spielberg himself grew disenchanted with this sequel while filming it because what he ended up putting on screen is still, in my opinion, a worthy follow-up to its revolutionary predecessor. Its inevitable comparison to Jurassic Park is its biggest downfall but The Lost World: Jurassic Park remains a highly satisfying successor to the original that offers its own set of thrills & entertainment that simply work.Set 4 years after the events of Jurassic Park, The Lost World follows Dr. Ian Malcolm who, after meeting with John Hammond, assembles a team to set off to the Site B island (where dinosaurs are allowed to roam freely) in order to get back his girlfriend who's already there to conduct her research. Once on the site, his team discovers that they're not the only one as another team from InGen arrives to take the dinosaurs back to the mainland but once again, everything soon spirals out of control.Written by David Koepp & directed by Steven Spielberg, The Lost World takes the viewers back to the world of living dinosaurs, this time filling the screen with more dinosaurs, many more body counts & even bigger entertainment. The direction retains Spielberg's ability to provide a sense of wonder & amazement but it also goes a bit far than required this time as a few sequences look ridiculous. The screenplay is downgraded too with more emphasis on action than story or characters yet it works for the most part.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design team does a fantastic job in recreating the same world we witnessed back in 1993 and the set pieces are wonderfully detailed too. Cinematography makes more dynamic use of camera than the first one due to more action, plus various sequences benefit immensely due to the energetic camera-work. Editing never lets the pace settle down n unfolds the story briskly while John Williams once again chips in with a thrilling score that exquisitely captures the different tone of this chapter.What Jurassic Park brought on screen during its time of release was something never done before, never seen before & never experienced before, at least not in such realistic manner. It was a landmark moment in cinema history that opened up many new territories previously thought to be unattainable through existing filmmaking means. And what this sequel lacks is that same level of freshness for much of the picture is simply a rehash of the original and tries to make up for what it lacks by amplifying its action, at which it succeeds.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Richard Attenborough, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn & others, with all doing a good job in their given roles. But just like the original, it's the dinosaurs who rule this film since almost every sequence featuring them is a delight to watch. Visuals & Sound is state-of-the-art stuff like before and the film brims with plenty of jaw-dropping sequences that exhibit the remarkable skills of Spielberg when it comes to larger-than-life action moments.On an overall scale, The Lost World: Jurassic Park gets a lot of flak for following a formulaic route as well as its lack of interesting human characters but for any dinosaur aficionado like me, it delivers everything that was expected from it. Whether it's the scenes involving the two T-Rex or Velociraptors or Stegosaurus or Compsognathus or that infamous San Diego mayhem, there's almost nothing that I don't like about this sequel for it stays true to the spirit of the original and is just as entertaining as Jurassic Park, if not more.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Read the book...,"The first Jurassic Park was very good, as was the book, and while THE LOST WORLD novel isn't as good as the first, the film's even farther off. Jeff Goldblum's character has done a complete 180 degree turn into some ""Know it all preacher."" I hate the scene where he says something like "" Ooh, yeah, that's how it all starts-then there's screaming and yelling and running."" He sounds incredibly stupid when he's saying it, and his character in this film is just plain annoying. I love the first and third film, and despite the sickening rumors of Ian Malcolm coming back for film 4, I hop that Grant (Sam Neill) comes back for more. I'm hoping unless the script is excellent, they don't make another stupid film to end the series like The Lost World. Let's hop for something like film 1 or 3( hearing rumors of film 5 too. I guess people love the dinos-I know I do).I give the Lost World 2/5 stars for having some good dinosaur sequences-other than that it's a pass.JOHN ULMER",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Adequate Follow-Up,"A research team is sent to the Jurassic Park Site B island to study the dinosaurs there while another team approaches with another agenda.What makes this film so interesting is watching it now (2015) and recognizing all the names who were not so big when it came out. Julianne Moore was just starting out (and obviously not on top of her game), Vince Vaughn had just broken out with ""Swingers"". Peter Stormare has made a hundred movies or more, but never got big until ""Prison Break"". And yet, here they are.This is a decent movie and a decent sequel. Not great, not as clever as the first. The plot seems a little forced, but for those who want dinosaur action, it definitely provides that. I am not at all clear why Site B has species of dinosaurs that Site A apparently never did.

The Sequel That Didn't Have to Be,"This movie just DIDN'T have to be made! The first Jurassic Park movie was great, and this sequel tried as best as sequels can (which isn't very much) to be better than the original, but failed. There is no better dinosaur movie than Jurassic Park, and the movie makers shouldn't have even tried to top such a wonderful masterpiece. The effects were somewhat better than the original (the T-Rex looks more realistic). I don't know why they had to change the Raptors' colors! I myself think that green suited the Velociraptors better than orange and white. I know that I've gone on and on about how this movie isn't better, it didn't have to be made, and more, but this movie was decent.

This movie is a good time - PERIOD!,"How people can bash this movie is beyond me - can you find flaws in the plot line - yes.  Are there occasional inconsistencies - yes. Are they any worse in this movie than the ones in Star Wars and Indiana Jones - no.  Instead of nitpicking every little thing that Speilberg did wrong, why not take a step back and look at all he did right.  This movie has some excellent acting (Goldblum and Postlewaite),a very good story, certainly good enough to string together all the incredible action sequences and movie magic that we're engulfed by throughout the entire film, and it actually pulls off a little moral statement about our society (both the stupidity of some hunters wanting to kill anything they can, and the stupidity of some tree hugging peace-niks that think everything should be saved.)  The suspense is there too - I actually jumped out of my seat watching the movie again last night during the raptor/shack scene.  People were obviously expecting something else from this movie when they bash it, but what WERE they expecting?!?! This movie has all the coolness of the first film and delivers extra - 2 t-rexes, new dinos, great capture sequence, and the entire SanFran ending is fantastic (who as a child didn't have nightmares that looked EXACTLY like what happened to the little boy?).  If this movie had been the first Jurassic Park movie, people wouldn't have enough good things to say about it, and the first one would be a pretty weak follow up - wouldn't it?  To throw in a personal music opinion it is like the band Boston's first two album releases.  The first one became an instant classic and one of the most played albums possibly ever - because it was great and nothing had ever sounded like it before.  Their second album sounded just as good as the first, same strong songwriting and catchy riffs, only something already sounded like that before, so people were less taken by it.  Take my word for it - this movie is a good time, even though it's the SECOND dinosaur movie to be a good time.9 of 10, but it gets a 10 to make up for idiots that bombed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Political Correctness gone amok...,"I had to sit through this film recently with an acquaintance and his family. However, just after the scene where the Vince Vaughn releases the dinosaurs to save them from the ""evil"" corporate hunters, the bile arising within me became too unbearable and I had to go outside and cool off by contemplating the mountains.For all the action, special effects, etc., the not-too-subtle anti-corporation and hunting messages really ruin what could have been a fairly if not thoroughly enjoyable movie.  The sheer lunacy of bringing a wounded baby Rex back to a trailer that was parked in an obviously bad location (don't naturalists know anything about camouflage?!) still gives me a headache.I would have loved to have seen the Vaughn character just sat on and smothered in the excrement of a stegasaur -- after having palmed the shells of Pete Postelwaite's shotgun.  That(!) would have been justice!No hunter or mercenary -- particularly on dangerous and unfamiliar ground -- is going to go off to urinate without *confirming* that others in his group know.  Even then, he would *never* go beyond visual range of the rest area. But, hey, in this film, the hunters are enemies of nature and in the eyes of the producer and writes justly provide a main course for the T-Rex and velociraptors.Everyone knows that Californians can be thoroughly self absorbed, but a T-Rex making it from the San Diego docks to a residential neighborhood unnoticed?  Please!!!And the ending with ""nature"" in the form of the T-Rex devouring the ""evil"" (or at the very least uncaring) corporate businessman is pure Political Correctness gone mad...Lost World was such an infuriating disappointment, I haven't even bothered to see JP3...",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A very good action flick with some minor flaws,"The Lost World is a respectable follow-up to JP. It follows most of the rules for a successful sequel, i.e. more action, more dinos, etc.  The sequel could not possibly capture the awe of the original so they correctly flooded us with dazzling effects.  Sure the storyline is weak, but there was not much more they could have done as far as the overall plot line.  The worst part of this movie is clearly the presence of Malcolm's annoying daughter.  Forget that a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs fails to account for the racial discrepancy between father and daughter, whenever the Kelly character is on screen bad things happen, culminating with her gymnastic routine where her 80 lb body drives a 600 lb velociraptor out the window like a cannon.  Nevertheless, good performances by V. Vaughn, J. Moore, and P. Postlewaite plus those dazzling dinos save the day.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lost Dinos,"While we didn't find too many extras for Jurassic Park, its first sequel gets greater coverage. First up is another ""Original Featurette on the Making of the Film"".

A huge disappointment!,"There is no doubt that Steven Spielberg has slipped upon his return. With Schindler's List, he was simply the best. This film is his comeback movie, and it really disappoints me to the heart...plus this is where I started having doubts about Steven's credibility.I've read the novel a year before this film came out. The translation from book to film is horrible, and this is a loser in the game of entertainment. We have Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Harding (played by Julianne Moore) on their story return, but they simply don't fit well with the story.Storywise, this film is better off as a spin-off than a sequel. The Lost World is simply ""more of everything"" from Jurassic Park and a little new touch. Anyone who did not read the book would like this film, but then again there would be some who won't like it.Steven Spielberg's directing here feels weak and generic. In fact, there are other directors out there who can direct this film and even improve on it. Spielberg, who's known for his artistic direction (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List, Jaws, etc.), really disappointed me here. I expected better from him.I feel cheated by this film, and cheated by Spielberg. It seemed that this film was made only to squeeze out money from viewers, who would simply pay to see dinosaurs. The plot is very bad, the cast is not good, the special FX are better, and there simply is very little enjoyment with this film.Better not pay a high price to watch this movie. You'll be amazed with the dinosaurs but you'll notice just how bad the plot is, how bad the cast is and how little value you can get from The Lost World. You'll be disappointed eventually.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie was just a big excuse for a sequel. Why did something have to survive'?,"I might be pre-empting the cinema going public around the world here, but I believe most of them would have loved the 1997 sequel to Jurassic Park titled The lost World'. Well there is movie-goer that did not like it that much, and that was ME! This movie loses the appeal that was created in the first movie, has moments where it so over the top that it kills the movie, and lacks the depth of characters that could make me care. Jurassic Park: The Lost World' is living proof that it takes more than a big budget,  a successful director and box office hype, to make a decent movie sequel.It has been four years since the disaster at Jurassic Park. The individual scientists who had been hired as consultants on the project agreed to remain silent about it. Now something is wrong at second Remote Island of prehistoric inhabitants. Dr. Ian Malcolm and his group are about to find out... something has survived.The special effects in this film are the only saving point for me. Once again the special effect team make the dinosaurs come frighteningly to life, in a way that I really like. These creatures actually cease being special effects and seem real. Back doing the dinosaur special effects in the Lost World are Dennis Muren, Stan Winston and Michael Lantieri. To say that the one reason to watch this film is because of the continuation of the great special effects would be an understatement.Yet the story presented is very corny, perfunctory and does things just because they need to be done. First time around I was convinced that seeing a dinosaur theme park going wrong was entertaining, but in the second part of the story I feel it is a complete waste of time, as it is just not that interesting, in fact it is down right boring. The story is based on Michael Crichton's second novel of the same name, which I have read many people criticise for being a farce. Then back again as screenwriter is David Koepp, whose screenplay has many problems including clichéd characters, boring storylines and bad flat spots. The other problem to the Lost World story is that it did not allow the dinosaurs to be the main stars of the film, which is what the first film did better in my view.Now was Steven Spielberg actually directing this film? From where I viewed it, it did not feel like it. From all my research, I agreed mostly with movie critic Roger Ebert. He said about Steven Spielberg as director of The Lost World, This feels like the kind of sequel a master hands over to an apprentice, and you sense that although much effort was lavished on the special effects, Spielberg's interest in the story was perfunctory.' Now while I am big a fan of Spielberg, I am afraid that I agree with Ebert here. The strong presence that I was expecting from Spielberg is not present here and it brings the film down.I also agree with Ebert about the key weaknesses to the film.  There are too many scenes drawn out and elaborate for the sake of being just that, not good enough in my view. The worst scene in the film has to be where the research trailer is hanging over the cliff, we see a terrifying drop and of course there is a dinosaur attacking our characters to just add to the cliché of it all. This scene is placed into the film, forty-minutes after the most boring of lead-ups I have ever seen.While the last half an hour to the film seemed too much like a typical Hollywood ending, with the film overstaying its welcome. Now while most people would be thrilled by these set-ups, I found them very frustrating in this film, as I believe it did not add anything to the film, although Spielberg and his team wanted the audience to believe it had. Well it did not work on me!The movie stars some famous names. Back for a second dose of dinosaur action is scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Now I had problems with his performance in the first film, but Goldblum here is unconvincing as the dinosaur expert, as his dialogue is delivered in such a quiet and unconvincing way. Malcolm is in a relationship with another dinosaur expert, Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore). Now this character was ok in parts of the film, as she has intimate moments with dinosaurs, which were interesting to see.Also along for the ride is a wasted character in Malcolm's daughter, Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), who is one of the characters I have referred to as clichéd', as she does nothing that makes her seem that important to the story. However, my favourite character in the film has to be the game hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), whose character is very smart, while being surrounded by people, getting eaten by dinosaurs. When asked about the possibility of working full time with dinosaurs he states I have spent enough time in the company of death'.This movie had a rival coming out around the same, that being Godzilla', another big budget Hollywood farce in my view. Spielberg I can only imagine looked at this movie as competition, and in a way tried to out stage it before it was released. Now while I think neither movie have had a positive influence on cinema, I think Spielberg should have been more focused on getting his movie right. I mean this film could have been as good as the first, but with so many flaws, I cannot forgive it. It is only lucky that this film got the box success it did, because I firmly believe it could have hurt Spielberg's career, or may have even started the end of it.CMRS gives Jurassic Park: The Lost World': 1 (Bad Film)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""I believe I've spent enough time in the company of death.""","Spielberg is in full-on dark dinosaur action mode in this surprisingly tactile but rambling sequel to the brilliant '93 original. In fact Goldblum perfectly encapsulates the vibe here as a trapped and frustrated Ian Malcolm, groaning bitterly from set piece to set piece, clearly eager to get the thing finished. Postlethwaite's ""noble"" hunter is pretty interesting but the chaotic relentlessness of the plot sort of sweeps him, and every other intriguing idea, along in its messy wake. However despite the clear structural and character shortcomings of Lost World, the dino stuff is mostly really great, the CG looks fresh and the animatronics are beautiful. Those gigantic T Rex heads alone are worth the price of admission.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wanted more.,"I have kept my thoughts silent on the matter of this sequel for 4 years. I saw it again last night for the 20th time and felt the need to comment.Agreeing that books and films are total different animals, I'll move to ask: What was wrong with the plot in Critchon's popular sequel: The Lost World. It could have been adapted for the screen. Period. Instead, we are given a weak first reel which includes, the return of Tim, Lex and John H; poor exposition involving Ian's attempt to expose InGen; and the girlfriend setup.The second reel tried & failed to capture the intimate quality of its predecessor, which balanced the CGI effects in JP1. I liked Dr. Grant, and Ellie and the kids -- they were real. I cared about them. I did not care for Sarah Harding or Nick. Liked Eddie though. The kid I could have done without. Vince Vaugan supplied testesterone and nothing else. Eddie was an interesting character in the book. It was odd that they switched Eddie and Nick around.The biggest travesty was sending an army of men to the island, because we all knew they were nothing but Raptor Snacks. The scene where most of the cast gets killed in a flurry of tails, and tall grass was a very cheap way to dispatch the army guys. They served their purpose - so let's find the most economic way of getting rid of them. The center- piece of the 2nd reel was the Camper Over a Cliff (hanger) which featured more camp than camper. The glass cracking was just too much. Great suspense.For a movie about dinosaurs, JP2 felt dino empty. Did anyone expect people to believe the scene in which Raptors suddenly change from jumping and killing humans to stalking and attacking each other just so we can have a ten second thrill ride with Wonder Woman crashing, diving and finally falling to safety. It was dumb.To the third reel. Spielberg does Godzilla in San Diego with Ian and Harding going above the law for their convictions. Where was Nick? Why didn't the guards shoot them when they stole the junior dino? And folks, I can't buy into the fact -- that everyone on board the ship was killed without ever warning the coast that they were in trouble. How did T-Rex get his head through the small door of the ship's bridge to bite a crew member (leaving only a hand clutching the helm). Okay! OKAY! It's a movie. I understand. But I resent the smell of by-the-number formula. Koepp is brilliant, hands down.So I went with it. And yes, I love it too.Anyway I am going to JP3 Wednesday and I'm hoping for adventure and excitement, a little blood and some scares.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The New World: Not Quite Jurassic Park,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a valiantly decent follow-up to it's perfect predecessor, managing to find new ways to scare and amaze, admittedly in fewer numbers.Jeff Goldblum is upgraded to the lead role from his previous stance as a comic relief, and it works well enough to root for his survival, even if his absence of constant quipping makes it difficult to recognise him as the same Ian Malcolm. There are a plethora of new editions to the cast, with the personal stand-outs being Richard Schiff and Pete Postlewaite as Eddie Carr and Roland Tembo, respectively. The new location Isla Sorna makes for a great new setting, with the abundance of wilderness adding to the elements of feeling stranded and amazed at seeing the dinosaurs in a more natural environment. Moreover, the dinosaurs themselves, both new and returning, are still a spectacle to behold from the tyranical Tyrannosaur to the majestic Stegosaurs and Parasaurs. But the most terrifying in this instalment end up being the critter-sized Compsognathus, which have several memorable moments throughout. In terms of the actual plot, the more environmentalist aspects of the film helps it have a message worth exploring with the complexities of how involved humans should be with nature, even if it does pale in comparison to the grandiose debate of 'playing God' that it's predecessor carried. More on the filmmaking, the movie is much faster paced and spends less time pulling back the curtain, making way for more action to be at the forefront and ditching the noticeable absent element of contemplative hindsight as to what led to the Dinosaurs' creation. The new score pairs well with the more tropical-dominant setting with its use of jungle drums, bongos, and other percussion instruments. Furthermore, it feels relatively in line as a logical step forward from the absolutely iconic original theme and stands out on its own, even if it is much less memorable.On the other hand, the film has many issues other than the obvious and inevitable impossibility of being unable to fill up the massive shoes of Jurassic Park. The movie has a very large cast, some played by interesting actors, but most are very uninteresting characters that either come across as one-note, one-dimensional, or simply boring, with the worst case possibly being Arliss Howard as the primary human antagonist Peter Ludlow. The dialogue in most of the expository scenes have four or more characters carrying out several conversations at once, making for a difficult time to figure out what's being discussed or what conclusions are made, making for some unnecessarily overwhelming conversations throughout. Although the increase in action makes for more fun, most of the sequences involving dinosaurs don't seem to know how to properly transition to the next scene; on several havoc-filled occasions the Dinosaurs disappear or disband to let an action scene end without much explanation or consequence from any of the main cast. And perhaps most notably, the final act takes such a different direction that it ends up being a complete departure and borderline nosedive from the otherwise excusably flawed plot to seemingly become another movie entirely where half the cast don't attend the climax, the tone shifts to be more comedic, and everything becomes very conveniently solvable to reach the eventual end.In conclusion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park may have some obvious imperfections and is missing the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of the original, but what it lacks in magic it manages to admirably try to make up for in a compelling plot with its own few strengths.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Doesn't work,"Just for the record, I love Jurassic Park. It has a great score, great dinosaurs and is just great fun from start to finish. I like Steven Spielberg, but I did not like this movie one bit, and I feel this is his worst film. Spielberg has made some masterpieces, and he has also made some disappointing or mediocre movies, but for me The Lost World is the only time where he has hit rock bottom. It isn't just disappointing or mediocre, it is pretty darn bad.The only redeeming qualities were the score, well it is John Williams what do you expect, and the dinosaurs, they look wonderful despite the fact we have seen most of them before. The scenery and cinematography were very good too, but not as good as that in the original, lacking its polish.What really brought the film down was the script and story. The script is just terrible, when it tries to be funny it is actually unfunny and predictable while there is too much mugging on Jeff Goldblum's part. The story is pretty redundant, not the idea but in the way it was executed. There is too much filler that could have been trimmed or excised, as some of is superfluous to the story and just bogs it down significantly. The rest of the story is predictable, is filled with plot holes and lacks any thrills, focusing less on suspense and more on action. The film is also overlong, drags due to those aforementioned fillers primarily and feels rather anti-climatic. Spielberg's direction is disappointingly lethargic, almost as if he wasn't interested, while the film is devoid of a single likable or sympathetic character, apart from one and he was killed off early. Kelly and Vince Vaughn's character especially are irritating. The acting is poor, Goldblum is a great actor with good material, but seeing as his material is actually awful he tries his best but it is all wasted effort by the end. The rest of the cast including Julianne Moore and the late Pete Postlethwaite try too but the script and how badly written their characters are undermine them to the point they struggle too.All in all, a huge disappointment and just didn't work. I can understand the disappointment of fans of the original, and I have heard valid criticisms of this film which I agree with. I also agree if you compare this in any way to the original, this movie is doomed, but any comparison is inevitable. As a sequel, it is not the worst, it isn't quite as awful as Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3, Secret of NIMH 2, Son of the Mask and Jaws:The Revenge(Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 is also terrible but unlike the above its predecessor is bad as well), but to me The Lost World is one of the more disappointing ones. 1/10 for the score and the dinosaurs.

A good follow up,"A couple months ago I would have trashed this movie. When it came out I had high hopes for it, as before seeing it I had read Crichton's excellent novel and could only imagine how great a big screen adaptation would be. Obviously, The Lost World is nothing like the novel it's 'based' on, and this angered me for a while. After seeing the recently released Jurassic Park 3, however, I finally am able to separate the JP movies and books into two very different spins on a similar story. Having accepted that, I can now look at the Lost World once more as it's own movie and look at how it fits into the series. I think it fits in very well.I won't bother detailing the story, everyone already knows it. Jeff Goldblum does a great job stepping back into his Ian Malcom character, the supporting characters especially Vince Vaughan are great too. The dinosaurs, which is what everyone wants to see, are similarily well done. There's nothing really new from the first movie save for some stegos and pachycepholasaurs (sp?) but that doesn't matter as they all look as good if not better then they did in the first one.Now, as for the San Diego ending, at first I hated it and thought it screwed up the movie, now I don't. The scene is quite interesting in it's Godzilla kind of way, and the idea of the whole world knowing about the dino islands is good as it allows for more sequel ideas, which I certainly want to see. 4 out of 5 from me, and JP3 does it even better.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not that bad.,The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just a better way of saying Jurassic Park 2.  I didn't like this movie as much as the first because in the first one they were nice to the dinosaurs and in this one they are cruel and there to kill them or capture. The special effects were amazing though. 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mediocre. Also Vince Vaughn???,"Only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the cgi was pretty good for the time and that's about it. Jeff Goldblum is a terrible leading man in this movie, nothing about him is captivating or relatable and he just feels out of place. Also he has a random African American daughter that serves no purpose in the story and it isn't even explained how he ended up with a black daughter that clearly isn't mixed. Btw he is a jerk to her for most of the film and treats her more like a pet than a daughter, which as a black person, I found a little offensive. The only black character is a child with no substance thats always getting yelled at. In 1997 this movie probably was a little more bearable, but since it's release thousands of movies just like this have been made, therefore the plot just felt extremely recycled and nearly put me to sleep. Also Vince Vaughn???????",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
2nd Bestest dinosaur movie,"Jurassic Park 2 is good, but when the Tyrannosaurus Rex attack the people in San Diego, he should eaten the people in front of him, overall it is a good movie to watch, but is more educational, how the Tyrannnosaurus Rex stick his or her tongue out to lick them, when they are trapped. I wish Lost World should have a lot of carnivores dinosaurs killing the people, that would make me more happiest. I still recommend for those who are interest of a dinosaur movie, this one maybe last for awhile, it might be like Jurassic Park 1 but it will do. New dinosaur are in there, two T-Rexes and one baby, only Iam Malcom is the star of this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The Jeff Goldblum"" edition, with more ""jokes"" and dumb action, but with less credibility and less suspense.","I would like to call this sequel, the Jeff Goldblum edition. HE is a funny dude, so I am glad he got a bigger role than in the original first edition, resulting in MORE jokes, which is a good thing. There is more action too, which is not necessarily a good thing, because nonstop action, just for the sake of it, can be quite boring...Any more bad? The one kid actor simply cant act.

The best of the trilogy by far,This is definently the best in the trilogy. Jurassic Park 3 was one of the dumbest movies ever. And the first wasn't that bad but could have had more action. This is one has everything you would want in a movie. Action. Lots and lots of action. Although the ending was a bit out of touch but it was really cool when the T-rex comes and wrecks L.A. I won't tell you how he did get to the town but it was nearly impossible how they got him in. But other than that I really enjoyed it. If you only want to see one of them I suggest you see this one film of the trilogy. The third one is complete boredom. And the first is good but not enough action. 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
it's great!,"i really enjoyed this movie in the theatre, it's certainly the most entertaining film of 1997! This movie is definitely worthy of being a sequel of Jurassic Park: i'm not saying it's better than JP, but it comes very close. I know that the plot isn't as good as the one the original had, but i had a great time seeing it, and that's the only reason we go to see a movie, isn't it?   I came out of the theatre shaking almost as much as when i came out of JP back in 1993. The most suspenseful moment of the film was when Sarah is above the breaking glass: man, my heart was really beating fast! Also the ending (with the T-rex running around San Diego) was great and it was totally unexpected.

Juras-sick park dude!,"The Jurasssic-athon continues on to the second film in the series, ""The Lost World"". Whilst certainly a step down from its prestigious prequel, this one certainly has some moments that make it worthwhile.Ingen has a site B. Another island where the more industrial aspects of genetic development took place, and they are looking to exploit it. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) sends a team to the island, to observe and report on the dinosaurs, who are now living free and uncaged on the island. But this team meets a second, militarised team, that Ingen have sent with the express purpose of getting dinosaurs off the island.I always think a little harsher about this one, than I actually come to feel when I'm watching it. It takes quite a while to get going, but once it has it then it's a pretty none-stop action adventure through to the conclusion. Admittedly, it has some silly moments. The whole raptor section transforms them from skilled killers to clumsy oafs, blundering through windows for no reason and being gymnastic kicked to their deaths. But the scenes with the T-Rex's, particularly the one where it attacks the encampment are all really well done. The scenes in San Francisco feel like a missed opportunity more than anything else, but aren't that bad. (Though it does, again, ignore its own rules about the noise a T-Rex makes when walking, because it suits the plot).I think it does suffer that none of the characters are particularly engaging. Their played by good actors, Julianne Moore is brilliant, Pete Postlethwaite, Peter Stormare - all reliable but all lacking in any sort of real growth or development and many of them, even the ""heroes"" make decisions that get people killed.As I say though, it's generally a fun ride - always more fun than I remember it being.

Best Possible Sequel,"I don't understand the hate. This movie is just underrated. People say it's all plot holes. Have they watched the third one? My god, this movie had tense human conflicts, intense action scenes, the best character from the first is the MAIN character in this one, a gripping story, good acting (in which you can tell the actors give a sh*t) and most of all: the same atmosphere as the first. In 3, everything is rush rush rush rush rushed. My theory of how the hate for this one got started was that people don't have real opinions, and don't know what to say, so pretty much, if it wasn't the meaning of life or exactly how THEY wanted it to be, they say it sucked (and, plus, it's a sequel, so of course it gets bashed), and after one person b*tched and moaned about it, everyone else without opinions decided to go with everyone else and say it sucked since that what someone else said. And that's society for you, people. Also, maybe if this movie wasn't so over hyped, people wouldn't have such high expectations. Then again, I can't blame the people for being hyped. The trailer was superb. Regardless, if you can understand how to judge a movie, and you're ready for some freaking FUN and action, then watch this one. Some people hate it (many are probably conservative republicans, so what do you expect) but I love it. 10/10 for being the best possible sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Like all recent Hollywood dinosaur films, this was made without care or interest.","Coming up with something to rival the first Jurassic Park film was going to be tough, but this film doesn't even attempt to do anything of the kind. The Site B idea is just contrived, and as the other island wasn't actually destroyed in the film then there's no reason why they couldn't have returned there.That is not the only problem, however.  Far from it.  True, the film starts promisingly with some gritty direction and some interesting characters, but they're soon forgotten as special effects take over.  The dinosaurs are as good as ever, but there's no sense of wonder surrounding them - they're just taken for granted.  And the sense of danger has gone.  The best scene, involving a cracking window, doesn't even involve dinosaurs.  Most of this film is just played for laughs.  And the climax (anti-climax) involves the feeblest monster-in-a-city scene I've ever some across.Though this film is, admittedly, entertaining at times, it has a weariness about it, as though everyone involved was doing no more than making some money.  With films like this it's no wonder sequels have some a bad reputation.  Mind you, it's certainly a lot more watchable than that '98 Godzilla advert for merchandising garbage.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Same strengths and weaknesses as the first one,"In retrospect, Spielberg's adaptation of JURASSIC PARK not only made sense in financial terms, but also artistic.  I didn't read THE LOST WORLD, but most of Crichton's novels, while they're well-plotted, are straitjackets, told in a clinical fashion, as if he's trying to tell you how much better he is than you.  And the characters are usually one-dimensional at best, with the exception of a few here and there.  Where the film versions of RISING SUN, DISCLOSURE, and CONGO kept most of the book, and therefore were held back by it, the film version of JURASSIC PARK threw out the book and just kept the dinosaurs, which made it more entertaining, so we could forget about the fact that the characters were one-dimensional and the plot is right out of a (bad) 1950's sci-fi movie.This sequel is, in most senses, a carbon copy of the original.  It has the same strengths (the dinosaurs, Jeff Goldblum) and weaknesses (lack of character development, watered-down story).  The primary difference is this is more of a straight-ahead action movie than the original, and Spielberg is in control there.  Also, Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite do a lot with a little.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Heartpounding Sequel!,"Like its prequel, I first watched this movie in the theaters and it was edge-of-the-seat excitement. Here, we have Dr. Hammond, the billionaire who founded Jurassic Park, trying to make up for his past mistakes by sending Dr. Malcolm the mathematician to a second ""Jurassic Park"" island, where Dr. Hammond's nephew is trying to kidnap the dinosaurs and exploit them in his San Diego theme park. Dr. Hammond's goal is to let the dinosaurs roam free on the island, away from mankind.There are more dinosaurs in this film, including my favorite one, Stegosaurus. Like the previous film, the sound and special effects for the dinosaurs made the creatures well-executed and realistic, making the movie believable.The cast of characters is larger in number in this movie, with each playing a significant role to help accentuate the plot of the movie and keep it going at a fast pace. Steven Spielberg gave another solid direction for this film, providing non-stop scenes of thrills, drama and character development. My favorite part in the movie is when Sarah (Julianne Moore) attempts to escape from being trapped inside her collapsed trailer hanging over a cliff, trying not to fall through the glass while it slowly breaks open. Also, my favorite line in the movie is when Ian (Jeff Goldblum) tells Sarah she would return home in not a couple of weeks but a couple of pieces.I thought, though, that the excessive dinosaur attacks are a little overkill and the movie lacks the charm and spirit of the first one.

"The dinosaurs weren't so smart after all, now were they ?","From the first movie, the dinosaurs are presented as quite smart and cunning.

How touching. And how utterly idiotic. And then the TRex comes and they just give him the baby back. You'd almost expect him to say ""thanks"" and maybe offer them a pumpkin pie.I think the script really sucked because the only ideas they could come up with in order to put the characters in a dangerous situation, was for the characters to do stupid things.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park,"There's lovely quote from the late Lord Attenborough at the end of this film along the lines of ""...creatures don't need our help to survive, they need our absence"". Never a truer word, but sadly it doesn't really enliven this merchandising booster of a film. The aforementioned gent, ""Hammond"" has had control of his company wrested away from him and informs chaotician ""Malcolm"" (Jeff Goldblum) that there's a B-site full of the beasties from the first film and his new board are determined to monetise them all. He has to get there first, and so armed with his sarcastic wit and the savvy Quatermain-esque ""Tembo"" (Pete Postlethwaite) off he goes. Of course, it being a Spielberg movie, there has to be an annoying child and in this case that's the stowaway ""Kelly"" (Vanessa Chester) and to complete our line up of charm-free misfits we have Vince Vaughn's ""Nick"" and Julianne Moore's ""Sarah"". Thereafter we embark on an whole load of set-piece snatched from the jaws (literally) of death time and time again type scenarios from the real stars of the show, only they have lost the wow factor of their 1993 outing and so now look like pale imitations or something from Ray Harryhausen's reject pile. The story is all too hysterically predictable as it turns out that the venal and the scientific end up going head to head with each other, and the ravenous dinosaurs, before a denouement that is entirely fitting but about ninety minutes later than I wanted it to be. Postlethwaite is the only one here who has anything like a character, in many ways akin to Bob Peck's first time round and there are some astonishingly creative visuals, but this is a sequel that nobody is going to look back upon very fondly.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"How can this film have a good note, I do not understand","I remembered from my childhood that of the three Jurassic Park movies that existed at the time, this one was the only bad one. In my memory I had three scenes in mind - all of them were action scenes.Having re-watched it now - perhaps 15 years or so after having seen it for the first time - I think this happened because the plot to this one is so incredibly weak. In french there is a word, ""décousu"", which means ""un-sowed"", like it wasn't properly sown together, and it was just a bunch of ideas jumbled up into fast-paced action scenes made to impress the public. But the actors are terrible, the plot is weak, and everything is so predictable, that you wonder how anyone could have been payed to write it. I feel like anyone could have easily drafter the plot line to this film on their kitchen table, thinking ""Hm, what could happen after the first film?"".I think this film has a good ""grade"" on here in part due to the film being made by Spielberg, and most people wouldn't give a bad note to a big celebrity like him. Maybe, also, it's because they tried to like it very hard, only because the fist one was so good. Maybe they are trying to fool themselves only not to wonder ""why did I lose two hours of my life"". Or, finally, maybe it's because people who put in a good note like films with Vince Vaughn. When I saw he was in this movie I thought ""this is going to be a bad movie, because every movie with Vince Vaughn is a bad movie"". So it was, and therefore, maybe the positive feedback on here only come from die hard Vince Vaughn fans, who enjoy his brand of over-acted badly put together cheap action films.I wouldn't watch this film again unless I were well payed to do so.

Good,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American adventure and sci-fi movie directed by Steven Spielberg, the second of the Jurassic Park franchise. The film was produced by Gerald R. Molen and Colin Wilson. The script was written by David Koepp, based on Michael Crichton's novel The Lost World. The film stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Schiff, Arliss Howard, Thomas F. Duffy, Vanessa Lee Chester and Richard Attenborough. Four years after the events of Jurassic Park, dinosaurs have been secretly living on a desert island without human interference. In the time between the two films, John Hammond lost control of his company, InGen, to his nephew, Peter Ludlow. Ludlow assembles a team to the island to bring the animals to the continent to generate revenue for the company. Hammond sees the chance to redeem himself for his past mistakes by sending an expedition led by Dr. Ian Malcolm to the island before Ludlow's group gets there. The two groups face a great danger and must come together for their own survival. The movie is good but loses the prestige, here is no worse!

A Thrilling Ride,"Jurassic Park II, officially known as The Lost World: Jurassic Park, takes audiences back into the dinosaur-laden world that captivated viewers in the original film. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this sequel shifts the focus to Isla Sorna, the island where dinosaurs were originally bred before being moved to Jurassic Park.The story follows Dr. Ian Malcolm, who returns to lead a team of experts sent to document the dinosaurs in their natural habitat. As they venture deeper into the island, they encounter a variety of prehistoric creatures, some familiar and some new, all while grappling with the ethical implications of their presence. The stakes escalate when a rescue mission turns dangerous, leading to thrilling encounters that highlight both the wonder and peril of these magnificent creatures.While Jurassic Park II features stunning visual effects and intense action sequences, it does not quite capture the groundbreaking storytelling and suspense of its predecessor. The character development feels less robust, and some plot points lack the same depth that made the first film so compelling.Despite these shortcomings, there are exhilarating moments that showcase the film's ambition and the awe of the dinosaurs.

Far from Spielberg's Best,"Though it is far from Steven Spielberg's best work, it is also not his worst. The Lost World improves in certain ways on the original and yes, it devolves in many ways too. For one, the visual effects are even better. The score by John Williams is terrific, and I must say the overall look is more atmospheric and absorbing than the squeaky-clean theme park look of the first Jurassic Park. The problem is that too much of the film is spent with the more frightening dinosaurs, rather than the calm majestic sense that Spielberg allows the dinos to have in the original for the first hour before he went off and gave us the thrill ride. Also the sequel forgets that what made the first one so successful was that it managed to give us a thought-provoking set-up. The Lost World offers none of that. As an adventure it is above average but as a Spielberg film it is admittedly below par. Still, it can be said that the scenes reintegrated by FOX on TV helped establish more plot development. They helped develop characters and it is anyone's guess why Spielberg had them cut. They are making a third film, so despite what people thought of this episode, everyone will again be flocking to see JP 3 when it comes out. Cast hopefuls: Jeff Goldblum (da), Sam Neill, Pete Postelthwaite, Richard Attenborough, and why not- Richard Dreyfuss. For being a loose, entertaining venture, I give this an 8.

Cinema Omnivore - The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) 7.1/10,"-> In THE LOST WORLD, a sequel promoting mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum, a hoot!), a supporting character in the predecessor (he is the wackiest and wisest among the fold), in the center, Spielberg and his team expands the scope with broader ideas, incorporating corporate corruption, non-interference ideal, trigger-happy hunters, an environmentalist spin, into the capitalistic drive of building a ""theme park"" attraction, with a less-thrilling climax of a T-Rex rampaging our built environment. Everything works just fine save for the vapid script, answerable for many a lousy, improbable decision, for example, why Sarah Harding (Moore, erring on the side of monomania), an over-zealous behavior paleontologist and Ian's girlfriend, would rather perversely keep wearing a vest soaked in blood, that could lead the T-Rex, who is alleged endowed with a highly acute sense of smell, to their trail? Is she really not aware of that? But the camera's fixation of the vest might suggest otherwise. Then, there is no remorse in her and Nick Van Owen (Vaughn), a documentarian, for the casualties engendered by their do-good act of snatching a wounded infant T-Rex, whose parents are just in the vicinity. Is ""human life"" cheaper than the precious species's? Judging by the film, Spielberg and co.

"It's a sequel,","Repeat after me ... ""Sequels aren't original....""They're in it for the money... well, DUH!  But that doesn't mean the creative people aren't trying.  An earlier review gave very little credit to the work that was done on this movie.  I agree, the story line isn't as good as the original.  Very few sequels are.  But then again, the first movie wasn't exactly Academy Award material, either.  It's pure entertainment. The audience didn't come to see ""Driving Miss Daisy"" - they came to see realistic dinosaurs and action sequences.  Believable or not.I thought the first portion of the film did a fine job of explaining the premise behind a trip to this new island.  No, it wasn't very deep and certainly wasn't dramatic.  But the purpose was to explain why the trip is being made.  Quickly and without a lot of to-do.  And I personally like Jeff Goldblum.  If anything, I think Jeff went a bit light on the character.  In the original book, Ian Malcom is basically a brilliant mathematician who doesn't get along with others.  Jeff Goldblum didn't make him as arrogant or annoying as he could have, and even made him a bit more likeable in this sequel.  Not necessarily a mistake; since he's the central character, it makes sense that the audience like him.  I would have liked Sam Neill back, also; but not in place of Jeff.  And Julianne Moore was excellent in her role, also.Not impressed with the dinosaur bits?  Well, perhaps the acting, but certainly not the special effects.  The SFX and computer work on this film were just fantastic!  And that's really what the audience paid for.Finally, just a -minor- correction.  It was San Diego, not San Francisco.

A guilty pleasure,"Is The Lost World: Jurassic Park technically a good movie? Well not really. As a film on it's own, it's OK, it has plenty of forgettable characters, plot holes in a few places and some comedy that really falls flat. As a sequel, it's mediocre, with a few inconsistencies here and there. And as an adaptation, it is absolutely terrible. I won't get into a long rant about how much they changed, but if you have read the book, then you will have almost no idea that the movie was supposed to be an adaptation.So why do I enjoy this movie. Well the action scenes are thrilling. The trailer scene alone makes this movie worth watching, but the T-Rex in San Diego is also pretty cool. Ian Malcolm is pretty hilarious and I like Tempo. And while the special effects aren't as mind blowing as they were in the first film they are still very good and a nice mix of practical and CGI.While not a very good movie, The Lost World is a pretty fun movie. It's a guilty pleasure, it sure isn't as good as the original, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as some people say.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fantastic effects and action, but a so-so story","Jurassic Park took the world by storm. It defined 90's pop culture and is still considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, and its my favourite film of all time. There are now 5 sequels to this modern classic, though none have really reached its heights. This first sequel demonstrates perfectly what made the sequels work, and what held them back from greatness.In The Lost World Jurassic Park, Ian Malcolm is back and must return to an island of dinosaurs to save his girlfriend. While there, the company that created the dinosaurs has arrived to recoup their losses...by capturing these powerful creatures and bring them to the main land.The problem here was summed up by Steven Spielberg himself. He found himself losing interest in the film as they were filming it. He was constantly worried that he was delivering action scenes with little substance for the rest of the film.The writing is bad, but it is made worse by the fact that the story, while not bad, isn't interesting. Man vs dinosaur is finally introduced as a theme, but it is less interesting than the abandoned themes of science vs nature, leaving the past alone, chaos theory and the threat of genetics. All this does is dumb it down. Malcolm is a fun character, and Jeff Goldbloom is great, but he works better as a side character than a lead. Pete Postlethwaite and Peter Stormare make for fun characters too. Everyone else is pretty dumb and at times annoying. You don't care who gets eaten or not.But even Spielberg on autopilot is better than the average director. There are some great moments here. The music by John Williams is just as good, though not as memorable, as that of the original.The action is this film is topnotch. The best action scenes here rival the best action in the first film. The trailer over the cliff and the long grass scene being highlights. The finale in San Diego makes up for a lot! It's the best section of the film, delivering something different, exciting and just plain cool. The effects are somehow still the best of the series. There are a couple bad green screen moments, but the dinosaurs have never looked more real.The Lost World Jurassic Park is not a bad film, and is much better than reviews of the time gave it credit. But it is an uninteresting one. Great action, music and effects is fun. But without characters to really care for or a plot to entertain you on the down times, it is just enjoyable dressing. But if dino mayhem is what you want, then this is right up your alley.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Well Made Sequel to a Classic,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997, Dir. Steven Spielberg)After a small girl is attacked by a small group of compsognathus, Ian Malcolm discovers that there is a second island full of a variety of dinosaurs. Dr. John Hammond decides to send four adventure to monitor the dinosaur's lifestyle before INGEN move forward in controlling the island. Ian Malcolm doesn't like the idea and wants to contact the other three members, but before he can contact them, he finds out that his girlfriend, Sarah Harding is already on the island. Now, what was supposed to be a natural viewing of the incredible creatures in their habitats, has turned into a rescue mission with everyones life at danger.'Jurassic Park' was released in 1993 and is now an instant classic, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' had a lot to live up to, and although it isn't quite as good as the original film, it's still an exciting and amazing trip through Spielberg's imaginative world. The story is interesting and has many twists and turns. The actors give amazing performances from everyone on the cast. The special effects like the original film, are amazing. They look so realistic and really fit in with the full motion models created. If you want an incredible adventure, then you need to watch this film series.""But later, there's running and screaming."" - Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as the first one but it is a good film.,"I know the entirety of The Lost World: Jurassic Park when I watched it that is to say it's scary when I was a kid even if I haven't seen the first Jurassic Park film and then came the third film. Overall I decide to give this review a bit of a mind of what I think of it right now. The Lost World: Jurassic Park doesn't follow on Alan Grant played by Sam Neill this time but focuses mostly on Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum. Ian Malcolm is off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica along with Nick Van Owen played by Vince Vaughn and Eddie to find his girlfriend, Sarah Harding played by Julianne Moore after learning that John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow took control of InGen, is planning to capture the Isla Sorna dinosaurs and bring them to the mainland. So they found Sarah, founding out that Ian's daughter, Kelly is in the trailer and the InGen's squad has arrived to capture the dinosaurs. Okay, I know Fallen Kingdom did the same thing but I couldn't argue with the fact that the film is a mix bag. I don't mind, don't get me wrong but I found everything about it to be modern. Let me get to the negatives. The acting. Well, I find the acting to be good but it's only a mix bag for the characters but you can warm up with mixes. Now I can get to the positives cause there are a few. John Williams is back to compose the theme of Jurassic Park and this time, he's doing a different theme and you know what? I really like this theme. I really like listening to it at the ending credits. Pete Postlethwaite is actually really good in it. You can't really go wrong with him. The scenes are thrilling with the dinosaurs but the bits of others are just kind of modern and cheesy. I'm just saying the dinosaurs are the best part about it when they're on screen and I love every minute of them. The third half act is what I like where the T-Rex is attacking San Diego. So that's it with mixes with good and a bit of bad. I really do like this movie for everything that thrills despite it's flaws in this even if you warm up with everything about it. It's not as good as the first film and that's saying something. It has it's dumb moments and good moments but I can't really complain about it. Richard Attenborough appears briefly in the film. He only appears with Jeff Goldblum and the end. So overall, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is an overall modern adventure flick for it's good special effects and the overall well known, Steven Spielberg, even though it's not one of his best films and not one of everybody's best sequels but I enjoyed it for what it is. Not to mention that the people had mix feelings about Basic Instinct thinking how convoluted it is about who killed Johnny Boz. So overall, this is not a bad film. It's an enjoyable sequel to Jurassic Park. Jurassic Park will return, but it won't be with Steven Spielberg. It'll be Joe Johnston next time.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Gorgeous Undercooked Misfire,"Watching this movie as a youngster, I felt confused but emotionally engaged. Now I am older the confusion takes over and I see how 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' was poorly conceived and forthright complicated.Jeff Goldblum feels very wrong here - there is no way this is the same character from the previous movie. Julianne Moore is striking and beautiful but her character is written very poorly. Vanessa Chester gives boundless energy and coolness but she's in the wrong movie. Pete Postlethwaite is simply not in it enough and is wasted. Peter Stormare is positively well remembered, along with Richard Schiff.I agree with the criticism that there are too many characters with too many of their own agendas. The direction is not clear and the action spawns from the overall chaos and incompetence of the characters.That being said, Steven Spielberg is a top tier world builder, and everything is marvellous to look at, and that is carrying this a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"great book, horrid movie","Michael Chrichton's book is a wonderful sequel and even surpasses the original story in a few places. However, this horrid attempt at film-making by the usually great Spielberg is too awful for words. It basically has nothing to due with the book at all and the ending where the dinosaurs reek havoc in San Diego is absolutely one of the cheesiest sequences ever put to film. Perhaps I would have liked the movie more if I hadn't read the book before seeing it and had such high hopes for it, but that is not the case. This is one of the most dreadful film sequels in all history. It's such a shame since the first one was so good.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not the book, but an enjoyable movie","Having read both Jurassic Park books, I can honestly tell you the film is very different. This movie is based mainly on Ian Malcolm, whose main objective at the beginning is to rescue his girlfriend, who has traveled alone to the long hidden Site B, an island where the dinosaurs for Jurassic Park had been born and raised. After being abandoned for decades, the island has been somehow thriving. The research team goes over to investigate, with Malcolm coming along only to save his girlfriend Sarah, when all of them, including his daughter who stowed away in the trailers, get more than they bargained for. It ends with the foolishly ambitious new head of InGen importing a live T-Rex and it's child into San Diego and the chaos and terror that results. Although it is not quite as good as the first movie, there is something about it that you can like. Plus it's better than the horrible third movie.

"Nice Try, Steven Spielberg, But Why Don't We Just Forget 1997 Happened to You","Oy vey, 1997 was a bad year for Steven Spielberg.Much like in 1993, when Spielberg had two movies circulating movie theatres, one a prestige film with Oscar written all over it (""Schindler's List"") and the other one of his fun house rides (""Jurassic Park""), 1997 saw the release of ""Amistad"" and ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park."" However, ""Amistad"" happened to be perhaps the worst movie he ever made, with ""The Lost World"" a close second.He clearly should have stopped while he was ahead, because while the visual effects in this sequel to his original dinosaur movie are just as good, everything else is abysmally worse.Grade: F",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
underrated sequel to overrated blockbuster,"People who hate the Lost World but love Jurassic Park boggle the mind. The success of Jurassic Park was based on the novelty of cgi technology--and the suspense of a plastic cup filled with trembling water. It had a poor plot, weak acting, terrible dialogue. I did not expect the Lost World to be any better(and it certainly had some shameless moments, mainly the gymnastics scene)--but it surprised me on a number of fronts. Spielberg was obviously changed after Schindler's List, for he ejected the sugary formula and cutsy children that we have come to know(and I loathe) from his 90's films. Yes, we are introduced to a bonafide Spielberg urchin at the beginning--who is soon attacked by the objects of her affection. And yes, we have a simple story of good v.s. evil(which was strangely absent in JP), but with some intersting twists. Vince Vaughn's character is introduced as a hedonistic photographer, who did his stint with Greenpeace. later we learn that he is actually a member of Earth First--a much more ""enthusiastic"" environmental group.The dinosaurs are presented as animals in the film(unlike the first movie), capable of defending themselves not only from the bad guys but the good guys as well. Petting a baby stegosaurus almost gets one character spiked, and the consequences for mending another dino-infant's human-derived injuries gets another good guy chomped in half. Best of all, the baby T-rex who is the focus of much danger throughout the movie gets to make the final kill! It was little ironic touches like this that warmed me to this movie on second viewing, as well as the cynical and refreshing message it delivered: If a Lost World of dinosaurs or other animals was discovered, humans would surely destroy it if they could. Pretty heavy for a saturday matinee action adventure flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More hungry dinosaurs!,"After the success of the first film it went pretty much without saying that a sequel would come along and while it was not received as well by critics and general viewers it still had numerous charms. The problem with this sequel is that it lacks the element of surprise and from where I'm standing that is the main problem the film has. Otherwise I believe that it is a fair sequel. In short I liked it.One thing I missed in The Lost World was Sam Neill. I thought he did an exceptional job in the first film and therefore I do not fully understand why he wasn't in the second film (of course I know that his character might not be in the novel upon which the film is based but they could have added him anyway). Instead Jeff Goldblum gets a chance to prove what he can do. He didn't really get to portray many nuances in the first film as a result of relatively limited screen time. In The Lost World , however, he proves that he really can act. He brings the character more down to earth than he was in the first film and it suits the character as he becomes more believable. Julianne Moore does a good job with her character as well. She is a good female counterpart to Goldblum's character as she produces a very likable character. Pete Postlethwaite's character is the most interesting in the film. His reasons for coming to the island are perhaps a bit ridiculous but the way he plays the character makes it worth it. Arliss Howard is a good, greedy villain. He plays the character in a way that makes the character seem like an intelligent character who is blinded by his greed. The supporting cast is good as well. Especially Peter Stormare and Vince Vaughn do good jobs. The acting is overall inferior to that of the first film but it is still very worthwhile.The effects have naturally improved from the first film. Spielberg has himself said that the way he saw it was that people saw the first film to see if they could make the dinosaurs seem believable and since the first film proved that people saw the second film to see what they could do with the dinosaurs. Accordingly the film is full of even more details than the first. There is a high level of interaction. Much more than in the first film and to Spielberg's credit it all works and seems 100% believable. The tyrannosaurus still looks absolutely brilliant and even more detailed than in the first film. You see veins and imperfections. Raptors return as well and the scenes they appear in are very tense like in the first film. Among the additions to the dinosaur cast is the stegosaurus and it, like the other dinosaurs, looks nothing short of impressive. Overall the effects are very good but we already knew that Spielberg could do it so it is really what was to be expected.The story is decent. Spielberg does what he often does. He takes his time and builds up the characters so we as the audience will care about them. Even though the story is not as well conceived as it was in the first film it still works. The film retains the message of the first film, making it more than just an effects movie. The message of course being that man should not play God and let nature find its own way. Other than this the story is both tense, interesting and allows the characters to grow. Some people found the ending a bit ridiculous and a bit of a copy of Godzilla but I didn't see that. I thought it was very tense and atmospheric.Overall I agree with the general consent that The Lost World is not as good as the original but in my opinion it is not a bad film either. The Lost World has a lot to offer both in terms of storytelling but of course also in terms of effects. The only advice I can give future viewers is that you should watch the film with an open mind and try not to let yourself be too affected by the negative tone surrounding the film.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The sense of humor saves it.,"My first consideration when judging The Lost World: Jurassic Park (JP2) is that however flawed the movie is, its dinosaur sequences are really fun, and they delivered exactly what I wanted when I saw the movie on the big screen.When a movie shows me a guy riding a motorcycle underneath a brontosaur, and depicts the dinosaur so realistically that the stunt looks completely believable, I'm willing to tolerate a jokey script and direction.The talking points on this movie seem to be that the script is bad, and Spielberg's direction of it isn't very good.I'm actually not surprised that the script isn't good, because it's based (however loosely and lazily) on Crichton's not-very-good novel The Lost World, a follow-up to Jurassic Park.  Sure, the book is entertaining, with sequences that should have been kept in the movie (such as velociraptors attacking people trapped in the high hide, and an encounter with chameleon dinosaurs which another comment mentioned already); but overall its story is a lame rehash, its characters are dull and/or unappealing and its action sequences become increasingly ridiculous.Therefore, even when I first saw JP2 in May 1997 I wasn't surprised by its lame plot, dull characters or ridiculous action sequences.  What did surprise me was that scriptwriter Koepp managed to somewhat redeem the ludicrously contrived story by absolutely smothering it in wisecracks: there's hardly a scene in JP2 that doesn't have a humorous line or two, with most of the best ones going to the naturally flip Goldblum (my favorite is ""Increase your rate of climb!"", during the trailer-cliffhanger sequence).While the actors in the first JP treated it more or less seriously (led by Sam Neil, who played his role absolutely straight), the cast of JP2 treats it like the lightweight special-effects thriller that it is: even the solid supporting actors like Schiff and Postlethwaite play the movie straight only half the time, then play it for laughs the other half.  It's a classic case of ""if you can't make the sequel better, make it funnier.""Many people seem to resent that JP2 is such a big send-up of itself, and it's arguably so flawed that not even its sense of humor can save it. Well, I actually don't mind the movie's shoddiness or its lack of depth because it was obviously never intended as a ""serious"" movie anyway.It's easy for me to hate an unintentionally stupid movie, because a stupid movie unaware of its own stupidity is usually boring; but JP2 is so intentionally, CHEERFULLY stupid (and aware of its stupidity) that I can't easily hate it.Consider the memorable sequence in which several characters run through tall grass and dinosaurs begin devouring them one by one: after watching the sequence, I could imagine Koepp smiling as he wrote it and Spielberg smiling as he directed it, because there is such a guilty pleasure to be derived from watching people being careless and thoughtless in a situation that demands care and thought.One character even warns the others to not enter the grass, then joins them anyway and plunges ahead: scenes of dinosaurs stalking, attacking and eating people are more fun when the people seem to be thinking, ""The dinosaurs won't eat me!  They'll eat the others, but not me!""Despite all its joking, the script is actually an efficient continuation of the first movie's theme that the best possible intentions can produce the worst possible result.  One character is determined to prevent the exploitation of the dinosaurs, but his actions (inadvertently?) cause the death of nearly everyone on the island; not enough people have acknowledged the irony that he was sent by Hammond, who created the dinosaurs and is ultimately responsible for all the deaths in both JP movies.  The best line in JP2 is Malcolm's reply to Hammond's assertion that he's not making the same mistakes: ""No, no, you're making all new ones!""The script also manages to explore the spectrum of human attitudes toward nature: Postlethwaite gives the best performance of the movie as (yet another) old-fashioned big-game hunter who respects the power of the dinosaurs yet can only express his appreciation by wanting to kill a tyrannosaur for sport.  Stormare's character is also memorable because his contempt for the little compsognathus dinosaurs has unfortunate consequences; Hammond's nephew coldly regards the dinosaurs as his products and has no respect for the power of nature they represent (he is not evil merely because he is a capitalist, as some people have argued).So I don't think the JP2 script is bad, or that Spielberg's JP2 direction is poor.JP2 is rated last among all the movies that Spielberg has directed, but I would rather watch it a tenth time than watch Hook again, or Empire of the Sun, or any of the other weak links in the Spielberg canon.A previous comment complained that Spielberg overdirected the tyrannosaur attack on the trailers: I actually agree, but I believe the exaggeration was intentional.  Spielberg has already proven himself a master of cliffhanger action in the first JP and the Indiana Jones movies; he didn't have to overdirect the JP2 sequence, but he probably did so with humorous intentions.Spielberg is that rare kind of director who isn't afraid to poke fun at himself, and the cliffhanger sequence with the trailers is so humorously and deliberately overstated that it can only be a Spielberg self-parody.  He's a director who does what he intends, and I don't believe he overdirected the sequence merely because he was bored or careless.The other complaint, that Spielberg's use of overlapping dialogue (with several characters talking together) indicated that he was bored with the movie, is answered by the fact that overlapping dialogue is a Spielberg trademark which appears in many of his movies, good or bad.JP2 is an entertaining and worthy sequel, and neither the script nor the direction is as bad as some people have argued.Rating: 7 (It's worth seeing at least once.)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A sequel easily dismissed, but worth reevaluation.","Nine times out of ten, a bad Spielberg film is usually better than most. This film has a bad reputation and is usually dismissed as a less than perfect sequel, but it deserves another look, if only to show how good it really is. Sure, there are plot holes and some bad choices, but those shouldn't tarnish the overall film.So what's the good? The dialogue for one thing is well written and well delivered. Early exchanges between field equipment expert Eddie and lead Ian Malcolm are snappy and amusing (""violence and technology - not good bedfellows!"" ""I would have squeezed a little tighter...""), while Pete Postlethwaite's character is magnificently arrogant and snide. Even Vince Vaughan, deprived of his usual schtick, is not given short thrift. Part of Spielberg's genius is his eye for situational character beats and his way of dealing with actors. If you notice, almost none of his films short change the characters. Hook, for example, is strongest in it's first half hour, in which we witness Banning's family problems and inability to let go of his work. Notice also Poltergeist. If anyone had any doubts as to the answer to the question of who really directed that film, compare the family scenes with Close Encounters or Jaws. Here too, Spielberg shoe horns in those moments.Aside from the actors, the dinos are still breathtaking four years on. Why are these creatures so awesome and more recent CGI (including Spielberg's own War of the Worlds and Indy 4) are so underwhelming? The action sequences still have the punch of the original: Sarah Harding desperately trying not to move on the cracking glass that is the only thing between her and the abyss below. The velociraptor attack. The T-Rex sniffing out our heroes behind a waterfall. All wonderfully crafted sequences. Now have a look at Jurassic Park 3 and see the difference. An entertaining film, sure, but lacking the sheen and quality of a Spielberg film.While the missing Raptor sequence that explains the deaths on the boat near the end provides the film's biggest plot hole and the King Kong homage is a little too much, the film still doesn't lose it's sense of excitement and fun, driving it to a rousing finale.Like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (which is much maligned, but I think it's the second best of the series) The Lost World is frequently dismissed, but to my mind worthy of another go.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of Spielberg's few disappointments...,"First off, I loved Jurassic Park, as well as most Spielberg films, but felt that The Lost World should never have been made.  Jurassic Park (both the book and the movie) are instant classics, whereas The Lost World (both the book and the movie) look to be quick cash-in rush jobs.  Did Spielberg have to fulfill his commitment to Universal before he could focus his attention to Amistad, his feature directing debut for his own studio, DreamWorks?  I don't know, but the resulting Jurassic Park sequel doesn't have any of the classic ""Spielberg touches"" to it.The Lost World is a mish-mash of scenes thrown together without much coherent sense.  The boring scenes were to long (most of the beginning), and the scenes that were exciting were cut way to short (the raptor attack in the brush would've been great if it was extended a few minute longer).  And lets not get into the whole mainland sequences because those just made me wince.  (The Godzilla homages, for example, border on camp.)Spielberg has said that he made The Lost World for all the millions who wanted a second E.T., but never got it (he swore he'd never do a sequel).  I for one wish that he'd made that promise with Jurassic Park because the ""what if"" of a sequel that is never produced is a far greater allure than an inferior one that is.My grade: C",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They don't hold automatic weapons and run away without even attempting to use them. They don't listen to music when they know there's a dangerous situation and they need to be alert. And they don't sabotage weapons, knowing full well they are in mortal danger and those weapons may be needed, regardless of their political beliefs.Jeff Goldblum carries most of the movie. The rest were a bit meh. As for the girl - why bother to have her in at all. She added nothing to the story other than raising the question (actually asked by a character in the movie and not explained) about who exactly her parents were. I suppose they at least didn't have Sam Neill in it - a man who can't act his way out of a paper bag.I've recently watched all of the JP movies (some for the first time, like this one) and this is clearly the weakest by a country mile.Four stars for the dinosaurs and Jeff Goldblum.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but not amazing Sequel,"The film is very flawed in places especially by silly parts of the story, for example the San Diego scenes at the end and leaves many unanswered questions like: why is Ian Malcolm's daughter black? and how what happened on the transport ship to San Diego (trying to avoid spoilers) actually happened?. I also generally dislike the character of Ian Malcolm, having grown up as a bit of a dinosaur nerd and a nerd in general I was always a big fan of Dr. Alan Grant but find Ian Malcolm on occasion funny but mostly slightly irritating.It does however have some very good points one of these for me was Pete Postlethwaite's character named Roland Tembo. The character he plays is an obsessive hunter who refuses a fee for helping Ingen's mission on site B and only requests that he gets to hunt a male Tyrannosaurus Rex. Roland Tembo realises the foolishness of his boss who suggest placing their camp in the middle of an area frequently visited by carnivores and says ""I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas, OK?"" which is possibly the best line in the film. The later Velociraptor scenes are also good but with some slightly silly parts especially for younger viewers who will be especially worried when Ian Malcolm is hiding in a car while a raptor slowly edges its way through the window. The scene where Malcolm's group have there camp attacked is also a particular highlight and by far the best scene of the film with the hanging over the cliff scenes incredibly tense.The film provides both intensity and often good quality light humour but it is nothing on the original. The lack of Dr Grant ( who it should be noted is not in the book that the film is based on), the chaotic plot and also the irritating character of Malcolm's daughter combine to make it an inferior sequel but not an above average film. It is especially superior to Jurassic Park III and doesn't take long to get into the action but its flaws mean it will always be recognised as inferior to the original Jurassic Park",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Mindless but not bad, just average->","This movie hardly impressed me in either way. The dinosaurs didn't make an unrealistic impression, the vehicles and equipment didn't impress me at all (judging by their looks they were supposed to impress me.) As far as I can tell there are no huge problems in logic, (watch Timecop for a really messed up story full of holes in logic) then again, there wasn't much of a story to mess up. What probably would have made this movie better was people doing more than running and screaming (they did do some other things but not much else), the movie also could have used some more humor (Independence Day had lots of it and probably made the movie a lot better than it would have been without.)

It totally ruined a perfectly good Dinosaur, special effects showcase.

"A Great Director, a poor adaptation.","In my mind, Steven Spielberg can do no wrong.  However, the people behind the scenes forking over the money for movies can do a lot of wrong.  If anyone had read the book this movie is loosely based off of(I'm being very kind), they would know that this movie hardly resembled what Michael Crichton wrote.  I also have to question how much input he had into this movie.  Let's face it, the first two thirds of this movie were okay, but when they took it to San Diego and turned it into a Godzilla movie, it ran itself directly into the ground.  If they had given it another name it would have been a fun movie.  Other that all that I would like to say the cast did a wonderful job.  Jeff Goldblum has always been one of my favorites and he is the true Ian Malcolm.  Michael Crichton must have used Jeff as his model when he wrote the character.

This is a hair below the greatness of the first one but it's still a worthwhile sequel,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Ian Malcolm from the first film discovering there's a second island filled with dinosaurs that John Hammond would like to cultivate for scientific study. Ian wants no part of it until he discovers his girlfriend has been sent. He heads to the island to save her and discovers he isn't the only one who has been sent to the island.This movie is directed by Steven Spielberg (The Color Purple) and stars Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Julianne Moore (Boogey Nights), Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects), Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers), Peter Stormare (Fargo) and Arliss Howard (Full Metal Jacket).This is a very well put together sequel with a lot of the same magic and intensity of the first movie. The soundtrack is once again outstanding as are the special effects. The cast is very well selected and the characters are fun, both the good guys and bad guys. The storyline unfolds perfectly and the daughter/daddy bond is great. The T-Rex scenes in this are tremendous and the raptors once again steal the show. The ending does have a King Kong feel to it in a lot of ways.Overall this is a hair below the greatness of the first one but it's still a worthwhile sequel. I would score this a strong 8/10 and would definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tyrannosaurus Was The Key.,"The Lost World is a sequel that is often said to be vastly inferior to Jurassic Park. While I agree that Jurassic Park is the better film, The Lost World is a very good film as well.Ian Malcolm and three others travel to Isla Sorna. While they are there to just observe the dinosaurs and how they have adapted. A group of hunters/entrepeaneurs travel to the island as well intent on capturing various dinosaurs and putting them into a zoo back in the United States.The story is pretty easy to follow. I like how they expanded the story from the first film and make references to ""Jurassic Park"" as well.Acting was very good for the most part. Jeff Goldblum is awesome as always and though many people miss Grant in this film, I think that Malciolm is cool to see as the lead character. I did not really like Julianne Moore as the female lead in this film. NOt anywhere near as good as Laura Dern in ""Jurassic Park"".THe dinosaurs made this film. The velociraptors return and are as scary and terrifying as always. Computer graphics are used a lot for the dinosaurs in this film and for the most part it all looks pretty good and realistic.The Tyrannosaurus returns. For me the Tyrannosaurus made the film and is the main reason it is such a good film. Tyrannosaurus gets in a lot of action going after the hunting party, pushing trailers off cliffs, and going on a rampage through the city. I love how they pay respect to the original Lost World film by bringing the Tyrannosaurus back to the city the same way in the original Lost World they bring back a Brontosaurus. Tyrannosaurus going on a rampage through the city works so well and is the best part of the film. In fact the rampage Tyrannosaurus goes on is better than what the 1997 Godzilla did.The Tyrannosaurus is not just a rampaging monster in this film. Also it is portrayed as being a very loving and caring parent in how it takes care of its baby. Tyrannosaurus takes very good care of its baby in this film and I like how they added these parenting scenes.There also are a few new dinosaurs that appear in this film including Pachysaphalasaurus, Parasaurolophus, and Compsognathus. New dinosaurs are always good to see.I love this film. Jeff Goldblum is great, there is lots of action, but the Tyrannosaurus for me made the film. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An immediate bdropnof the ball,"Jurassic Park is an amazing film with a nicely wrapped up ending that never required a sequel. However, with Michael Chriton writing a sequel to his book, the scientists at iN-gen got to work at making a sequel that not even Spielberg could resurrect any of the heart and spectacle that made Jurassic park a timeless classic. That doesn't mean that the Lost World is devoid of any enjoyment, there are a few interesting characters namely the immortally swave Jeff Golblum returning as Ian Malcolm and a safari hunter out for a trex. The largest issue with this film is it's script, it lacks any of the pieces that makes the original work and is full of silly and stupid moments that spin kick you rightout of the film. If you like dinosaurs tearing stuff up and eating uninteresting characters then you may enjoy this, otherwise this film is a soft pass.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as groundbreaking as the original ""Jurassic Park"" but it's still a great sequel.","Spielberg's sequel to the his groundbreaking original does not break the same ground or carries the weight but it still has his masterful finger prints all over it and it still delivers. Jeff Goldblum once again brings an intelligent intensity to his role as Ian Malcolm and this time he is evenly matched by the late Pete Postlethwaite as a big game hunter looking for the ultimate prey in the scariest and most intense Jurassic film in the entire series. Honestly, I think there are more iconic scenes in this film than in the original and it has even better special effects. It just does not carry the same emotional weight as seeing dinosaurs for the first time as the original but this film is a completely different film than the original in tone and story.Its a great sequel and a great final film for this series by Steven Spielberg.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
unnecessary and nearly unwatchable sequel,"This movie commits a sin even if viewed as a stand-alone: It compels the characters to act stupidly in order to move the plot along. Case in point: a big-game hunter that doesn't realise that predators can follow the blood trail of their young. Another: a wildlife photographer who tries to pet the animals! Geeze. And Malcolm's daughter is a walking cliche. But what's worse, it violates the rules for sequels. It's not new, in any way (except to show us new dinosaurs, like the stegosauruses or the pterodactyls (pteranodons? either way, just how did Hammond intend to exhibit THEM? No roofs on Jurassic Park as I recall...), and it actually contradicts the original. For instance, Hammond flat out told us that EVERY dinosaur in the park was hatched in his lab under his personal supervision. So what's with this island? Again, the kids in JP did not act like children of the father JP:TLW showed us; they very definitely expected adult men to take care of them. ""He left us! He left us!"" cried Lexie in complete betrayal; that girl's father was around. So what happened? Another? How about the man who was ""always on the lookout for another future ex-Mrs Malcolm"" being presented to us a committed boyfriend? For that matter, Malcolm was the least likely person from JP to be the hero. And the whole ""T Rex in California"" bit ... doesn't work. There are a few nice scenes, but 2 minutes of dinosaur footage doesn't redeem this movie. Just watch the original again.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pure entertainment decent action, adventure thrill ride, my third personal favorite film in the franchise","I had fun entertainment I enjoy Dinosaur T-Rex in a city San Diego the chase and eating people, I had fun with that sequence. We have pure entertainment decent action - adventure thrill ride San Diego is a satisfying finale for me. Sarah shoots a tranquilizer dart at T-Rex, and Malcolm closes the hold's doors at the ship cargo that scene was a bad-ass awesome. Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding was good in this movie, I like her she was one of the reason I like watching this movie and I still will watch it. Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm was decent and likable I like him. Pretty good special effects, the CGI work for 1997 are pretty decent they are some nice practical effects as well.I had fun entertainment with the sequence where Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn are in this vehicle and it is been pushed off the cliff. No sequence was there after they get out of there, I like that sequence. Ian, Sarah and Kelly are fighting a group of raptors that have chased them into the facility I like that sequence. You see on a rooftop Sarah holding and raptor try's to eat her and she tricks him so that raptor falls down on another raptor and they start fighting each other I like that sequence.The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) is a decent action adventure film at best decent sequel to a classic Jurassic Park, I enjoy it. This is a good decent movie but it is my third favorite film of the three. It is miles way better than Jurassic World I enjoy this movie more than that movie and Jurassic Park III, I like the third Jurassic Park but I enjoy this one more.I love Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo as famous animal hunter he was awesome, I seriously I love the actor and his character.

He was the only one who capture the T-Rex and survived in this movie I enjoy the character so much I miss the actor.Steven Spielberg return to direct this movie and he was good I love his direction and his vision about the movie. Michael Crichton write another book to original classic novel and movie Jurassic Park. So this movie was based on his book and I have enjoy the film I watch it now the second time around. It is not better movie than the first one but a solid sequel.John Williams did return as music composer and he did return with his theme music score, not a bad music score.Returning Richard Attenborough as John Hammond was a good idea I like his character but I wish his character would have more to do, but he was only in a cameo scene. R.I.P. I also miss the actor it is a shame the actor also passed away.Steven Spielberg did not a bad job directing the film, I like his direction in this movie. Not a bad direction I love the jungle on a B site island.The Lost World: Jurassic Park it is my third personal favorite film of the trilogy, still I will watch it.

Downgraded sequel,"Following the steps of the original was certainly going to be a challenge. This seer isn't as good as it feels noticeably lesser and more generic. Not much is explained regarding the absence of Laura Dern or Sam Neill's character. However Jeff Goldblum is presence and takes the leading role. Featuring a younger Julianne Moore who is an instant upgrade over Laura Dern.The worst aspect of this film is that humans always seem to be stopped from fighting back against the Dinosaurs, it's understood for the Dinosaurs to kill the humans because they shouldn't mess with them. But Spielberg seems to be adamant that there should be no pleasure taken in humans killing Dinosaurs no matter how many people they kill. So the movie basically turns into a rather unpleasant kill fest. The story just simply isn't as entertaining and drags on more than the original.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Lost World shows Dr. Malcomn finding out about Site B of Jurassic Park and him going with a team there to study how dinosaurs lived without fences, barriers, human interference and lysine. Of course, we have Roland Trembo, a guy who's just leading Ingen's new operation to bring the dinos to San Diego zoo and Peter Ludlow, Ingen's new boss.

Much different film,"Jurassic Park was a marvel of modern filmmaking and like all modern blockbusters, The Lost World came out soon after. At the time it was surrounded by negative and mixed reviews. In hindsight, Spielberg was obviously attempting something much different and on this repeat viewing, I found myself enjoying the film. The Lost World is a much darker film, like Temple of Doom. It's not a direct sequel and it attempts to evolve the series from the usual park overrun by animals. The action is dialled up to 11 and it's a vast change in direction, a good one. I feel this film deserves more recognition, as it's not the usual studio sequel. Spielberg attempted something different and it works in my opinion. It's not a tired retread, Jurassic World did that to a very meh reaction. Strong film and one that deserves more attention.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

He comes to the island in a second attempt to steal Dino's. Unfortunately, he doesn't even appear. John Hammond was not in the second book at all either. The main reason for this would be that the Compies got to him in the original book. He wasn't even meant to live through that. There was a paleontologist who was THE main character in the book.

I liked it.,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a very enjoyable film and almost lives up to the first one. When I saw it in 1997 for the first time, I was shaking like crazy.

The main reasons why a lot of people disliked this movie is either they were expecting too much, or they just don't look for the right things in a movie. When I look at a JP movie, I look for suspense, action, surprises, good acting, and realism. The Lost World provided all of that. Therefore I liked it. When I saw The Lost World in the theater, I walked away from that movie convinced that I had seen a real Dinosaur. THAT, my friends, is what makes JP movies so wonderful. Jurassic Park and it's sequal are the only movies in the world that can do that (when it comes to dinosaurs). Godzilla('98), lacks all of that except action which is not enough to make a good movie. Godzilla and his babies had no personalities, because of this, it was very hard to believe Godzilla was real. Jurassic Park movies give all of there Dinosaurs personalities. When you watch a JP movie, you know the difference between the way a Raptor acts and the way a T-rex acts. If it wasn't for that, the Dinosaurs would be faker than ever, regardless of the really good CGI. The Dinosaurs do more than just run around eating people, each Dinosaur does it their own way.

The movie is just a rehash of the original.I guess that the reason that I gave this movie 2/10 stars instead of 1/10 is because this movie did make Vince Vaughn a star. He certainly does his best, as do Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Pete Postlethwaite. But no matter what they do, they can't escape the fact that the movie is ridiculous.

Big drop-off,"This is a flawed but fun dinosaur flick. There are lots of awesome parts, memorable scenes and creative ways to use the dinosaurs. But it's not nearly as good as its predecessor, and it's filled with really stupid moments. You really have to turn your brain off.Comparing it to the original, it's inferior in almost every way. Both movies take their time setting up the story, but in the sequel I kept thinking, ""let's just get to the action."" The entire setup feels forced with lot's or retconning and explaining why certain things have to happen this way.The character dynamics aren't nearly as natural as in the original. Character conflicts are introduced but never resolved, unlike the original. Philosophical themes are mentioned but not explored, unlike the original. The child character is poorly written, unlike the original. The way they try to make her useful in the plot is one of the dumbest scenes in cinema history.But the biggest drop-off is with the musical score. It's not bad, it just doesn't enhance the movie, whereas the first musical score is one the best ever and gives you goosebumps and a sense of awe. The only thing the sequel does as well as the original is create suspenseful scenes and tension-filled moments. (about 6 viewings, 5/30/2022)",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It had the best and most tense parts from the book. The trailer hanging over the edge of the cliff?Why didn't people like the San Diego part? It was entertaining and had action.

Oh how would a child react to a man getting his intestine ripped out by a dinosaur or a man's crotch being bit off by a dinosaur? Or would that not be gory enough? Gore is only essential for horror movies and The Lost World or any of the Jurassic Park movies are anything but horror films. They are Sci-fi adventure films.So why do people not like this film?

There's an island full of dinosaurs, two groups of people go there, they play around with customized vehicles, and then everything goes wrong and people get eaten.  A total of three characters from the book are in the movie and two of the interesting quotes were based on quotes that Crichton wrote.

What an adventure!!!!!!!,"Wow, this is the first Jurassic Park movie i saw and i have to say it really blew my head, it was just great, i had an incredible moment in the cinema that day, one of the best i have had in a cinema.Somebody said in other comment that there was no chemistry among the characters, bah, that's a big lie, they had a relation very funny and did really fit in the story, and the product of their relationship was really amusing. The actors did a great job and gave the characters a really definite personality, for example, Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) was the whole movie complaining of everything he could and was always ill-humored, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) was an adventurer-paleontologist that really wanted to change her life of bones digging out, Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) was photographer that only worked for acknowledgment.......and money, of course......and so, if you mix them up you get an eccentric and funny mixture. Richard Attenboroughplayed a short but nice part in this movie.The script was really good despite of all those here that think not, it had a great plot and had a lot of funny lines, specially for Jeff Goldblum, and i couldn't help laughing, the jokes are very very smart, not cheap ones.The special effects are a subject apart here in this movie, i think this movie has the greatest of all time and haven't been excelled yet. The dinosaurs seemed alive and more (the first time i saw it i thought they were real, i was a kid then, don't get me wrong, i knew dinosaurs were extinct, but i just couldn't think this was a product of computers) The scene when the In-gen team arrives to the island and they chase the dinosaurs is worthy of admiration and it's not the only one.The music is the classic from the first, and so, it couldn't be better. It could adjust to scare tunes, to fun and adventure ones.Spielberg did a great job with this movie better than with the first one, this is the best of all until now, let's wait for the forth movie and expect it will be as good as this, let's hope so.So resuming, this is one of the greatest movies that i've seen, (and i've seen lots) and should have a rating much superior than it has now, come on, you have to be fair.......",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
it's the same thing as the first movie: worth seeing for its special effects,"The idea of a sequel to the most successful movie made in 1993 stayed rooted in people's minds. Moreover, in the first movie, Sam Neil was astonished by found out that ""dinosaurs are breeding!"". However, scientifics who used to work for the ""jurassic park"" had developed a process that had to make the dinosaurs sterile. Apparently, there must have been a mistake or something they didn't think about. But for Spielberg, this carelessness was a kind of excuse to make a follow-up.As far as this sequel is concerned, well it's far from being superior to the first movie. If special effects are always dramatic and successful (you can notice that Spielberg made the effort to diversify the species of dinosaurs), the screenplay is always few inspired. It appears frankly poor in the way it plays the role of fill-in. Must you add that it contains dialogs that sound hollow and labored? And of, course, unlikelinesses are always on meeting. Nevertheless, one positive side: children nearly never appear during the movie.Steven Spielberg chose Jeff Goldblum in the main role (perhaps, he wanted to grant him more liberty and calibre than in the first movie) but he could have chosen as well Sam Neil.On another hand, when the tyrannosaurus invades San Diego (it gives a little ounce of surrealism to the movie), the movie falls into the ridicule. Instead of feeling anxiety or fear, you laugh a lot when you watch the disasters that the tyrannosaurus causes.At last, the end probably ranks among the worst ends of movie ever made. Indeed, it's too easy and conventional to say that we must let dinosaurs live on their island and it gives birth to a childish moral. Besides, the movie globally gives off a feeling of great childishness due to the characters' every moves and thoughts. Especially the clan of wicked people who mean to capture dinosaurs in order to create another ""Jurassic park"" in San Diego.A flat and poor sequel.

"Dull and boring, quite possibly Spielberg's worst movie","The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a painfully dull and boring movie, which is surprising since it is directed by Steven Spielberg, who consistently continues to make great films. But this is not one of them. The story is very stupid and you can easily tell this film was a cash grab and a sad excuse for a sequel. After the enormous success of Jurassic Park, both the book and movie, Michael Crichton was asked to write a sequel novel to Jurassic Park. He agreed to do so and had to write the sequel based around who they could get back for the second movie. They were able to get Jeff Goldblum back, so Ian Malcolm was made the main character. His character died in the first book so he had to make up a reason for him to be back for the second one. In the movie, like I said Jeff Goldblum (Ian Malcolm) is the main character, which would be a cool thing to see if he gave the same type of performance like he gave in Jurassic Park. But in this he phones it in, which sucks because when Jeff Goldblum is good in a movie, it adds a kind of vibrancy to the film, ex. Jurassic Park, The Grand Budapest Hotel. Even although he doesn't really try in this movie, he is still there nonetheless. Of all the performances in the movie I think Vince Vaughn was the best, who seemed excited to be in a big blockbuster after only doing smaller films before like Swingers. The CGI in this looks very good if not better than the first Jurassic Park, and the dinosaurs look very convincing. The film is well made on a technical level but a lot of the shots are bland and nothing extraordinary like in a regular Spielberg movie. His direction is flat and it kinda feels like one of his movies but at the same time it doesn't. I was very bored during this movie, it was nowhere near as fun as Jurassic Park. The theme in this movie is used rarely and they use it just to remind you that you're watching the sequel to Jurassic Park. An example of this was when Ian Malcolm is leaving Hammond's house they use the main theme while Dr. Hammond is walking back to his bed. I was expecting it to cut to some dinosaurs but nope, it's just him walking. So majestic. I'm just getting goosebumps thinking about it, screw that shot in the first one with the stegosaurus eating the tree. This blows that shot out of the park. Overall I would not recommend this movie, as it is very forgettable and not fun.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The hate for this movie is unwarranted and undeserving.,"Despite a few obvious plot holes and forced dramatic shots, ""The Lost World"" comes rather close to the intensity and fear that the first movie generates.The acting is almost as good as the first movie, the actors do a great job showing the appropriate emotion in every scene (something that hasn't been appropriately done since in the series as of 2023).I might be a little biased, because this movie hits me on a personal level. It was the first time I ever watched a PG-13 movie in theaters (I was 13 years old when it was out), so it was quite an exciting event for me. It blew my little mind. And it still does, to be honest. After so many years, this film holds up.Like the previous film, there is an adequate amount of well-timed humor to provide a comedic break during some of the most heightened scenes. Ian Malcom is such a fantastic character and Jeff Goldblum was the perfect choice.So many great scenes, and it's such a thrill. I feel sorry for those who hated it, because they obviously missed out on everything: the entertainment elements, the continuation of Michael Crichton's vision, and the outright brilliance of it all. It's the last of the best of a series that was beaten to death by marketing and the garbage companies based on numbers and modern trends which is known as modern Disney and Hollywood.If you were a fan of the first movie (which should apply to EVERYONE), you should be a fan of this glorious sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dismal sequel,"This film has a cast of established actors, a renowned director at the helm and a continuance of the very believable CGI that was on display in the first film. Why then does it largely fail, and why is it so inferior to its predecessor? The answer lies in the script and its structure. After twenty minutes of set-up, most of the film involves various characters running around an island pursued by dinosaurs. We've seen this already in the first film, and the rehash here is done without spirit or wit, rendering it dull and mundane. What the paying public ought to have been clamoring for, and been shown much more of, is the paltry twenty minutes at the end featuring a T-Rex running amok in San Diego. It is extremely baffling why a movie that talks so much about the perils of man interacting with dinosaurs shows so little of that interaction in the urban setting of a big city, and even then with only one of the dinosaurs. In fact, for a blockbuster action movie  and a second go-round at that  it is bordering on criminal that they waste the viewers' time with so many ho-hum by-the-numbers sequences on the island.A key failure in this long middle passage of the film is that, besides the always-dependable Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, the principals are playing a number of underdeveloped characters that are hard to work up any real sympathy for. Julianne Moore turns in a poor, unbelievable performance as Malcolm's roving-scientist love interest. Vince Vaughn is miscast as a hired-hand photographer, but does not have much to work with. Postlethwaite stays the right side of over-the-top as a hired hunter, but for the most part the film shows that names and money alone do not make for a successful film.If the feeble script deserves any kind of credit, it would be for giving us a sense of empathy with the creatures, but to be truly invested in a movie, we also need to empathize with the characters, and have genuinely interesting things happen to them. For a blockbuster, it also helps to have a whiz-bang ending. This film has a hugely anti-climatic one, but the biggest transgression of all is its failure to entertain.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Forgettable and mediocre, with some forgiving moments","It has its entertaining moments and it's certainly not a bad film, however when comparing it to the miraculous work that was the first Jurassic Park this film is as forgettable as they come. The film is very predictable for the most part, and its formulaic tendencies definitely get in the way of bringing its larger than life story to a proper execution. All the antagonists seem far too stupid to be realisitic and far too generic. Jeff Goldblum Ian Malcolm is a fun return but he hardly captures the charisma he held on screen in the last one, despite trying his best to be the action star this time around. Also starring is Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn who I feel don't often get talked about enough when it comes to this film- in fact the film itself seems to forget Vaughn's character by the end- which is a shame cause he is honestly more fun to watch than most of the other characters involved. The special effects start out a bit iffy at times but soon regain the visionary wonderment of the original in a very different setting. The film has some entertaining moments throughout, but I did enjoy the first half of the film a bit more than the second half. Although it could be a bit of a slow burn more often than not, the first half seemed a whole lot smarter and more thorough than the second half- which seemed to race to connect a bunch of plot points to wrap this film up. In the end, The Lost World wasn't a total miss, but it certainly was a mediocre rendition of what we have already come to see from this franchise and certainly isn't worth more than a one time watch.My Rating: 4.8/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Worse still, it feels devoid of the magic and joy expected in a blockbuster Spielberg film. The dinosaurs, particularly the raptors, are totally wasted and non sensical in this to the point of feeling like parodies of their predecessors.All the hallmarks are there for a big franchise sequel to make big money but there's none of the polish. One clunky set piece follows another with no tension or pace guiding proceedings.It just feels like a film that Spielberg didn't really show up for. It's on the record that he was burned out after doing the first film and Schindler's List in the same year and may well not have felt like making another dinosaur film, but this begs the question of why he didn't get another director for this sequel as he did for the third.

The scene where the two rexs attack the trailer (with the demise of the hapless driver particularly harrowing), the raptors stalking the men through the long grass, the rex chase at the waterfall etc. All adrenaline pumping set pieces. The overrall theme seems a bit darker then the first film.Thats not to say the Lost World is perfect. Far from it. Malcolms daughter dazzling a raptor with her parallel bars routine before kicking it through a window nearly ruins the entire ending as it is. I thought the T Rex in San Diego didn't fit at all and it certainly wasn't in the book. In fact they left out one of the coolest parts of the book. None of the dinosaurs would venture near a certain part of the island as it was inhabited by a pair of dinosaurs that could become semi invisible like chameleons : the Carnotaurus.

A classy and entertaining sequel worthy to follow the first,"As is always the case, the fear of making a sequel to a very successful and well made movie would be that the sequel might turn out to be a pile of metaphorical... well let us say dinosaur feces, kill the franchise and ruin everyone's perception of the first film. Thankfully enough, when a director as high caliber as Steven Spielberg, who directed the first Jurassic Park film to colossal effect returns for the sequel, this is seldom the outcome. Such is the case here, as ""The Lost World"" turns out to be a wonderfully made sequel, almost as entertaining a suspense ride as the first was, four years prior.In fact, in terms of quality of work, storyline and such, The Lost World is easily on par with the original Jurassic Park (if admittably somewhat of a structural re-hash of the first). The most noticeable complaint is that the novelty of such excellent special effects and the like has worn off somewhat, since after the original Jurassic Park, audiences had grown accustomed to having their minds blown due to technological feats and creature effects. But that's not to in any way downplay the quality of the special effects on display here, which still easily equals any modern technological achievements, and in fact is even more enjoyable than most of today's dime-a-dozen CGI bloated Blockbusters. The robotic and animatronic dinosaurs actually interact with actors like real dinosaurs would, and there is never that sense of the effects looking almost real, but never QUITE real that most modern computer effects seem to provide.It's great to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Ian Malcolm, the harried mathematician, and once again he manages to seem incredibly believable as the absent minded theorist trying awkwardly to interact with his daughter (newcomer Vanessa Lee Chester, who gives a terrific and very endearing performance, much better than the average child star) while remaining a strong lead all the while. Spielberg also managed to snap up a number of emerging stars in supporting performances, including Julianne Moore (spectacular and very lovable yet classy as always as Malcolm's field researcher girlfriend Sarah Harding), an early impressive performance from Vince Vaughn as wildlife photographer Nick Van Owen, character actors like the always enjoyable Pete Postlethwaite as hard edged safari hunter Roland Tembo, Peter Stormare as a sadistic enforcer who meets a righteous dirty end, and Arliss Howard as the snobby and greedy capitalist who also learns that messing with nature seldom turns out as well as predicted. Of course, it's wonderful to see Sir Richard Attenbourough also make an appearance once again as founder of the park, John Hammond, who manages to show how classy a performance one can make in only two scenes.All in all, The Lost World is quite the solid sequel, and definitely worth watching, especially for those who enjoyed the first film. From the beginning with a young British girl making acquaintance with a few unexpected prehistoric visitors on a beach to the obvious King Kong reference finish in San Francisco, Spielberg once again manages to draw us into the story, and find ourselves caring about the characters and being enthralled by the wonderful special effects and tense, exciting storyline once again. This Lost World definitely deserves to be found by those who have yet to do so.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than I remembered,"After rewatching this movie because of Jurassic Park's 25th anniversary and I have fallen in love with this movie.

Another flaw being how dumb this movie can be, for example imagine karate chopping a velociraptor in the film and surviving, while that doesn't happen something along the line of that happens.

Hammond wants to preserve this island, this 'LOST WORLD' and keep it away from public gaze (""wow, you've turned from Capitalist to Naturalist in just 4 years, thats something"" -- Ian Malcolm to John Hammond) To do this, he must send in a group of specialists to photograph the animals alive and flourishing in their natural habitat. Shortly after that said team arrives on Isla Sorna (site B) a group of Ingen mercenaries arrive, and with a much different agenda!It was inevitable that the hype surrounding the sequel to one of the biggest grossing films of all time was massive, and as i have said, it can often lead to disappointment.There are 3 major elements to this film which prevent it from reaching the success of the original. Firstly, it has a rather weak story. A good premise i must admit but Malcolms heroics to save his girlfriend seem a rather lukewarm way of making him return to a Dinosaur filled island. The Michael Crichton novel is far better than this adaptation but unfortunately apart from a few scenes, the film fails to grasp the ideas of the book. Many feel that it would have been a wise choice to follow the book more accurately! Secondly, Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm takes a complete 180 degree reversal. He turns, from an eccentric, cocksure mathematician brainiac to a clichéd American anti hero with no substance, and it really does show. Love him or hate him, Malcolms character was very distinctive in JP, but in TLW, it becomes rather obscure. Thirdly and finally is the Ending! I wont spoil it for those few who have yet to see it but the San Diego attack at the end is the killer for me. In our own little sad way, us movie lovers could imagine that in our own little world, this Dinosaur cloning could be happening, but once a 20ft t'rex has a race with a local bus down a busy San Diego street, the illusion is somewhat spoiled! I can understand that they had to do something 'Big' in this sequel to surpass the original, but sometimes surpassing isn't easy, or indeed necessary. Sure it looked great on the teaser trailer when Rexy roared at the night time San Diego skyline, but in the final product, you feel somewhat cold to the whole scene. For me, the Dinosaurs in the JP films look better in their once natural habitat of the jungle. This is where they lived, and this is where they seem most ferocious, intriguing and above all, realistic.Now, on positive notes, the film has that typical Spielberg atmosphere. An atmosphere carried through from the original. There are a few excellent action sequences (most noticeably the Trailer sequence)that are up there with the best JP moments and the attention to detail, CG, and animatronics are simply astounding and really do their part to immerse you in the film. One feels that if this was the first film in the JP franchise, it would have received as many accolades as the original did!!?But, at the end of the day, it isn't the first, its a sequel. And like a hell of a lot of sequels it cant quite match the original. I personally feel that its severely underrated as most of the gripes are to do within the franchise itself and the adaptation from Novel to Screenplay rather than filming issues. Its still highly enjoyable, highly stylish and a bucket load of fun. Popcorn movies at its best!!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Even as another Jurassic - professionalism should be present - it really isn't,"It's part of the Jurassic franchise... so it's not going to be that wonderful. The best you can hope for is that the Directing is sharp, the pace holds up and the Actors do a good job of keeping the cartoon going. Strangely, the Directing is not great here (or maybe it's the Editing - but that's a Director's job too...) which is not normal for Speilberg. But, maybe he's forgiven, because this is a complete mutt of a script and the key performers (Mr Ham) Goldblum and (Mrs Ham) Julianne Moore are utterly apalling - if you add in Vince Vaughn ( God Help Us) the chances of tuly bad are going to be high. I expect poor performace from Goldblum as he is a rubbish actor, period. Moore should have dragged in some basic skills, even if she's just doing it for the paycheck - but, oh no. They both put the kiss of death onto a badly scripted and badly paced film. Jurassic was over by the time this second rate meal came out but somebody should have shown some pride in their work. The audience were treated with contempt and therefore the film should be equally treated the same way. Do Not Bother.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This time It's not just a walk in the park!- the best JP movie.,"A great movie, obviously far better that the original(a crap). This film I first saw on Star Movies when I was 12 & till date I simply love it.It's action packed, dramatic, exciting, adventurous. A dinosaur loving kid should certainly like the movie. Till now I have seen this film about countless times & every time I saw I it I felt equally excited as the first time.Steven Spielberg must be credited after making up for his weak, boring JURASSIC PARK.I wished I could watch the movie in a theater- that would be far more exciting than watching on TV, certainly.Jeff Goldblum(Ian Malcom)& Juliann Moore where quite a good couple. Especially Goldblum really made up for his weak performance in JURASSIC PARK.This movie is the best in the JP trilogyAlthough some things were similar to GODZILLA 1998, I didn't mind that-I enjoyed the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,Ignoring the very obvious set-up for a sequel in the original film and choosing a new set-up that's forced/uninspired makes this an overall disappointment.,4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good sequel. But falls short of the original.,"Still directed by Spielberg. Still an excellent cast. And still the same witty dialogue. Everything is also upgraded from the first film. Many more dinosaurs, and bigger more exciting scenes.However the film somehow falls short of the first one due to a couple bad design choices. First, the last act of the film is a little lacklustre (like the first one). And also Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm doesn't carry the film like Sam Neill's character did in the first film. The character of Ian Malcolm's daughter is also a very weird and jarring design choice, bordering on the ridiculous in a specific scene.This is a great film, just like the first one. However I feel that it's a missed opportunity to make a better one, mainly due to choice of scenario. Then again, Spielberg does not seem to be making these films for the scenario but to make a kind of moral point.If you are into videogames, I recommend you check out Dino Crisis 1 and 2. These types of scenarios, based much more on a survival horror interpretation of Dinosaurs, is better IMO.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lost,"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is easily one of the worst Steven Spielberg movies of all time while also being one of the worst sequels of all time, I had high hopes for this movie after the banger original, but it failed to deliver on almost every level.This movie takes everything about the original and puts it to shame, I struggle to find a single likeable character in this movie besides Ian, Jeff Goldblum heavily carried this film, it's a terribly unfunny, awfully written, and extremely messy and slow film that had me begging for the credits to role, it has one of the slowest first acts I've seen in a long time and also one of the messiest third acts I've seen in a long time, I now have low expectations for Jurassic Park III after this colossal failure.D+",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as Amazing as The First Film, But Nowhere Near as Bad as People Make it Out to Be","Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My Review,"I did not enjoy this movie. The only likeable people are Eddie and Sarah, so of course they have Nick and Sarah kill off Eddie immediately as the first death. (After a bizarre rope sequence that went on for a ridiculous length of time.) The slate of characters is one of the weakest parts of the movie like in the first. They were good at writing unlikeable villains, but they got so good at it that they wrote almost more unlikeable ""heroes"".In addition to only having basically one good guy and then for like 20 minutes, everyone else is an idiot except for Roland who is there for the explicit purpose of killing a dinosaur while literally only bringing two bullets. Most people knowingly stand still and get eaten by the obviously approaching dinosaur/crushed by the known full-speed boat. Unlike the protagonist, at least the other team is a little prepared. If the protagonist simply stood by and did nothing, everything would have played out fine and no one would have died. However, Nick explicitly sabotages everything and directly causes dozens and dozens of deaths. Besides destroying all useful equipment, none of the protagonists do anything productive besides heading for the old station like everyone else. Unlike the other team, the main characters have zero weapons and zero tactics. They just survive the movie through dumb luck and plot armor. Twenty armed men walk across a field and get slaughtered to a man by six velociraptors. Three main characters get jumped by three velociraptors and they're totally uninjured though. A raptor jumps directly on Sarah but only is interested in her backpack actually for no reason. Ian avoids a raptor by playing peekaboo with a window sill. His apparently adopted daughter gets the only dinosaur kill in the entire movie by doing an elaborate, impromptu gymnastics routine. It's like a child's story. There's no cause and effect.Then the last bit is especially bizarre. A T-Rex somehow broke through metal bars, killed everyone, and then got stuck in the hold? A T-Rex walks through San Diego only eating a dog, a traffic light, and one random bystander?Overall, not a good movie. Just a slideshow of barely offscreen deaths which are all entirely the protagonists' fault. The fact that he's useless doesn't stop Ian from acting like the most perfect person to ever walk the earth though. (Although at least that is at least a little toned down in this movie.)",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Honestly...,"A 5.6 out of 10? This is probably one of the most underrated movies on IMDb, and that's saying quite a lot. This great sequel deserves at least a 7.0. Is it the worst of the trilogy? In my opinion, TLW and JPIII see-saw as to which is my 2nd favorite of the trilogy, although neither match the original. But when it comes to thrills and action, this movie gets a 9.0. Jeff Goldblum is just as good a leading man as Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are greater in variety. The bad: the raptors have a much smaller role in this one, and some things are downright laughable. For example, Kelly using gymnastics to get rid of the raptor. While it doesn't deserve as much flack as it gets, it was somewhat lame.8/10. Heinously underrated.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sloppy Sequel,"This sequel pretty much was a flop in my opinion for various reasons, including casting, writing, character development and editing. The writing and plot was atrocious. Most obvious was that the writers apparently couldn't figure out what the plot was. This movie presents 4 plots - study dinos, rescue mission, big game hunt and dino in city. So what's it going to be? Any one of these plots would have worked but to include more than one made the movie confusing. Specifically:1. The study the dinos plot was already done in the original but could have worked well in sequel introducing us to more dino types .A lone or amateur hunter could have been worked into the plot.2. The rescue mission plot could have also worked well but would have required that a team had been sent months before and not heard back from. Rescue team, land on island, search, obstacles, lost, trails, pirate treasure, find way off island etc.3. The big game hunt plot is a separate disaster movie delusion theme that is a different movie. Much of the movie present scenes consistent with this plot.4. Dino in city - That is a different movie along the lines of a King Kong. Dino capture, transport, escape in city, city theme park. In this movie, it got confused with the big game hunt issues such as dino capture and escape.Other problems with the movie -1. The opening scene with the yacht and people drinking champagne on the beach of the other island was uninteresting. It looked like 1980s cheese wealth display. Should have shown Nedry miraculously surviving attack of spitting dino and making way to other island on raft. This would explain how dinos got to other island a lot better. Subway scene at beginning not serious. Poor opening for movie and irrelevant to plot.2. Inadequate character and plot setup at beginning of move. Should have introduced Malcom, Dr. Sarah and child so relationship clear. Also gymnastics angle which became very important to plot later in movie. Should have picked her up at practice or something and explained olympics training or whatever.3. The chairman of Ingen, Ajay was too weak of a character and not interesting compared to Hammond in original movie. Poor casting and character development.4. The game hunting team just suddenly appears on the ground as if their landing scene had been edited out of the movie. As a result the viewer didn't get enough introduction to them.5. A lot of time wasted on capturing boring dino.6. Too many night shots took away from seeing what was going on and where they were on island. Not enough aerial shots of island.Whatever. You get the idea. That said, you pretty much have to see this movie to watch the sequels in sequence.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's not as good as the first, but it doesn't deserve the hate","After the first one being a huge success, a sequel was made and everyone hates it. Does it deserve the hate? No. Here is why: the story is about Ian Malcolm one of the survivors of the first one goes out to find his girlfriend Sarah Harding on a different island that is filled with none other than dinosaurs. However, more expeditions come in as they are about to take dinosaurs off this island for another theme park attractions. Malcolm and the others need to stop them and each group of their own gets stuck on an island as they try to work together on how to get home. The main reason why no one likes this movie is because of two things: First, it doesn't have the same charm as the first which is true, and second they really hated on what the characters are doing like opening cages as dinosaurs destroy their camp or bringing in a baby T-Rex into an RV. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think everyone is misjudging it. I know its not as good as the first one, but I really enjoyed how it stands out on its own where it doesn't need to be like the first one. The characters to me are just like any other movie you see as once they are into risky situations, they just argue things over and are just having a hard time trusting each other and working together. I can defend their actions if I have to write this as a long review, but don't want to go too far on that. I thought Jeff Goldblum, in my opinion, plays a very good lead as in the first one he was once a funny side character, now he is more mature and he has once had his experience on Isla Nublar as he had to risks his life again on Isla Sorna to go out and find Sarah, and then come home. The other cast all did fine. Even though, there is not much to their character, but I would love if the movie has some more characterization. The story I thought was told fine as once again not being like the first one again. The special effects, well, at times there are parts that are slightly dated, but for the most part they looked really good. John Williams' music is just as good as he did with the music in the first one. I do love the final scene, where the T- Rex attacks San Diego which I thought was a well done action scene. Like the first one, the movie doesn't bored me as it still keeps my interest. ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" may not be a perfect movie, but I don't think its really Steven Spielberg's fault, I thought he did well enough on what he can bring to this movie that does give enough much excitements, and plenty of good dinosaur action. To me, I say give this movie another chance. If not, then no worries because everyone has an opinion and we respect it to each of our own. Again, it's not as good as the first, but it doesn't deserve the hate. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Once again, Spielberg's dinos do not disappoint","Steven Spielberg's THE LOST WORLD, while not a masterpiece, is still an exciting adventure filled with action, powerful music, and credible performances.An entertaining and exquisite storyteller, Spielberg takes us now to Isla Sorna, aka Site B, where dinosaurs were bred before traveling to Isla Nublar. Two teams with different plans unexpectedly meet on the island, and only their goals will determine if the dinosaurs will live or die.Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, the late Pete Postlethwaite, and Vince Vaughn, among others, are featured in this movie. Once again, Spielberg's dinos do not disappoint; the movie is brutal, complete with two Tyrannosaurs and their baby, sneaky raptors, and pesky little Compsognathus (not featured in the original JURASSIC PARK) that can bite you to death like a pack of wolves. I think the tall Goldblum and the stunning Moore (love her hair) make a good on screen couple, and Postlethwaite gives a determined performance as a Tyrannosaur hunter. While more situated for comedies, Vaughn blends in well with the drama.All in all, after a four-year absence from the director's chair ('93 to '97), Spielberg comes back with a bang with THE LOST WORLD. Although it's far from his greatest triumphs (JAWS, RAIDERS, E.T., SCHINDLER, PRIVATE RYAN), his JURASSIC PARK sequel is an entertaining two hours of dinosaur action and drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This movie features legitimately talented actors: Julianne Moore, Jeff Goldblum, and Pete Postlethwaite stand out in the credits, but their abilities are sorely wasted on one clichéd action sequence after another.
