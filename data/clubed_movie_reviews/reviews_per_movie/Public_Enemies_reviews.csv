Decent film with room for improvement,"Public Enemies is a crime drama based on the true story of the infamous bank robber of the 1930's, John Dillinger. Johnny Depp does an outstanding job playing the main character, but I don't feel that this is his best performance. Perhaps it is a lacking script that causes the unimpressive characterization. Christian Bale plays the FBI agent chasing Dillinger with fervor. His betrayal seems a bit dry and lackluster. The story is interesting and well paced, but there is slightly too much time put into the setup and not enough in the execution of the plot. The action sequences are quick and the machine gun shoot-outs are mind blowing. Overall, I left the theater feeling that this was a decent film with room for improvement. It is worth a watch, especially if you like the period portrayed. I give this movie 7 stars for a just-above mediocre production. I hope this review was helpful. -MovieJuice",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Fun but flawed,"I liked PUBLIC ENEMIES but I didn't love it. It comes close to feeling like an epic at times, detailing the cat-and-mouse games between infamous bank robber John Dillinger and the G-man on his tail. Unfortunately the screenplay feels a little bloated at times and the truth is that while Michael Mann is a consummate professional as director, his films always possess a certain coldness that makes it hard to get close to the characters.And that's the case here. Superficially, the movie looks good and the characters go through the motions with aplomb, but you never really care about what happens to them. Bale's protagonist is totally unmemorable, leaving Depp to hold the fort as the anti-hero of the piece, but whenever the film moves away from a complex action set-piece it falters. Depp's romance with Marion Cotillard is particularly gruelling and heel-dragging.Nevertheless, the drama and excitement when it comes is very well handled, with the shoot-out in the woods particularly fine and the bank robberies all staged very well. As ever, Mann has a steely eye for the action so the film zips along when concentrating on them; it's everything else that's a bit lacklustre. In addition, the cast is so big that the supporting players, like Stephen Dorff, James Russo, Billy Crudup, David Wenham and Stephen Lang get lost in the mass, each lacking truly memorable scenes. The ending, when it comes, seems almost arbitrary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Overview of a criminal mastermind,"Public Enemies is an alright docu-crime-thriller that, thought well-made, ends up coming out dry. Many of the scenes are well paced, but in its running time the film feels like a very rushed overview of the final years of John Dillinger. What I mean to say is that this is a good movie, but you probably won't leave the theater feeling like you've learned anything about John Dillinger, other than trivial facts. The movie never really gives Johnny Depp a chance to shape the character into a believable icon because as I previously stated this film feels more like a dramatized overview of Dillinger's career instead of focusing on the man himself.Now, Johnny Depp is a fine actor, and he reminds us in this movie that he isn't only a go-to man for quirky, weird, whimsical, and bizarre characters. In Public Enemies Depp reminds us that he is talented as a traditional actor and that he is still one of the best in Hollywood today. The problem is the script he is given for Public Enemies never lets him expand on anything regarding John Dellinger as a person. In Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' Denzel Washington was given a chance to really emphasize the qualities he felt reflected his view of Frank Lucas. Public enemies, Johnny Depp never truly gets to define what he feels are the most important aspects of his portrayal of Dellinger because often the film gets too caught up in the action and events instead of its characters.Christian Bale bounces back after a sub-par performance in 'Terminator: Salvation' and it's good to see him working his voice manipulation ability again, because I for one was beginning to think he'd gotten stuck on his Batman-style growl. Playing the FBI agent pursuing Dillinger he is an interesting character due to his dedication and could have been a really interesting character, but like Depp, Bale never really gets a chance to try and expand on his character.The music isn't anything you haven't heard before in previous crime films of this sort, but for the most part it works. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack to this film, but it certainly didn't take away from the experience. Also, songs from the 30s are played throughout, and most of the time they manage to fit into the story's many montage scenes very well.Director Michael Mann seems a tad bit off when compared to some of his previous films. He often goes for a look that makes the audience feel that they're in the middle of everything, and that's good in small stretches, but I felt he used this technique too often and I found myself growing a tad bit dizzy at times, and had a desire to see what was going on in the shootouts. I found it strange, that with his recent films such as 'Collateral', where the characters had been the center-focus of the entire film, he could then make a movie about one of the most infamous criminal minds and have it be more about the history than the characters who lived it.The thing that is most fascinating about this film is the costumes and sets. The men and women behind these really outdid themselves and created a very authentic view of 1930s Chicago. This aspect of the film alone makes it worth seeing! Every costume and set seems to have been made with the utmost attention to detail, and the final result is very pleasing to the eye.The final product in an okay docu-drama on the life of one of America's most infamous criminals, but in the end you really don't discover anything about John Dillinger that you couldn't have found out by looking him up on Wikipedia. So this is a pretty film to look at, and with Depp and Bale it's a good way to introduce those unfamiliar with Dillinger to the criminal, but if you were looking for a character study on the bank robber you may find yourself a tad-bit disappointed.I wouldn't come close to calling Public Enemies one of the best movies of the summer, or of the year, but when compared to several other films that are currently being screened I would still highly recommend it. With movies like 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' out there your money is best spent on Michael Mann's Public Enemies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good, but not without flaws","Public Enemies, this film has been built up for quite a while, why not? It stars Johnny Depp as one of history's most famous bank robbers. Also the city of Chicago has been excited to see this, in some strange way we considered Dillinger to be a Robin Hood as he never took money from the common man, just from the banks. He also was clever enough to escape jail by making a fake gun out of a soap bar, I lived in Indiana for a year and people are incredibly proud that Crown Point was where Dillinger had fooled everyone, lol. So naturally I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, especially with Johnny Depp as John Dillinger, it's a can't miss. Unfortunately for me, the film fell short of our expectations as the way it was made and how there is lack of material for Depp and Bale to work with to give these characters any depth. Mann makes a film that is using a digital camera for a film set in the 1930's and doesn't really bring his A game to the film as it's more like ""Here's Dillinger's story enjoy"".Set in 1933 John Dillinger is brought to a penitentiary, but is there to break out the rest of his gang. After loosing a few of his friends, he's headed to Chicago to make his mark on the banks. Melvin Purvis is upgraded by J. Edgar Hoover, who is protecting the FBI from scrutiny by politicians, to lead the hunt for John. John later meets Billie Frechette, whom he takes to dinner. He states plainly what he will do for her and how he will treat her if they are to have a relationship. After a shoot out gone horribly wrong and making the police look more incompetent, Purvis demands that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive. Though Hoover had hoped for more pristine agents, he agrees. While John and Billie are enjoying the luxuries across the States, the police finally find Dillinger and arrest him and his gang in Miami. However, Dillinger and a few inmates escape from prison using a fake gun. He is goaded into a bank robbery job by an acquaintance, Dillinger agrees. The robbery goes fine until Nelson impulsively kills a nearby police officer, alerting more of the robbery, making Dillinger Public Enemy Number 1.Now Public Enemies is by no means a bad film, some of the actors were terrific and the sets were perfect as well as the whole feel of the film. But it just won't stop with the ""Run! Chase! Run! Chase! Shoot! Shoot!"" scenes that seem to dull down after a while. The love story between Dillinger and his gal, Billie didn't seem too necessary, it added to the story but for me felt a little out of place at times. I have to tell you that I'm feeling so incredibly bad for Christian Bale this year as it seems like he's been given characters who are not well written, but I'm starting to wonder if the Batman voice is his new trademark because he was starting to use that voice again in a few sentences. Depp does the best he can, but once again with the lack of material; he's made out completely as the hero of the film, instead of maybe having more of a documentary feel to it and being biased on how cool Dillinger was. Maybe he's Mann's personal hero, who knows. But over all the film is decent enough for the watch, I'd just say if you want to see it, go for a matinée or a rental, it wasn't worth the full price.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The devil is in the details,"It's as hard to get a grip on Mann's impressive but vaguely off-putting new movie about John Dillinger's last thirteen months as it is to project yourself into the coldly beautiful digital images. The title itself provides a clue to the problem: it doesn't focus on the star criminal embodied by the charismatic and -- here -- coolly dashing Johnny Depp, whose quips and provocations in the trailer draw us into the theater to see him, only him, and his bold exploits. It points instead to the wider focus of Mann's book source -- 'Vanity Fair' writer Bryan Burroughs' 600 pages of meticulous research, 'Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34.' Relentless G-man Purvis (a convincing but bloodless Christian Bale) and his rising boss FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup, both droll and period) are part of another story as important as the bank robber's final wide ride, the story of the growing cruelty and relentlessness of the forces of American law.Look at another title of a movie about a doomed but spectacular crime spree: Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde.' That 1967 classic works so well because it's character-driven. Even in the sketchy but powerful scenes that outline John Dillinger's romance with French-Native American hatcheck girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cottillard, working wonders with limited material), character is subsidiary to function: ""I rob banks,"" Johnny says. And then: ""What else you need to know?"" Well, quite a lot, actually, for a rounded character to emerge. Mann's movie is meticulous as to period look, to facade, but not to essence. Its street scenes are full of detail, its clothes immaculate and accurate. Taking place in 1933-34, however, it provides too few overt signs of the Great Depression. The film is also misleading in showing the Dillinger gang only robbing grand, marble-hall-and-column banks, when in fact they mostly robbed small and middling sized ones.The overall result is a collection of contradictions. There is romance, but the effect isn't romantic. There's precise realism, but the overall effect isn't realistic. Perhaps the only unmitigated pleasure that remains is the images, the digital with its cold precision, its crisp edges even when many of the cameras are jiggly and hand-held, the depth of detail in darkness, the color that is neither bright nor faded, the sheer satisfying crispness of everything and everybody. And in this one aspect, a sublimely heightened vérité whose look is something quite new, 'Public Enemies' matches 'Bonnie and Clyde:' it makes us feel we're seeing period scenes with contemporary eyes. The best and most memorable images are the complex ones you won't see in stills where many actors are running back and forth in front of the camera, the gunshots are popping realistically in every direction, and there is no hint of the usual film chiaroscuro or highlighting, but the light is somehow beautiful. The cameras move too much, but they do rub your face in the action. What's gong on you may figure out later.Maybe you can't avoid mythologizing when you shoot a movie about a famous Thirties bank robber and shouldn't try to, but Mann does. He's working, with great accomplishment, from that meticulous historical account, involving dozens of players on both the cop and the crook sides. Dillinger (and alternatively the totally unappealing Purvis) stay in the foreground. But there too is a contradiction, because the way Depp plays his part, witty, cold, and focused rather than warm and down-to-earth, his character ends up being impressive, but ultimately absent. (Contrast Warren Beatty's impotence and blinking charm as Clyde Barrow, an absence you yet want to cuddle.) Even when the characters are strong in Public Enemies, they don't get enough chance to interact. Dillinger is rarely with Frechette. His chance to confront Purivs is too brief, the moment when Purvis tells him he's to be extradited to Indiana and he quips, ""There's absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana."" He's not facing off Purvis; he's playing to the audience.This should have been one of the showpieces of the season, and it is indeed a blockbuster with class in a world of junk. Its virtuoso look and complexly orchestrated scenes will hold up with time, but despite a freshness in approaching familiar genre material, it's missing that certain 'je ne sais quoi.' Even though it's different, it lacks style, movie-making panache, playfulness, suspense, the ability to push a climax, the capacity to take a breather so the momentum builds up again. There's an impressive twittering machine functioning here on all its Ford V8 cylinders. But the light touch is missing, the capacity to make you say ""Yeah!"", to simultaneously stand apart and admire while utterly caught up in it all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
John Dillinger- Public Enemy #1,"The year is 1933, it's the Great Depression. A time for the desperate to do the unthinkable. Crime was on the rise and people were suffering. For John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) it was a time of infinite possibilities and opportunities. To combat the sharp incline in rampant criminal activity, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) forms the FBI, led by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Together they target Dillinger as public enemy number one. Relying on new methods of intelligence gathering (such as tracking the purchase location of a coat or recording phone conversations), the firepower of trained gunmen, and his own relentless nature, Purvis gets closer and closer to Dillinger and company.""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you. What else do you need to know?"" - John Dillinger. Johnny Depp IS John Dillinger. He's perfect for the role. The cool, confident and almost cocky nature of the character is really portrayed on screen (such as bragging to reporters about his bank jobs and teasing Purvis and agents who are after him). It's a look of how a man lived and succeeded in a hard time. Dillinger was a man that lived in the moment as only a man in the depression could. From the worlds on John Dillinger, ""I'm to busy having fun today to even think about tomorrow."" Who knows what tomorrow might bring? Bale also succeeds in his role and is a solid counterpart against Depp. It works well having two top, well known actors opposing each other on screen.The film is directed by Michael Mann who brought us such films as Heat, The Insider, and Collateral and he adds another good film to his resume with this one. The action sequences, bank heists, and shootouts in this film are probably the biggest highlights. After all, this is from the same guy who gave us one of the most famous and arguably the best shootout of all time in Heat. The sequences are cool, slick, and gritty. Excellence at it's best. (I have to throw in a note of praise for the superb shootout at the Little Bohemia lodge, which was an extremely impressive scene)The cat and mouse aspect makes it intriguing, but I think more could have been added to it. It just feels as if something was missing. Much of the film focuses on the love story between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marion Cottillard) It's also interesting to see the other gangsters of this time and how they relate to Dillinger and the criminal world.Much has been made of Public Enemies being filmed on HD video, mostly complaints. I must say that at times, the picture looked amazing. The night sequences, especially looked beautifully slick and realistic. I loved the cinematography here. The cars, headlights, street lights, and everything looked fantastic. Other times, it doesn't look as good. It just felt as if something didn't look right. I'm not sure what to think about this.One problem I had with this film would have to be the lack of character depth in many of the characters. At times, it seems as if we are expected to know and understand the characters before going to see the film because it is a real life story. But as a film, it could have developed the characters more to help us (and those who know nothing about Dillinger, his life, or Purvis and the FBI) understand them better. Another problem was some of the historical inaccuracies. Many things portrayed in the film, do not happen as they did in real life. Many sequences are just out of order. I know the filmmakers had to know about this and just tried to work it in as best as they could. It's not a documentary, it's a movie.I really enjoyed Public Enemies. It's a solid crime drama and a good summer film. I understand expectations were through the roof, but that's a little hard to ask for. It's a really good film, but not quite a great one... The action is fun, the story is interesting. Maybe instead of being a very good film, it could have became a really great film if more was put into the characters? I'm not sure. It just felt as if something were missing. But who can knock a film for still being good?",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Johnny Dillinger and other characters,"Digital is the world of Michael Man with all its drawbacks. It works up to a point, if you don't mind being distracted by the make up on the actors faces, pimples and blemishes. The final adventures on John Dillinger's life look and feel like a work of fiction and I suspect that in ""Public Enemies"" they are, 50/50, fact and fiction. Johnny Depp is marvelous no matter what and his is a star performance. There is only a vague approach to a real characterization, but I didn't care because I go wherever Johnny Depp wants to take me. It was like that with Gary Cooper too, wasn't it? Part of the sneaky narrative is to have Dillinger the criminal played by the angelic Depp and Purvis the noble FBI guy played by Christian Bale that emanates evil without even trying. If you're interested in performances, like I am, Billy Crudup is the thing in a sensational turn as J Edgar Hoover in spite of the digital thing, that makes him look as if Hoover suffered from some rare skin condition, damn shame if you ask me. Marion Cottillard is absolutely lovely but we knew that already and the rest of the characters remain an enigma, they enter and leave the scene without us ever having a clue who they are. Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Dorff, Jason Clark, who were they and Lelee Sobieski? It was startling to see her appear on the third act. Who was she suppose to be? In any case, the film has a Michael Mann feel and it's technically great. The shootings are extraordinary and Johnny Depp totally beautiful. I suppose that should be enough to applaud and recommend ""Public Enemies"". I did and I will even if, I must confess, I expected more or maybe less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Back to the '30s with Mann,"My grandpa's first reaction when he heard this movie was being released was -why? Why yet another movie about Dillinger? What can it add? My grandpa's question triggered my thinking. Movies and Hollywood filmmakers don't seem to care anymore about adding something to history or the medium. They just seem to compulsively adapt other movies, toy lines or videogames into modern reworkings. It's a culture of thoughtless recycling. Fortunately, and although I haven't seen the '30s or '70s biopics, Michael Mann does have something to show.The first surprise is how the movie is shot. As one of the most vocal followers of digital video, Mann seems to exploit its handicaps instead of trying to convince us it can look as good as film. Throughout the movie we're treated to 3D video feel, artificial grain and close-ups which show up every pore on the actors skins. It's like someone sent a documentary crew back in time. However, this incongruous approach also made me experience the 1930s in a way I'd never done before, as a reality instead of a postcard. Almost all movie depictions of the ""public enemies"" era (even the gritty ones, like Bonnie and Clyde) are stylish and sophisticated. Instead, Mann's compulsive attention to prop and costume detail combined with the hand-held camera-work are immediately urging and attention-grabbing.Mann, as a filmmaker, always seemed to me more interested in technique than depth or story. This is arguably the same film he has made twice before (I'm talking about Thief and Heat), only this time history-based. As I read on about Dillinger and Melvin Purvis after watching the film, I realized the movie's script is very unusual in that it almost seems to strip the juicy bits out of the story. Where is the scene with the people soaking their handkerchiefs on Dillinger's blood, or the '30s era depression portrait? Like you guys were saying, Little Bohemia was in fact an embarrassment to the FBI in which civilians got shot and the criminal walked away unharmed. Except for a weird scene in which Dillinger walks into the Chicago police station and wanders around, there's a very down-to-earth approach to the character, taking away his more mythical elements and leaving us with a career robber who, like James Caan's character in Thief, seems to abstractly decide to fall in love to make up for lost time.The movie focuses obsessively on this relationship, instead of the more obvious paths it could have taken. Hoover's incompetence and his closet homosexuality are brief side notes. So is Melvin Purvis. The movie strips him of a personality, showing only the professional side of the policeman. This is so evident that when the title card near the end informs us that he later shot himself, I had to laugh it was so random. I seem to be speaking against all of this, but in fact what I'm doing is pointing out how unusual all of these directorial choices are. In fact, I celebrate them. Public Enemies is a movie that might seem frustrating to many, but to me, it was a refreshing, exciting journey into a world too often depicted and too easily neutralized. It's a great thing to see a copmen-and-robbers film without feeling like I've seen it all before. And make no mistake, the film's action scenes are intense.I'd like to finish by pointing out that the movie has a hell of a cast. Johnny Depp is a revelation in a time when it looked like his awesomeness was exhausting itself. Christian Bale is not given much to do as Purvis, but he's competent, mostly the Bale serious face we see too much of all the time. Billy Crudup's Hoover is great, he deserves his own flick. Marion Cotillard is a great foil to Depp. There are a lot of very famous faces on the film (in fact, maybe too many), and some of them are only in for very brief seconds - Lily Tomlin, Giovanni Ribisi and Leelee Sobieski enter and leave the screen and they're all very good, but none have any big scenes. This might be the artsiest blockbuster I've ever seen. Which, in my mind, is a compliment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Not one of Mann's best, but still...","Whenever a Michael Mann movie comes out, I am besieged by expectations. This is one director whose style I seem to consistently like. The Insider, Heat, Collateral, The Last of the Mohicans, and yes.. I LOVED Miami Vice the movie (despite the many negative reviews it seemed to have got). So, when Public Enemies came out, and seeing Mann team up with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, I knew I could not miss this. However, probably because of the high standards he has set for himself, I was a little disappointed with this.The story is about a gangster bank robber, John Dillinger(Johnny Depp), back in the '30's, who pulled off a couple of daring heists and prison breaks. He was generally considered a hero among the public, as this was during the years of the great depression and Dillinger was seen as someone who steals from the rich man. A fledging FBI, led by the peerless J. Edgar Hoover, decide to hunt him down so that they can grow the organization, and name him Public Enemy Number 1. Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale) is assigned the task of leading this group of agents.Johnny Depp is as usual great, but you get a feeling he would have been even better if the script had given enough scope to explore the character of Dillinger. The same goes with his love interest, played by Marillon Cotillard. Again, a wonderful actress, but at times the love story seemed forced into the story. Despite this, they have great chemistry.Which brings me to Christian Bale. This is an actor who has so much more to offer than the half baked roles he has been getting this year. You get a feeling this year that he is being offered big movies which don't give him a character he can bite his teeth into. First there was Terminator Salvation, and now this. In both, his character never really seemed into the movie as compared to the others. I'm waiting to see a movie again where he will assert himself.Despite the flaws, this is still a good movie from Mann. Just don't go in expecting it to out do his best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It is an entertaining backseat ride into the life of a country boy turned bank robber,"With Billie Holiday singing her heart out and the subtle details of cracked nail polish and $3 dresses, Public Enemies brings you into the era of the Great Depression without boring you with back stories and explanations.It is an honest bio-pic with little factual variations outside of John Dillinger's romantic ambitions. It is an entertaining backseat ride into the life of a country boy turned bank robber in a time where America hated money-makers and banks. A time when people were starving and in need of a gun-toting, charismatic mid-western boy to stir things up a bit, one bank robbery at a time.A Cast of Winning Players Director Michael Mann is known best for Heat, Collateral and Miami Vice. His attention to detail is known and it is said that he went above the call of duty in his research for this movie. Obviously he deemed it important to depict a true version of the Dillinger story with a bit of Hollywood sprinkled in to keep our attention. Johnny Depp is solid as the charismatic bank robber, adopting his mannerisms, speech and swagger and even the trademark smirk that is seen on all of Dillinger's photos. Christian Bale is perfect as Melvin Purvis, looking similar to the ""G man"" and confidently playing the role convincingly.Digital Camera and No true sense of good and Bad The camera threw me off a bit switching from an old sepia toned look to a digital one during fights. At times it made you feel as if you were an observant on the street while other times it felt just like a movie. I wasn't sure why this was but I concluded that Mann wanted us to be there with Dillinger most of the time and at other times we are to observe from a distance. There was no great love felt for any of the dark heroes, the charismatic Dillinger was likable but I never felt concern for his well-being. The FBI agent in Purvis (Christian Bale) was the typical white knight archetype and was given little personality outside of this so I felt nothing for him either. The romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) was interesting but felt clichéd (gangsters always have THAT chick in these movies) and just like real life that political blowhard J.Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) is the only real ""bad guy"" in the entire film.Final Thoughts It felt like a different time period and the choreography of the gunfights were done well enough to keep me interested. With as colorful a crew as the boys who ran with John Dillinger, it would have been hard to direct a movie like this while keeping everyone relative. Men like Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) are given screen time, as well as Capone's number one do-boy Frank Nitti (Bill Camp). Still there was so much shown that you tend to lose your familiarity with Dillinger's quest for whatever it is he wanted and the hopelessness of his situation settles in after awhile. It is a good movie with no real emotional weight, just a ""this is what happened"" gloss to the entire thing with a sprinkling of charisma to top it off. If anything, you will go researching Dillinger and gang after the movie has piqued your interest.www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Strangely uninvolving and forgettable,"""Public Enemies"" is like one of its anti-hero's robberies. It's dazzling, occasionally stylish, violent and straight to the point. The characters zip in and out leaving mayhem in their wake, and you can barely tell them apart. You don't get to know them, and you don't know if you should feel blessed for that, or not.The movie is star studded. Perhaps the two greatest chameleons currently in movies, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, both appear, on opposite sides of the law. There's also Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard, Giovanni Ribisi, and a brilliantly cast Stephen Graham... who is unfortunately underused.Quite a lot happens in the movie but you don't feel invested in it. I've seen it twice now, and not one sequence sticks in my mind. Michael Mann made the risky decision to go with the gritty, hand-held camera approach to the movie, which seems incongruous with the trappings of a historical movie. The steadicam thing makes you think what you're seeing is really happening. It can't do that when everyone is dressed like the 1930's, and driving vintage cars.This isn't the first time Mann has fallen on the sword of style: remember the weird, ponderous approach to ""Ali""? This isn't as much a failure as that; it's still fairly enjoyable. It's just forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Please please please film directors, don't follow Michael Mann in picking this type of film making. The picture is dark and looks like something my brother would do on his digital camera.

"Previewed last night in Westlake, CA","Johnny Depp was brilliant as Dillinger. You could really tell he loved his line of work, but also struggled with not completely becoming a thug. It was so nice to see him play such a different role for a change. It was real acting, not is normal eccentric character roles (don't get me wrong I love those as well) Christian Bale was also fantastic; you can see his conflict he was having with the job he was tasked to do vs. his own convictions.Marion Cotillard was stunning and Channing Tatum was such a psycho as Pretty Boy Floyd you hated him and loved him at the same time.One of the highlights for me was the music. The old nostalgic feeling and the narrator on the radio was one of my favorite bits that was used through out the film.Over all the movie was excellent, my only issue is with the title. I think simply calling it Dillinger or Bye, Bye Black bird would be better. I think the title really takes away from the feeling of the movie.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

What should have been thrilling is boring,Michael Mann has made some really great movies. Heat and Collateral are amazing. But he has made some weaker ones as well. Unfortunately Public Enemies belongs to his weaker. I had high hopes for this when it was upcoming. The poster of Johnny Depp clad in a trench coat and fedora hat and holding a Tommy Gun looked so cool. I imagined this as being like Heat but set in the 1930s. In several ways the setup is kind of similar. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale two actors at top of their game felt perfect as the leads. The criminal vs. detective thriller with both being the main character. Unfortunately it fails in all the things that Heat did so brilliantly. I've seen Public Enemies again after my first disappointed reaction but even when I tried to ignore my expectations on the director being Michael Mann and not to compare it to Heat Public Enemies is still a dull movie. The movie looks stunning I feel they have totally succeeded in recreating the 1930s Depression-era USA. But while the outside looks great it is on the inside that it is lacking. The story that is based on reality is actually a good one but the movie somehow still makes it feel uninteresting and completely devoid of any real substance . A major problem for the story is that we never feel anything for the characters. The actors do well overall but the writing is the problem also here. Johnny Depp fits well as John Dillinger. He looks the part and I can't say anything bad about his acting. It's just that his character lacks any real personality. I feel it's not really clear how the viewer should relate to Dillinger should we root for or against him. And this can be said about all characters in the movie there is no substance or development for any of them. I could not care less relation between Dillinger and Marion Cotillard's character. Christian Bale does well with what he's got but his character is less the focus of the story than Depp's. However I do feel that his attempts at an accent is very inconsistent. Unfortunate is that the action is just as bland as the rest of the movie. Michael Mann can or could direct tense edge of your seat action scenes. But the gun fights here are short and stale. It's just men shooting at each other but there is nothing creative about the action scenes. I'm not expecting these massive action set pieces and I know it's based on true events which seldom are as exciting as we like to see on screen. That doesn't matter. I think of Mann's Collateral which no is not based on reality but my point is that a skilled director can create thrill and suspense without that much spectacular action happening. Public Enemies is a well made movie only technically but lacking creatively. What should have been thrilling is boring. Actors struggling due to lack of characterisation. In the end this is not really a bad movie but it's not good either. Disappointing and forgettable I am sad to conclude.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
1930's Chicago Revisited in Style,"Eighty years after the events, Michael Mann takes on the Period Chicago Gangster genre, and wins, with this entertaining story. Do not be put off by some churlish carping from the critics, much of which is generated by the very high standards that Mann's films are now judged. The lengthy 140 minute running time flies by leaving the audience wondering about what could have been added to the story, not what should have been omitted.Essentially this is the story of the life, in his heyday, and death of Gangster John Dillinger. It bounces along, leaving little room for back story or leisurely character development, like Dillinger,it lives for the moment. Johhny Depp is superb as Dillinger, Christian Bale a thoroughly convincing Melvin Purvis, his taciturn but determined G-Man nemesis.A plot curio is that some time is given over to J Edgar Hoover's fight to establish an FBI with Purvis operating as his local enforcer.But the role is under developed, it could be dropped with no impact on the plot, making you wonder how much extra footage was left on the cutting room floor, hopefully set for an appearance on the DVD.Marion Cotillard, a native Frenchwoman, plays the part of the leading lady, and Dillingers love interest, well enough. In a role which offers infrequent appearances, she conforms to the genre requirements of being easily bedded, hit, and cries on demand.Critics have queried the way that the digital film is shot.There is none of the lushness of ""last of the Mohicans"", nor the grittiness of ""Collateral"", but the compelling plot leaves little time to worry about that.Review audiences also complained of poor sound quality and mumbled dialogue, not faults that I could identify with on this showing.The ""showdown"" between Dillinger and Purvis happens early on, in a scene which is played straight and without lingering fanfare, it is certainly no re-run of De Niro v Pacino in ""Heat"".If the film lacks anything it is a sense of Tragedy, so wonderfully apparent in De Palma's ""Carlitos Way"". Depp and Purvis are played so ruthlessly and efficiently by Depp and Bale that pathos and emotional attachment are on pretty short display.The period is lovingly recreated by Mann and the action sequences, unsurprisingly, never fail to disappoint, indeed when Dillinger is first shown robbing a bank his vault over the counter is seen in graceful slow motion. Diana Krall has a pleasing cameo as a nightclub torch singer performing ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" and the costumes are a consistent delight.Punchy, light on its feet and offering weighty roles for Depp and Bale, this will be enjoyed by ardent fans and the curious alike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
digital look for period piece,"It's 1933. John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is brought into prison but he's actually leading a prison break. He and his gang goes on a bank robbing spree around Chicago. After killing Pretty Boy Floyd, FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is assigned by J. Edgar Hoover to hunt down Public Enemy #1 John Dillinger. Dillinger falls for nightclub singer Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard).Director Michael Mann's decision to use digital and his modern style seems very intriguing until I actually see it. There is something disconcerting about this modern way of filming done on a period piece. The incongruity is off-putting. It's missing its heart. Depp and Cotillard are two of the greatest actors around but their chemistry is tepid. I like Depp and Bale in their roles. The action is brutal as in most Mann movies. There are lots to like but the overall feeling is an opportunity lost.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Familiar Territory, But Still Pretty Good Stuff","This is a solid crime movie; not fantastic, but good. For older viewers, the story of John Dillinger is familiar territory. Most everyone knows about the famous and where and how he died.....so isn't easy making a film where a sizable part of the audience knows the ending. Yet, thanks to the acting, directing and photography, I found it an interesting film.Johnny Depp isn't just some actor who likes to play weird roles; he's simply a good actor who can be convincing whether he's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" Willie Wonka"" or ""Public Enemy No. 1 (Dillinger)."" It also was interesting to see Marion Cotillard, the star who played singer Edith Piaf in ""La Vie En Rose,"" playing Dillinger's girl ""Billie Freschette."" Wow, it seems like very strange casting, but it works. The same goes for the always-fascinating Christopher Bale who portrays FBI agent ""Melvin Purvis."" The film has no lulls, despite it being two hours and 20 minutes and not overdoing the action scenes.Kudos to Director Michael Mann for another fine job, too. The one extended action part - the shootout in Wisconsin - is reminiscent of Mann's dramatic shootout in the streets of Los Angeles in the 1995 movie, ""Heat."" It is an eye-opener.Yet as much as I enjoyed the movie, somehow I kept thinking the film could be more involving because none of the characters is someone who is endearing, even though that probably is a pretty accurate picture of the real people. In the early '30s, neither gangsters or the police were particularly likable although Dillinger was seen as a folk hero to many as if he was a modern-day Robin Hood. The film, I thought, made him somewhat neutral. The same goes for Frechette and Purvis. I admire the restraint on the part of the screenwriters but I didn't feel they did a good job giving a good character study of anyone.Regardless, if you like good acting, a good period piece with cool 1930s cars and machine guns a-blazing, you should enjoy this. See it on HD, too; it looks terrific.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Shallow Gangster Movie,"In 1933, in the fourth year of the Great depression, the bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) challenges the law with his gang and is considered Public Enemy #1. J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) goes to the Congress asking for financial support to the agency and assigns the Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) responsible for Chicago area. Melvin does not succeed using technology to hunt Dillinger, so Hoover orders the use of abusive means of interrogation and the agents use torture, intimidation and blackmail to achieve their purpose. Meanwhile Dillinger falls in love for Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and Melvin and his men stakes her out trying to catch the outlaw.I had great expectations with ""Public Enemies"" and I am quite disappointing with this gangster movie. Johnny Depp is excellent as usual in the role of John Dillinger while Christian Bale is unrecognizable and has a wooden performance in the role of Agent Melvin Purvis. The FBI agents are brutal and abusive in a period without human rights and the characters are shallow and poorly developed; this complete inversion of values is the greatest problem of this movie and my wife and I were cheering for the romantic criminal in the end. The action scenes, with shootouts and car races, are excellent and it is not a surprise since it is a trademark of the director Michael Mann. The cinematography with the reconstitution of the 30's is also magnificent. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Inimigos Públicos"" (""Public Enemies"")",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Instant Classic,"Public Enemies has everything a Mob film should be. Tommy guns, cops and robbers, prison breaks, car chases, and really great actors. Based on a true story while this movie was also filmed on location to duplicate the real life images from news papers and articles of the true John Dillinger. Johnny Depp did an amazing job recreating the character. I also love the humor they bring into the movie. This movie never gets old.

Not even Depp and Bale can save an oddly disjointed and empty movie,"Oh boy was I looking forward to this! I love gangster movies, I think Christian Bale is one of the best actors around, I think Johnny Depp is always decent, and I think Michael Mann is a great director. It seems a sure bet, a thing that could not go wrong.Well. It did. Sort of. While ""Public Enemies"" is not a total disaster, it's not the new ""Heat"" that it should have been.It seems that Micheal Mann has finally succumbed to the style over substance virus, turning Public Enemies into a movie that is almost entirely about atmosphere and fancy visuals. It worked in Collateral and Miami Vice, but this time Mann goes overboard and fails to provide a compelling narrative or characters to care about.Instead, what we get is a fairly tiresome collection of one shoot-out and bank robbery after the other. A lot of people get shot, a lot of people die, but you very rarely have any idea who is being shot since none of the characters are introduced properly and they all look the same anyway. To make things worse, the editing is all over the place as well, with frequent jumps in time and space that are poorly explained, and whole sections of narrative apparently missing.Depp and Bale are probably doing the best they can with what they are given, but they manage to be almost totally forgettable, a first for Depp and the second time for Bale (Terminator Salvation being the first). And Depp and Bale are the lucky ones, since the excellent supporting cast really has nothing of any interest to do, and the love story, which is given a prominent place in the marketing campaign, taking up a very minor part and being unconvincing to boot.As much as I wanted to like this movie, I just couldn't. It's basically a collection of nicely choreographed and elaborate but very hard to follow gunfights after each other, with very little in terms of story or characters to tie them together. Worth seeing for the excellent production values, but not much more",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
How can a crime thriller be so boring?,"This film is about a criminal mastermind who is elusive to the American authorities back in 1930's.I cannot believe how boring ""Public Enemy"" is. I already felt thoroughly bored after twenty minutes, and after one more hour it does not get better at all. There are many problems with the movie. Slow pacing is the obvious problem, as the filmmakers spend too much effort trying to make the film atmospheric. They have simply forgotten that as an crime thriller, we need more action to engage viewers. Instead, most of the film is just talking and talking. When it does show an occasional gun fight, it is unbelievably detached with no intensity or thrill. It is as if the gun shots are played on tape, and are not from the supposed fights. Another problem is that 90% of the scenes are far too dark. It is not fun to look at silhouettes or shadows continuously. When we do get to see faces, most of the time their eyes are hidden under the shadow of their hat. Without this eye contact, I feel disengaged and disconnected from all the characters.""Public Enemies"" is a very boring movie for me. I struggled so hard to keep my eyes open, and I have to say I lost the fight.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Honestly, a little disappointing","Considering the actors who took part in this movie, it could have been much better. Not that the acting was poor, but that just too many times I was made to feel restless. Needless to say that 'Goodfellas' and 'The God Father' are in a category of there own, but I was really looking forward to seeing a powerful and modern gangster movie, however, 'Public Enemies' was under my expectations. Except for the occasional brilliant moment, there was still a feeling that something was missing. Maybe it's to do with the fact that there was to little insight into the characters, or perhaps the slightly unoriginal shooting style. Despite these flaws, if I may call them that, I'd still recommend this movie to J.Depp fans, for he was great as so often before and if your up for some violence and blood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Heat meets Bonnie and Clyde meets The Assassination of Jesse James,"What a fine collection of talent in Public Enemies. I had so much doubt in anticipation of this movie. I was told that the camera quality was low, Bale's acting was bad and that the plot was confusing and did not explain anything. After Miami Vice, I was willing to believe this might be another let down. Right in the first act, I knew that this movie was the one I have been waiting for.The last wave of decent crime films was in the first half of the 90's with Heat, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas and Casino. Since then, I have been waiting for more cinematically well- crafted crime dramas. The ones that were expected to be comparable to the older films I think did not reach that level, such as American Gangster. I would say Eastern Promises, Gangs of New York, Road to Perdition, Collateral and The Departed came close, but they are more just good movies of their own.Public Enemies is the first film in my opinion to have captured the essence of crime drama in a long time. It jumps right into the era, without the explanation that some people wished to have had. We enter right into the world, learning quickly the interactions between Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Frank Nitty, and much more of the criminal society of the Depression. I've always loved seeing these characters portrayed in the other movies they are featured in, but this film really had them right.Michael Mann really exercised himself as an auteur on this outing. Many can criticize his style and decision to shoot HD. Still, artists can paint the crucifixion of Christ in many different ways, so Mann should have the right to explore the story in his own fashion as well. I personally thought the imagery was fantastic, most especially the opening act.Depp, Bale and Cotillard were all great. So was the rest of the cast. Great balance between tragedy and humor. Go see this movie in theaters or you will regret it. It's quite simply the coolest movie of 2009.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
THE average summer commercial -.-,"The director of Public Enemies had directed Heat and The Insider? Unbelievable. Oh wait, on second thought there were quite a few similarities between public enemies and heat. So perhaps, Michael Mann is an auteur? No. I don't think so. Similarities are merely- attractive costumes,guns and cars. Visually, the movie is inviting. But it stops with that. A few good shots do exist but the rest of them simply increase the rate at which your eyes blink.A grand opening and a memorable ending indicates that the writer had only them in mind and just wrote bullshit in between to finish the script.There're so many parts in the movie that are preposterous and unacceptable. John Dillinger walking into the police headquarters made me wanna ""ALT+F4"" but I decided to stay on considering that there were just a couple of minutes left to get done with it.Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are both woody as wood. John Dilinger doesn't scare me one bit. Marion Cotillard actually does a little bit of observable acting.A few things were left unexplained and had been poorly dealt with. The romance between John and Billie was built up poorly. I felt as though I had missed a prequel to the movie. What does John do with all the money he robs from similar looking banks? There is hardly any insight given into the character.If there're any nominations it can possibly get in the coming awards season, it would be for the art direction. Yes, Michael Mann does triumphantly manage to simulate the prohibition era.If your aim is to get entertained you might as well go ahead and watch it. It isn't the most entertaining movie but Well.

Solid Story Highlighted With Some Great Performances,"Let me just start out by saying: This is a very, very good movie. If you're going to the movies this weekend, this is the one to see.The performances are really the highlight. Depp is perfectly nuanced as Dillinger. It's his most mature role to date. I don't really understand the flack he's giving for playing him as ""empty"". Subtle would be a better word. He's playing someone who always lives in the moment, and has accepted that he won't be around for a while. I think he captured this perfectly. Marion Cotillard is also perfectly fragile as Billie, his love interest. It's Bale, however, who really steals the movie. His portrayal is absolutely brilliant. He plays Melvin Purvis as professional, intimidating, and broken. Anyone who has seen his work should realize that his accent is spot on. He's also very subtle in his expressions, and this is one of his best performances, right up there with ""Hard Times"" and ""American Psycho.""The shoot out scenes are fantastic. I actually enjoyed the digital shooting much more than I thought I would. It really had voyeuristic feel that just can't be obtained with traditional 35mm. The visuals are across the board fantastic. The authentic places really stand out.I think the ending will really split viewers. I, for one, loved it. The last line is killer, and left me with a good impression of the film.Now the cons:The story spends too many scenes on Dillinger and Billie. The love story ends up feeling a bit contrived. I understand that Mann was going for an old gangster movie type of love dialogue, but it just didn't fit in. The movie had too much to say, and it leaves some subplots completely open. It almost seems sloppy. It should have been 30 minutes longer, with more of a focus on Purvis and J. Edgar Hoover (absolutely brilliantly played by Billy Crudup).Overall, go see this movie. This and Up are the best blockbusters of the summer so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"My public record shows that ""Public Enemies"" is a cinematic hit!","John Dillinger was a gangster legend who was adored, loathed, chased, admired, and detested by many. There are mixed elements to how people judged John Dillinger, and that was one the most admirable & authentic qualities to Director Michael Mann's John Dillinger gangster flick ""Public Enemies"". Mann wisely does not evolve into the entire biography of the Dillinger tale; there is no childhood chronology and no catastrophic life scarring moment. It is basically about a man choosing a life of crime in order to live fast and play hard, subconsciously aware to the fact that is will be not be infinite. Mann starts the film with Dillinger already at his height of his gangster popularity orchestrating another one of his ""great escape from prison"" schemes. Then once again, Johnny D. and his bad boy entourage are robbing banks and living the retro thug life. Dillinger then checks out and romances the lovely checkout coat girl Billie Frechette. Apparently, Johnny's fresh ways were successful in luring Ms. Freshette. During that era of the 1930's crime hike, many Americans were rooting for these public enemies to rob banks in order to show their dislike of American banks for their mismanagement which eventually was the catastrophic factor which caused The Great Depression. Not to undermine the fact that many were against the dreadfulness that Dillinger and his men caused by their heinous crimes. J. Edgar Hoover was during that time trying to formalize his Bureau of Investigation into a national police force which later became known as the FBI. But Hoover had to find ways to vacuum the U.S. Government into this political formalization. Therefore, he exploited the capture of outlaws as a way to elevate his Bureau of Investigations. He then delegated the task of capturing Public Enemy Number 1, Dillinger himself, to top agent Melvin Purvis. The central plot line shootout of ""Public Enemies"" which Mann exhibits is the relentless pursuit of Purvis and Co. in capturing the charismatic Dillinger and his men. Johnny Depp was a real straight-shooter with his enigmatic but bulls-eye performance as Dillinger. Christian Bale's acting pursuit as one of the elite in the biz took another leap higher with his driven work here as Purvis. Marion Cotillard proved that she suffered no acting letdown, after her Best Actress Oscar, with her strong supportive work here as the Dillinger gal Billie. Speaking of Billies, Billy Crudup crudely transformed himself into J. Edgar Hoover with authentic prowess. Maybe I was hit too hard with Ronan Bennett's complex screenplay, but at times I was lost with ""Public Enemies"" verbose rounds. Nevertheless, it was Mann who captures his audience by Mannly displaying the Dillinger crime life and his ultimate demise in sheer entertainment fashion. ""Public Enemies"" might not be the #1 film in my ""most wanted"" 2009 film list at years end, but most probably will be gunned up as one of the best of the year. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Well-Made Cinematically, But Shallow","Who was John Dillinger? We all know he was a flamboyant criminal who robbed banks, but who WAS he? The question of who Dillinger WAS is far more interesting than the question of what Dillinger DID, but this film, sadly, chose only to concentrate seriously on the latter and gave up almost immediately on the former.This film goes out of its way--with a poor grasp of history's time-line, by the way--to show us what Dillinger did and who he hung around with, but it does next to nothing to explore who Dillinger was as a person or even as a criminal. It hints that Dillinger might be a passionate lover and loyal friend, but shows us little evidence aside from a few thrown-together seduction scenes (which make his girlfriend/heroine look like a dim-witted pushover) and an awkward love scene.Even Dillinger's foil, Melvin Purvis, is a mystery in Mann's hands. Did he care about justice at all, or was he just a fascist on a personal crusade? Was he competent in the least or was he just a bumbling idiot? Squinty-eyed stares can only convey so much, after all.Michael Mann seems to be in a terrible hurry to tell this story, as he is stuck between the rock of having to relate a relatively complete ""crime-ography"" of a notorious American gangster and the hard place of keeping the movie shorter than 2 1/2 hours.As a result, a beautifully shot and edited movie that had a lot of promise ends up little more than a dumb, shoot-'em-up action movie wearing the fedora of ""historical romance."" Good for a date, but not a serious film.Grade: C+. Things to look for: Mann's ham-handed and laughably obvious political commentary on the use of torture about 2/3 of the way through the movie; psychotically trigger-happy Baby Face Nelson well-played by Stephen Graham; cool old products (Zenth radio); great fashion sense.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Horrid and Shaky Camera Work + Dullness = Huge Disappointment,"I can't believe a director as accomplished as Michael Mann would produce a movie with this poor of a presentation. More than half the film consists of ultra zoom close ups. Are Johnny Depp's nose hairs really that camera worthy? Maybe they spent the entire budget on gathering this cast and had to hide their period piece shooting behind ultra zooms on two 1930's cars? The horrid and shaky camera work is far too distracting and often pulls the viewer right out of the film. Add to that a rather poor pace and a story that never allows you to connect with either lead and maybe this rating is too kind. For the most part, Dillinger's charm and savvy are lost as we never see what made him a competent bank robber or really why he was an infamous scoundrel. Bale's performance is monotone drab as is most of the running time of this very disappointing movie.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Public Enemies Commits its Share of Cinematic Crimes,"In the words of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) spoken to his love interest Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard, A Good Year), ""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you. What else do you need to know?"" Like a one legged pirate, ""Public Enemies"", helmed by Hollywood's very own HD CAM junkie Michael Mann (Collateral, Miami Vice) limps along to the two hour and twenty minute mark and has, as Ricky Ricardo would say, ""A lot of S'plainin' to do"". In a world of well staged shootouts, fun and cocky dialogue and heartthrob's Johnny Depp (Sweeney Todd) and Christian Bale (American Psycho), the words ""story development"" may or may not really make much of a difference, but let's not kid ourselves here, they really do.It is the 1930's and America has just declared their first war on crime, targeting some of the country's most notorious dangers to the well being of society. John Dillinger is one such criminal, claiming bragging rights to the fact that he can clear out a safe in ""one minute and forty secondsflat."" With the help of Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd there really isn't any bank they can't knock over or any jail cell secure enough to hold them in, that is until they are matched by the likes of FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Purvis pulls all the stops to remain hot on Dillingers tail in attempts to capture him ""Dead or Dead"". Along the way Dillinger falls for Billie, a coat check girl who you'd more than likely expect to catch wearing a three dollar dress in a room full of Mink. Their love is tested when Dillinger is pursued and eventually restrained and locked away, only to escape once more through clever tom foolery in an attempt to fall back into Billies arms once more while staying alive long enough to do it.To its credit, ""Public Enemies"" lives up to its expectations as a first rate gangster flick, steadily filling the screen with a barrage of machine gun bullets, almost to the point that you can smell the gunpowder from the fifth row. There's enough blood, gore and suspense to keep any action fan at bay, and if you don't squirm in your seat during end of the second to last scene you may need to check your pulse at the door. Unless you've experienced a shootout in person, there is a particularly notable one between the FBI and Dillinger in a motel at the pictures halfway point that should leave you breathless. In fact, if I were to rate Public Enemies on a scale for action alone, id happily award it with a five star honor, but this isn't meant to be just some run of the mile Schwarzenegger popcorn flick, this is meant to be a fine slice of cinema, and cinema has certain prerequisites.As I stared up at a crisp digital print of the film, I couldn't help but wonder why a big budget movie of this caliber was decidedly shot, in Michael Mann fashion, in HD. At times, the image looked beautifully gritty and realistic, while at others as degrading and false as home video This makes me seriously contemplate why Mann still insists on shooting on cheap digital cameras like the F-23 which he used for this particular project instead of actual film or even a Red One. My question may never be answered, but ultimately it's the film's quality that suffers, which in turn managed to remove me on more than one occasion from the fantasy world of the picture. I wish I could say this was the only aspect that distracted me from my viewing experience.It seems as if in a stirring turn of events, which occurs somewhere between the main titles and the end credits, Michael Mann has failed to include even a stitch of character or story development. With the exception of her basic introduction at a dingy city bar, Billie has absolutely no back story what-so-ever. This never allows us the opportunity to connect with her on even the most elementary of levels neither emotionally nor physically. The same goes for agent Purvis, whose character is flatter than a dollar flapjack off the sunrise special, making this one of Bale's most forgettable performances to date. There is absolutely no chemistry between Depp and Cotillard, which is a shame when you consider how dynamic both of these top notch actors are individually. To his credit, Depp does manage to deliver another stunning, hardnosed performance as John Dillinger and proves to once again be a complete joy to marvel at on screen. If only the story had as much pizazz.As a whole, we are presented with bits and pieces of celluloid that never quite seem to join together to make an actual movie, but rather come off as a series of disjointed, yet entertaining vignettes. You would think that by the third film in Mann's powerful resume, he would have learned by now how to pace and execute a motion picture instead disproving his validity as a serious director by making these easy to avoid errors that stand out on screen like a bad spelling mistake. When you mix everything up in an over-sized pot and stir, the ultimate result is an undercooked, emotionless and disconnected final product.If you're expecting to walk into Public Enemies thinking it's going to be the next ""Godfather"" or ""Scarface"", you may find yourself severely disillusioned at the films conclusion. Then again, if you walk into the movie expecting to be thrilled by impeccably staged action sequences and a few downright impressive shootouts you may find yourself satisfied with your ten dollar ticket purchase. Either way, discerning audiences will demand explanation for why studio execs failed to wellexplain anything. Someone tell Mr. Ricardo that it's time for his close up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I had hoped for so much more!,"My wife and I saw it last night and we both agree that it was less than we had hoped for. I got into a disagreement with another poster here about the use of HD. He said it automatically made the film substandard. I argued that there was basically no difference (in fact, I have never even thought to look at which is which). I still say, that for the most part, HD video is equal to film... most viewers would never see the difference. But I will now agree that this film would have been better if shot on film. Why? Because it could actually have benefited by a bit of grain. It would have helped it fit into the period. So much attention was paid to costumes, etc. The film should have looked ""gritty"" which it didn't. The real problem, IMHO, about the use of HD video was the guerrilla (sp?)style of hand held cameras. I hate this technique. I think that hurt the film tremendously. And when you shake a camera, especially an HD one, you really see the shake. Had the film been shot more with steady cam and perhaps a bit of sepia tinting, the HD part would have been fine.Now to the movie... it was not well defined in any aspect. They didn't go deep enough into any character to more fully understand the motives they expressed. There was little connection with the viewer and the characters. I could see that Dillenger loved Billie but she was the only one who showed any real emotion in that regard. We didn't see them falling in love, just hearing him say that he did. Pervis looked angry all the time, but we don't know why. We suspect it might be because the gangsters killed (F)BI men, but that's only a guess. J. Edgar Hoover will go down in history for being a real strange character and that fact was touched on in the film, but very little.In general, it seemed that no part of the story was carried deep enough. I expect that Mann likely shot several hundred hours of video and I also suspect that a 4 hour Director's cut might be a better film but in it's current form, this films lacks depth and definition. There were excessive bullets flying (well filmed) but even these action sequences seemed flat. The most emotional scene in the film **spoiler** was when the ***hole cop was hitting Billie to get info. That scene carried a lot of punch (no pun intended). But then it deflated since no dialog followed up on his behavior. Even the final scene where Billie is told what John said as he was dying was flawed by the character saying ""I think that's what I heard"". I realize it was probably done that way to assure accuracy but it left the audience wondering ""is that what he really said or is that just a guess?"". And if were are trying to stay accurate, do we really know that **spoiler** Dillinger walked through the Bureau's ""Dillinger Division""? That seemed a bit far fetched. But if it's true, how do we know it? I had hoped for so much more. The acting was great. There were a lot of great performances, but actually too many. Who were all these people? Too many cops and robbers but we don't learn who most of them are. ""Baby Face"" Nelson's portrayal was a bit silly and even here, we don't learn enough about how those 2 infamous bank robbers hooked up or how they felt about each other. There was a lead up to the train robbery that looked promising, but then John got shot and that storyline went bye bye. Who was that guy? How often did Dillenger work with him. It was said in the film that all Dillinger's associations were dead. But this looked like his most important cohort. I don't think I ever heard his name mentioned.The story was ""murky"", like a muddy pond. We know there are ""big fish"" in there, but we don't really know who they are, how many, where they came from, what they like to eat or why they swim the way they do. I feel unfulfilled.I am a fan of Mann's work. I had hoped for and expected so much more. It might actually exist but on the cutting room floor. But overall, I am less that impressed with this year's most promising movie. Hopefully, Scorsese will fill in the void with ""Shutter Island"". 7/10 ""I think that boy's cheese slid off his cracker"" The Green Mile",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Its Awesome To Be Bad!!!,"This was Marion Cotillard's first film after her Oscar win a couple of years back. My heart ached when she was beaten by the police. I wanted to rip the man apart. This is the kind of feeling you want to feel when you watch a movie.The Feds try to take down notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during a booming crime wave in the 1930's. That's the plot people.Based on the non-fiction book by Bryan Burrough & set in the time of the Great Depression, Public Enemies is a cops-and-robbers drama, only its more layered than that. John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is the FBI's most-wanted man, responsible for robbing over a dozen banks & murdering several police officers. Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is the FBI agent who heads the operation to catch Dillinger.Dillinger introduces himself to Marion Cotillard magnificently. He tells about his childhood & that he loves fast cars & HER! That was actually very romantic, in a weird way..! Christian Bale does what he's best at, simply staring intensely & barking orders. The fact that this was a true story made it all the more exciting. Christian Bale brings his Batman tone to some of the scenes. Some may like it, some may not. I didn't like it. I half expected Depp to get by on swagger & charm like in the Pirates Of Caribbean, but he does so much more than that. Marion Cotillard gives one of her best performances. The camera-work used in the film makes the whole setting look authentic & gives a gritty feeling to the film. You gotta love Johnny Depp's style..:) Watch this film because it is not only a gallant tale about honour & loyalty, but also because it's one hell of a thrilling ride.8/10-Girish, 20",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A surprising masterpiece,"Michael Mann is, regardless of personal opinion, one of the greatest directors ever when it comes to action films. His notion of pace, narrative, and perspective are top notch, and Heat, Miami Vice prove this without a doubt. Now, Public enemies, his greatest film since Heat, comes to prove something that the pacino/deniro confrontation had left in the air: his subtle but certain analysis of the idea of the ""hero"" versus the ""anti-hero"". Let's be clear: Mann creates tough, aggressive, larger than life characters, but, at the same times, gives them a great sense of humanity. But let's focus on the film: Public enemies is a precious work of art, a fast-paced, epic movie not only about Dillinger, but also about the other great robbers of its time (the so called ""public enemies"", that gave origin to the film's name) and the clash between them and the law (represented, mainly, by Christopher Nolan's character). The result is a gangster movie, with a powerful love story fueling the narrative into a very compelling and powerful outcome. Deep's performance is simply off the charts, Oscar worthy, and his supporting cast is exceptional (Marion Cotillard and Nolan being the best proof of that). That, along with remarkable action sequences, extraordinary shootouts, brilliant photography, original ambiance, and masterful directing, makes Public enemies the best movie of the year so far. If you liked Heat, you'll love this. If you didn't, go see it anyway: it's just a brilliant piece of cinema. Not everyone will like it, but if you allow yourself to be taken in by the story, you'll probably love it. All in all, a masterpiece of modern cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Review of Public Enemies (2009),"When contemporary songstress Diana Krall sings ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" -- as Johnny Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) have their first dance -- it becomes the theme song for Public Enemies. It's a bolt from the blues.Michael Mann's brilliant and deceptive new film is full of such themes lurking in its shadows. That's what makes it provocative, challenging, and rewarding.Mann takes a well-recognized historical figure in a well-known time in a well-worn genre and gives them revitalized life. But one has to be alert to see beyond the past.Mann is sly, inventive, and sometimes subtle amidst the familiar goings-on. He remints the fabled career of John Dillinger in the 1930s.One expects Mann to make some pungent social criticism in his mise en scene and plot machinations. And he does, with panache.One especially provocative sequence in Public Enemies is a torture scene in which the brutality only gains misinformation. It is a compelling mirror of today's interrogation techniques.Mann also introduces the concept of burgeoning surveillance which is a telling harbinger of what is to come.But Mann doesn't state the obvious; he lets the actions speak louder than words. Mann lets history -- and its meaning -- speak for itself.A revelatory example is the infamous ""lady in red,"" whom many people know as the woman who betrayed and who was with Dillinger at the Biograph theater in Chicago.In actuality the woman was not in red. In Mann's movie, as in actuality, she wore an orange skirt, which some people mistook as red. And so the legend. Mann doesn't explain that he's bringing actuality to myth. It's there for us to discover.John Dillinger as portrayed by Mann and Johnny Depp (another JD) is a glamorized figure, who seems nearly flawless His fundamental attribute is loyalty. He is charming, cool, and smart. He's Robin Hoodlum.Besides Depp, another fortuitous casting is Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette, the coat check girl who becomes the soul mate of Dillinger. Cotillard won an Oscar as another bird -- Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007).Public Enemies is very much a romance.Christian Bale gives humanity to the stolid but earnest agent Melvin Purvis, whom J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) picks to head his special force to catch Dillinger. Hoover is in the process of developing the FBI and names Dillinger as the first Public Enemy #1.Stephen Lang is memorable as the Texas lawman who assists Purvis. He adds substance to the luminous, fictional denouement.Mann and writers Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman have created a canny script. Public Enemies may remind one of the scope and vision of Altman's Thieves Like Us (1974).Mann has created an evocative, beautiful movie in Public Enemies. Cinematographer Dante Spinotti -- in their fifth collaboration -- creates breathtaking tableaux from a palette with strokes of mesmerizing light.Mann employs scenes and shots that remind us of Hitchcock. There's suspense at a stoplight. There's a shot in a movie theater that reminds us of the tennis match in Strangers on a Train (1951).Mann also uses techniques that may remind us of graphic novels -- flashes of light from tommy guns. There's a surrealistic night scene in the woods around Little Bohemia lodge in Wisconsin.But perhaps the most effective use of past movies is the sequence in the Biograph theater before Dillinger meets his fate. Mann uses clips from Manhattan Melodrama (1934) starring Clark Gable as Blackie (more fortuity), which actually was playing at the Biograph.One of the fundamental themes in Mann's work is about men who hold to their personal codes against society and institutions. It's in all Mann's movies -- Thief (1981), The Insider (1999).Blackie in Manhattan Melodrama has a code; he refuses the governor's (William Powell) offer of commutation and accepts death. In Manhattan Melodrama he says, ""If I can't live the way I want, at least let me die when I want."" Blackie is true to his principles and character -- like Mann's Dillinger.Dillinger watches the movie and obviously relates to what is on screen. Talk about irony.Movies make strange bedfellows -- Gable and Dillinger. Life is image.Mann espouses individuality, but realizes it comes with a heavy price. The individual always winds up the target of the group Business wins out.In Public Enemies Mann has several shots of the group. One of his early shots is of prisoners trudging in a line in a gray-walled prison.Another is a group of pasty-faced feds.Another is a roomful of men sitting before phones taking bets. Dillinger's exploits threaten the crime mob because they bring attention to them. One mobster tells Dillinger he is ""bad for business."" The group is out to destroy the outsider.Mann's Dillinger is a descendant of the cowboy. He sings, ""Get along little doggies."" He lies in bed beneath a picture of a man riding a bucking bronco.Clocks and watches punctuate Public Enemies. Time is running out.But what a countdown! Public Enemies is a delicious feast for an interpretive viewer.Blackbird under glass. A rare treat.Tony Macklinhttp://tonymacklin.net/",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Expected More From a Depp Film,"OK I admit it. I am tougher on a Johnny Depp movie because I expect Academy award greatness type of film, every time. This movie did entertain. Depp was great as was Christian Bale and Marian Cotillard. No issues with the acting . The movie though , had more of a Spoofy, Film Noire feel to it , rather than tell an in depth story of Johnny Dillinger. I googled Dillinger and I have to admit their was a strong resemblance between Johnny Dillinger and Johnny Depp. Definitely excellent casting. The film though would have been better had it focused on Dillingers complete life story, not just the last year or 2 of his life. Plenty of gratuitous action, but some of it seemed forced and unrealistic. At times this resembled more of a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger, bad*ss movie. It was based on a true story but became hard to take seriously. It came across to me that the writer of this movie , was more concerned about having nonstop action than relaying a true story. Perhaps this was in the insecurity of the writer himself. I do not know , I am not a psychologist. I do recommend this film. It was a guys film to be sure . My advice.... Do not go in to this thinking its an elite , award film, as I did, because it clearly is not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
EXCELLENT HISTORICAL MOVIE!!,"This movie is one of Johnny Depp's best. Regarding content, this movie definitely flows at a high pace, but it lacks the violence that is characteristic of so many other American criminal movies. However, this fact does not bother me at all, and I actually really loved this movie, but I think that the lack of violence may be why so many other people rated this movie with a low score. In addition, I noticed something funky going on with Depp's hairstyle: it's reminiscent of 21 Jump Street! The way his hair is combed in this movie very much reminds me of his bad-boy hairstyle midway through the television sitcom. As a result, Depp appears to be much younger in this movie than in many of his other movies from this time era.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Cinematography. Solid Acting. Hollow Story.,"I did not like this. Decent directing, but hollow story.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
From depression-era to modern-day gangster stories ... they always abound, e.g. ""The Untouchables"" (1987),
""The Godfather"" (1972), et al. Because people like to live vicariously as either gangster, cop, or both.This story is barely passable, and it's far too predictable and cliched, end-to-end. Sometimes, but not often, characters
don't always have to be fleshed out. Here, the story is about the characters: history, idiosyncrasies, and what makes
them tick. In other words, encourage the viewer (reader) to become connected and invested in the qualities of the
good and bad guys.Unfortunately, there is zero character development here - just plop! This just doesn't work. It's empty. Hollow.ACTING:
Of course the acting is solid across the board ... since actor after actor here could have played lead roles!(The number of excellent actors on this picture surprised me throughout - must have spent a fortune.)Sadly, for all of anyone's skill, there are no stand outs. Frankly, I would have preferred if Depp and Bale weren't
here because it's a waste of their talents. This is another example of great acting being impotent to overcome
poor storytelling (writing).ENTERTAINMENT:
Low - moderate valueTEMPO:

Mann the Director Outclasses Mann the Writer,"Public Enemies {dir. Michael Mann, 2009}***/****In telling the story of John Dillinger, it would seem that director Michael Mann had found the perfect fit for his personal aesthetic. Dillinger was a man of copious charm, and a taste for fine clothes,yet he was suitably cold blooded and violent when the situation called for it. Mann as a director who has always explored the lives of violent men, from Thief to Collateral, and his films have always looked impeccable However,in the end his new film Public Enemies is not the film it could have been. It ends up a middling Mann film, lacking the urgency of The Insider and the power of Heat (Mann's two best films.)The picture opens auspiciously in 1933, with a thrilling jailbreak by Dillinger, who is introduced in glorious close up, and Johnny Depp playing Dillinger holds that shot like few other actors working. Mann utilizes the closeup to great effect throughout the movie. He and cinematographer Dante Spinotti make great use of the HD technology at their disposal, and they have much of the film resting on the power supplied by those closeups, fortunately Johnny Depp provides an alluring, menacing attractive quality. Later, we meet Dillinger's flame, Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard, very good in what is a poorly developed role) along with the two men in charge of capturing Dillinger, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup in a very solid, multi-faceted performance) and Melvin Purvis (Christan Bale, in another one of the film's underwritten roles.) However, the most intriguing of the G-Men is Stphen Lang's Charles Winstead, the man who would eventually be the one to shoot Dillinger. Mann also name drops Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd, yet none of the peripheral characters are really given enough time or work to be more than quick walk-ons.While this is a film with a number of startling and powerful scenes, it doesn't hang together as a cohesive whole. The audience observes, admires and moves on. I can't think of a film with so many great scenes that left me feeling so cold.But, this is ultimately a good film. It contains strong work by the actors and Cotillard and Depp have add a sexual chemistry to their relationship. I would add the look to the list of things that work in the film. Obviously the costumes were quite excellent and the sets looked wonderful, but the cinematography was stunning. I was entertained by the film, at times enamored purely by the keen visual style on display. Mann seems to bring a new, almost documentarian, approach to the period piece. I only wish he and his fellow writers took those leaps with the script.Although it features a fantastic lead performance from Johnny Depp and stunning HD photography (both of which are the best so far this year), the script needed some serious work. Some characters seem undefined and others (like Christan Bale's Melvin Purvis) are bland clichés. Mann and his fellow screenwriters don't even seem to know what they want to say about Dillinger the man. As a result the film is a vaguely satisfying, at times intoxicating. However, in the end it provides only a sketch of a man who deserves a full, fleshed out portrait.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gloriously shot chase movie on the challenge to stop a 1920's legendary gangster,"After ten years and a strong cult following, Michael Mann has decided to try to recreate the basis that underpinned ""Heat"". That film saw a cop and a bank robber play off each other whilst being two sides of the same coin.There are parallels with that film and ""Public Enemies"" (the gangster's girl, the brotherhood between some of the gangsters and the gunfights etc) but also some major differences. Firstly the gist of the film revolves mostly round gangster John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) whilst law enforcer Melvin Purvess (Christian Bale) is really second billing (Heat was split equally). Next this is based on a true story so creates limitations. Anyhow, best to just take this film on its own.So how does it all go? Personally, I enjoyed it. The settings are very evocative of the period (1920s) without falling into cliché whilst the actors all fit in very well into their roles. Johnny Depp holds out very well in his part as John Dillenger and gives him a full character. There are many great quotable lines in the film and the film moves at a fair pace.However, it wasn't as gripping as I'd have hoped. The story was well written but didn't grab me partly as it's a very long movie. Maybe my expectations were too high. Despite that, these are really sparse criticism, and overall it's a very good film and enjoyable, just be warned that it is a long film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Chutzpah and Brains Gone Bad in a Pretty Good Version,"Public Enemies (2009)Chutzpah and Brains Gone BadYes, this is a terrific gangster film, filled with period effects, great character acting, and visuals to knock the safety off your machine gun. But it's more than that, more than a love story snuck between the bank heists, more than a glimpse at the roots of the FBI (with a slightly unconvincing J. Edgar getting started). It manages to create a pulse and a mood that sustains even the occasional slow moments. It makes the life of Dillinger, in the form of Johnny Depp, a little fantastic and romantic in a filmic way--creating another Hollywood icon. The bio is the vehicle for a larger aura, which is the movie.After all, we know the facts. It's how they are told and how they are seen that matters. Public Enemies, with all its clichés, is dynamic and sweet, disturbing and even a little bit funny. There are redundant moments (one too many bank robberies for me) and some acting that falls a little flat (including, unfortunately, Dillinger's love interest). But the cinematography by Dante Spinotti is really superb and varied, playing with foreground and background, often with a single element shown very close, and using a huge range of interesting light--the long chase scenes in the Wisconsin woods struck me as original and beautiful.So I wouldn't think of this as a film about plot but about getting absorbed, which you can really do well. And about Depp in a superb performance, filled with charm and confidence and unrecognized doom.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Full of Authentic Detail and Wonderful Acting,"This is a film that has to be seen more than once as it is so full of period detail and the actual authentic truth of Dillinger's life. The real locations were used often removing plastic frontage on entire streets, the actual weapons and models of car used by the man himself, nothing was overlooked, right down to the money belt he wore. Johnny Depp, as always when playing a real life character, went to great effort to portray the real Dillinger, finding old film reel and then discovered he came from a town not faraway from where Dillinger was born so he could adopt the accent with some ease before taking the speech pattern from the old newsreels. Johnny Depp did this so well that an elderly sister of Dillinger contacted him after the film was was released to say how well he portrayed her brother. It is a piece of American history at a time of great change, beautifully captured with judgement left to the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
PUBLIC ENEMIES Rekindles Gangster Era,"Johnny Depp is hitting his stride in recent years with his Pirates of the Caribbean films and character roles. Director/writer Michael Mann has been a respected stylist of the crime genre with such notables as Heat, Thief, and TV's Miami Vice. The union of these two super talents results in a more than satisfactory retelling of the legendary bank robber, John Dillinger, in Public Enemies. This violent tale focuses on the free spirit of Dillinger and his infamous robberies in the Midwest at the height of the Great Depression.In 1933, the country is in the midst of the Great Depression and bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) captures the public's fascination and even folk hero worship. Having helped to break his friends out of prison, he continues his robberies in and around Chicago. As the crime wave sweeps the Midwest, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover enlists up and coming agent, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), (who has just nailed Pretty Boy Floyd,) to capture Dillinger, Public Enemy Number One. Purvis employs a variety of sophisticated listening devices and police work to track him. Dillinger thinks he is invincible and executes even more daring bank robberies. He dates hat check girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and travels with her to Florida for horse races and then to Arizona, where lawmen recognize and arrest him. Transported to Indiana State Penitentiary, an easier place to breakout than a federal prison thanks to his mob lawyer, he uses a fake gun to engineer an escape. He is joined by notorious hothead robber, Baby Faced Nelson, and they score more violent robberies. Purvis insists on recruiting a crack force of Texas lawmen who assist him in closing in on the Dillinger gang leading to a memorable shootout in Little Bohemia. As Dillinger crosses the state line, he violates federal laws and brings pressure on organized criminals, who turn on the fugitive. Billie's fear that John will be caught or killed is tempered by her love for him, and when she is captured by local law enforcement, Purvis intercedes. When a call girl comes forward with information about Dillinger, Purvis sets up a fateful ambush at The Biograph Theater where the FBI will be waiting.It is interesting that Dillinger's relationship with organized crime syndicates helped him with a legal infrastructure that disappeared once the mob deemed him a risk to their lucrative business. Further, Hoover's political agenda was desperate to make headlines and build the FBI into a future powerhouse of law. It is also fascinating how technically proficient the FBI was on its use of wire taps and eavesdropping devices while being relatively incompetent in conducting a simple arrest or taking part in a shootout.What is refreshing is the core romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette. Dillinger is presented as bold, charismatic and at times ruthless. It is his bravado that attracts fellow criminals and Billie to him. Cotillard gets a strong role that is considerably more than window dressing. Her performance is convincing, and her chemistry with Depp's Dillinger makes this romance believable and heartbreaking thus lending an emotion subtext to the typical gangster movie. Bales's Purvis is portrayed as an obsessed, determined lawman who is dry and dull in sharp contrast to the devil may care attitude of the freewheeling Dillinger. Billy Crudup registers effectively as the young Hoover. Mann favorite Stephen Lang, barely recognizable, registers a solid performance as a hardened Texas lawman who is critical to the end of the film.Besides the usual set designs and costumes to mimic the depression era, heavy use is made of period music. The Little Bohemia shootout is a major set piece with heavy use of hand-held cameras. Although a detailed montage of action, it still does not have the visceral impact of John Milius' Dillinger or even the classic, G-Men. There is also an extended bank heist reminiscent of Mann's Heat in its boldness and precision of execution. The climactic ambush at the Biograph Theater is depicted in excruciating detail and still carries a great deal of tension.The last scene at a women's prison may never actually have happened, and it is curious that Lang's lawman and not Purvis serves as the catalyst for this key moment. The subsequent, final shot of Cotillard after getting a special message is quite memorable. It almost raises this film to another level.Public Enemies is not the best of Michael Mann, but it is a solid entry in his canon of crime films. What is notable is another star turn by Depp, an actor at his creative peak.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Michael Mann plays with the gangster genre and HD technology with mixed results,"""Public Enemies"", Michael Mann's account of John Dillinger's (Johnny Depp) crime wave and his romantic involvement with a young beauty (Marion Cotillard), has technical pros (the film vs. digital video controversy is a matter of personal taste, in my opinion, but that deserves to be discussed), but lacks character development.Shot in HD (high definition video), with some interesting hand-held camera movements and unorthodox angles, the movie shows how HD video has developed. Take a look at last year's magnificent ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen, which was shot on video as well. Sometimes, it's hard to tell the difference. Some people argue that video should only be employed for independent, low budget films, and its use in big budget productions like this just for the sake of stylization is unwelcome. Naturally, the cameras and general equipment used in a production like ""Public Enemies"" are much more advanced than the ones used in, say, ""Frozen River"". However, lots of people think the video look doesn't fit a gangster flick. Film has that special look that video doesn't have, and film still produces the most beautiful images you can see on a big screen. Digital, however, has a special texture to itself as well, and whether it works for this or that genre is just a matter of personal taste. I wasn't turned off by the use of HD in ""Public Enemies"" and actually think it gave the movie an interesting, unusual look – you could see the pores, wrinkles on Depp's and Christian Bale's faces like never before.My main problem with the film is the lack of character development and, why not say, soul to the whole package (So let me end the technical discussion here). By character development, I don't necessarily mean to give a longer background story to the main characters; however, the relationship between Dillinger and his girlfriend seems cold and contrived. Depp is charismatic, and Cotillard, who delivered one of my favourite screen performances of all time in ""La Vie en Rose"" (and earned an Oscar for it), isn't bad, but is not given much to do (and unlike the likes of a Juliette Binoche, she doesn't sound very convincing in English yet; she seems much more comfortable in her own language, which doesn't mean I'm bashing her efforts because I believe she will have a wonderful international career, and I'm looking forward to seeing her with Daniel Day-Lewis in the musical ""Nine"" later this year). They lack chemistry, and while the movie spends more time on Dillinger's escapades from the law, it never finds a balance with the ""love story""; and long, choreographed killings get old after a while – especially when you don't care that much for any of the characters. The movie lacks tension and believability on both sides. It doesn't always work as a gangster film, and the love story at the core doesn't ring true.I think it was Billy Wilder who once said ""Nobody is gonna remember after a movie: what a great shot! What about the story?"" Unfortunately, nowadays, Hollywood movies (and some supposedly artsy indie films, too) rely way too much on unusual camera angles and forget about telling a story. And these experiments and ""cool shots"" turn out to be the only things people remember as specific to such movies. Being experimental is fine, but sometimes when you try too hard you lose every and any focus. Mann succeeded with his digital experiments in the great ""Collateral"" (2004), failed miserably with the dreadful ""Miami Vice"" (2006), and had mixed results with this ""Public Enemies"". This is NO ""Bonnie and Clyde"", and as cool as Mann's camera angles and visual approach can be, they're not half as groundbreaking as Dede Allen's daring editing job in Arthur Penn's masterpiece (back in 1967, and still as compelling over four decades later).The way it is, ""Public Enemies"" has good moments and technical achievements, but seems more like a curious exercise in style than a really good movie.6.5/10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Different style of Crime,"Public Enemies is beautiful in ways one wouldn't have expected. It isn't flashy, it isn't shot with a clean style loaded static camera angles or slow zooms and portrait shots, no instead Public Enemies was shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras and because of that, makes you feel that you're at the table with John and the gang, or with Melvin Purvis addressing his fellow G-Men. That style choice makes Public Enemies unfold in an entirely different way. I felt like I wasn't watching characters, instead i felt I was watching real people, wonderful style choice in my honest opinion. (I can understand that hate for such a style choice though) The true surprise here wasn't Johnny Depp's unusually toned back and powerful performance or Christian Bale's quiet strong underlining supportive role, it's actually Marion Cotillard's performance, she holds so much emotion it's astounding. (a scene near the end between Marion and a G-man is almost hard to watch) Direction, performances and cinematography are all top notch, expect a handful of Oscar Consideration for this one.

An epic story told in a slow pace.,"Public Enemies tells the story of John Dillinger, the 1930's public enemy number one and how the Feds tried to take him down along with his friends. Or better yet, it just tells the story of how Dillinger was taken down. The story didn't start at the beginning nor did it tells us about John Dillinger, it just skipped to the middle of his 'career' and showed us how he escaped from prison and went on a bank-robbery-spree. So, in a way, the story was not in depth and, of course, it didn't really follow the real history with some changes made. But the storyline is gripping nonetheless.The acting is brilliant. You can expect nothing less from the casts of Johnny Depp, who played public enemy number one convincingly; Christian Bale, who is obsessed to take Dillinger down; and of course the lovely Marion Cotillard, who played Dillinger's girlfriends. Cotillard however didn't get a very long screen time but she used every second of it to give us her best, and one of the best stand out scene is the interrogation scene.The movie is shot with a shaky ""hand-held"" camera. It feels like we are chasing the action as it happens. And the tone of the movie is bright making it look like a documentary without the use of CGI or such. Everything about this movie looks realistic from the costumes to the buildings and cars in the background.The soundtrack really fits the movie and I love the shooting scene, which most of the time is just silence with only gunshot ringing in the theatre hall. The gunshot sounds realistic and not surprising coming from Michael Mann, the director of Heat (1995).All in all, Public Enemies is not for everyone and the 140 minutes long run does not help either. But if you want realistic drama and sweet shooting scene, plus great acting from a cast of brilliant actors and maybe a light history lesson, then this movie is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ultimately Underwhelming,"On one end of the spectrum, Public Enemies is embellished with great performances by its cast, especially Johnny Depp and Billy Crudup. It's also immensely mounted, with an extremely well designed 1930's era Chicago. The clothing, cars, weapons, and accents are all very accurate, as is to be expected with a big-budget period film. The narrative is also captivatingly woven, showing Dillinger's latter crime career, including his relationship with Billie Frechette, and eventual downfall including his eventual capture by the FBI.So, while the film certainly had an adequate cast, budget, and script at hand, in the end a lot of it felt underdeveloped. Dillinger and Billie's relationship could have been fleshed out a bit more, and there should have been a few more scenes between Dillinger and Purvis. Both of these were needed in order to create more emotional depth for these characters, particularly to rationalize the actions of both Dillinger and Purvis, in order to make them viable for the audience to care about. As it stands, Public Enemies wasn't lacking in depth for Dillinger, as the majority of the film focuses on him, but Purvis was seriously under-written. His character was under-developed to such an extent that Bale's performance appeared to flounder in comparison to Depp, as Purvis wasn't lended a personality that made the audience empathize with his intentions. Puvis's lack of character development also left much suspense out the picture, an aspect that worked to nerve-wracking results in Mann's Heat, as both DeNiro and Pacino were very well-developed, and possessed far more dialogue exchange than the solitary scene Depp and Bale share in this film. Other faults that hurt the film was the uneven editing and the use of digital cameras instead of traditional 35mm film. The editing for Public Enemies disrupted the flow of the film, as certain scenes were either extended too long or cut so suddenly that pacing felt awkward at some points. Moreover, the use of digital film was not a good choice in shooting a period film. A few scenes, the shootouts especially, are 'cheap' looking, meaning that the realistic shooting style made much of this big-budget film look like it was shot for television or as a documentary, removing much of the scale it would have had on 35mm.In the end, Public Enemies is a well-acted, stylishly mounted, enjoyable biopic that falters a little due to its underdeveloped characters, uneven editing, and awkward shooting style. But, in essence, its positives far outweigh its negatives, with some outstanding sequences, especially the climax, well-written dialogue, strong performances, and authentic art direction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An increasingly rare film for grown ups.,"I did like this film. None of those usual talk overs or flashbacks or lengthy explanations to try and ensure even the dumbest person could follow the film. I cannot even remember a date being flashed up on the screen. Just a straight action film, take it or leave it. The lack of character development was a great relief. I do not think it was required for Dillinger who was a very, very, very bad boy and would I think would be considered by many to possibly lack depth of character. From films and TV it would seem in America that many people are eager to find the real me and ensure they are true to their inner self. I suspect that Dillinger was not of that ilk. The history may not have have been accurate but everyone says how great Shakespeare was and his history was very flaky.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"I was promised a Michael Mann crime epic, what's this?","Rarely have I been so disappointed in a film. I mean, it was FINE, but this is what counts as a Michael Mann crime saga now? How did this get so amazingly generic in every way?There are not even an unusually large number of awesome scenes that make you see what could have been. It's rushed, over-packed, and therefore unfocused.For no good reason. It picks up rather out of the blue, so could have just done that halfway through what they filmed, then drop the entire mobster subplot, and let the rest breathe. MAYBE that would have saved it. Maybe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Blair Witch Gangsters,"This is what happens when a talented person mistakes an instrument for a tool.Cinéma vérité is back, at least for this director. Michael Mann began his career as a documentary filmmaker. He graduated to film with the excellent Thief with James Caan and then Manhunter. More recently, I think he peaked and maybe topped his other works with The Insider from 1999. In some ways, with Public Enemies, his sensibilities may have come full circle. Using the CineAlta after flirting with Viper film stream camera in Miami Vice and Collateral, allows Mann to film an inordinate amount of shots in more diverse conditions. He can do, hand-held shots to his hearts content, he can do many more setups and no longer does he need to stop to change film mags. He can shoot in any lighting conditions, or so he convinces himself. He is now shooting total documentary style. He smashes the camera right into the cheeks of his actors. Can't you feel it? It's ultra real man.The characters are all well done, though it is hard to tell sometimes with the camera bouncing around like a ping pong ball. Depp is good as Dillinger, while Bale fares a little on the weak side with Purvis. Out of all the characters, I would think Stephen Lang as Charles Winstead was the most authentic and interesting. He reminds me of my uncle Sonny, now passed but who was a bounty hunter and federal marshal. He was from the same area of north Texas/southern Oklahoma like the real Winstead. Lang's body language and manor are beyond authentic. He is dead on.The film takes us places we've already been and shows us things we've already seen a million times before. The close calls Dillinger makes through the film are bright spots, but not nearly enough in a story that seems all too familiar. But again, Michael Mann was really trying to give us a documentary.The problem is, Public Enemies is not a documentary. Though it was filmed in a faux- guerilla style with a digital hand-held half the time. There were no digital hand-held cameras in the 1930s, and the effect just pulls you right out of the movie. So again, this is no documentary, as there are actors and sets. There are props and special effects and computer generated blood. There are huge historical liberties taken with the script. And I have rarely seen any documentary where they barrage the viewer with 2 and a half hours of hand-held camera work. In fact, most documentary filmmakers are careful to show you things in a very direct and succinct way.The audio sounded like it was recorded in a shoebox. The film score appears as if there is another movie playing in the background. And aside from being aesthetically uninteresting, problematic with motion work, having inconsistent color tones, and images which over-sharpened in post processing, the Cinealta camera has given Michael Mann the ability to shoot anything he likes at the moment. And this is the biggest of all the film's problems. Shaking the camera is not representative of reality. All those old cars and fancy hats don't do the trick. The film does not feel realistic, it feels as if there is a real lack of vision. Limitations in any medium are what focuses your abilities to create. Adversity breeds creativity, what you are left with after this process, is called vision. The lack of restraints in shooting method have left this film feeling haphazard and unfocused.In short, I liked this film a lot more the last time I saw it when it was called Heat.Also based somewhat on real characters and events, Heat was an epic film. And though overlong, tells an all too familiar story of these bank robbers and their dance with fate. It is still a beautiful work and shows no lack of vision.Public Enemies is by no means a bad film. And technically since it was not shot on film, it can't be called one maybe. Like George Lucas and his techno toy Star Wars prequels, I think Public Enemies is a technical exercise from a person more interested in working with a new tool, rather than making music with a new instrument.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Peaks and valleys of brilliance and mediocrity,"Public Enemies was about what you'd expect from a Michael Mann film, some expert camera work, fantastic shootouts early in the film, and two top billed actors working on opposite ends of the law. The shootouts and action sequences are without any further comments excellent almost across the board.Unfortunately the movie really fails at figuring out what message it is trying to convey. Does the movie want us to sympathize with Dillinger or Purvis? What roll does J Edgar Hoover ultimately play in the film (played brilliantly by Billy Crudup who is fast becoming a go to actor)?Characters appear and disappear, and the movie seems to have to much to say and too little time to say it. Dialogue consists of characters that speak to each other in threats until someone caves. For this movie to rise to the next level it needed characters to stand out that the audience could latch onto besides Dillinger, Purvis, and Dillinger's love interest, Billie (who is somewhat bland). Instead the cast often seemed one dimensional, and consisting of either pure confidence or pure panic.A big disappointment in the film was Depp's performance which was empty. Since he is such an eccentric actor, you as an audience member expect more charisma or at least depth, which he lacked throughout.On the other end of the spectrum Purvis, played by Bale, was absolutely spot on brilliant, as a law enforcement official who doesn't need to say much, but when he does officers show him respect no matter what. Unfortunately, his entire performance, and perhaps the actions of Purvis historically, are undermined at the end of the film, which I will not spoil, but I will say a very poor directorial choice was made in one frame that left me scratching my head for hours.Final word: Public Enemies has a lot of good qualities such as great camera work and some really compelling action sequences, but it wants to be a combination of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Heat,"" and ""The Untouchables.""It isn't as good as Bonnie and Clyde, and Depp is no Beatty, The action sequences are in the same league as Heat at times, but not quite as good, and the film juggles too many characters and therefore loses the clarity and the ultimate message of the Untouchables. I wish Public Enemies had decided early on what type of film it wanted to be, because it all of the elements of a masterpiece, but ultimately fell short.2.5/4 stars. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A lot better than I expected.,"Whatever camera was used to shoot this film needs to be eliminated as an option for further film making. When I first saw the preview for this film I thought it looked very amateur due to the camera's inability to properly capture the motion of every one on screen. The movement on-screen sometimes seems blurry and closely resembles that of a camcorder, however the visual effects and the sound effects make up for it. The gunfire sounds great and it almost makes you sweat during the shootout scenes due to their intensity. Gunshot wounds and the way people's bodies react to getting shot look great as well, nothing too corny. The movie picks up quick and holds a lot of action until the last fourth of the film where it really slows down and not much really happens (shoot-out wise.)Overall this is defiantly a film worth seeing, I enjoyed it a lot and I strongly recommend it to anyone who liked The Assassination of Jesse James film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This Film is an Embarrassment,"The Feds try to take down notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during a booming crime wave in the 1930s.As a native of Wisconsin for 31 years, I was a bit proud to have this film shot in Columbus, Oshkosh and Manitowish. I have walked these streets, seen the sights. Heck, I've spent many hours at the coffee shop and comic book store in Oshkosh where a scene was done. But sadly, the finished product is a disappointment.The movie begins with too much ""shaky-cam"". It is not artistic and it is not effective. It is more annoying. And from there, it sort of devolves. Johnny Depp, as much as we may love him, is not John Dillinger. He neither looks like him, nor is he the right sort of personality. Christian Bale made an alright Purvis, though.I also found the movie to be an insult to the book. While it may be ""based on"" the book ""Public Enemies"" (which is an excellent book), it deviates so widely from it that this is more fiction than fact at times. The Little Bohemia incident is exaggerated, including a car chase that happened in a completely different time and place. Billie Frechette's role is enlarged, giving the film a romantic angle it should not have and creating this myth that she was beaten or was the subject of a secret message.The most egregious change is the scene with Dillinger walking into the so-called ""Dillinger Squad"" office. While it may well be true that he once entered the same building as the police department, he certainly never walked up to the police and started talking about baseball! The plastic surgery part of the film is removed, and Frank Nitti's role is increased. We also get much more Phil D'Andrea than probably necessary. Dillinger had minimal interaction with the Mafia. To try to inflate their part (without even adequately explaining who they are) is just a mistake, making the story convoluted and even more in error.If you like gunfights, this film is okay. But for a story, action, and a good Dillinger... I recommend seeing the movie ""Dillinger"", directed by John Milius. It is the supreme telling of this story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Well done telling of a historic crime figure. It entertains and holds interest with good support by blasts and blazing gunfire.,"Michael Mann who is one of the best film directors around as by evidenced with his crime genre films, really scores big here with his latest as ""Public Enemies"" is an informative and historical blasting and blazing gunfire thrill ride from start to finish. This film is blended with enough action and your traditional bad guy against good theme to make it a must see for any film fan and the acting and chemistry between the characters which features some of the best working in film today like Depp, Cotillard and Bale make it even much more of a treat.Set in the 1930's Midwest during the great depression the film starts off rather heavy as criminal John Dillinger(played wonderful by Johny Depp)burst out of an Indiana jail and right away becomes a dangerous and brazen bank robber of the 1930's depression era as one by one he's robbing banks and breaking out of jails. This sparks the justice system and federal law enforcement to create new methods and ways to fight crime as their jurisdiction will reach from state to state and a new most wanted list is created from the agency head J. Edgar Hoover. You guessed it the most wanted enemy number one is John Dillinger. Now enter some drama and conflict as the film was good to show during the bureau's early days not all was agreed on in legal methods and searches plus even arranging chase teams were debated. All this would come from hotshot and by the book special agent Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale)who would come to final terms with Dillinger in Chicago in 1934.As you see from bank robbery to bank robbery including jail escapes John Dillinger is cool, calm, calculated, and cocky the movie shows him as such an interesting character which is helped by Depp's elegant and effortlessly cut performance. As many of these gunfires scenes are so well liked for the way Mann shot them still thru it all this film celebrates the criminal as a pop culture phenomenon for the way it shows him in many scenes. Along the way as with any bad guy Dillinger meets a love interest really the wild card of the film that being a lady named Billie(Marion Cotillard who's sexy)and they romance along the chase path when not busy taking money yet it still leads to unexpected crazy love.Really this is a measured film that entertains in such a traditional way of the classic good guy against bad guy with plenty of support from blazing gunfire it's such a traditional feel good film. As the setting of the 1930's and it's actual taking of place helps. Still the way director Mann made this crime drama makes it an interesting watch not only is it a fun action drama to watch it's a good historical film that shows the early FBI roots and it profiles one of the first and earliest criminals the country ever had. You as a viewer really would cheer for the Dillinger character as it showcases and shows him in such a stylish way. Seriously ""Public Enemies"" is one of the better action crime dramas that's been made in a long time a real winner due to it's direction and for the fact that it showed a lot of historical information to many that didn't know. And most of all Johhnny floats and sails above everyone with his memorable and very good performance as a legendary American criminal figure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Not quite as hot as Heat, but its a warm addition to crime dramas","Entering this movie, I wasn't sure if I should expect what the trailers depicted, a riveting action yarn similar to Mann's Collateral, or a crime drama similar to Mann's other baby Heat. Turns out, there's a good chunk of both, it is definitely a Michael Mann film, and Definitely a Johnny Depp film.The opening to the first 45 or so minutes kept you intrigued at times but left out at times, there were times where you just can't tell which gangster is which (save Red Hamilton and Dillinger). The greatest flaw if this film is the lack of character depth, again, save the friendship between Dillinger and Red which had the depth needed to carry the film.There are shootouts abound, the film very closely and accurately (save one mishap, ready the trivia and you'll find out) portrays the Dillinger saga. However, again, I was disappointed in the chemistry between Dillinger and Billie and the romance that budded in real life but not so much in the film.I'm still confused in my total take of this film. It was very hyped up, considering the lead roles and director, but somewhere along the lines, it just fell flat in regards to its hype. Depp was outstanding in his role, and I quite honestly feel that there should be a Best Actor nod his way at next years Academy Awards. Billy Crudup definitely turned in a great performance as J Edgar Hoover as he continues to prove himself as a rising Hollywood star. Christian Bale (one of my favorite actors BTW) was a couple steps up from his performance in Terminator Salvation, but he just wasn't great, he was very monotone in all of his dialog (wheter Pervis was actually like that, everyone has a personality, and Bale's performance lacked any personality what-so-ever), and Cotillard wasn't effective as ""Dillinger's Girl"" either, not enough screen time with Depp, no back story, which was too bad because when she was on screen she turned on the drama, so maybe you can blame the script for excluding her.Great accurate story line (minus leaving out any build up around Dillinger's gang), great cinematography, great camera work, great action sequences, excellent depiction of the 1930's. Visually this film was a 9/10Great supporting cast but they all lacked any depth, little screen time for many rising stars of today, Johnny Depp, although not eccentric, turned in a charged Oscar Nominated worth performance which adds this film to his top performances, Mann definitely was behind the camera, and if you are a Michael Mann fan, you will enjoy the look and feel of the film, but may get antsy in your seat after 2 hours and wish there was more dramatic elements. performances 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Sombre drama and brutal violence,"Micheal Mann's Public Enemies is a film of sombre drama and explosive violence, adrenaline highs and sobering death; a battle of the righteous and the villainous. Combining his love for gangster films and that of period dramas, Mann lets his passion and skill do all the talking in this vividly photographed and exceptionally acted endeavor. Public Enemies is a wide open window into the final months of notorious bank robber John Dillinger, not an origin story, nor truly a biopic. Instead of attempting to cover every aspect of Dillinger's life, or deeply exploring his psychological motivations it is just about a man in the moment and through this attempt we learn, and connect about the famous outlaw anyways.More than a quote 'gangster film', Public Enemies is more a human drama that happens to feature gangsters. Then from these sequences of charm and humanity erupts brutal violence and often soulless murder. The gunfights are thunderous, the Tommy guns spouting deafening fire, followed by crushing impacts as the rounds strike everything in their wake. While an effective drama in many ways, the shootout sequences are arguable the most memorable, as never before have I felt like I actually needed to dive for cover in a movie theatre. Ground zero for the violence is the post-Capone, mob ruled Chicago and combining forces to stop the likes of Dillinger (Jonny Depp) and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) is the founder of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) and lawman Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). With robbers make a mockery of the justice system Hoover unleashes Purvis and his team to control the situation and quell the growing wave of violence. On the other side of the law however, Dillinger is planning his big score and his eventually retirement down south with his gal Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and the battle of wits and bullets between the righteous agent and the slick crook begins.Depp is very solid as Dillinger, oozing a cool swagger with playboy charms. He is cocky and while not truly in it for the money loves the celebrity and notoriety that goes along with his brazen robberies. Not the same can be said for Nelson who is like oil to Dillinger's icy coolness; trigger happy and greedy. Bale's character is one we have seen many times before, yet for the life of me I cannot figure out why I found Purvis to be so compelling and unique. Perhaps that is just more of Mann's charm shining through his characters. Fresh off her Oscar win Cotillard is lovely in a classic sense and her characters arc makes her all the more fiery and attractive. Aside from the leads, the supporting gangsters are recognizable but not big name stars and this works quite well. One of my favourite of such appearances is Steven Doriff who, if possible, looks even more menacing and greasy in a pinstripe suit and fedora.Public Enemies is long, but never seems plodding. A so-so opening act succeeds to compelling human drama which is further progressed by the heart pounding action. While true brilliance may have alluded Mann due to the odd pacing issue and really offering nothing masterfully unique, this flick is one that fully immerses you in the time and shows us of a time of when celebrity did not always mean Hollywood, and endings were not always storybook.Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Watch It Only For Johnny Depp,"A missed opportunity of sorts, Public Enemies begins strongly but it slows down in the middle and then is never able to catch up or reignite the level of interest that was present earlier in the movie. Made at the time when Johnny Depp was still one of Hollywood's finest & most bankable stars, it's a well-conceived project that was poorly executed in the end.Set during the Great Depression, the story of Public Enemies chronicles the last years of notorious bank robber John Dillinger & his associates, who flourished during a booming crime wave in 1930s Chicago. The plot covers their numerous heists while also focusing on Dillinger's own personal life as they are being pursued by an agent of FBI, which was still in its early years.Co-written & directed by Michael Mann (best known for Heat), Public Enemies recreates the early 1930 era in fine detail and employs the right props & setting to add more authenticity to its overall surroundings. The film opens on an impressive note but the process of juggling different subplots needed a bit more refinement in the script to provide a more compact structure to the narrative.Technical aspects are always on the plus side in a Michael Mann film and Public Enemies isn't any different. There is an incredible amount of detail in every image, which look very crisp by the way, but the pacing issues really hurt it down the line, and improper editing, which allows few moments to run longer than necessary, doesn't help either. The background score works fine but it sure isn't memorable.Coming to the acting department, Public Enemies features a marvellous ensemble in Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Lang & others, with Depp stealing the show. Outshining everyone with his compelling input & charismatic screen presence, Depp decimates all as John Dillinger and is nicely supported by Cotillard, Crudup & Lang while Bale contributes with a surprisingly wooden performance.On an overall scale, Public Enemies has flashes of brilliance but they are few & far in between. Its 140 minutes runtime feels longer than it should, and it falls pretty short of expectations when it's all over. Capturing its era in a detailed fashion, helmed by an esteemed auteur, and blessed with a stellar cast, it really is a shame because Public Enemies had the ingredients to finish as one of the better crime dramas but instead, it ends up being a forgettable example of its genre. Watch it only for Johnny Depp's outstanding showcase.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
too high expectations,"It's difficult to tell why such a good and well shot film like this leaves the wrong mouth taste... but this happens. When you look too many times at your watch, the usual reason is you are not immersed in the movie.And this is a pity. Specially when a superb Depp makes you believe you are looking at the very eyes of John Dillinger, when Bale's face is so deeply involved in his Purvis pose, and specially when production design and cinematography (a great job by Dante Spinotti) sometimes make you think you are watching a documentary instead of 'just' a movie.Maybe the problem is that 'sometimes'. Or maybe a script that doesn't tie the spectator to the cinema chair.A good film that could have been a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Less pseudo reality more myth & legend,"The cinematography it had an uneven look definitely due to the HD digital, the biggest noticeable contrast being the Little Bohemia shootout with the rest of the film. The hand held camera-work was way overdone, there was no reason for it in certain scenes particularity during the night club sequence where you had Billie & John tête-à-tête conversing, why, why must the picture be bouncing up and down? Why when Bille is captured do we get a munchkin POV looking up? What's the point of that? Now some complain about this effect making them nauseous for me it just makes me annoyed. I think minimal use in key segments could accent certain sequences but when its continuous it becomes redundant. It also robs us of the appreciation of the props and the art of set design, if everything is a blur or constantly bouncing about it makes set design an exercise in futility. What is the point of showing beautifully restored automobiles as a bouncing blur, at least the shot of the steam engine arriving at the station seemed not to be not hand held. The whole effect gives me a feeling of what I assume someone with HAADD would experience.There is a current trend in Hollywood in making certain Genres into, historical costume dramas, almost docudramas when dealing with the past, its the same in the Western Genre trying for too much reality takes away the magic of the Western iconography built up over the years. Westerns were about Myths and Legends same as the old Gangster Genre films. Too much reality is killing Westerns and you can see this to some extent in Public Enemies. In the schizophrenic Public Enemies we get a bit more detail and emphasis on accuracy in some areas and then wild fabrications in others but what is lacking in this film is the small touches that give some character development to Dillinger's gang they seemed to all blend in to a blur and the same likewise could be said of the FBI team. Public Enemies spent a bit more time with the Billie-John relationship at the expense of the ""Public Enemies"", but I somehow get the feeling that that(Billie-John) was all contrived Hollywood BS anyway.The little extra vignettes that the 1973 Milius' Dillinger had gave a bit of character development to the legend of Dillinger's gang, the gumball machine, Dillinger's visits to his family, Dillinger's sister, the bar scene, Dillinger splitting the money from the robbery that he did at his jail escape with the mechanic the warden and Reese, Purvis' vow of smoking his gift cigars from his shot down buddy ""over the dead bodies of every one"" of the public enemies gave Dillinger that mythic Gangster Film cachet. Were any of these historical, possibly, but others particularly Purvis was wildly inaccurate. But a larger than life Dillinger needed a larger than life Purvis. In Public enemies neither Dillinger nor Purvis really reaches Iconic status. It also helped that the character actors in Milius' Dillinger were well enough known and in enough prior films to be distinguishable from one another and add gravitas to their roles. When the legend becomes fact film the legend was Milius's MO.Now let us examine how the two films handled the Little Bohemia Shootout. In Dillinger the FBI arrive just at dawn and the shootout commences when three hapless innocents walk out of the lodge all the action is in the light. In Public Enemies Mann stages the shootout at night the action being ignited by three men leaving the lodge in a car.Now I'll digress for a moment, let me tell you a little parable, there once was a survey leveling crew on a survey project that was working on the edge of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area in Montana. They were running a level circuit on a construction P-line and decided to try and finish the three mile project before sunset and the ensuing darkness. In short they didn't make it, finding themselves about 2.5 miles from the existing road on a steep fir pine and spruce covered hillside, and had to continue walking out carrying their equipment. When it got dark it got DARK under the tree cover, pitch black, as if you were in a closet. Besides obviously trees everywhere there was also blow down, underbrush etc., etc., to negotiate around and through. They could not walk normally they had to feel ahead with their feet for any obstacles in their way at the pace of a crawl. Every once in a while they would break into a natural clearing and a sliver of moon lit it up enough so that you could see but as soon as the hit the tree line on the other side again in was back into the abyss.There is no F-ing way in Public Enemies that anybody is going to be running around in the frickin dark through the woods, its totally ridiculous you would be slamming into trees tripping over logs etc., etc. Its just not believable, but the muzzle flashes of the Tommy guns looked nice, lol. Apparently that is what he was going for.The film overall was entertaining but it could have been way more than it is, it needed a tad more myth and less reality. 6.5-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good film about real life mobster John Dillinger,"I saw Public Enemies today.I was interested in seeing it as I am a fan of mafia films.Not just ones set during the 1930's, but all of them.Michael Mann is also usually a good director as well.I knew little about John Dillinger so I do not know how historically accurate this film is.The performances were great.Johnny Depp played a good role as mobster John Dillinger and Christian Bale's acting was great as well.The plot involves the police trying to find and arrest John Dillinger, who escaped from jail and commits a series of bank robberies, while falling in love with this one girl.The movie is not boring, there is a good mix of action as well as plot.It's a bit long(2 hrs 20 min), but not as long as other gangster films such as ""The Godfather"".My only problem with the film was, at times the camera was shaky and made the film look a bit cheap.I don't know if Mann intended to do this.It wasn't a big deal for me, but some people may not like it.If you like crime/drama's, it's definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"It was okay, but long","John Dillinger (Depp) is robbing banks and the Feds have a hard time stopping himI don't know why this movie wasn't called Public Enemy No 1 as it was all about Dillinger. Yes, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd were mentioned but this was all about Dillinger who was called Public Enemy No 1 by the Feds. This movie also showed the beginnings of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover.It was okay. The best parts were when Dillinger spoke and we wished he had more dialogue. We hung on every word and when he was courting his girl, Billie (Cotillard) we heard some good dialogue. The entire cast performed well.The story didn't explain Frank Nitti's involvement although his character was in a couple scenes that sounded important but were vague, so we never knew anything.What was missing that could have made this a better movie? Two things. First, his men didn't talk about him in glowing terms among themselves or to others. That would have enhanced the legend.And, second, if we had seen Dillinger pretend he was a bank alarm systems salesman while casing out some banks, that would have helped as well.Not to glorify Dillinger, but the general feeling among the people of the United States, at that time, was that he was getting back at the banks, which they hated. Remember everyone was just coming out of a depression and it was generally felt the bankers caused it. We are talking 1933. So if Dillinger robbed a bank, the bankers deserved it. A breakfast table conversation in awe of Dillinger would have been correct and funny, in a way.Would those two things have made the movie even longer? No. All they would have had to do was to cut down on some of the shootings. That big shooting scene in the woods when the Feds thought they had Dillinger went on for too long, the scenes were were too dark and no one could tell who was shooting at anyone. It took a scene later on when Dillinger was caring for his wounds that we knew he had gottten away.One of these days the powers that be will realize that Johnny Depp is so much like a Brando in that he becomes the role he is playing. He is that good.But, on the whole, the movie was okay. Could have used more humor too.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Some GDIs were only heard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Bye, Bye Blackbird","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on Bryan Burrough's book, ""Heat"" director surprisingly takes a straight-on approach to the story of Public Enemy Number One, John Dillinger. There is none of Mann's usual MTV approach, though some of the texture and look of the film seemed inconsistent and even distracting.Personally I appreciate the mostly no-frills method here as Johnny Depp brings Dillinger to life as a serious, dangerous man when he's working, and a bit of a charmer when dealing with the press or the ladies. The sets, costumes, accents and cast are all spot on. I especially enjoyed the look and feel of the train station and the Biograph Theatre.If anything, too many characters are thrown at us, but the cast is so strong, that even that is no real negative. Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd, Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette and Stephen Lang as Agent Winsted all add a nice touch. And don't miss Diana Krall (Mrs. Elvis Costello) as a lounge singer. Christian Bale actually plays Melvin Purvis close to the vest and some of the best stuff is thrown down by Billy Crudup in a wonderful spin on the ambitious J Edgar Hoover. He is excellent and creepy.Depp and Cotillard have some strong scenes together, but I actually thought the gun fights were a bit over done and unrealistic - though efforts were taken to make it seem very real. Just a slight disconnect there for me.Overall a pretty decent and straightforward bio-pic with minimal Hollywood fluff. Dillinger's story is plenty strong enough without the dramatic license we usually get. Also loved the soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies A Decent Action Crime Drama,"Public Enemies is a decent action crime drama with exceptional performances by it's two leads. Writer/Director Michael Mann is admirable in bring this movie of notorious bank robber John Dillinger but some flaws with character development and the pacing weighed it down. I thought the good outweighed the bad though with this one. Johnny Depp is great as always playing the charismatic Dillinger who became public enemy number one in the 1930'S Chicago. Christian Bale is equally impressive as determined FBI Agent Melvin Purvis the man whose assigned to track Dillinger down. Depp and Bale only have a few scenes with each other but they both are very believable as their characters. Well done. Marion Collitard as Dillingers love Billie Frechette, Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hover, Stephen Lang as Charles Winstead, and Giovanni Ribisi as Alvin Karpis are also good in their limited screen time but lack development. Their characters and others including Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd who makes a brief cameo aren't really developed which weighed the movie down a bit because most of the focus is on Depp and Bale. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing but you don't really get to know many of the characters that well except for them. The pacing of the film was a little slow at times with a running time of 140 minutes but overall I thought it was a decent. If you like gangster movies than chances are you'll enjoy this one. Public Enemies has action and drama with solid performances by Johnny Depp and Christian Bale who make this film worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A first class shoot 'em up!,"Someone once said that Johnny Depp never met a weird part he didn't like. He has done so well at playing oddballs like Edward Scissorhands, the cross dressing director Ed Wood and even Willie Wonka. Its so nice to know that he can play a normal part well as he sure does in this film. Michael Mann is one of the most brilliant directors of our time, he has directed such classics as Thief, Manhunter and Heat. He triumphs once again in this brilliant film that runs circles around any other shoot em up. It is 1934 and the FBI declares war on public enemy #1 John Dillinger. They pointed out in the ""goofs"" section of the IMDb entry on this film that Mann carelessly made many errors with history. For example, the movie opens with Pretty Boy Floyd being killed by FBI agents. Floyd actually wasn't killed until several months after Dillinger (he took Dillinger's place as Public Enemy #1). They have Baby Face Nelson doing a Jimmy Cagney impression from Angels With Dirty Faces which wasn't made until 1938! However, this is such a fine film these are just minor quibbles. Depp gives a fine performance and makes John D. out as a lovable rogue. Yes he is a bank robber, but you sort of root for him. For example, there's a scene where he tells a bank customer during a robbery not to give him his money that he just wants the banks and another where he is tenderly polite to a lady he took hostage. I wouldn't be surprised if Depp gets an Oscar nod for his work. I hope Mann gets one as best director for it is long overdue. The only trouble I have with this film is Christian Bail as Melvin Purvis. I wanted Purvis to be played just as charismatically as they played Dillinger. After all your supposed to be rooting for him. Simply put, Depp acts circles around Bail. This man is just so bland and boring its almost as if he is sleepwalking thru his part.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mann Delivers a Historical Story,"John Dillinger, at one time one of the FBI's Most Wanted and Public Enemy #1. In the era of Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie And Clyde and even Al Capone, Dillinger was one of the most flamboyant. A bank robber but also one who was sympathetic to the little man.The originality of the film plays a semi poor grasp at historical timing, and does get a few things wrong. strong script with some shining moments by Depp as Dillinger. Depp brings that charisma, swagger and finesse to how collected Dillinger was. The accuracy of the tommy guns and the vehicles I thought was spot on. Christian Bale I found to be rather dull as Melvin Pervis. At some points the character drove the logic of the FBI but mostly it became a vendetta.There were a few points in the fil that were choppy in editing, cinematography was very well done. Filmed in parts of Chicago and even in Wisconsin. If you have a vast knowledge of history and enjoy gangster films then this will fill your viewing pleasure. I give this a simple but worth 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Depp Makes This Movie More Than Average,"I recently called Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' a missed opportunity, having only seen it once, (in the cinema when it was released) I decided to revisit it. And my feelings have not changed much, it's better than I remembered, but not by much.Back when this was made Depp was still one of my top 10 actors, but sadly there is something missing in his work since early to mid 00's (with the exception of Sweeney Todd) as he seems to be lost in big budget sequels to the 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' and underwhelming movies. Whilst this is his best movie since Sweeney Todd, it still falls flat. Then scene between him and Bale in the prison should have radiated chemistry (see the Sly Stallone and Mel Gibson scene in the van in Expendables 3 as an example of how it should be done.) but there is nothing there. Just two actors saying the words. Depp seems very into his role, and is the best thing in the movie, effectively carrying it on his own.Giovani Ribsi, Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Carey Mulligan offer Stellar support and Casey Siemaszko (who I've always been a fan of, and deem to be an under rated actor) is here too as is Al Capone from TV's 'Boardwalk Empire' actor Stephen Graham as ""Baby Face"" Nelson. Leelee Sobieski brightens the picture with a small role late on. She is a talented actress, that I find very attractive.But for me Adam Mucci as Agent Harold Reinecke is the stand out supporting performer as he is one of those actors who makes you hate his character.I think the problem with this movie is Mann's direction and Bale. Bale who is a talented actor is merely going through the motions and offers nothing of note here. As for Mann he directed 'Heat' which I loved, and hoped for something similar here.All in all Depp carries this movie above the average line.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Bye bye blackbird,"I've seen it yesterday (4th July) on the 'Wilkinson American Movie Day' in Antwerp, Belgium.It was fun to see Johnny Depp (Dillinger) act along Christian Bale (Purvis). Dillinger is praised for being public enemy nr.1 and being an anti-hero. Agent Purvis get's the opportunity to make career in an upcoming FBI. It's also a movie about unconditional friendship (dietrich, Red, etc.) and love (Billie Frechette).The story could have been written today because of the recession and the people being angry at the banks in the 1930's. Hopefully nobody get's the idea to be the next John Dillinger.Great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good film.,"PUBLIC ENEMIES.I enjoyed it.I have been wanting to see this for a while now. I am a Johnny Depp fan and a Christian Bale fan.The movie is about a notorious bank robber named John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp. There are only 2 things he loves, his girlfriend Billie, and robbing banks. Christian Bale plays an FBI agent who is determined to catch Dillinger.The movie has some really good action scenes in it. I love the bank robberies and I also love the scenes where he tries to escape from prison. This movie is set in the 30s and has that old fashioned feel to it.It is not Johnny Depps best film in my opinion, i prefer the ones where he is made up not to look like himself... but it does make a nice change to actually see his face on the screen.I thought Christian Bale could have been in it more. He does not have anywhere as much screen time as I had hoped. Also, he is speaking in a strong accent and I struggled to understand some of the lines he said. But this does not ruin the movie too much.I remember thinking while watching Public Enemies how in a small way it has a similarity to Natural Born Killers. Mickey & Malory Knox were murderers on the run but the general public grew to love them anyway and were cheering for them to escape the police. The same thing happens here... Dillinger was robbing banks and shooting his gun all over town, but he was loved by most of the public. They protected him.I give this film a 7 out of 10.Great movie, but like all bio pics, how much of it is true?For more of my reviews please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?fref=ts",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This film has become a favourite,This film grows on me more and more. Depp is mesmerising as Dillinger and having watched the doc on the real person I am in even more awe of how well Depp captured all his nuances in the film. I don't think people appreciate how much of Dillinger Depp captured playing him and this just makes it more enjoyable to watch. He is surrounded by a fantastic cast that compliments. The only slight annoyance is sometimes the camera work is tooo busy with unnecessary movement.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Soulless,"Chicago, thirties of the last century. John Dillinger and the crew rob banks and with high-speed cars flee across state borders, escaping the police. The FBI is in its infancy and Hoover wants to build a reputation by catching Dillinger, a state enemy number one. Story is realistic, almost like documentary. Action scenes are well shot and from a technical standpoint film has no flaws. But, although it definitely isn't boring, it failed to pull me in. I was not tied to the characters, I wasn't rooting for either side, nor did I care about their fates. Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Jason Clarke, Stephen Graham and many other big names guarantee that trouble certainly doesn't lie in acting, but screenplay didn't left room for characterization. Characters are one-dimensional. Criminal is just a criminal, cop is just a cop, there's no background stories, no diverting from main course of the movie, no inner struggles, no emotions or depth. Just black and white and straight forward, like TV news. Though, here and there they inserted a couple of emotional moments, I guess in attempt to breathe some soul into the movie, but they only achieved needless pathetic that simply doesn't fit with the rest of it. Technically excellent film, but not essentially powerful.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
We need to talk about Sound Mixing,"I'm only going to talk about one thing, and that's the sound design. The mix is so awful, so inconsistent and distracting that I had to look it up. I thought I was doing something wrong, but it turns out that director Michael Mann micromanaged the sound mix, and it really shows. Sound effects are always way too loud, the dialogue is usually too low, and every single layer seems to change volume at will, and if you want to hear any of the dialogue without being deafened by the gunfire, you better keep your hand on that volume button at all times. Just awful.The rest if the movie's good. Not great, but decent.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Subpar,"Public Enemies was everything I thought that it would be, Johnny Depp in an action movie. However it was not everything that I really wanted it to be. It felt to me like the film was rushed, as if Michael Mann was falling behind schedule and assigned a hand-held shot for everything that hadn't been filmed yet. The audio was also pretty sketchy, which took away from the experience. These elements along with the HD Video made it feel like I was watching a student film at times. In a way the HD Video adds to the fact that the story being shown is true, seeing as the film's look doesn't have that Hollywood feel to it, though I feel that its not as appealing when movies don't have that professional touch to it.As for the screenplay, I was also a bit disappointed. It felt like the only goal was to make Dillinger look like a badass, and just forget about the rest of the character. This is proved when Dillinger says, ""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you. What else you need to know?"" I feel that there would be more than that to the real John Dillinger, but maybe I'm wrong.It might sound contradicting to what I've just said, but overall I enjoyed Public Enemies. It was a great film with a great cast, and it kept me interested for the majority of the film. Though long, I didn't ""feel"" the 2.5 hours like I did during movies such as Transformers 2 and Benjamin Button. It moves along beautifully, not spending much time dragging anything on for longer than it should. Even if you already know what ends up happening to Dillinger, seeing the movie is definitely worth it. Visually the film is amazing, particularly a shoot out scene which stands high above the rest of the film. And Johnny Depp kicks some ass, reason enough to go see it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Less ''Heat'', more ''Warmth''","This review originally appeared at www.a-mighty-fine-blog.blogspot.com Public Enemies was never meant to be a film. It was originally set to be made at HBO as a mini-series, and if my viewing of it told me nothing else, it's that television would have been a much more natural fit for the story of John Dillinger's last year, the woman he loved and the man who tried to catch him. It is very episodic in nature, with no real through-line to connect them other than, obviously, Dillinger himself. There is just so much that could be done with this story that, even at two hour, twenty minutes, the film winds up feeling truncated.To his credit, Michael Mann does try to cover a lot of ground in what time he has; we get a glimpse into the birthing pains of the FBI, the megalomania of J. Edgar Hoover (played with relish by Billy Crudup, sporting the broadest of 1930s announcer voices) and the creation of a surveillance society. These fascinating ideas, though, are ultimately only mentioned in passing and are never explored. Similarly, there is no sense of the economic turmoil that America was going through at the time, and therefore little context for why Dillinger would be consider such a folk hero. And it would have been perfectly possible to convey this without interrupting the story or disrupting the drama; Bonnie and Clyde did it in 1967.The greatest victim of the film's attempts to encompass so much in too disparate a manner is the character of Melvin Purvis, played ably by Christian Bale. I say 'ably' and this should not be considered a slight against Bale; he's not fantastic because the part he has been given is not fantastic. Purvis could be an obsessive trying to get his man, or a conflicted good 'ol boy struggling to contend with his more violent colleagues, but there is so little scope for his development in the film that he winds up being a two-dimensional good cop.Contrasted with Purvis is Dillinger, who is given ample room to play around in. In his depiction of Dillinger, Johnny Depp, as well as Michael Mann and his co-writers, Ann Biderman and Ronan Bennett, do something very interesting. Instead of romanticising and mythologising Dillinger, the film-makers choose to portray him as a cold, efficient and ultimately bad man. Sure, he's charming and has a certain amount of wit to him, but the film suggests that this was all for the cameras and the public, that Dillinger was putting on an act in order to curry public favour. It's there in his assertion that he cares what the public thinks of him, in his declarations that he's ''here for the bank's money'', not that of its customers (even though it's all the same money) and in his decision to visit the office of the very people trying to catch him.Even the look of the film serves to underline this un-romantic view of Dillinger. Rather than shoot the film in a nostalgic way, Mann shoots the film in an incredibly modern style, using digital cameras and an almost entirely hand-held technique, making for a nice contrast between the period trappings and the urgency of this technique. The film has a verite feel to it, one which is exemplified by its fast and loose action sequences. I was particularly impressed by the way in which bullets were used in the film. The lack of music in most of the shoot outs made each of the impacts sound especially loud and the sound design for each impact made them feel much more powerful and intimate than in most films. In your average film, bullets ping; in Public Enemies, they bang, producing a much more visceral experience.The only flaw in this aesthetic is the way in which the film portrays Dillinger's relationship with Billie Frechette (the luminous Marion Cotillard). Their relationship is overly sentimental and is at odds with the tone of the rest of the film, which is resolutely hard-edged in its notions of Dillinger and what he represented. I'm not saying that this element of the film is sub-par, it does make for a nice change from the bank heists, shoot outs and prison escapes that make up much of the film, just that it was an element that stood out from the rest of the film.Public Enemies is an impressive feat in terms of what you can do with digital film-making and as an example of what can be done with period films to make them feel fresh and relevant, but it's too compressed in its ideas and this causes the whole to suffer. Add four hours, divide it into six parts and it could have been something really special. As it is, it's an above average gangster film, but with the pedigree of those involved it should have been so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Fun action, thrown together romance","The action in this film is very well done, reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with angles of shots that make you feel at times like you are seeing what someone participating in the shootouts would see.The romance seemed a little more thrown together than everything else, and having just read another reviewer's comments that that may not have been as factual as the rest of the movie's content, I find that fairly believable.The movie doesn't disappoint for the most part though, and if all or even most of what occurs in the film is based on true events, Dillinger was indeed a very likable(sp) guy, in a ""i steal money and kill people, then act nonchalantly about it"" kinda way.The only problems this film had were some character dialogue and/or choices being stupid or bad, and it was kinda lengthy but still managed to be enjoyable (and possibly educational...or is that a con?) for the most part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Strangely underwhelming,"Maybe this movie suffers from comparisons with THE HURT LOCKER which I had seen 2 days earlier, but I found this highly anticipated movie static & unmoving.How could you go wrong with putting down $7.50 seeing Michael Mann direct a period gangster piece with Johnny Depp & Christian Bale going toe to toe? (By unable to stop the constant urge to compare it to a non-stop intense movie about an Army bomb squad in Iraq?) Because this movie like his last one, Miami VICE, never really gets going. It has fine performances: Depp as Dillinger, Cotillard as his dame & Bale as G-Man Melvin Purvis are all very good. However my favorite performance was Billy Crudup who gives ""his"" J. Edgar Hoover a wicked effeminate flair. (Forgive me --or not-- for not enjoying Hoover played as bit of a poofter.)Mann is not a grab you by the throat artist (like Paul Greengrass or, evidently, Kathryn Bigelow). His best films (THIEF, THE INSIDER, HEAT, COLLATERAL) seduce you. This one doesn't although it tries very hard.Like all Mann movies, PUBLIC ENEMIES, is put together with a great deal of care, informed with great intelligence (that even permeated his pulp masterpiece COLLATERAL) & has atmosphere to burn. It just doesn't quite come together as anything more than occasionally involving. Also the digital photography ruined some shots (it worked in COLLATERAL, but it didn't work in ...VICE & it doesn't work here).Mann has hit grand slams before, but this movie results in a ground rule double.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Good,"I think people are being a little too hard on this movie. For example, they say the camera was bad. The thing people dont understand is that it doesnt mean the cinematography is bad if the camera is shaky. In fact, I preferred the way they handled the camera in this movie rather than in most mainstream movies where its too ""perfect"". Now, contrarily to what most people say, I think the characters were fine. A character doesnt always need a flashy personality so I think the character of Dillinger was really fine. Now, there is one scene near the end that I dont really bite into but its still fine in my opinion. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the fact that it doesnt try to shoot for the moon either. Whenever a movie tries so hard for things and fails, its way worst than movie that actually delivers on what it ""promises"". So overall I think this is a very descent film and its a fun watch also.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Tragedy of John Dillinger,"Public Enemies, the latest film from director Michael Mann, is a film that is entertaining, but comes short of true greatness.The film chronicles the adventures of bank robber John Dillinger in 1933. Dillinger is portrayed here by Johnny Depp with the right amount of wit and charm. As a matter of fact all of the actors in the film turn in credible performances. Though what makes this film worth seeing is for the thrills. The action in the film is exhilarating and fast paced, keeping you on the edge of your seat. Mann handles the action sequences extremely well. Only problem with the action is that the film was filmed entirely with hand-held cameras, giving it this naturalistic feel that I am not usually a big fan of; I tend to prefer the more glossy-styled film-making.My biggest gripe with the film though comes with the fact that none of the characters truly have any depth to them. There are times where it looks like Mann is going to take the time and explore who the characters truly are, but he just introduces it subtly and then moves on without really harping much on it. Still this doesn't really affect the film that much, I was just expecting something a little bit more from someone of the caliber of Mann.Overall I enjoyed Public Enemies. It was a tense, action packed thrill ride that was in the end quite good, but just short of genuine greatness.I give Public Enemies a good 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A mostly dull TV docudrama with big name stars and nothing more,"(54%) The big question here is why isn't this movie better than it actually is? Because with Depp, Bale, and Mann combined this should be a great movie, but as a matter of opinion it hardly makes it to the levels of a good movie, which is quite a disappointment in my books. Bale is hardly ever on screen, and when he is there isn't anything for him to do, even Depp is fed crumbs from a script that ambles along in circles making the ruthless Dillinger seem almost dull. The bank robbery and prison break scenes are almost identical to each other, and are quite poor compared to the ones in the fantastic ""Heat"", as the direction is slack and more than a little distracting from the far from gripping events on-screen. Worst of all though is the uncanny feel that much of the movie has to a TV docudrama. I almost expected a staged interview to pop up between scenes and a talk about 1930's organised crime to happen. So the performances are muted from the biggest stars of the production, the direction is below par for even an average film maker, and the script sucks the life from a criminal that shook America. On a plus side the scene when Dillinger enters the police headquarters and has a look round is a highlight and is certainly the best part of the whole movie. But this is still a reasonably big misfire and a let-down from a promising looking flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Public Enemies"" is inappropriately shot, directed, and edited","""Public Enemies"" explores the antics of the 1930's bank robber John Dillinger. Although set during the 1930's Mann chooses to shoot the film in primarily HD and with what appears to be mostly zoom lenses. The fishbowl like hyper-clean HD look and video like color timing of the film is inappropriate and off-putting. Furthermore the choice of the Wide-Angled Zoom lens (used mostly in documentaries) distorts the picture (look for ugly distorted hands in the foreground of the frame when Dillinger dances with his ""girl"" in the first act of the film) and seems student film like. The picture edit lacks a consistent timing and appears rushed and the sound editorial is full of silent holes for no main stream or art house reason that I can think of. It appears that HD, or the way Mann uses and color times HD in this particular film, was not the way to go for a 1930's gangster film. 35mm or perhaps even Super 16mm with some prime lenses may have worked out better for Mann's ""Public Enemies"". Fincher's DP in ""Benjamin Button"" was able to appropriately capture beautiful HD images for him but Mann's camera department seems, quite simply, ""off"", in this film. Why some critics call ""Public Enemies"" a work of art is befuddling to me. The direction of the film is poor as well and lacks a consistent style and a poor revelation of information. Mann's ""Heat"", ""Insider"" and ""Ali"" all were more beautifully shot, edited, and directed than ""Public Enemies"". Even the usually handsome Depp looks old and tired because of the nature of the optics and HD acquisition. Sitting in the theater I saw at least 10 people walk out after about 45 min. into the film and the rest appeared bored and confused.

Blurry And Dark,"Chicago's Biograph Theater and immediate surroundings in the film's final fifteen minutes look authentically 1930s. And the accompanying sense of impending climax captures a growing drama. The ending of ""Public Enemies"" thus makes for absorbing viewing, helped along by the realization that these events actually happened.That said, I find little of interest in this mostly factual account of public enemy number one, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), and attempts by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to catch him, under the watchful eye of J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup). Though the period-piece sets and era music are fine, the film suffers from two big flaws.First, despite the focus on Dillinger, the script overwhelms the audience with too many background characters, all of whom seem nondescript and confusingly intrusive. I counted 43 characters significant enough to earn a ""biography"". The total list of characters exceeds a hundred. The film purports to be a biography of ""public enemies"", namely Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, and their sidekicks. But all these added people blur the story, and render a very impersonal account.Second, the film's lighting trends dark, and as unhelpful as the script. Faces merge together. There's lots of hubbub and ""action"". I can barely remember any of it, apart from those final fifteen minutes, and one other segment wherein Dillinger walks nonchalantly into a police station room devoted to his capture. But, in general, the lighting compounds the confusion with regard to characters and plot.Overall performances trend dull and wooden. Depp is a terrific actor. But he's dull here. Christian Bale gives as wooden a performance as I have ever seen. Other actors leave little or no impression.Sound effects are good, especially the sounds of gunfire.One gets the impression that the film's director aimed for a particular style of storytelling. If so, the results don't work, at least for me. There are many good true-life gangster films out there. ""Public Enemies"" isn't one of them.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great movie from narrative to directing to the music,"This was a great film with accurate depiction of John dillinger and 30s era, from directing to the music to the amazing job from everyone that acted and put together this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Low-key, but engaging...mostly","Considering the track record of director Michael Mann when it comes to making crime dramas (Collateral, The Insider, Heat), I found myself surprised by the direction he took with Public Enemies. Instead of a nail-biting suspense movie set in the 1930s, I found myself watching a fairly low-key drama about the fall of one of America's most notorious criminals.Audiences who come to watch Public Enemies expecting it to be a swashbuckling crime film will likely leave the theater disappointed. Some critics and film fans have faulted Mann for not putting enough adrenaline into this movie, and truth be told, at times his insistence on keeping this movie low-key as a whole does get a bit tiresome. Because of the film's overall lack of suspense, it finds itself relying heavily on the performances of its actors to keep audiences engaged. And for a crime drama without much suspense, that is asking a lot. Fortunately, the cast of the film is generally up to the task.In terms of the performances in the movie, Johnny Depp is the standout, hands down. Film fans who know Depp only as Captain Jack Sparrow likely will be shocked by his understated and effective performance in this movie, which is a refreshing change-up for him, given his recent track record of films. Depp's best scene in this film, in which his John Dillinger tries to woo Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) at her job with a smörgåsbord of tough talk, is a perfect testament to why practically every girl alive is currently infatuated with him. Similarly, Christian Bale plays a role against type, portraying FBI agent Melvin Purvis, a promising agent who finds himself somewhat in over his head after he is assigned by the fledgling Bureau to track Dillinger down. His performance is not quite as effective as Depp's, but nevertheless is a welcome change of pace for him after he mailed it in as John Connor in his last film (Terminator Salvation). Cotillard does a solid if unspectacular job as Frechette, while Billy Crudup's J. Edgar Hoover is entertaining but slightly more cartoony than it should have been.Mann's depiction of the 1930s Midwest, oddly enough, lacks much visual evidence of the Great Depression, and the film as a whole would have been better (especially considering the film's overall lack of suspense throughout) had he sacrificed some of the film's more melodramatic moments in order to give the audience a clearer idea of just how important the Dillinger case was in modernizing the way crime is fought in America, as well as how much Dillinger himself captured the imagination of Americans as a then-modern-day Jesse James. Nevertheless, Mann was clearly valuing substance over style while making this movie. For example, the violence in this film is played out in a fashion that stresses realism over showiness, even when the intensity of it is dialed up a bit, which is a nice change of pace from the stylized insanity of the violence found in many other crime flicks.Though far from being a dramatic masterpiece, I found Public Enemies to be a welcome breather from much of what has been passing as entertainment in movie theaters these days.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good film. Great Actors.,"Public Enemies is a good film. My only complaint is that the film is way too long. If the film was cut down to about 2 hrs it would have been perfect. Just when I thought the film was over it kept going. Some of the scenes were to dark. I couldn't tell what was going on. Johnny Depp was excellent in the film. It seems that whatever movie Johnny Depp is in, good or bad, he is always good in it. Another surprise was the performance of Billy Crudup. I just wish he got more parts in films. More lead roles. He's a terrific actor. Christian Bale did a much better job in this film then Terminator Salvation. At least he didn't mumble his way through this film and I could understand his dialogue.

Slick Gangster Flick,"Johnny Depp delivers another mysteriously effective performance as gangster John Dillinger. The script sticks close to the actual events in Dillinger's life and in some ways tries to make him a heroic figure, but with the FBI relentlessly pursuing ""public enemy #1""not for his murderous ways but because he perfected the art of both robbing banks and breaking out of prison it is easy to see him as a sympathetic character. Although the film does not portray law enforcement as totally idiotic, it does make the FBI seem to use crime-fighting as a distraction from the poverty and brutality that drove men like Dillinger to it. However, in an effort to be even-handed, the film does not delve too deeply into the motivations of the detectives who pursued him nor does it investigate the mindset of Dillinger himself. The Chicago settings are masterfully re-created. Nevertheless, and this is an above par gangster movie that even contains references to James Cagney, whose film ""The Public Enemy"" remains the standard against which all gangster movies are measured.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mann restores my faith.,"It was really weird, I walked out of the cinema feeling something I hadn't felt for ages, there was no crushing disappointment or bitter hatred, there was just 'yes I've just witnessed a great film'. After a slew of bad summer movies at last one that made me believe in cinema again. Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' is a classic. Think 'Heat' meets 'The Untouchables' it's a brilliant gangster film about John Dillinger, played expertly by Johnny Depp, America's public enemy number one. Straight away we launched into a prison break in 1933 and it's the devil in the details that makes the viewer really believe it is 1933, the costumes, the cars, the settings, the guns, and it's perfect. Depp plays Dillinger just right and even Christian Bale as his G-man nemesis is the best he's been since 'The Machinist'. Shot in typical Mann style we follow Dillinger from small time crook to big time celebrity as he lives fast, for the moment, on the edge, always outwitting J.Edgar Hoover's crack crime force. The pacing, as always, means that the over two hours doesn't feel like it, the score a mixture of orchestral, blues and jazz fits the mood perfectly. There's romance, drama, action and the shoot outs, no one does a shoot out like Michael Mann its as if every bullet counts, each one a punch, you can hear the bullet leave the gun and arrive at its destination, its gun play choreography at its best. Marion Cotillard fresh from her Oscar winning portrayal of Edith Piaf is great as Dillinger's love interest and despite very little screen time Billy Crudup is amazing as the callous and determined Hoover. All in all this is what you want from a film, engaging, thought provoking, amazing attention to detail, multi-layered, a solid story and expert direction. They don't make them like this anymore, but thankfully one person still does.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Nutshell Review: Public Enemies,"It looks like Michael Mann just can't get enough of playing cops and robbers, and with previous efforts from Heat to Miami Vice, he just about goes to show that he can weave some exciting scenes of pursuit, testosterone charged shoot em ups, and parallels between those on opposite sides of the law. What more, he has the services of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale as his leading men, set in a time during the Great Depression where desperate men turn to desperate measures to survive.Mann doesn't waste time and puts you smack in the middle of the story, introducing you to the John Dillinger (Depp) character through a very daring prison break. Not his of course, but orchestrated by him to free his merry men, to form his band of brothers to rob banks with. Unfortunately though, the bank robberies that made it to the final cut wasn't as sexy as those in the trailer, and doesn't offer you too much techniques or tactics into breaking into those bank vaults full of cash, and neither does it add to the Dillinger character other than one-liners telling the public that this is nothing personal, highlighting his code of honour even amongst thieves.As for Christian Bale's lawman Agent Melvin Purvis, he gets introduced opposite Channing Tatum's Pretty Boy Floyd, and gets put in a no-nonsense light somewhat like an Elliot Ness type, and gets personally handpicked by J Edgar Hoover (chillingly played by Billy Crudup) to lead the charge in capturing Dillinger. With pride in serving in the very roots of the FBI's formation, and with great belief in the force's standard operating procedure and cutting edge (at the time) scientific methods, Purvis comes across as a very straight laced contrast to Dillinger's free-wheeling, devil may care attitude. Which of course sets up the initial differences between the two men more than just merely being on the different sides of the law.However, Public Enemies seem to be, like Dillinger, always in a hurry. While it's paced incredibly well to plough through its rich material of a famous American bank robber during the Great Depression era, very little gets said about him as a person other than his romantic pursuits. His romance with Marion Collitard's Billie Frechette seemed to stick out like sore thumb and presented a tangent in the narrative, with too much desperate focus on it being that sliver of a personal piece on the notorious bank robber. Collitard had little challenge in a role which began quite interestingly with the romantic games people play, but fizzled out with time, being no more than a glorified flower vase in a role that could've been tackled by any fresh faced ingenue.Mann seemed to be pulling his punches with a lot of subplots going underdeveloped. There were plenty to be explored, such as the code of loyalty between Dillinger and his band of merry men, or even the formation of the FBI could've been tackled in more depth especially since the film included the grilling of the unpopular J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), whom I felt had enough fuel for a tussle of hearts for Melvin Purvis to handle. I can already imagine with John Woo at the helm, sans the more balletic gun fights, these are areas that Woo would probably exploit, and areas which could have made this a more interesting, meaningful film than a shiny, glossy one. Not to say that Mann didn't try, which can be seen in those excellent scenes with Dillinger not being able to keep up with the times of white-collared crime versus brute-force robbery with diminishing returns, and being written off as old- fashioned. That too was in great contrast again to the FBI's newer, modern methods, which didn't prove to be as successful as the tried and tested process of crime investigations and problem solving.So what's the verdict of the match up between Johnny Depp and Christian Bale? Like Mann's Heat which had the much touted about pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino on opposite sides of the law, or like other much touted collaborations such as Ridley Scott's American Gangster starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, which is another biography of a more contemporary gangster, Public Enemies join that list in having its star billing spending less than a handful of screen time in the same frame. They rarely meet since they are adversaries on opposites, though here when they do, it's nothing more than some mediocre exchange of words. Nothing too exciting about it, which is somewhat of a pity since these two gentlemen are just about the hottest property in Tinseltown right now.With cameos by Leelee Sobieski and Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd in blink and you miss roles, Public Enemies felt a little short-changed in depth, with wasted potential from being a contemporary classic such as how Brian De Palma's classy The Untouchables which was also set around the same period, with a famed lawmen and an infamous crook as its lead characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Probably be rating it lower if not for Depp and Bale,"The cast is what makes 'Public Enemies' fun.Johnny Depp is great as Dillinger, he lifts a load of average scenes and makes them way more interesting. Christian Bale does likewise as Purvis, those two were excellent casting choices.The film also features other familiar faces, e.g. Stephen Graham and Giovanni Ribisi, who are all fairly accomplished in their respective roles. The down parts of this production, for me at least, are the plot and the editing.Plot-wise it is a little drawn-out, it can feel a bit pedestrian in the moments away from the fire-fights. Some of the editing comes across choppy, during a few of the action scenes in particular.I still had a decent time watching, though I'd probably be rating it lower if not for Depp and Bale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Good as a docu-drama about a notorious bank robber,"For a film this doesn't really have much soul to it or really pulls you into what is going on. But for a docu-drama this is done pretty well but has some flaws. I didn't really like the cinematography to this, I can see why Michael Mann went with this direction in order to seem more realistic and make the audience be part of what is going on. But I personally didn't find it effective and sort of looked cheap in some areas. So yeah didn't really like the camera work in this, it was like watching a expensive play instead of watching a movie. There also isn't much depth to this movie and doesn't really expand. However Johnny Depp did a fine job playing one of the most famous bank robbers in history. He really showed a lot of charisma in this movie and somewhat made his character likable because he played his character in a very charming and yet dangerous manner, also the way he carries himself. Christian Bale does a good job of playing Melvin Purvis, who is a FBI agent trying to track down Dillinger. Like Johnny Depp with Dillinger, Christian Bale really stood out in this as well but unfortunately the script didn't give his character a chance to give depth to his character. Even with the chase scenes and the shootouts, the movie felt mostly dry a lot of times. The love story in this is important to the story, but felt like it dragged the pacing of it all at times. This film would have been better if at least the characters had more depth to it, especially John Dillinger. He was just a cool and slick criminal and a bit of a hero to some degree and nothing was really menacing about his character. And didn't really feel like he was a bad guy at all sometimes because of the feel and direction the movie went with his character. ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" did a better job with character development and direction even if it lacked action like this movie. This isn't one of the best movie of 2009 or anything like that, but it's still a watchable movie and is worth the time to check out.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Re-romanticize the de-romanticized,"Michael Mann has been able to tell complicated tales in expert form before, with masterful attention to detail and performances. In ""Public Enemies"" he keeps the latter but fails to tell the right story, choosing to do a standard old fashioned Hollywood film (with great gunfights). The book that this was adapted from is about the FBI and how it came to be successful, despite its multiple blunders, during a time in which the United States was no better than a third world country. The tales of the villains (the public enemies of the title) at the time are told to in part de-romanticize the crime figures but also to de-romanticize (or de-Hollywood-ize) the FBI. Mann goes the opposite way. He creates not only a Hollywood-type lost soul criminal in John Dillinger, but also a ridiculously idealized Melvin Purvis, the Chicago special agent in charge. Mann wants to make him into an Elliot Ness of ""The Untouchables"", when per the details in Brian Burrough's book, Purvis was rarely involved in the raids, missed or blatantly ignored many leads, and screwed up many operations - particularly the raid on Little Bohemia, portrayed in the movie as extremely successful, when in fact the FBI only managed to harm innocent civilians and lost all the gang. Many ideas credited to Purvis in the film were ideas of other agents. This is not just dishonest but it takes the fun and intelligence out of the tale.Mann is not ignorant of the details. What in turn is amazing of ""Public Enemies"" is the great length to recreate many scenes, which Mann and his crew deliver perfectly. Thus it is obvious that Mann chose to willfully ignore it to create his own romantic vision of Dillinger and the FBI.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies on Blu-Ray,"Like David Fincher and Robert Rodriguez, Michael Mann has embraced HD, having utilized the format for three films. The transfer to blu-ray, a native hd format, is stunning, perfectly rendering the film's muted, contrasty cinematography. I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND investing the extra few bucks for the blu disc. It's one of the better editions out there.The movie itself is one of the more engaging historical crime films. While taking liberties with certain facts, the central hunter/ quarry conflict propels the movie forward at a blistering pace, making the more mundane, expository passages forgivable. Similar to his other offerings, Mann's action sequences are sure-handed and tense, relying more on traditional film technique than the frenetic Paul Greengrass style. The performances are strong. Depp's portrayal of Dillinger stands out as both complex and quirky, imbuing the character with a charm that makes the audience invest in him completely.Public Enemies stands out as the most precise and entertaining telling of the Dillinger story thus far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Far Off the Map"": Freedom vs. Control in Public Enemies","Public Enemies has been unfortunately called Heat set in the 1930s. This is an extreme oversimplification, though we can imagine how that film would have played out being that Bryan Burrough's marvelous book on which the film is based reads a lot more like Heat than its consequential film adaptation. Mann, whose own narrative style has evolved since 1995 into something very impressionistic and sparse brings the material closer to The Aviator (2004; directed by Martin Scorsese) and his fascinating and fussy Miami Vice (2006). Scott Foundas writes in his review of Public Enemies that the film ""suggests a period redo of the 1995 crime saga, Heat, albeit reduced nearly to the point of abstraction."" Unlike Heat, where almost every actor in the crowded story is given a juicy scene that clearly establishes an identity, Time in Mann's more recent work is moving ahead so fast that there's no room (no Time, no Space) for an individual to establish Identity, where even the protagonist is struggling to hang on under the weight of this immense gravity that pulls the Self into a black void.Public Enemies does not operate with the usual tropes of character development wherein character actors are allowed juicy monologues and self-serving scenery chewing. It is terse, silent, and even mechanical as opposed to conventionally humanistic. Even when it unfurls using the norms of cinematic suturing – such as the heightened melodramatic music of Eliot Goldenthal during the blooming romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marilon Cotillard) – the affect is almost ironic and distancing. Instead of compelling the audience to feel what the lovers are feeling, the result is much more akin to Todd Haynes' Douglas Sirk homage, Far From Heaven (2002): these characters are constructions of the growing cinematic world of their particular historical context (1933-1934). As a filmmaker whose style is geared towards generating content, Michael Mann is here eschewing normal methods of character development and storytelling precisely because he doesn't want us to disappear into the movie, the same way the characters are disappearing into History; we have to be in a dialogue with a film that is asking us about our reactions to it, because it is the Movies, after all, that generate our own personal myths and validate our preconceived identities, making sense out of human experience - our relationships, our loves, our deaths – much as Mann's Dillinger experiences cinema (Manhattan Melodrama) moments before his last stand. Indeed, the cinematic construction of the Self for Dillinger is circularly reinforced, being that his image of identification (Clark Gable) is in part a film studio's construction based on the man Dillinger himself has created with the assistance of the media. The ""Real Self"" is possibly non-existent, ghostly, and perhaps the only place John Dillinger can be captured and killed is under the blinking lights of a movie theatre, the Biograph (a name suggesting a ""Life""), because he's more Real there than in his corporeal body. Public Enemies is focused on the Real Self within History and how that Self dissipates within that History's systematic unveiling. The State becomes realized as an Idea of absolute Control and Reason, and people within that Right Hegelian System personified by J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), such as the tragically alienated Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), are doomed to become nothing but despair-ridden suits, dying slowly and then forgotten.This kind of structure is not exactly conducive for a summer multiplex audience, any more than Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was in July of 1999. But as Time magazine critic Richard Schickel points out, Kubrick's critics were always looking for ""what wasn't in the movie,"" ignoring the ""movie-ness of the movie,"" what was being communicated within the frame. The same could be said for Mann. Like Kubrick, his pictures demand the audience to communicate with the text, analytically participating instead of passively viewing. Which is why both directors' films are able to be watched and re-watched numerous times, each viewing having its own resonance depending on the viewer's response, as if each screening had the distinctive character of a live stage performance.Public Enemies is not a rehash or period revision of Heat, but rather an obtuse and fascinating dialectic between film and audience and between historical reality and American myth. The film documents a particular time in history, when technology was enabling larger social structures to override local structures and private individuals, to the extent that it would completely absorb human beings and the symbolic functionality of their relationships in addition to Nature and the mystery of the frontier. Hoover's bureau, the abstraction for the Great Corporate Body, is thrown over the once mythological and transcendent American frontier as a technical matrix web that forces its workers, however virtuous, into base submission. Rebelling against this system, or shown to be active in fleeing from it, are the ""public enemies"", portrayed as archetypes pursuing a kind of poetic freedom, which denotes freedom from economic and political structures, so that the individual may control his own subjectivity and his own time. Unlike other elegiac period films, where the characters are either revisionistically de-mythologized or their presentation is wholly based on myth, the famous characters in Public Enemies are demythologized beings who are presently aware of their mythos and how that mythos is ""becoming."" It is a film that affirms the paradigm of our mythology, a trait that it shares with the films of Terrence Malick (whom is casually referenced through inter-textual clues), as long as those myths do not exist as tools of control but rather as touchstones with which we can identify and make sense out of our own experiences. The work of art must hence be in dialogue with its audience, not communicating clearly in order to communicate. We must experience it not passively, but actively, just as we may experience and analyze our own life experiences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great performances,"This film is full of great performances by some of the best actors around. Johnny Depp is given top billing but there are so many greats in this for example Christian Bale, Giovanni Ribisi, Channing Tatum just to name a few. there are several flaws in both the timeline of actual events and some of the sets but truly these mostly do not take away from the enjoy-ability of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Aesthetic rendition of a true story though well short of being Great,"The 1930s was the era of the Great Depression in America when one man chose to thwart the authorities by robbing banks consistently in the most audacious fashion. John Dillinger was an outlaw romanticized as a folk hero for his contempt for authority but that hardly seems as enough reason for him to achieve the celebrity status of his days. Melving Purvis (Christian Bale) is on the Dillinger hunt with a capable force that he would rather not lose to unscientific methods of crime investigation. With this, Michael Mann, who gave us 'Miami Vice' and 'Heat', attempts to depict the crime saga of the 1930 era in a stylish fashion but falls short of making it a superior crime drama.The movie starts with Dillinger breaking some of his friends out of prison in one of the better sequences of the movie. Soon, after robbing banks in an inglorious and rapid fashion (unklike Mann's 'The Insider'), Johnny falls in love with Billie Frechette after a bold and straight-forward encounter at a posh restaurant. We have seen love stories in a crime drama involving gangsters and one cannot help but recollect those moments from 'Scarface' or even 'American Gangster' but Dillinger and Billie's relationship lacks the connect that can engage you in the diversion from all the robberies and shootouts. Dillinger is a rebel with a cause in a depression-hit America but the reasons for it are unknown and that makes the viewer dispassionate towards his character's importance. The same goes with Melvin Purvis who is initially seen shooting a most wanted criminal in an orchard but his iconic status as the good man in the story is under toned and under performed. Purvis is constantly challenged while being a straight arrow cop who is simply upholding the law with a special team and being outwitted by the Public Enemy #1.The only character insight we really see is Dillinger's refusal to abandon friends, colleagues and loved ones to the extent that it brings his own fall. John Dillinger's character, at least in Mann's direction, lacks the cool factor of a cold blooded villain like Tony Montana in 'Scarface' (""say hello to my little friend"")or Frank Lucas in 'American Gangster' (as he shoots a rival on the street outside the diner) or Robert De Niro in 'The Untouchables' (murdering his associate during a meeting) . Well, if not the villainy, he even lacks the wittiness and suave of Frank Abagnale in 'Catch me if you Can'. The character of Dillinger is so loosely crafted that even after Johnny Depp's best attempt, he only manages to keep you in the theater for the 2 ½ hour duration with mixed interest. The film rides on his shoulders and he manages to carry only his role but not the entire movie.The film's cinematography is impressive and renders the vintage look of the 30s. More of the look has been focused upon than the 'feel' of the movie and that perhaps is its downfall. On the other hand, unlike the other crime and gangster movies mentioned earlier, 'Public Enemies' fails to take sides. One isn't totally convinced by the ways of either John Dillinger or Melvin Purvis and the ambivalence makes it harder to engage oneself with characters and the conclusions that the movie draws. Christian Bale's performance of a loosely drawn character is at best – unremarkable while Johnny Depp gets a few one-liners and charisma that make him look bigger than the character written for him. One will remember 'Public Enemies' for Johnny Depp if at all but not in the same manner as one would remember 'Pirates of the Caribbean' for Captain Jack Sparrow.The film fails to highlight some essential aspects of the movie that may have aroused greater engagement from the viewer. These include the heroic status of John Dillinger in a depression-hit economy of America, his reason to choose the path he chose, Melvin Purvis' background or character insight and the rise of the FBI after failed attempts of local judiciaries to fight crime due to geographic limitations.However, there are some highlights in 'Public Enemies' that cannot be ignored. The opening scene of the prison-break is brilliantly directed in an almost choreographed manner, the cabin shoot-out is violently breath-taking with exemplary high def camera work and the inevitable conclusion of the film's 'villian' is caught in some brilliant cinematography as well. In the end, it is these few moments and Johnny Depp's coolness that manage to leave an impact but they sadly are not enough to make Public Enemies a brilliant film or a remarkable depiction of a true story about John Dillinger.7.010 on a scale of 1-10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Michael Mann trailblazing a pore-filled, naturally lit run and gun, documentary approach to period biopic filmmaking.","Mann, ever ahead of his time and not risk averse throws two fingers up at a proper sound mix, and revels in digitals ability to move from outside and inside of environments giving the film a truly homemade feel. Fly on the wall was not a way you could describe a film set in 1933 before, something the film enjoys putting ahead of the first scene to remind you you're not seeing something in the present day. Mann shoots the history that is stranger than fiction with a Fincher-like attention to detail that had me googling for hours afterwards to find more of the details behind the supposed truths.
A yell when you spot them star studded cast sit alongside the stars in cautious, subdued thankless roles. The boiled down script and Mann's proclivity to let the fire burn deep inside his characters means that critics were easy to be cruel to them, when in reality it's refreshing to allow Mann's close camera to let us peer into these souls instead of have everything splashed around in grand OTT fashion. It makes you engage as psychologist not passive when watching them.
There are flaws, it loses steam by the end, an intentionally terrible sound mix is still terrible and Cotillard and Depp's chemistry is pared back to the point of nonexistence and therefore chunks of the movie depending upon it fail entirely.
But Mann has made something magical as always, something edgy and experimental and well worth existing which is more than most filmmakers do. Here he is actually making art of a kind. And in time it will be appreciated. His editing swallows all the best filmy bits of the film the way The Wire swallows its most TV storylines in between episodes. Where else would ceilings actually be an integral part of deciphering the themes of the film. And in many ways Public Enemies is a bookend to the superb Assassination of Jesse James regarding celebrity outlaws in the history of the USA, whereas Jesse James had only archive newspaper and pulp serials to base its myth and legend on, Public Enemies had the early days of reporting and witness testimony To hinge a sort of tangible historical reconstruction on. Here there are some scathing parallels between the birth of G-Men and the height of post-9/11 law enforcement techniques and torture. In many ways the film is secretly a bait and switch to show how sadistic and villainous Hoover's police were and how their celebrity and their lawlessness made them a far more formidable threat than Dillinger perhaps ever was.
There are many other reasons why I love this movie, dripping with period detail and then set at with a run and gun approach to make you forget all of that. The rest of the things I love about this movie, I can't put into words. In my book, that makes it one to remember and one to promote.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""I'm John Dillinger, I rob banks""","Being a huge fan of Micheal Mann's previous bank-robber film Heat, as well as Johnny Depp and heist movies in general, I was very excited for this film. I must say in some ways I was quite satisfied, but in others I was disappointed.All in all, it was an exciting film with exciting action, some very well done scenes, and great acting all-around, but it somewhat suffered in the plot and character development.The movie's main character pretty much sums up the structure of this film about 20 minutes or so into it: ""I'm John Dillinger, I rob banks."" The film altogether is more or less that straight forward. Director Micheal Mann really doesn't beat around the bush. The film just kind of goes from one event to the next, without really a lot of build-up or development.The action in the beginning of the movie is well directed but it moves by quickly, and doesn't really give you a lot of time to get into the scenes. However, as the film went on, I found I started to get into it much more. As John Dillinger's character started to unfold a little, I began to really get into Johnny Depp's performance. He does an excellent job as the cocky, straight-forward, cool-headed gangster. The other gangsters in his entourage are perhaps not given enough screen time or development but they are interesting characters and also well-acted, and Oscar winner Marion Coutillard is of course fantastic as Dillinger's love interest. This all begins to show more and more as the film goes on. On the other hand, Christian Bale's character as the federal agent on Dillinger's tale is a little bit dull. This may not be his fault, though, as much as the script's. His character really doesn't have a whole lot to work with but he does a good job with what he's given.The middle section of the film also consists of some top-notch shootout sequences. While I had hoped for a little bit more suspense and build-up, one thing I was looking forward to in this film was a whole lot of guys blasting away at each other with tommy guns, and in that department in delivers. One thing Micheal Mann certainly knows how to direct is a good shoot-out, as well as a very good break-out scene. The action does start to lose momentum towards the end, but there are a lot of good dramatic moments throughout.One thing that kind of bothered me about the film was camera work. Micheal Mann seems to use a lot of what appears to be hand-held camera, as well as a lot of very close-up shots, which in some scenes are effective, but often makes the film feel somewhat claustrophobic. I also don't feel that the period was used to it's fullest extent. This film is set in the depression era, which has a very distinctive atmosphere, which in turn has a very distinctive charm, which can often compliment a film. To me, that atmosphere and charm really didn't shine through as much as it should have. This is probably mostly due to the claustrophobic camera work. The characters are always the center of attention, never the setting. This has it's merits, as the characters are what move along the action of the film, but often times a setting is as much as a character as the people. In a depression-era film, you need to see the depression a little more distinctly. In a bank-heist film, the bank itself needs a little bit of extra attention. You rarely actually get a very good look at where you are, just who's there and what's going on. It works for moving along the plot, but it leaves you wanting just a little more.All in all, this film was quite enjoyable, very well acted, and in many parts quite exciting and action-packed, but it should have been better and certainly will not be winning best picture. Still, I'm sure any fan of gangster movies or of Johnny Depp will enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Johnny Depp IS John Dillinger!,"After riding on the gravy train that was the Pirates of the Caribbean, Johnny Depp delivers his best performance yet as 1930s bank robber John Dillinger.Here's the skinny: After robbing many banks during the Depression, John Dillinger(Depp) is now Public Enemy #1. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover(Billy Crudup) sets up a task force to catch Dillinger and his gang, making FBI agent Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale) its leader. Meanwhile Dillinger, aside from robbing banks and repeatedly busting out of jail, is in a relationship with Billie Frechette(Marion Cotillard). What follows are Dillinger's last days until his death.What shines best is of course the lead performance by Depp. He easily makes Dillinger look like an anti-hero rather than a heartless villain. Dillinger was a hero to most of the public in the Depression, and Depp easily creates Dillinger that way as well for the audience. The film is also well scored by Elliot Goldenthal, who also did the score for director Michael Mann's 1995 crime classic Heat. The film is mostly accurate history wise, save for a few mistakes. Aside from Dillinger, there are appearances of more big-time criminals like Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd, played by Stephen Graham and Channing Tatum. The film also drags a little bit, but it is still an excellent crime film.Overall: 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Detective: ""John Dillinger isn't going to see a Shirley Temple movie!""...","Director Michael Mann has given us a stylish gangster film, the kind that Warner Bros. used to make in the studio days with someone like James Cagney as Cody Jarrett in WHITE HEAT.This time the gangster is real-life public hero, John Dillinger, played in JOHNNY DEPP style by the actor who is convincing as the man who, from the very opening scene, plans a prison break that Mann has filmed with startling realism that jumps off the screen. I say hero because that was the public's perception during the Great Depression of any man who could thwart the authorities and rob banks with such authority and skill.MARION COTILLARD is the love interest, the only angle of the film that reminds one of Hollywood hokum, the way the gals were always featured in the Cagney and Bogart crime melodramas--but she plays her part well and is especially strong in some of the final scenes where the police are giving her a brutal interrogation in an attempt to locate Dillinger.Technical credits are all excellent, including the photography and background music, evocative of the '30s settings. Interesting use of some Billie Holiday songs on the soundtrack are combined with an effective and unobtrusive soundtrack by composer Elliot Goldenthal.The only weakness is that most of the other supporting members are given little character development to work with--but since the camera is almost always on Depp as Dillinger, who gives a riveting performance, this can easily be overlooked. Good chemistry between Depp and Cotillard is an asset.There are only two other main characters of interest--Christian BALE as Melvin Purvis and BILLY CRUDUP as J. Edgar Hoover. Both are excellent. Bale comes across as a basically decent man from Tennessee who is practically forced into becoming an enforcer by Hoover who is anxious to get his Federal Bureau of Investigation started. His first job is to go after Pretty Boy Floyd. When Floyd is killed, Hoover knows he found the right man for the job of hunting down Dillinger and his gang.The shootouts are exceptionally well staged and there are many of them throughout the story of one of America's most famous outlaws. Although the film runs two hours and twenty minutes, there is seldom a lull in the storyline, thanks to some very impressive direction by Michael Mann and some fine performances from the cast.The windup concludes with Dillinger attending the Biograph theater to see Clark Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy in MANHATTAN MELODRAMA. When the police learn that he has a choice of two theaters, one of the detectives asks what's playing at both. We know they made the right choice for their ambush when a detective says with assurance, ""John Dillinger isn't going to see a Shirley Temple movie!""",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This movie grew on me.,"Not historically accurate. Floyd was killed 4 months after Dillinger. However they get a lot of the characters, Red- Homer- Nelson right. They also get the trend - away from robbery to the rackets right. Depp was not my first choice, but in the end he did a decent job as any for Dillinger. The shootout at Little Bohemia is one of the best yet and entirely accurate IMO. From what I have been able to gather, Diilinger was really playing with fire by using firepower related crime to achieve his ends. He talks about the public supporting him, but after family men are killed the support wanes. It's interesting that Purvis is in on all the major successes in taking down these people when in fact he was a lousy shot. The scenes where he requests hardened lawmen from Oklahoma and Texas are real.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Invites Us To A New Realm Of Gangster Drama,"The story of legendary Depression-era outlaw John Dillinger (Johnny Depp)—the charismatic bank robber whose lightning raids made him the number one target of J.

His charm and audacious jailbreaks endeared him to almost everyone -- from his girlfriend Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) to an American public who had no sympathy for the banks that had plunged the country into the Depression.But while the adventures of Dillinger's gang—later including the sociopathic Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) and Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi)—thrilled many, Hoover (Billy Crudup) hit on the idea of exploiting the outlaw's capture as a way to elevate his Bureau of Investigation into the national police force that became the FBI. He made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy Number One and sent in Purvis, the dashing ""Clark Gable of the FBI."" However, Dillinger and his gang outwitted and outgunned Purvis' men in wild chases and shootouts. Only after importing a crew of lawmen from the Dallas bureau and orchestrating epic betrayals—from the infamous ""Lady in Red"" to the Chicago crime boss Frank Nitti—were Purvis, the FBI and their new crew of gunfighters able to close in on Dillinger.

Horribly Inaccurate,"After much anticipation I just returned from Public Enemies. Though a very watchable movie it is amazingly inaccurate. Pretty Boy Floyd was not killed by Melvin Purvis and was still alive when Dillinger died (as was Van Meter and Nelson). Not only that but Purvis was a complete imbecile. Hoover disliked him but had no other choice until bringing in Samuel Cowley, who was technically in charge when Dillinger was gunned down. The Little Bohemia scene, again though interesting, was way off base. That event was one of the biggest disasters for the FBI. Everyone of importance got away. Plus it was a rookie Fed who killed the citizen as they tried to leave, not Purvis (there was very little shooting that night, unlike the movie). Then at the end Hamilton was Dillinger's new girlfriend though not portrayed that way in this movie. That's why he went to the theatre that night. The movie made it seem like some random event. And, last but not least, no one heard what Dillinger muttered when he was lying in the street dying. Worth the price of admission but don't try and write a biography paper for school from it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A bit of a disappointment....,"You've been living under a rock if you don't already know quite a bit about Mann's latest film.I'll just add that I was disappointed in several aspects of the film. This is unfortunate, as I consider myself somewhat of a fan of Mann's.The first negative is the emphasis on overt melodrama. (This is quite ironic, since there are several scenes from ""Manhattan Melodrama,"" the last film that Dillinger saw, in the movie. It's almost as if Mann was overtly telling the audience that this would be a MM for the 2000s.)Also, I wouldn't mind the cornpone storyline so much if it were historically accurate. Unfortunately, it is not. It is one thing to fantasize about characters in a fictional story (as in ""Heat""), but Dillinger, and virtually all the other characters in this movie, were real people and they did real (and, in most cases, historically verifiable) things. The non-fictional aspects of the Dillinger story are exciting enough. Why was it necessary to jazz them up for this movie? It certainly wasn't done to improve the pacing of the story.Finally, what's with the sound and the cinematography? Mann, and others associated with the film, state that the quality of the digital photography was deliberately chosen and used for effect. What? The rectangular digital anomalies (like photocopy screening) were deliberate? What was that supposed to represent? Wire news photos? This just looked bad...and cheap. Plus, the sound is terrible. Forget the mumbling and just turn on the captions. As for the sound overall and the sound FX, they were nowhere near as convincing as in ""Heat."" The weapons used in ""Heat"" sounded like actual weapons being fired on the streets of LA. The weapons in ""Public Enemies"" sound like canned sound FX bought on-line. You never once believe that a shotgun or Tommy gun is being fired.Other than my complaints, not a bad movie. Depp does a pretty good job, as do Crudup and Bale. (Though they should have just given up and told Bale to drop the accent.) Everyone else is pretty forgettable.Frankly, I prefer John Milius' 1973 version of the Dillinger story with Warren Oates.

extravaganza of closeups,"For fans of extreme facial close-ups, this is the great movie of 2009. Not only is the camera cheek-to-cheek with Johnny Depp, Marion Cotillard, Christian Bale and the rest of the sterling cast, it's downright microscopic, revealing a vast landscape of zits, pores, peach fuzz and capillaries. This kind of cinematography gives the film a persuasive intimacy that locks us into the drama from the earliest scenes (the film opens with a closeup of a tight formation of shackled prisoners in classic black-and-white striped uniforms marching across a prison yard). Depp is a good choice to play the dapper gangster John Dillinger. It's not that others couldn't have done equally well in their own way, but there is something about his nonconformist offscreen persona that underpins the role. Christian Bale as FBI agent Melvin Purvis matches him scene for scene in a performance of seemingly effortless brilliance. Marion Cotillard reinforces her reputation as a convincing, versatile actress as Dillinger's girlfriend; she plays ""wounded-soulful"" very well. And a plumped Billy Crudup is properly officious as the young J. Edgar Hoover.The film shifts from Dillinger and his gang to Purvis and his gang, taking breaks occasionally to indulge in protracted shoot-outs between the two which get rather tiresome after a while, particularly because they tend to confuse the viewer. In one nocturnal scene, an ambush takes place at a motel in a wooded area. The parking lot around the motel is pitch black, but the surrounding forest into which a significant chase sequence occurs, is conveniently bathed in what can only be described as the very generous light of a full moon.Costumes, interiors and autos are all convincing. The soundtrack is okay, but in its languor tends to add to the slowness of the film's pace. The underscoring is half Flatt-and-Scruggs style banjo licks (was Michael Mann trying to pay homage to the 1967 film classic Bonnie and Clyde, which also dealt with Depression-era gangsters to the tune of strumming banjos?) and anachronistic recordings with a jazz-swing sound that date more from the later 30's and 40's than from the film's actual time period (1933-34). Recordings by Billie Holiday dominate. In truth, Holiday was not making these recordings at the time; they are from a much later period. More authentic are the use of ""The Last Round-up,"" an actual hit song from precisely that period, and, if this movie is to be believed, one of Dillinger's favorite pop songs and Al Bowlly's crooning of ""Close Your Eyes"" in a bar scene as one of the Dillinger gang's molls agrees to set Dillinger up for the kill. Diana Krall as a nightclub singer exhaling ""Bye, Bye Blackbird"" as if it's 1945 is far advanced musically beyond what people in fancy Chicago show places would have heard in Dillinger's day. Somehow Mann didn't trust the music of the period to complement the action as he conceived it. I wonder why. Oh well, he's the director and it's his film.To sum up – very good on character, visuals and script. The pacing is a bit too formal and wearying. Too many overlong machine gun battles. Beautiful ending. Musical choices could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Pretty good summer film, but disappointing","When I first saw on IMDb Johnny Depp cast as John Dillinger in this film, I was thrilled. Dillinger, after all, was a charming, swaggering, cunning, womanizing thief. Remind you of anyone - say Captain Jack Sparrow? I read articles with Depp saying he had studied Dillinger, even wore a pair of Dillinger's dress pants. I was excited at the thought of an actor of his caliber dedicating himself to such a robust, interesting character.When I left the theater, however, I had mixed emotions. I was glad someone took the time to show what the world of cops and robbers was like in the 1930s. There was some good action, and there were some tense moments in the movie. Billy Crudup was near perfect as J. Edgar Hoover - the man who thought himself God. The acting was very good overall. The major problem I had was that I had no sense that Melvin Purvis and John Dillinger had been brought to life on the screen.Melvin Purvis was a pencil-neck attorney who had no law enforcement experience previous to the FBI. Christian Bale's character is a polar opposite - a manhunter who can shoot a running man down from 200 yards, a great planner and interrogator. It would be hard to get farther from the truth. Read up on him and take a look at a picture and you'll know what I mean. The worst part was that there was an actor in this film who was a spitting image of Purvis - I believe it was Richard Short.The most egregious, however, was Dillinger himself. Instead of the larger than life bank robber whose charm could buy him a drink or a date anytime, he is a troubled loner with a violent streak. The real Dillinger was known to rob banks with a smile on his face and sometimes to not even display a weapon. The movie Dillinger busts in with a gang wielding Tommy guns and tries to terrify everyone into submission. Again, as far as bank robbers go, it would be difficult to get further from the truth. I think Johnny Depp acted the part as it was written, and did that well. It's just a shame the part was written so poorly.There are also some pretty severe historical inaccuracies. Minor ones I don't mind, but killing someone off at the beginning who was actually part of Dillinger's gang for years after is a bit much. If you know the history behind Dillinger, you'll find yourself thinking ""wait, that never happened"" or similar things.The filming has been mentioned in other comments, and I will echo that. There are far too many close ups, and a lot of the filming is very fast-panning and unsteady. The '30s were a time of sharp contrasts - abject poverty in some places and some of the most elegant and beautiful architecture and apparel ever seen in other places. This film chose not to show that - whether that be due to budget or just poor film-making, I don't know.This was overall a pretty good movie, and will keep your attention. It had a chance to be really special, and it didn't make it there. It's a shame to see all that talent and material go to waste.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Beyond Redemption,"Where to start? Check out the goofs to confirm how far Mann strayed from reality, particularly in the time-lines of the characters lives and deaths. This could be excused if we were presented with solid writing, acting, direction and some drama. But we get nothing. A complete waste of over two hours of my life. Johnny Depp's ability seems to be confined to Burtonesque fantasy tales. Here he is seriously miscast, lamely going through the motions. Script seemed to be a first draft with story meandering between random shoot-outs and bank robberies. I rarely review but I'm hoping that these few words spare at least one other fellow human being the ordeal.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A nice escape from the summer blockbusters,"Firstly, the performances in Public Enemies are terrific all across the board. Johnny Depp (who, even despite being one of my all-time favorite actors, I was initially a bit skeptical about), especially, is perfect as John Dillinger. Literally, from minute one, you buy into his character. Obviously, we're still far from ""Oscar Season"", but I'd honestly be a bit surprised if Depp didn't – at least – get nominated for his performance in this film. Now, Christian Bale, much like in Terminator Salvation, isn't given as much to work with in terms of his character. Unlike his performance in McG's latest film, however (and contrary to what most people have said), Bale does an extremely solid job here, doing the best with what he's got.The action sequences, too, are surprisingly well done. Everything is pushed just to the edge of reality, while not becoming too frenetic or too unbelievable for a film like this. However, perhaps the greatest strength of Public Enemies is how it manages to capture the feel of the 1930's. Everything, from the settings and costume design, right down the dialogue, comes together to really bring you back to that time.Now, on the negative side of things, I never once bought into the relationship between John Dillinger and Billie Frechette. Dillinger just looks at her once, and instantly falls in love with her. On top of that, I didn't feel that there was any chemistry between the two of them. With love being such a huge motivating factor in what Dillinger does, it makes their lack of ""spark"" a real problem for me. This lack of character development carries through the rest of the film, though. Every character (excluding Depp's) feels extremely one-dimensional, despite the solid performances of the actors portraying them.The story doesn't flow very well either, making the movie feel more like a series of clips (as enjoyable as they may be to watch) randomly strung together. While I still really enjoyed Public Enemies, it's these shortcomings that kept it from being a truly great film for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Sturdy, yet over-familiar and under-explored; a tragic fumbling of Mann's playing to strengths","A Michael Mann film delving into the criminal psyche, paralleling the obsessive pursuits of cop and criminal, peppered with breathless shootouts and challenging new visual aesthetics. Sound familiar? Indeed, as Mann has been exploring similar subject matter throughout his film-making career, there would seem no more fitting director for Public Enemies, profiling infamous depression era bank robber John Dillinger and his relationships with a culture alternatively abhorring or hero-worshipping him and a law enforcement bureau tenaciously hunting him and branding him public enemy number one. But, as sad a realisation as it is, Mann's being the obvious choice to direct sadly detracts from his film's quality, as, with so many prerequisites for the subject matter, it increasingly feels that Public Enemies, for all its accolades, has preciously little new to say in regards to the gangster genre or in general, making it feel like an impressively realised, but inescapably overdone story.While pinning down why Public Enemies feels like an unsatisfying watch in the midst of so many promising attributes proves elusive, the prevailing complaint is the familiarity factor. If anyone were to find more to say in the gangster or cop genres it would be Mann, but one of the most authoritative voices in both appears tongue-tied, unable to generate content which has not been ground into the mires of predictability. Rather than being an immersive experience, the film feels sketched in point form, hitting all the familiar notes (heists, a romance on the side, betrayal, desperation) without finding anything new to say.And while Mann's copious adherence to factual period detail is particularly impressive, guaranteeing that his film at least credibly looks and feels like the 1930s, there is more to the story of Dillinger than he chooses to explore, making his film's familiarity unattributable to his sticking to the facts. There is an intriguing self-reflexivity element in making a film about a figure obsessed with movies and who styled himself after them, only to in turn inspire generations of movie villains after his public persona, yet this is merely one of many potential approaches Mann ignores in lieu of the conventional. Similarly, the character of Dillinger may be a paradoxical enigma, but the film seems to simply take it for granted rather than giving the audience the opportunity to see what defines or motivates Dillinger - his legendary charisma, focus, ethics, showiness, etc. While glimpses emerge (a memorable sequence showing crowds of people cheering as he passes, arrested, in a police car and there are hints of his living for the moment and not envisioning a future), one still gets the feeling than a more conclusive and contemporarily relevant take on the story existed within the project, which somehow became obscured and lost along the way. Apart from the occasional high point and a memorably resonant ending, Mann's film seems to simply drift along, never quite ensnaring the viewer's focus as it should.The familiarity of the story also impacts one's enjoyment of Mann's telling, his typical attention to detail and nuance make the film feel overlong and dragging rather than engaging. Nonetheless, overdone story or not, there are few who can convey a crime film in as thrilling a fashion as Mann, and his usual flair for amplifying nail-biting tension and delivering expansive, inventive and jaw dropping shootout sequences does not disappoint (although it is frustrating to see the dazzling cinematography of many of the gunfights marred by unnecessary shakycam, making it difficult to see anything happening). Unfortunately, Mann's initially bold experiment of high resolution digital filming, aiming for a gritty, realistic look backfires, resulting in a grainy, out of focus look which literally hurts the eyes, making the 140 minute running time hardly a pleasant watch. But, even more frustratingly, the visuals are confusingly inconstant, with some scenes nearly indecipherable and others pristinely clear with glossy Hollywood lighting and composition. Mann's usual flair for appropriately stylised music feels similarly on hiatus, with a musical score which generally feels overbearing or downright out of place, apart from certain moments (the recurring heist theme) which click with his usual precision.More commendable is the valiant attempt of Johnny Depp to redeem his under-explored character, offering an excellent blend of icy precision, quiet smirking confidence and a winking sense of fun - indeed, had his character been explored more thoroughly, his Dillinger could easily have been a character for the ages. Christian Bale impressively delivers steely reserve to his tenacious fed Melvin Purvis, but his character is tragically deprived of a backstory or context of any sort, leaving Bale struggling to redeem a painfully bland character (when an ending title announces his character's suicide the year after the film culminates, the viewer is left cold, with no real emotional attachment or sense of enough character to fully empathise). Despite mastering delightful arrays of charm and wounded concern, Marion Cotillard similarly flounders to rise above a tragic lack of character, dimming her and Dillinger's love story, the film's emotional centrepiece. Stephen Graham and David Wenham contribute much needed energy to the film as fellow lawbreakers Baby Face Nelson and Pete Pierrepont respectively, even if they too could benefit from further character exploration, but Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover feels irritating and unnecessary, forgettably chomping scenery to no viable effect.While Mann's film is far from a failure (and in a cultural vacuum would likely be quite brilliant), it becomes increasingly unsatisfactory through the knowledge that everything good about it has been done better, often by the same parties involved. Therefore, while Public Enemies may offer a mature, impeccably researched and often thrilling profile of an infamous criminal, more often than not it sadly feels unnecessary, leaving one instead yearning for the more engaging films it took influence from.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Decent yet uninspired,"Sadly, the hype generated for this film and the chance to have Depp and Bale go at each other in a deadly game of cat and mouse fell short of the mark. Three things kept this film on a short leash, teasing the audience but never fully delivering.1) Camera work. I have noticed a trend in the film industry to film action with shaky, quick-cutting camera work. I understand it is intended to give the audience the same sense of chaos that the characters are feeling, but I find it distracting and just pure sloppiness. What was worse was that the ""shaky camera"" was use throughout the film even when there was no action to speak of. I absolutely despise this ""style"" (I use the term loosely) of camera work. Couldn't the studio have spent a few dollars more for a still camera set a vastly improve the quality of the film? Speaking of quality of film: 2) ""Digital film quality."" A film that is supposed to be set in the 1930's certainly lost its appeal when it feels like it was filmed with a digital camcorder. The ""digital"" quality of the film made the movie feel unrealistic and out of place with the gritty world of the Great Depression.3) Lack of connection to characters. Given the last two problems I've discussed and adding to it the style of story telling, you feel absolutely no connection or sympathy for either Dillinger or Purvis. Its almost as if the director said, ""Here is Dillinger...here is Purvis...this happened...this happened....the end."" And this unemotional story is dragged out for over 2 hours.Sadly, it has the potential of being a great film but will ultimately become just another one of the hundreds of films that are released each year and will disappear into film history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Outstanding Film Noir,"This was an excellent gangster drama, lead by Johnny Depp as John Dillinger with an outstanding supporting cast of fellow gangsters and desperadoes, but what really made the film work were the ""G"" Men pursuing Dillinger. Christian Bale was perfectly cast as ""G"" Man Melvin Purvis, who ran the Chicago Office of the FBI. Billy Crudup was also great as J. Edgar Hoover, portrayed as a ruthless administrator willing to stoop to any depth to catch Dillinger, including rounding up family members and deporting friends of Dillinger unless they were willing to cooperate. None of the Oliver Stone fantasies about Hoover in a dress, but the Hoover who ran the Department with an iron fist.The supporting cast of Dillinger's fellow gangsters is too long to list, but mention should be made of Marion Cotillard who played Dillingers girlfriend Billie Frechette. She proved that her winning the Oscar for Best Actress (Le Vie en Rose) was no fluke.Michael Mann deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Director and possibly Screenplay (he co-wrote).A great film, possibly the best gangster movie ever.

"Great Plot, Bad Execution","This movie is has a great plot that really brings you along for the ride and makes you love John Dillenger even though he is the bad guy, but there is terrible editing and awful film shots that make it seem more like a TV or B movie rather than an A-list movie. It shocked me at points how the sound would fluctuate from very quiet to blareingly loud for no apparent reason. And at points it seemed like the film was being shot by a high schooler on a hand-held camera rather than by a professional. Not that the movie and the acting was not amazing, but the awefulness of the editing and filming process detracted from the plot at points. The director should have been much more careful about what he was putting out because it was enough to make me very disappointed in a movie that I expected to be much higher quality for the hype it was getting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Hunter and Hunted,"The film's biggest hurdle is to distinguish itself from other genre pieces like ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""The Untouchables,"" even films like ""O, Brother, where art thou?"" where some of the same characters that inhabit those films also inhabit ""Public Enemies."" Unfortunately, it fails at that, but there is much to admire.With a pedigree director, a distinguished (beyond belief) cast, and all the time it wants, various set pieces are riveting. Great care has been taken in developing a soundtrack that lets the audience discover what slugs of various weights of lead sound like when passing at high speed through various substances, like air, plaster, brick, stone, tree trunks, motor vehicles, etc. It's spellbinding and the sound crew should find awards at the end of the year.But what's missing most is form in the screenplay. It's not that there are too many characters that we have to sort through, there are too many that we have no idea of who they are or why we're watching them. In the cast, it's Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis who makes the most impression as a man who traditionally is the hero, and has to bring an era of crime—apparently single-handedly—to an end. But his methods are the first herald of modern day criminology, and it's fascinating to see early wiretaps and case development. Billy Crudup gives us a hint at what a full portrait of J. Edgar Hoover might be like (we're overdue for a full bio film on Hoover). And the amazing Marion Cottilard is always a rare and welcome presence, but the role created for her is too trite; nevertheless, she carries just about all the weight in her scenes with Depp.Johnny Depp has never been boring even if he misses the mark. But here he seems not to even be present. There's probably a reason we've never had a film about John Dillinger. While myth abounds, he was a brutal psychopath. The screenplay goes for the myth, and we're left feeling ambivalent about the people he hangs with, the choice of vocation he's made, and many people we see blown to smithereens in the course of the film all to bring him and his raiding to an end. He makes a distinction early in the film that he's not taking a customer's moneyjust the bank's. In today's perilous economic environment, it just doesn't play well.The film is fully scored using some music from the period, but nothing sounds like the period. That's at odds with the detailed art direction which appears both shabby (to reflect the world of the Great Depression) and extravagant in the use of cars and art nouveau architecture from the period.Any schoolboy (or possibly girl) knows the end of this story. So what the film needs to give us is some reason to care when that end comes. But I didn't. The shootout at Little Bohemia Lodge which is a prelude to ""the end"" is exciting, but we don't know who the people are running around. ""Is it Dillinger?"" Christian Bale asks. I shrugged, and muttered, ""Don't ask me.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public enemies summary,"I like the fact that this film is advertising the true heroism and legacy of John Dillinger but there are many problems with the film. Firstly it is a bit confusing if you know anything about Dillingerrs life and history of him. The time changes don't help. One moment Depp is clean shaven, then he has a moustache, then he is clean shaven again. There are also confusions about some of the characters and the time changes with no indication. Secondly, there is a lot of his life left out. Some of the main info such as Dillingers amateur surgery. With this surgery he was able to sneak about unnoticed. Overall i would say it is a good film with great shooting scenes and great acting but has been made to bring in money rather than to tell facts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies,"Public Enemies is based on actual events in the 1930's during the Great Depression dealing with notorious bank robber John Dillinger and his gang of men. The film shows John robbing many different banks and hiding out from the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation, who have named him ""public enemy"" number one. The film also focuses on the man who is determined to bring John down and to have him captured once and for all. A side plot involving a romance between Dillinger and a woman named Billie, is also featured. Films like Public Enemies can go either way for me. Sometimes they are high on substance and little on a good story and more on action and style, which I do not really care for, or there are also those which are very well structured and put together and leave the viewer entertained, thrilled and marvelling at the achievement. Public Enemies for me, fell into the second category. Yes, it does have a lot of style and was made with what looks like a big budget and popular Hollywood actors like Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, but the film does have a very involving story and even though it is quite stylish and was made for quite a bit, it never goes overboard with being unrealistic, or trying to show off with a lot of special effects, or technical tricks. There is one action scene that does go on for several minutes, but I found it to be very well paced as well as quite suspenseful and thrilling, so the fact that it was a longer scene did not bother me at all. I also found that the script had enough to keep us as the viewers interested and intrigued for the entire length of the film. I also liked some of the twists and turns that the film took and revealing some of the true intentions and real motives, of these characters. The only thing I would have changed with the film was to have more of Marion Cotillard's character Billie, because I found her to be quite interesting and it was a great performance, and yet I did not feel we got to know her as well as we could of and I would have liked to have known more about her and because the performance was so good, every time she was on screen it was a real pleasure to watch. Some scenes especially near the end with her in it are quite powerful and show the range of her great acting. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are great also, but again we do not see as much of Christian Bale's police character as we do Depp as Dillinger. Mainly the film is about Dillinger, and having being advertised that way, it was no real surprise to me that the film mainly focused on him, but I would have liked a little more of the supporting characters as well because when they were on screen, I found them to be interesting and added more to the story than if it had just been about Dillinger robbing banks the whole time. The script really does develop the characters well and as I mentioned there are some powerful moments as well as thrilling moments to capture anyone's attention. The film looks good with it's cinematography (which is digital and has brought forward some complaints) to the great looking replica costumes of the era. Public Enemies has style and a great deal of substance to really fulfill any real movie lover's expectations and I felt mine were met and I really enjoyed what I saw.

"explosive cinema, certainly worth a look‏","Michael Mann is back with a powerful gangster movie where two male egos face (actually they face off). Plus Public Enemies (in my view not as strong as Heat), has a strong love story with a girl who goes along with the gangster's lifestyle, in the sense that she commits to him staying loyal (they spark chemistry all around). Johnny Depp is a prototype of the perfect businessman, being him efficient, ruthless and using all the updated technologies.

Unwatchable,"This movies starts out with a less than exciting prison escape, then follows that up with Pretty Boy Floyd being killed. In reality, he was killed after John Dillinger. While this wasnt a documentary, and didnt expect it to be, this scene adds nothing to the movie. So I'm not sure why the director decided to put this in there.
This movie was just plain dull. The actors have the emotional range of a door. Personally, I couldnt develop any sort of interest in any of the characters. Even the relationship between Dillinger and Frechette is devoid of any sort of passion.
The camera work was shoddy as well. In at least one scene, the camera jumped around. I say in at least, because I couldnt finish this trainwreck of a movie.

Good movie but very boring,"The good points of Public Enemies were the costumes, the soundtrack (gosh yes the soundtrack is amazing and I'll discuss that) and the gunfights. However, the overall impact of this movie left me continuously aching to leave the theater and do something - anything - else with my time.I didn't like the two key actors. Bale stars in this movie as Bale. Depp stars in this movie (guess...) as Depp. Bale's ""same acting in every movie"" was tiresome and I felt very detached from Depp's character only until the last scenes in the film (the fact that his character, John Dillinger, was constantly referred to as Johnny was a huge disconnect for me during the film as the actor's name is, of course, the same).Not only could I not empathize with either of these two characters almost entirely, but I felt this way with every actor on screen. Every character seemed to be identified and then pushed aside for the next scene just as I was almost at a point where I could force myself to connect with him/her. The acting was remarkable at its best, but the director had it in mind to intertwine so many different actors with so many overlapping traits that the uniqueness of each character was lost.Now, this is fascinating: bad acting typically kills any movie, but Public Enemies was fantastic and epic during some of its runtime.Oh-my-gosh the movie's music was AMAZING. Whatever dullness I was gleaning from the lead char's was throttled by the soundtrack. I'll be downloading all of these songs from iTunes; that's how fantastic it was. The soundtrack alone was able to keep me in my seat during this flick.Overall, a 6/10. I would rate a movie higher that impressed me so much with gruesome, detailed deaths and such a breathtaking soundtrack, but that's not to say Public Enemies isn't worth seeing. It is, and make sure you get a loud theater, just that I wasn't ready for such a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
What's all the fuss about?,"I had high expectations for this film, and they were not met.I will say that the film does a good job of establishing the time period, as well as showcasing some strong performances all around. You can also give the film praise for having a strong visual style, but I found it distracting at times (too much hand-held for a big screen).What was wrong with this movie? Ultimately it bites off more than it can chew. Even in a 2 hour movie, I felt that none of the plot lines were given much time or emphasis. The romance was pretty quick and felt ""written in"" (although the actress does a great job, and Johnny does too of course, but their chemistry starts off very forced). Bale's character isn't given nearly enough to do, and we never learn more about him than we already knew in the trailer. Even Depp himself seems to be hidden from the audience a surprising amount.I respect the filmmakers for trying to tell a story without over-reliance on a script, and it shows in the strong physical acting and direction in the movie. However, for a movie that doesn't have any clear character arcs, continuous romance, or lots of action, we simply need more meat in this story. I doubt if the script (as is) couldn't have fit into a 90 minute film.Bonnie and Clyde is much better, and sadly this film can't escape its show, even with great original performances and a strong visual style.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Wow!,"There isn't much character development here but Johnny Depp scores as the self-assured, fly-by-the-seat-of-his pants, Robin Hood-esquire Dillinger who spat in the face of Johnny Law at every turn. As a member of Hoover's ""take off the white gloves and hit hard"" FBI, Melvin Purvis, Bale does more than just be a stuffed shirt. The cat and mouse game between the two is suspenseful and the bullets crackle and explode in intense shoot-outs and the prison escapes and bank robberies couldn't be more daring. The production values (the classic cars, night-clubs, costume design, the old movie theaters, etc) look fantastic and bring the 1930's to life and the tight close-ups of characters faces adds to the grit of Michael Mann's outstanding looking film. Cottillard is a classic beauty, a strong presence, and her scenes with Depp are some of the best romance you'll see this year. But it's Depp, layering on the cool, that has us rooting for the bad guy. This all leads to one of the best and most powerful endings of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Michael Mann delivers on a realistic portrayal of John Dillinger,"Going into this movie I knew exactly what to expect from a Michael Mann film. ""Amateur"" camera work. I do not believe it is amateur camera work but it is used in a way to make what the audience is seeing more realistic. Think of any documentary you've ever seen or news reports; Michael Mann realizes that when we see camera angles in those types of media we associate them with reality. So in a way the movie is documentary style but in a good way. The movie is shown in a new way and I loved it. I was already a fan of Heat and Collateral. Public Enemies just looks and sounds so authentic that you appreciate all of the ""cheap"" looking camera work but I happen to believe there were many scenes were the picture looked so beautiful and crystal clear. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has a passion for realism in a movie. The acting itself was great from all members of the cast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good trailer, horrible film","I went to see Public Enemies with quite high expectations, for the most part because of Depp and Bale and the trailer looked quite good. The 7.8 it had on IMDb at that time helped also.But it wasn't great, it wasn't even good. The dialogues between John Dillinger and his girl (Billie Frechette) where just plain boring and completely unbelievable. The action scenes where edited in such a way that I didn't know what the hell was going on half of the time. But the worst was that the movie failed horrible in creating an emotional connection with the main character. Whether anyone died or lived? I couldn't care less.Now the film had some good points too, the looks and feel of the time period where very authentic. You could pause the film at any time and get a great picture. And of course the acting was great. But what would you expect with such big names. But that wasn't nearly enough to save the movie.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"'Bye, bye, blackbird'","By no means does Michael Mann rank among my favourite directors but, for quite some time, I have been awaiting the release of 'Public Enemies' because the subject matter about one of the most infamous criminals in American history and the appealing cast. However, having now seen the result, 'Public Enemies' disappoints. It's not a bad movie by any means but, given the source material, it could have been so much better had it been crafted by the hands of directors like Sam Mendes or the Coen Brothers.Mann's film is above average at best, that too in parts. First of all, his storytelling does not involve the audience. The viewer feels like a complete outsider who is detached from the characters. Mann puts more focus on action than on characters. I found the background score uninteresting and intrusive rather than contributing to the scene. Several scenes could have been more effective without background music. But, the songs work and they contribute brilliantly to the art direction which definitely captures the feel and look of the time period. The cinematography is very ordinary. The editing needed some working. I found the pace to be slow at times while the characters lacked development.Johnny Depp does the best he can with what he's got. He captures the charm, slickness and determination of an infamous criminal. Had the character been better developed, his performance would have been outstanding. Christian Bale is restrained and he does a decent job but he's overshadowed by Depp. Luminous Marion Cotillard is spellbinding and she delivers the best performance in the movie. She shares an excellent chemistry with Depp. For me the highlights of the film were the scenes they shared. Of the talented supprting cast Branka Katic and Stephen Lang stand out while most of the others are wasted.I think Mann is better suited for lighter action movies. The action sequences in 'Public Enemies' are brilliantly executed. But, if you're going to make a movie about someone, character and story development should come first. Even though much of what I've said sounds negative, I don't mean to trash the film. It is watchable even if it's not something I'd include in my DVD collection.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A character-film who is up for it.,"At the end of Michael Mann's new film 'Public Enemies' we see bankrobber John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp, smiling wryly at a cinema screen where Clark Gable is acting out as a gangster whose about to be executed in the electrocution chair, as he's passing by a fellow criminal's cell he says ""Die like you live; all of a sudden"". It's a rock & roll cliché; live fast - die young. But Dillinger sees no tomorrow, when checking up on the lovely Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) he rapidly fires his biography and tastes of life in the matter of seconds, as he says; what more do you need to know? And what more does Dillinger need to know than life - right here, right now. He's turned into a alternative 1920s Robin Hood when the Great Depression is lying heavy on US society; when robbing a bank for hundreds of thousands and raising those Tommy-Guns high, he quickly but importantly tells a bystander whose emptied his pockets to put his dough back in, it's not his money they're after. John Dillinger, who's enormously interesting biography is sadly little apparent, is here portrayed as a romantic, runaway boy with looks to kill and loyalty that goes beyond, he sticks it to the boss and lets everyone see his principles of life and how it should be. And with Johnny Depp performing, it's all pretty great I have to say. The character is complex, his emotions are dark and hidden, and Depp turns all his calibers down to a minimum to achieve this undercurrent wildness, restlessness and sorrow in his eyes - at his opposite there's FBI-agent Melvin Purvis, a strictly conducting lawman who goes face-to-face with anybody who questions his authority; played out by Christian Bale, also he turns out a mellow performance, mute and straight-faced. Audiences may recall Mann's 1995-classic 'Heat' when these two opposites of the law go chasing one another, but where Pacino and De Niro understood each other, Depp and Bale are the complete opposites. Still, also Depp's Dillinger feels the heat around the corner when authorities catch up with his girl, Billie. And it's here Mann triggers heavy, the romance between Dillinger and Billie are important matters, and why not? Dillinger's striding for life and all its goods, and what's better than the love for another a human being? The director has been flirting up these alleys before (Heat, Miami Vice) but has never achieved the same tenderness that he does here, and although it's not better than anything he's done before, it's different, and thereby interesting. Now, although the film's PR and cast & crew has been tightly remarking its historical accuracy, everybody who's read a few articles about Mr. Dillinger and the times surrounding him knows that there's several flaws throughout the film - for my taste that's not very important, what's important is that Mann has created another crime drama with timeless themes. Shot with an absolute brilliance by Dante Spinotti, amount of work put into the hand-held camera-work, editing, sound, production design, costume and locations are stunning - you won't hear a machine gun fire this loudly or see the night so bleakly light anywhere this year, in other words; the craftsmen-work are top-notch and are already strong contenders for the technical categories in the upcoming Oscars 2009. Powerfully realistic, but still with a feverishly undertone of living life like a dream, this is Michael Mann's best film since 1999's 'The Insider'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Pleasant ride.,"I was really looking forward to this movie - primarily because of Depp and Mann's involvement, and, as if often the case when a movie I've anticipated finally arrives, I feared a let-down. But thankfully, this is one of those happy cases when I was pleased.Depp is the foundation for this movie. His performance was incredibly convincing. Movie-goers who are familiar with his range and characterization won't be too surprised by this. When he was on-screen, I felt I was actually watching Dillinger. He stole the show, and an Oscar-nod wouldn't surprise me. Miss Cotillard also gave a fantastic and emotional performance. Bale was a little wooden - something that's far too often the case, I fear - but still convincing.Mann's direction was inspired, on par with other such great films as Heat, The Insider, and Collateral. He continues to be one of the great directors of our time.I know there's been some complaint about the decision to use HD digital video for the film, and while I admit it was a little distracting in places, it also gave a sense of realism to it, almost as if I were watching a documentary. Helped me to remember that what I was watching actually happened, and wasn't just fantasy.In all, an impressive, enjoyable film, with an ending that left me stirred. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Bit of a disappointment,"Considering the tremendous star power of the cast and the fire power of the story I was expecting a much more gripping film. In the end it just petered down to another ordinary flick. Nothing to take away from the stars themselves mind you, Depp was suave, Bale was his usual seriousness and Cotillard I thought was fantastic. However, on the whole the movie fizzles out. Rat-a-tat of guns and the a bank robbery here and a chase there. Nothing stands out. There was a lot of potential in the movie but somehow it was lost in the presentation aspect. Minimal dialog and lack of character development add to the woes. Marion Cotillard is the saving grace of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Technical Masterpiece,"WOW!! simply wow...Every time I'm gonna watch a Michael Mann movie I know i'm in for a technical treat. The use of digital HD Cameras on Miami Vice and Collateral gave us some truly amazing shots..and here on Public Enemies, Mann delivers!There are some scenes in this movie that are just..wow, beautiful. I agree that there are moments in this movie that shooting them in Film would have been better..but there are some techniques that are simply impossible with Film cameras... For example, in the opening scene when the guy is dragged with the car holding Dillinger's hand...what a great shot! I seriously doubt if they could have pulled that off that with film cameras...The scene where they ambush Dillinger and his gang's hide house is one of the most impressive scenes I've seen lately, along with Depp walking into the police station...awesome!!All of that builds up to the perfect climax of the film in and outside of the theater....my heart was pounding although I knew how it ended!!!All in all, an excellent movie with some spectacular moments.

Style Over Subtance But The Style Is Good,"I caught this on ITV4 last night and came in to the film not knowing anything about but a gangster film starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale based on the true story of the FBIs attempt to catch John Dillnger does make for a good premise . One thing that did strike me was that the number of gun battles did remind me somewhat of HEAT though unlike that film this one seemed to concentrate more on the action sequences rather than the character interaction . After all Depp and Bale aren't really on the same plain as DeNiro and Pacino . I felt slightly stupid when the end credits rolled and the caption Directed By Michael Mann appearedIn some ways PUBLIC ENEMIES is a more glossy , action packed version of HEAT but it's more of style over substance . Not necessarily a criticism because when you've got style this good what is there to complain about ? Not much because the high digital cinematography is genuinely impressive . One wonders though if the decision to shoot it in this style is to hide the fact that from a narrative point of view is entirely down to the structure is too close to HEAT for comfort . We get scenes where a femme fatale is arrested and the protagonist has to drive off with tears in his eyes and lots of shoot outs with extras hiding behind cars etc . In truth there's nothing here you haven't seen before but is very well done it doesn't matter very much",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies is a friend of mine,"The name John Dillinger sends a chill down the back of people from several generations. The memory of his fame fades faster and faster. Those directly affected by his actions probably wish they could forget. Born to people who were children during his rampages, I heard the stories of adventure and crime. While the same lips would warn of the evil, bloody acts done by that horrible demon of a man, how could I not wonder while shuddering in terror, ""What made this person do these things and why?"". To this day I still wonder. There is no better explanation than the basic ""evil"". Any movie about him and his peers before today would tell you that.Now comes Michael Mann with his version of a man gone wrong. I still have no pity for the man but I left the theater more satisfied after seeing a more complete movie about the destructive legend. Not only are bad guys bad, but we get to see good guys go bad. Johnny Depp was excellent as the self absorbed, money and power driven bank robbing murderer. His sneers from overconfidence were chilling and even funny when, in one scene he particularly shows his disregard for police by challenging their intellect, or in another, where his picture is glaring over the audience in a theater while he struggles not to look at the attendees' reactions. You just knew he wanted to see how people would react if they knew he was there. Great performance Mr Depp!Marion Cotillard, you were even better. The smoky, glassy-eyed local girl trying to hold on to her values(perhaps) gave it all up for a wicked man who should never be lucky enough to know a woman as lovely as her. She fought off the temptation for as long as she could, but that one man was able to make her feel needed in a way no other had. Marion is the kind of actress I would like to see in any love story. Her emotional performances were classic. Myrna Loy, from the really old days, appears on the really old screen and one can instantly see the comparison in skill and beauty.Christian Bale is a very intense actor. I like what he does in about everything he has done. While I have no complaint about his performance, I was caught daydreaming temporarily when his first appearance during a testimony reminded me a lot of Oliver North. Thank goodness for gangsters shooting everyone up because that's what it took to shake that image.OK, so the performances were great, but there were times I had to wonder why this movie sometimes seemed to be going downhill. I am glad I stuck around because it all paid off in the end. The slowest scenes were actually sticking in mind as the story built up to a climax that I thought made a different kind of twist. While you may think you know how it ends, just knowing the ""punch-line"" is not enough.This is definitely not a fast paced movie so adrenalin junkies may need to adjust a little. It is a smart movie but not Shakespeare approved. I have to call it stylized drama suited for most ages(anyone who is allowed to play violent video games). While it is not blood gushing gore, there is plenty of violence.Great movie gets a great 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Everyone seems to be rating the film based upon hype instead of analysis.,"The acting is what saved this film. Johnny Depp was great, which is what prevented it from seeming as if it was shot by a mediocre film student.I was surprised to find other reviews in which they stated the audio sounded muffled. I too noticed this but attributed it to the cinema. However, perhaps not. The mixing for the dialogue was bad. I couldn't understand some words being said and at times I literally tried my best to lip read. It was distracting. However, perhaps it was some cinemas or it may not be the same upon a DVD/bluray release. Thus, I won't factor the audio issues into this review.Now, I spoke of distractions. The biggest distraction was the cinematography. I'm certainly not the first to complain about the digital cameras used; however, my complaint is slightly different. I typically liked how the shots looked. The lighting of the night scenes was great. The problem was the excessive use of hand cameras. Obviously this was an attempt at ""putting you in the action"" and heightening the action. There were numerous shots over people's shoulders, in an attempt to make it seem as if you were standing behind them. But this attempt failed.The major sign of excessive use of hand cameras came during the shootout at the bar with Nelson. This is where the cinematography broke down. There was constant camera jitter, bizarre shots from the ground looking up at the characters, and excessive closeups. Frankly, it was reminiscent of Rec and The Blair Witch Project, which is a bad thing when considering the type of movie we were meant to see. In both of those films, the viewer was aware that the character was using a portable camera. With that understood, it allows the viewer to be transported into the film--into the action. With Public Enemies; however, there is no real justifiable purpose. It's unnecessary to simulate a first person view to draw a person into a movie. Instead, this should be done with brilliant acting, a great script, and beautiful cinematography. The best filmmakers have been doing this for as long as the medium has existed.Ironically, the opposite of the intent was achieved. Instead of being within the action, you are made aware of the camera. What was meant to draw you in, instead dissociates you from the film. At times I felt as if Public Enemies was more of a video game than a film.Ignoring the cinematography and the sound issues (yes, that's challenging), the film would likely have received an 8. I would have preferred a greater back story/additional character development; however, I understand the way it is. It is in-keeping with the way Dillinger describes his past to Billie--a short statement of facts without painting any sort of picture.As I stated in the beginning, the acting was good; however, it lacked the sort of indistinguishable spark found in past Johnny Depp films. It is certainly not his greatest; however, overall it was enjoyable. I left the cinema with the feeling of, that was great, that was fun! What the heck were they thinking with that awful cinematography? That was fun! So on that note, it's worth seeing, even to learn how NOT to shoot a movie. Take notes film students.

Orchestral gun play by Michael Mann,"Public Enemies reaffirms Michael Mann as one of the true auteur directors of this generation. Easily duking it out with 2004's Collateral for second place in the Mann canon, it falls short of his 1992 masterpiece Last of the Mohicans, which I hold in regard as one of the five best movies ever made.While Mohicans has left Mann with very large shoes to fill, Public Enemies sees Mann return to elements which worked to perfection in the earlier film, seemingly using it as a template to re-attain past glory.Based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34"", it tells the depression-era tale of the virtual blood feud between FBI special agent Melvin Purvis (Bale) and John Dillinger (Depp), and to a lesser extent other gangsters like Baby Face Nelson (Graham), Pretty Boy Floyd (Tatum) and Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis (Ribisi).With the exception of Nelson, Mann relegates the others to little more than filler material to illustrate the world in which Dillinger moved. Capone henchman Frank Nitti (Camp) even makes a few appearances for good measure. None of this amounts to much as it's the manhunt involving Purvis and Dillinger which takes center stage.Facing mounting pressure by nascent FBI director and architect J. Edgar Hoover (Cudrup), Purvis, whose entire career is on the line, revolutionizes detective practices by calling upon the latest technological advancements (archaic by today's standards) such as wiretaps, vinyl recordings of telephone conversations, early forensics and the like to track the nation's criminal prey.Depp's Dillinger is portrayed as a principled gangster who eschews robbing the common man in favor of large banks, and restrains from excess violence, unlike fellow gangster Nelson who is portrayed as an unhinged psychopath.Dillinger's Achilles Heel in this story is former coat check girl Billie Frechette (Cotillard), his love who is exploited by the FBI in their quest to track the charismatic hood.Under Mann's guidance, Depp is allowed to bring his full range of talents to bear in his portrayal of Dillinger, alternately showing the character's ruthlessness, gentlemanly, egalitarian, brazen and egotistical nature. It's a tour-de-force by Depp that doesn't for one second come across as an actor pulling out all the stops.In keeping with the gold-standard artistic template Mann first established with Last of the Mohicans, he makes copious use of a hypnotic orchestral score by Elliot Goldenthal, which evokes strong similarities to the Randy Edelman and Trevor Jones opus that drove Mohicans. And, like many of Mann's films, the film is populated by several extended sequences with little dialog, copious violence, and entrancing orchestral music – all Mann trademarks, and all signs that you're watching a movie created by a truly talented director who knows how to deliver the perfect cinematic blend between artistry and commercialism.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Documentary-style audio diminishes storytelling,"Michael Mann deliberately embraced the HD video camera as a way to shoot in a more documentary style, especially at night. He did that with success in ""Collateral"" (see my review). He evidently tried to up the realism by not only shooting with inferior video (trails from lights), but also inferior audio. I first thought I was being fooled when I first screened the movie. I thought it might be the theatre's sound system. I went to another screening (video projection) which unquestionably had the intended audio mix. My guess is that Mann wanted to mimic what a location sound mixer (which is one of my professions) would do. In this case, you would hear a line delivered very quietly. Then you hear the volume deliberately turned up much louder, as if the sound mixer was compensating for quiet talking. Along with that, the ambient audio is almost nonexistent in some cases. Once again, mimicking the poor sound you get in a low budget documentary, due to the clip-on microphones attached to the actors having a small pickup range. What he apparently wanted to accomplish was the sense we were watching ""Cops"" or something like reality TV. He chose to degrade the quality of the image to cue the audience into believing this was first person footage, like someone in the gang was walking around with a handycam.But it's not a documentary. And the all too perfect production design and all too good-looking cast never take us out of movieland. Then there are the deliberate face close-ups, using the fine grain on the video to emphasise the pores in people's skin. Once again, attempting to feel real, and in this case it does not detract from the story. Seeing the weathered skin on the characters faces helps illustrate the rough texture of their lives. But in pushing the envelope in degrading the video and audio, Mann sacrifices the level of audience involvement, because the trance is broken when they notice something wrong with the audio. Same with the video, when the camera swishes around, creating obvious video trails, you start thinking about the craft instead of the characters. My main complaint is that those who do not recognise the use of bad sound as a directing decision, they will conclude that either the sound mixer did a bad or rush job, or that the theatre itself has a bad sound system.As for the acting and story, Mann put together a detail filled depiction of the 1930's, as seen through the eyes of our main characters. Depp doesn't quite come off as human, only coming close when he admits that he never learned how to dance. His subsequent love interest never has any sparks. There should have been a scene with them being human, such as going bowling or something. Some of the dialogue also feels canned. Even if this is supposed to be a subdued script, the lines delivered sometimes sound cliché. I also applaud directors taking chances, but I think there is a thing as too much, such as too much shakycam (thankfully not in this case). This film has too much of an amateur look and sound for an audience to pay $9 for. I still give this film a thumbs up, especially for the terrific period work and cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Great film, both technically amazing and entertaining","This movie was fantastic.With its A-list cast, and gifted director, this movie was everything I expected from it. All of the cast members gave outstanding depictions of the real life people. It made you feel as if you know the person.Depp, as always, did an excellent job. He made you really believe that even though Dillinger was a bad guy, he had some good qualities about him. Any time that a movie makes you feel sympathetic towards the bad guy, you know the actors have done a great job.Bale, gave another great performance. It was nice to hear his normal voice instead of the deep batman voice as well (haha). He seemed (IMO) to give an accurate portrayal of his character. His language, body language, and just the general tone in which he said certain lines made his character believable as well. You could tell that both Bale and Depp had spent a good amount of time researching their character before filming this movie.Michael Mann, has done it again. Although distracting (FOR SOME), the HD camera really seemed to bring this movie to life for me. Most of the movie was slower (which most seemed to dislike, however I understand why it was necessary), so the camera becoming blurry while trying to focus was never a big problem. The HD cams also brought the shoot outs to life. I felt like the battle was actually happening right in front of me. The muzzle flash from their guns was amazing.Another plus for this movie was that all of the filming locations were historically accurate. They used all of the buildings that the events with Dillinger actually took place in. The theater, the jail, the house in the forest, the sidewalk where he was gunned down...everything was real. The fact that they were able to use these locations for filming was very shocking (For me at least). It was VERY cool to see the place where Dillinger actually stood, and with Johnny Depp's spot on portrayal of him, it seemed like the real Dillinger was their again in the present day.Overall, this was an outstanding movie. Both technically, and for entertainment purposes. It had everything that it needed in it. Amazing actors, great story, historically accurate, love, comedic relief, action scenes, etc. This film couldn't have been any better, and I highly encourage everyone to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Visceral and raw - excellent job by Mann and co.,"I loved it, as well as the 2 other women I went with - yes, we like Johnny Depp in general and are already buzzing about the planned? Dark Shadows, but even the best actors in the world can make a dog of a movie.I'm not real familiar with Mann's work or what some of the fussing was about, but I think I caught on fast as to what the director was portraying, and he did it beautifully, with a raw, visceral film - you can feel the rain on your face, and feel the branches scratching you as the actors run through the woods - you can feel the cold. And a kind of building bad coming, with a terrific soundtrack to match. Yet other scenes are simply gorgeous.Generally disliking romances (not all) I was very happy with the tragic, mature adult treatment of the relationship, and I enjoyed Marion Cotillard's performance. Without question Depp shone in this (I was dubious about this part for this actor) - you forget it's Depp. As an actor he seems to be so completely immersed. I thought all the performances and casting were excellent, the biggest surprise to me was Christian Bale who I have always thought of as the world's flattest and most boring leading man. Here, (especially if you have read about the real Purvis) he conveys an unassuming, dedicated, even conflicted leader with a kind of almost delicate subtlety - impressive. The jail scene between Depp and Bale was particularly good, not over-the-top testosterone but realistic.Only complaints - our theater had the sound problems as well, as thought the sound would fade and get loud again - obnoxious. Some of the shots made our eyes swim into focus. Overall I would like to shake Mann's end for a fine, fine movie and it's treatment - definitely want to see again and definitely one for the DVD collection. Personally I can't understand what the complaints are about, the approach Mann took was very refreshing and drops you right into the ride. It's like reading a very good, mature, intelligently written, REALISTIC, book - settle in and enjoy, although parts are very grim there are a few laughs here and there to ease things.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"This movie is like Dillingers life: short, fast, and loud.","The 1920s/30s would be an exciting time period to live in if you're involved in crime. It was a time full of gangsters like Al Capone, Baby-face Nelson, Pretty boy Floyd, and of course John Dillinger. These criminals were more famous than celebrities and lived like kings, if only for a short while. This was also the birth of the FBI, and the police weren't afraid to use brutal tactics to punish lawbreakers. So brutal that folks like Dillinger were revered as heroes to the public, a modernized Robin Hood.Director Michael Mann (Heat, Miami Vice) tries to do this time period justice with his new film Public Enemies. It focuses on the most famous bank robber, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), and the FBI agent charged with hunting him, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). This film covers only the last year of Dillinger's life, but it is by far his most interesting year. Dillinger escapes from jail, twice, and commits dozens of bank robberies with the likes of Baby-face Nelson and John ""Red"" Hamilton.I'll go ahead and get this out of the way, Public Enemies is not as good as other gangster movies like Scorsese's various films or Mann's own Heat, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Johnny Depp is once again brilliant in his portrayal of Dillinger, and it also helps that he looks spookily similar to the man. It is quite obvious that Mann chose not to make this yet another romantic legend of Dillinger, but instead it's almost a documentary focusing on showing what the famous robber was really like. An example of this is that unlike the urban legend of the ""lady in the red dress"", she was actually wearing a simple white shirt with an orange skirt. He wasn't a peoples' hero stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, but a cunning thief and a cold blooded killer. Mann also quickly establishes that Dillinger cares about nothing except what is happening at that moment, like he says in the film, ""We are having much too good of a time today to even be thinking about tomorrow."" Michael Mann continues to show his prowess at creating extraordinary gun fights, and there is a shootout about every 15 minutes. The sound mixing is so well that it feels like they are shooting old Thompson machine guns right next to you. The sets are also extremely detailed and accurate, and Mann even filmed the famous gunfight in the Wisconsin forest in the exact spot where Dillinger fought off and escaped the FBI, but it's hard to see these things because the movie is paced like Dillinger's life, fast and loud. It's also worth noting that the entire cast does a great job in this movie, especially Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard.It's almost like a double edged sword for Mann, focusing on the facts and not the legend, because he had to sacrifice good character development and script. Almost all the other characters and their relationships in the movie seem really frail, since they lack scenes that help set up who exactly they are. The main relationship between Dillinger and his girlfriend Billy (Marion Cotillard) seems really forced and is difficult to connect with. As accurate as the movie is, it does change a few famous deaths around to fit in the movie (since in real life they were killed after Dillinger), and this doesn't work well. At the end it makes Dillinger seem a little weak and all alone, instead of the powerful criminal mastermind he actually was.Overall, Public Enemies isn't perfect, probably won't get an Oscar best pic nomination like some were hoping for, but its still a good flick. Unlike the other hyped summer movies like Terminator Salvation and Transformers, this is actually one film that I want to see again.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"The modern, unwatchable, movie...","What a shame. Of all directors, Michael Mann, who has proved that he can make good films again and again, goes off the deep end. Maybe he feels he's getting old and wanted to prove he can use the hippest, grooviest new style just like the young people do.Whatever his reasons, he has rendered an unwatchable movie, coalescing all the worst techniques into one long aggravating disaster. Shaky-cam, jerky-cam, bumpy-cam, jitter- cam. Long, lingering ultra-closeups obscuring high tension action sequences. Disgustingly self-indulgent directing in which Mann as much as says, yeah, there's a lot going on back there but I'm not showing it to you. I'm showing this part of a guy's face, and that's all you get to see.The movie hardly tells any story at all. There are long, elaborate sequences of events that NEVER HAPPENED IN DILLINGER'S LIFE. Important characters in Dillinger's life go unnamed in the movie, events are shown and not explained so today's audience misses their significance. And so little story is told, that it's as if Mann thinks he's made a film for a new generation audience who don't care to know anything about the people and events, all they want is the barest thread leading from action sequence to action sequence.And maybe he's right. This may be the wave of the future, unwatchable movies that don't tell a story about famous names from our past, names everybody recognizes but nobody remembers much about, so writers can be free to make up anything at all and not be tied down to actual events. Wonderful.I spent about a third of this abomination with my eyes actually closed, trying to avoid a headache. Most of the rest was marginally viewable and deadly dull. I actually reviewed all the teams in the NFL for a while trying to think of the answer to a TV game show question, ""Name two of the 5 NFL teams named for birds."" The contestant got the Cardinals and the Eagles so the show didn't show the other 3. I got the Falcons and Seahawks right away, but not number 5. Two days later, during this movie, I took the time to review all the teams geographically starting in New England and going counterclockwise through the northern states, down the west coast, across to Florida and finally up the east coast to the Baltimore Ravens. That's almost the whole NFL, and it provided a nice vacation from the dreck on the screen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
the story,"the only sin is the manner to present the story. not the absence of inspiration but the lost of courage to transform it in more than adaptation from American event from inter-war period. and the sin is great for the use of great actors from sketches of characters. but, despite that, it is not a bad film. the good parts are not small and the work of actors for give more credibility to characters remains meritorious. but the story is not seductive and remains only a cold story. despite large possibilities. despite the delicate flavor of atmosphere. its virtue - beginning point for discover an American history episode. is it enough ? maybe not. but that is the basic thing who remains after the end of Public Enemies show.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mann's magical work on the soundtrack continues,"Mann's choice of music amazes me once again. His re-use of ""Beam"" from Malick-Hans Zimmer composition from ""The Thin Red Line"" towards the end, with proper credits to the original film. Then there is the talented Elliot Goldenthal who was a shade better in Mann's ""Heat"" a work that ought to have won him laurels but didn't.Mann's falling back on actors he trusts is another laudable fact-- Stephen Lang (used first in ""Manhunter,"" and now again in the final scene of ""Public Enemies""). That's just one example among many.Mann was much better in ""Heat"" his best work, though in ""Public Enemies"" he retained the great team of ""Heat"" cinematographer Dante Spinotti and composer Goldenthal.The film was entertaining but not as gripping as ""Heat."" I tend to see Mann's films mainly to study his soundtrack management, which is amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

HK Neo Reviews: Public Enemies,"Tagline: Depp is exceptional, but nothing really happensReview by Neo: I am disappointed. Basically, the line before this summed up the whole movie. Public Enemies is one of my most anticipated films of the year. The trailer looked tight, slick, interesting, historic and bombastic. However, as the credit rolls, the film is clocked far too long (almost 3 hours of running time) and the very fact that nothing really happens. True, some may argue that all real life 1930s bank robber –John Dillinger (played sublimely by Johnny Depp) did was robbing banks. I pose the question, does it really require three valuable hours of screen time to visualise the tale? Sure, director Michael Mann is going for the being the real for the realist stake, but by the end of the film, the audience does not feel for a single thing for Depp and with three hours of prior investment, it is bounded to disappoint, even the most patient of human species.The movie goes like this: Johnny Depp is a serial bank robber who roams around the country of USA, for one mission – to rob banks and escape from jails. In the process he met a beautiful Marion Cotillard and hook up with her. Basically the film is about the life of a bank robber who constantly outsmarts his police counterparts with an underlying passion for robbing banks and the girl in red.As mentioned before, the film fails by not only being too simple, but rather far too realistic for its own good. If the film clocked just 2 hours, then perhaps it is still plausible, but the fact that it requires 3 hours of longevous running time to express something so simple, it feels more like a waste of time. That's not to say that director Michael Mann did a bad job, as the direction can easily be described as simple and effective and some scenes especially the numerous bank robberies and chasing scenes are crucially well-staged. However, the film just fails to connect and after investing 3 hours, one would really expect a lot more.After all these cons, I guess you are probably wandering if this movie is really worthy of a review. I must admit that I was rather impressed by the performance of Johnny Depp. Not only does he resemble the real-life bank robber, John Dillinger, he is probably the only reason why I was able to stay awake for the duration. Depp easily outshines fellow co-star, Christian Bale (as the head copper chasing after Depp and his gang). It is not an understatement to claim that Depp have menacing charisma and irresistible screen presence. The manner and the way he picked up Marion Cotilard were cheesy yet extremely effective and memorable. I still recall, the moment Marion claims: ""I don't even know you"" and Depp smartly replies: ""I like fast cars, whiskey and you, what more do you need to know?"" Now that's a rare moment of cinematic magic and perfect comic timing. I do still strongly believe that it takes a character and the calibre of Depp, to pull a line like that so seamlessly. The only flaw here is really the manner and the way the film ended, with the audience lacking in any sort of emotional attachment to Depp's character. However, to me personally, I do not believe it is right to push the blame to Depp and rather attribute the blame towards director Mann instead. A wondrous and catchy display from the dependable Depp and the chemistry between Depp and Marion is just realistic and naturalistic enough to be believable.Christian Bale is a brilliant actor with a crappy voice, but here, he is simply overshadowed, out-classed by the inflatable Depp. As the police counterpart, Bale has the determination and desperation of the required part, but just somehow fails to shine. It is a good performance by all means, but just nothing stunning or memorable. Marion Cotilard is a classic beaut of the French Cinema and her display here is both captivating and perhaps the most humane of the pack. Cotilard was last seen in Hollywood starring alongside Russell Crowe in A Good Year, portrays a character with some degree of emotional depth. The scene in the interrogation room is both brave and confronting. Not to forget, Depp and Cotilard are a fine couple and the fact that both are each other needs, made them all the more convincing.All in all, Public Enemies is by no means a total failure, with some fine acting turns from Depp and Cotilard and adequate support from Bale. The film fails to hit its mark by simply being too realistic for the audience to become involved in any of the proceedings. Director Michael Mann, usually have an excellent track record and films like Collateral, Aviator and Heat speaks for itself. Here, Mann has lost that humane touch, by resembling too much to the real-life story. True, Dillinger at its very centre of its core is only a guy who strive and thrills himself by robbing banks and bedding women, but this is a cinematic experience, not exactly a semi-documentary. The result is leaving the audience exhausted and frustrated, by the time the credits begin to hover. In fact, I was left quite empty, disappointed and the feeling of ""nothing really happened"", therefore given the three hours duration; it is probably not too self fish for demanding a little more  (Neo 2009)I rate it 6/10www.thehkneo.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Superb Movie!,"Me being a fan of gangster flicks like The Godfather and American Gangster, I was really looking forward to seeing Public Enemies, and it didn't disappoint. Johnny Depp did a great job at playing the notorious bank robber John Dillinger. Marion Cotillard did a great job as John Dillinger's girl, Billie Frechette. The movie definitely had that 1930's feel to it thanks to the cars, the buildings, and the actors' wardrobe. The movie definitely keeps you interested in the story and it's definitely worth seeing. However, if you hate long movies, it's 2 hrs 23 min, so if thats going to be a problem for you, then i think you might want to wait for this one on DVD and Blu-Ray.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I enjoyed it immensely.,"I just watched it a second time after nine years. Very good. Johnny Depp from back when he made half-way decent films.Flawed?

If anyone tells you otherwise, send the fools away because they are fools.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Some style or substance or anything,"If the motives of the depression era gangsters were indeed as murky as the lighting and editing of ""Public Enemies"" then there may have been a better story to be told. In reality, they were thrill-seeking predators who lived as long as time permitted. Michael Mann sees no need to limit the time it takes him to tell his stories, and he certainly has little care for his audience's time.The film feels under lit, often out of focus, and scenes play with little sense of dramatic or cinematic structure. Characters become difficult to distinguish from each other and often it is hard to figure out really what is at stake other than the inevitable capture of Dillinger. The editing in the first half of the film is particularly gratuitous and confusing when coupled with the hand held camera work and dour, flat lighting; the viewer's eye can make no sense of the composition or relationship of shot to shot and is instead presented with a scramble of action.There have been so many well told depression era gangster stories over the years, but ""Public Enemies"" will not rank among them, as in general, the amount of talent that is ultimately squandered in this film, from the cast, Director of Photography, and Editors, to the score and Sound Mixing, illustrates that Michael Mann is a man not unlike Dillinger in his own way: it is inevitable that he will continue to go on until someone stops him.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
isn't that good,"I didn't like it at all, I was suspecting to see another crime epic like The Untouchables, but I was wrong. Bale and Depp doesn't act bad, but I don't know, seems to me like they both played a version of themselves instead of the characters they were supposed to portray. Depp looks like Depp this time, he has no wig or something, in Public Enemies he looks just like himself and that is a shame, I know Depp could have act much better, people who see this movie will agree: he's just himself, he's not Dillinger. Lawrence Tierney was Dillinger in one of the first movies about the life of JD (Johnny Depp/John Dillinger?) and he did it good, he was a real JD. Christian Bale had got the same problem: he doesn't act at all. in fact, his appearance here reminded me at the part he played in American Psycho. conclusion: Public Enemies isn't that good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not America's Most Wanted,"On paper, ""Public Enemies"" looks like a promising venture. Fans of Michael Mann's ""Heat"" know that he can spin an engaging crime yarn and with Johnny Depp & Christian Bale in major roles it seems like a can't miss. Unfortunately, this exploration of John Dillinger's life in crime comes up short.Johnny Depp can't be faulted here as he capably carries the film. The film also features good work from the other stars (Christian Bale & Marion Cotillard) along with solid support from the rest of the large cast, including Billy Crudup, among others.Where the film falters is in the script. The story is somewhat overlong and meandering and I also find that it treats Dillinger too favourably while not really capturing what made him tick. It's certainly less compelling than, say, Arthur Penn's romanticization of Bonnie & Clyde.Michael Mann's direction is well done, though, and the film is quite nice to look at. Musically, the film doesn't really stand out but that's not a major concern.In the end, ""Public Enemies"" is a decent gangster flick that falls short of expectations. Depp's performance and Mann's direction make the film worth watching but they only offer a taste of what could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not The Greatest,"There are some pretty cool scenes in this movie. One is the breaking out of jail scene with John Dillinger.

It was a so so effort.6 stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Not actually bad, but not good.","This film is a disappointment. Johnny Depp is rather good as the bank robber John Dillinger, and Christian Bale is not bad as Melvin Purvis, the agent chasing him. However, put simply, it feels rushed. The cinematography is ineffective and spastic, and the editing fails to make the story interesting. Perhaps these things needed more time given to them. It's actually boring, which is not what's expected of a gangster film. Without that attention to detail, it ends up simplistic but busy, a bad combination.The director of photography also did LA Confidential, so it's difficult to blame him for the uninteresting look of the movie. There are two chase scenes which echo each other, one through an orchard during the day and one through the woods at night, which were done well. Most of the action scenes are just bullets spraying everywhere while people run around, with only rare attention paid to constructing a coherent sequence of events. The camera is far too jerky, far too often. Michael Mann is probably to blame for all of this, as the director.Weak story, uninteresting flow, and visuals without enough punch add up to make this one a waste of time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Waste of time,"I watched 51 minutes of this film.I was bored from minute No. 1.Crime isn't romantic. It's losers wasting their lives and harming others. Now, if this had been a film about why he turned out the way he did, or at least a go at realism about criminals, it might have been ineresting.Romanticised, I find it abhorring. The thirties weren't this clean, cool and cinematograhic. Come on! If this were tongue-in-cheek, I might applaud the stylishness, but I'm just bored with the perfect pictures and the bland story.I chose to not let my time get wasted one minute longer.Something I very rarely do. But time is all I have and wasted on so many things I have no control over, that this time I used my remote control and directly stopped the DVD.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Greatest Hits version of the life of John Dillinger.,"I really wish Johnny Depp would play ""normal"" guys like this more often. His acting talent is more apparent when he's in a role that's not defined by eccentricity. The guy made a fine Dillinger, I must admit.Public Enemies breezes through the more interesting parts of Dillinger's criminal career, without getting bogged down in any origins or psychological justification for his behavior. He was just a man who liked fast money and the things that came along with it. This isn't a historically precise, complex character study, it's just an entertaining romanticization of a very notorious man.Along with Depp, you have a plethora of talent actors and actresses who are either in love with Dillinger, helping him, or trying to bring him down. This is a seriously impressive cast, from headliners like Cotillard and Bale, to small but appreciated cameos from Emilie de Ravin and Carey Mulligan. There's a great actor everywhere you look, in Public Enemies. That's one of the many things to like about the movie. It brings the ""summer blockbuster"" feel to a genre that isn't normally associated with that idea, and it does it well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies Independent Movie Review,"The name John Dillinger didn't mean a lot to me until I went to see Public Enemies. I actually didn't know much about the film going into it, except that it starred Johnny Depp (Kudo's to the marketing department). Upon closer look, the names Christian Bale and Michael Mann came to light, further increasing my curiosity. Truth be told, I went to the theater planning to see the new Transformers flick (which one of my friends fails to acknowledge even exists), but due to a timing error (you dropped the ball, Google!), chose to see Public Enemies instead.

Michael Mann is back!,"Firstly, let me say, that I have given up all trust and faith in film reviews. How 'The Times' could rate this 2 out of 5 I have no idea. Metacritic averages around 50% I think for this title, highly variable opinions. But then again, how could I place my trust in the judgement of yuppie journalists with nothing better to do than slag off the works of others.Anyway, on with my review! Minus the shoddy cinematography towards the start of the film, and some poorly captured dialogue (sound-wise), this film is up there with the all-time greats! Johnny Depp delivers a stellar performance as always, the man exudes charisma and really does a great job at portraying John Dillinger as a lovable rogue rather than a cold blooded villain, in fact he's almost one of the good guys when compared to the character of baby-face nelson, brilliantly portrayed by Stephen Graham (Tommy from Snatch). Even Marion Cottillard plays her role to the tee, superb. Most Gangster's chicks drive me nuts (Penelope Cruz in Blow, I wanted to slap her!) but Dillingers girl was a real babe, down to ride in any situation! And she never sold him out, not once! The film does away with the classic rise and fall formula and focuses more on 'the fall'. The pace is relentless and bullets in abundance. I really enjoyed it throughout. If anything, I'm a big fan of Christian Bale, but his character seemed to lack something, he had a certain emptiness about him, but then again I think this was intentionally done.Some of the cinematography seemed quite shoddy at the beginning of the film but this soon went away, whether I was so engrossed that I no longer noticed it or whether Mann had simply 'found his mojo'? I don't know, but its really not bad enough to justify the poor reviews I have seen. Some people clearly don't like these sorts of movies, I wouldn't write a review on something like 'Gone With The Wind' because that is clearly not my thing.John Dillinger says ""I like baseball, good clothes, fast cars and you."" Well I like all that and Gangster films so this was right up my street. Ladies and gentleman, if you want to see a heart thumping gangster flick with the pace of a fighter jet and more bullets than the u.s army, this is for you. If not then go watch something pretentious, but don't go slagging this off with your yuppie articles in your local paper because I'm sick of reading them.If you took a hardcore football fan to the opera or ballet, you wouldn't expect a glowing review of his experience would you? So why on earth are upper class yuppie journalists who much prefer the latest pretentious low budget love flick to come out of Cannes attempting to pass judgement on a big budget gangster flick of this caliber?! I'm so riled up right now, I'm sure the real John Dillinger would have loved Public Enemies and so did I! It may have received good press but I never thought much of Collateral anyway, so well done Michael Mann!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Great story, but annoying cinematography","I really love that playing a normal person is finally a novel enough prospect to attract Johnny Depp. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. The story was well written, moved quickly and kept my interest throughout the film.My only complaint, (and it's enough that I deducted two points for it in my vote), was the cinematography. I suppose it was an effort to capture the flavor of the early 1930's in which the story takes place, but the camera was shaken so much and so frequently that I actually wound up looking away part of the time because it was too hard to focus and it became unpleasant. This is not a good sign when the whole purpose of watching a movie is exactly that - to WATCH.Low lighting and a fuzzy camera were also used for the same purpose. These were quite effective in my opinion and didn't bother me at all. They could have - and SHOULD have - stuck to that. Shaking the camera seems to be a disturbingly popular trend in new movies these days. I sure hope they wise up and STOP. In the old days they couldn't help it, but there's no excuse for it now and in my opinion, no use for it either. Fewer extreme close-ups would have been better too.Otherwise it was a great film and I do sincerely recommend it on your list of movies to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Intense and originally shot gangster movie,"I saw this movie as a second choice, since the picture I meant to see was sold out at the movie-theatre, but although not being my favourite genre, I really appreciated it. The myth of John Dillinger is brought to vivid life by Johnny Depp who hits the sign, by offering a truly strong and deeply convincing performance. We do not come to know much about this rob-banker, except he loves robbing and planning robbing banks, he is a highly professional man, and committed to his job, he never retreats, he never gives up, he is honest and sincere, that's what makes Billie Frechette fall in love with him. I really liked her character, very intensively interpreted by Marion Cotillard: at the beginning she appears as a fragile woman, in search of protection, but as the story progresses, she proves strength, in the way she stays next to her man in the most tragic moments. Although we do not see much about their relationship, although they do not say much to each other (Dilliger once says to her: ""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars and you. What else you need to know?""), they are deeply in love, being their love founded on sincerity from the beginning, and the only moment, a very touching one, when Dilliger laughs (he generally shows a hard, almost insensitive face) is when he gives her the fur-coat as a present. The movie is very well built, the original and expressionistic use of camera-work makes everything sound very realistic and involving, although sometimes too indulging in violence. The script is very intelligent and made alive by a talented cast. And, let me address to the female public, Johnny Depp in a white shirt and a black suit is really worth the ticket!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
What happened to good cinematography?,"I've been a huge fan of Mann's since Miami Vice and Spinotti is one of my favorite DPs.That said, I find myself struggling to understand the aesthetic for the cinematography of this film. It's underlit, with a lot of pure black dominating the frame in almost every scene. Night exteriors are severely underlit and even night interiors lack detail in shadow areas to the degree that it just looks like a mistake.The hand held camera work is shaky, but not shaky in a good way. Many closeups and medium shots of people delivering dialog have sudden spastic shakes and just are generally awkward. I'm a huge proponent of hand held shooting and thought The Constant Gardner was a very good example of this style of shooting while this film had a lot of ugly camera work in general that I would never expect to see in a big budget studio film.The overall ""look"" of the film with its TV news-video feel was off putting and made me feel (constantly) like I was watching a low budget film shot on some old analog video camera. When I take the time and spend 10 bucks to see a movie in the theater, I want it to LOOK like a movie, not a student film.The skin tones were hideous, looked very harsh, and screamed VIDEO every time I saw a closeup of an actor.Did Mann and Spinotti spend only 1/10 of their lighting budget and pocket the rest?Are Mann and Spinotti ""breaking new ground"" with a brave new gritty approach?I just don't know.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Beautifully Composed, but Lacks Narrative Drive","The scenes in ""Public Enemies"" are beautifully composed. You know you're watching a film by a veteran director with a film school education. The Depression period of brand-name outlaws like John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd, and the nascent FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, is a fascinating one, and it is recreated here with great attention to fedoras, overcoats, and vintage cars. The soundtrack is lovely and works very well with the images on screen. The film lacks narrative drive, though. It never brings its characters to three dimensional life. As much as I enjoyed all the serious fedora-wearing going on, I was tempted to walk out. There was no narrative drive or tension, and no characters I deeply cared about, gluing me to the screen.Johnny Depp is handsome as ever and exudes movie star charisma, but he is a bad choice for Dillinger. He's ten years too old. Dillinger and many of the other Depression-era outlaws were notorious for their youth, their life on the edges of mainstream society, and their desperation. Depp never looks like a desperate, edgy, young, outsider. He looks like a suave CEO. Christian Bale is as focused and fascinating as ever. In a very brief role, Marion Cotillard is most sympathetic as Dillinger's moll, Billie Frechette. I would really like to see a movie, based on a more powerful script, that featured this same cast.The film falls into the trap of glamorizing Dillinger, turning him into a tender, devoted, poetic lover. Um  mebbe not. Dillinger had been a thug all his life, beating up other kids in school, quitting good jobs, committing petty crimes, and never learning his lesson. There were reasons why frightened Depression-era Americans, feeling betrayed by banks, glamorized outlaws like Dillinger. I suspect that the loved ones of those men Dillinger and others like him killed would feel differently. The film could have taken up that tough question – why we humans put murderers, from Dillinger to Stalin – on pedestals – but it never does.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
People should not get annoyed that this film is historically inaccurate!,"I enjoyed this film though was confused at the plot at times, as all the men looked the same ( which i find is the case in many testosterone fuelled action films!)Admittedly i don't know much about John Dillinger but this film was made to entertain, and so obviously the film makers were going to pick the aspects of his character and life that they found suited the tone and flow of the film.If u are interested in the life of John Dillenger maybe don't take this film too seriously and read a history book about him as well. However i thought it was beautifully shot and the costumes and sets are wonderful, and really create the glamour of the rich in America in this time.Johnny Depp is flawless in in work, though maybe the script let him down at times, leaving him little space for character development.Marion Cotillard is stunning, and really steals the limelight in every frame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Depp's shootout,"Johnny Depp is very capable in the role of John Dillinger. He's a great actor, but besides Depp and a fine supporting role by Bale, there's not all that much which is great about the acting in this movie. The movie feels very conventional to me. It's good but it's never special. This is not to say the movie doesn't have good point. The set pieces are all very top notch as well. This is a very good movie to look at, everything looks authentic 1930s.But there have been movies like this before, movies about convicts on the loose with lots of firepower and a hatred of the police, Bonnie & Clyde is one excellent movie about this topic. It's similarly based on a true story although there is a lot of artistic license being used.I never felt that kind of excitement in Public Enemies. There's lots of shooting but that seems to have taken the precedent over any character development.I would have liked to get to know Christian Bale's character more as well as some of the other officers in the then newly created FBI trying to catch Dillinger. Dillinger's comrades also seem to get a once over.Depp is good as always and it's nice to see him in a different kind of role for him (something outside of a Tim Burton film) but the story felt like it could have been a lot better. We've all seen shootouts captured on screen before but this movie should have been more about the characters than their actions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Public Enemy, but not Chuck Dee Public Enemy Public Enemy","Decent Michael Mann movie. Kept me riveted to the chair as I was watching it, and I don't demand much more of a movie.A few points of gratuitous criticism, though:*The movie takes a few too many liberties with history; I realise this is not a History Channel documentary, but it should at least loosely adhere to the real order of things; to point out one rub, we see Pretty Boy Floyd getting shot at the beginning of the movie, although he was actually killed after Dillinger.*Most of the movie is shot in digital video, on a Sony HD video camera; I was disappointed. The images were grainy and too contrasty, and even skewed -- circles looked like ellipses. The few scenes shot on regular film were a visual relief. Basically the cinematography was crap.*In one scene a fed beats a girl and is wrestled down to the ground by his boss. I found that scene unbelievable and gratuitous -- after all, innocent bystanders are getting killed, and a hard-as-nails cop takes umbrage against a gangster moll being roughed up?*Unlike shown in the movie, Dillinger was dating other women than Billie Frechette; e. g. the girl he went to the Biograph with was his actual-life girlfriend.*Unfortunately, the movie makes no mention of the Great Depression and the economic circumstances it was set in. In the current economic crisis, many people would have liked to see more of the situation in a previous one.*A few scenes didn't gel. For example, I could have sworn that Dillinger got shot dead in the Little Bohemia shootout scene, and in the next scene he's jumping around. Maybe I'm just slow.What I really did enjoy were the cinema gags. For example, Dillinger sits in the cinema when the lights go on and the voice from the silver screen tells viewers to look left and right if their seatmate is John Dillinger.I also liked the detail of Dillinger going with the times and sporting a (badly cut) Clark Gable-moustache at the end of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Christian Bale out-acts John Depp,"Although the movie was good it failed to live to my expectations, The story flows good and over production is well done aside from the cinematography, god scenes and good soundtrack.

Watching the movie was like running through a forest the only thing you see is a flash of objects as you pass. Stephen Graham (Baby Face Nelson) was awesome also just a great character you love to hate a very convincing role.

Formidable addition to the gangster genre,"Michael Mann is a fine director known for his male movies from ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" to ""The Kingdom"", often featuring real-life male characters as in ""The Insider"", ""Ali"" and ""The Aviator"", and frequently focusing on criminality as in ""Heat"", ""Collateral"" and ""Miami Vice"". ""Public Enemies"" then - set in crime-ridden 1930s America and telling the tale of flamboyant bank robber and prison escapee John Dillinger - is quintissential Mann.

What is new is the use by cinematographer Dante Spinotti of high definition video which, together with scrupulous attention to period detail, makes this a true evocation of the period and, together with interesting use of colour and intense sharpness of sound, creates an absorbing movie that one simply has to see at the cinema to enjoy the full richness of the work.For all the bank robbing and gun fighting, this is essentially a human story and inevitably comparisons will be made with ""Heat"". Again we have the lawless and the lawman as complex, committed but somewhat taciturn figures circling one another plot-wise and only once actually meeting face to face. The charismatic Johnny Depp plays Dillinger, while Christan Bale is his nemesis FBI agent Melvin Purvis, in accomplished performances backed up by a succession of strong minor appearances. For me, the one female role - Marion Cotillard as Dillinger's moll Billie - does not work as it should and it's hard to understand why he would take such risks for such a tepid character.Based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34"" and with a screenplay partly written by Mann himself, Dillinger is presented in a rather sympathetic light as a kind of latter-day Robin Hood, adding colour and escapism to the dreary lives of Depression-era Americans. It's not always clear what is being said and what is happening, but inevitably one is swept along in a work that, while long (140 minutes), is never boring. It may not have the pacing and drama - and that station shoot-out - of ""The Untouchables"", but ""Public Enemies"" is a worthy addition to the gangster genre.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""What else do you need to know?""","This is one of those rare cases where a director actually gets in the way of his own best intentions. Michael Mann is a smart director, sometimes so smart that one can see other movies pale in comparison to his distinctive voice and style. But he's also gone the way of David Lynch and Robert Rodriguez, shunning celluloid for digital video (you can say HD but you can't fool me, it's *digital* and it's *video*) no matter what the project may entail. His run in the new medium, this time DoP'd by a former Mann collaborator (previously amazing work in The Insider), started promisingly enough with Collateral, then he took a decent detour with Miami Vice, and now we come to this, a period piece shot and edited with an equal amount of professionalism and amateurish-ness that is hard for the mind to boggle with.Maybe there will be a lot in the audience that won't notice it. And yet for every scene here or there that is brilliantly shot, or a scene where the drama becomes intense and everything gels, there are many scenes that feel rushed, with some compositions way too over-exposed or just looking, well, like a video as opposed to some blockbuster gangster picture. And maybe it's partly my fault for ""not getting it"", so to speak, that this is the way that movies will go into. But where-as Lynch's use of DV is like out of a surrealist's laboratory, and Rodriguez provides a clear sense of visual effects, Mann's skills as a director of drama and action seem amiss from the looks of Public Enemies. Too often I found myself being pulled out of the narrative, however loose it sometimes was, with digital 'noise' and uneven lighting got in the way (i.e unnecessary sound and bits of information that HD picks up naturally).But hey, what am I doing going on about all this technical stuff. The question really is this: is Public Enemies worth seeing? Yes and no. No for the technical reasons I mentioned, not to mention some scenes going on for a little too long (it's appropriately epic at 2 1/2 hours) and for some lack of character psychology or development save for Dillinger and possibly Cotillard's Billie. Yes because it is an enveloping bank robber saga more often than not, and it features more than a few pieces of really terrific acting. Some criticism has fallen the film for there not being enough narrative 'focus', but on its quasi-conventional terms in the scope of the gangster movie, there is a compelling story in there, somewhere.And Johnny Depp - he's so on here that it's hard to see him when he's 'off' really, and he makes this Dillinger a striking force, charismatic and suave, with that glint of danger always there, and a certain devilishness that he makes this real-life ""folk-hero"" his own (my favorite of this kind of quality Depp brings comes when Dilinger sneaks into the HQ of the Dilinger-Manhunt station and nobody recognizes him). In a way Depp helps to project a similar slick panache the film carries, and between him and a couple of exciting/incredibly bloody shoot-outs, it is at least a curious viewing to see him. Bale, too has his moments, if a little more straightforward in the two-dimensional Melvin Purvis. Big points also go to a great caricature of a 30's figure of J Edgar Hoover by Billy Crudup. And, lastly, Cotillard in her first big Hollywood starring role following her Oscar win is impressive, if only in the last few reels when the intensity builds on her vs. Dillinger vs. the FBI.So what is Public Enemies? It's not a return to form nor a total embarrassment. It's got the fabric and texture of the 30s, the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cars down very well and the look of the film, crystal clear and muddy in a single scene, contradicts this. It's got a purpose, but its soul is contaminated in an odd way. Mann can be commended for giving a try at taking his digital technology in a ""period"" piece, but at the end of it all, when the final line it uttered, the results are 50/50 at best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Depp and Bale as Public Enemies,"Depp and Bale as Public Enemies ""But the best rejoinder to Public Enemies is Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal video, which I watched again after the singer-dancer's inevitable, untimely death. It's a tommy-gun gangster fantasia with a touch of Guys and Dolls, and it's everything Public Enemies isn't: madly inventive, genre-bending, a passionate tribute to the artist as outlaw-loner.""See nymag.com, daily, movies, 2009, 06, The_incidental_pleasures_of_pu.htmlI can not remember so many restless fans at any big budget motion picture as this one. People got up for bathroom breaks, cell phone calls and greasy smelling popcorn.But that is not the story. The story of Public Enemies is not the smooth and stoic good looks of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale either. The story is writer/director Michael Mann.Mann has after all, created some enduring pieces of colloid art. He pitted Tom Cruise against Jamie Foxx in Collateral. He gave us Will Smith in Ali. He exposed Big Tobacco in The Insider with Russell Crowe.But most importantly, Mann brought the heroic epic of great American literary writer, James Fenimore Cooper, to the screen with an incredible performance by Daniel Day Lewis in The Last of the Mohicans.It is that masterful blend of music, courage, Madeline Stowe's good looks and the sheer beauty of a raw, untouched wilderness - all of which are ripe with the potential for a rich, prosperous future - that Mann attempts to recapture with Public Enemies.Billie Crudup, who we saw in Almost Famous, gives a performance as a young, tough J. Edgar Hoover, with ever present Clyde Tolson by his side, which should give a serious notch up in his career.So like Mohicans, this is three grim, determined men striving for their objectives, against all odds, regardless of cost. Unlike Mohicans however, this epic suffers.Here there is no Stowe or wilderness beauty. Marion Cotillard gave a Oscar winning performance as singer Edith Piaf (2007), but her talent is wasted here as Dillinger's girlfriend. With a few exceptions, she just does not have the lines or the beauty to vault this over the top as another extra-ordinary Mann epic.Depp? Of course, he is wonderful. Both he and Bale enjoy long close-ups that should make their agents happy. Yet there are little to endear either the Dillinger or FBI man Purvis characters to us. As Dillinger, Depp is no charming Warren Beatty, for example, in Bonnie and Clyde. We don't see his youth or scenes with his mentor.Same with Bale. Mann uses Bale's narrow jaw to indicate Purvis' resolute determination to catch the bad guys, even if it means using techniques that a modern, enlighten citizenry finds squeamish, possibly immoral. But we never learn anything personal about Purvis. Otherwise, Bale does NOT have a lot of emotion or catchy lines either.Here the musical score does not uplift the tale. It fills quiet scenes with heroic feeling, only to be punctuated with the incessant pop-pop chatter of Tommy-guns. Not even an appearance and song by smooth jazz great Diana Krall can lift the music of this film.Lest you think ""the lady doth protest too much,"" this is still a good film. I simply don't think it is worthy of a $10 go-see-it-now on the big screen ticket. Better make it a rental. One where you can go for bathroom breaks, cell phone calls and greasy popcorn without missing much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Crime doesn't pay,"The expression is as trite as this movie. Dillinger thought he was smarter than the G-men and he wasn't even though it wouldn't have taken much. There is no new insight into what drives a person to a life of crime, though Johnny Depp does try to infuse some humanity into the empty script he's given.I think the script is the main problem here. Depp does what he can, but Marion Cotillard is heroic, making a real person emerge from the zilch she is given in the script.Big actors filled many of the minor parts -- Billy Crudup shows a side of J. Edgar Hoover (the young side) that we haven't seen before. Somebody should make a film of Ken Ackerman's Young J.

Nearly A Classic...,"Public Enemies is Set during the Great Depression, it focuses on the true story of FBI agent Melvin Purvis's attempt to stop criminals John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Pretty Boy Floyd. The film is an adaptation of Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933.'Public Enemies' Directed by Michael Mann is a well-made film, that takes you back in they day of need. The Legendary Feud between the FBI & Dillinger & co, is executed in a mature manner. This 128 minutes long old time story is worth a watch for it's excellent direction by Mann, outstanding action sequences & First-rate performances.Going by who's better in terms of Performance, it's a Christian Bale show all the way. Playing the role of Agent Melvin Purvis with great style and absorbing presence. Depp on the other hand, plays Dilinger well. But somewhere, Bale's persona over-powers. Marion Cotillard is superb, especially in the penultimate scene. Billy Crudup is good. Channing Tatum, Emilie de Ravin & Lili Taylor are wasted.On the whole 'Public Enemies' is a must watch. Such Orinized work like this, needs to be applauded. Thumbs Up!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of Mann's most underappreciated and effective works,"Michael Mann vehicles always take a while to grow on you. The first time I saw it I didn't think it was anything too remarkable, just a period gangster flick with a lot of stylistic flourishes. Having re-watched recently as part of an ongoing Michael Mann kick, I can safely say it's one of the most thoughtful and achingly beautiful ""Very Serious™"" tentpole movies of the past decades. Mann knows how to take a script that in the hands of a lesser director would just be average and elevate it to something indescribable and, for lack of a better word, cosmic. Everything from the acting (including fine turns from Johnny Depp, Marion Cotillard, Christian Bale, and a tragically underutilized Billy Crudup), gritty but beautiful cinematography, gorgeous production and costume design, to Elliot Goldenthal's delicate and varied score give the impression of a period in history playing out before the audience's eyes and ears in a way few films I've seen have accomplished. John Dillinger's mythic crime spree is depicted simultaneously as romantic & tragic and gritty & brutal. Those unaccustomed to Mann's particular mode of low-shutterspeed, gritty handheld digital photography may find the presentation off-putting. But to those who know and appreciate it for what it is, Public Enemies is one of the director's most underappreciated works to date and ought to be reappraised as such.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Chicago never looked better, but  Michael Mann has made better films nonetheless","Stanley Kubrick apparently once said that a film isn't a photograph of reality, but photograph of a photograph of a reality. In Michael Mann's Public Enemies, Johnny Depp is playing real life bank robber John Dillinger sitting in a movie theater watching Clark Gable play a gangster in a gangster movie. That's an actor portraying a gangster in a movie that a gangster played by another actor is watching in another movie. That's a photograph of a photograph of reality, an especially common phenomena in gangster movies. I don't think any gangster movie can avoid it's own mythology.And then, Public Enemies is still a gangster movie that attempts to be as naturalistic as possible. Based on a book by Bryan Burrough it's a visual spectacle of authenticity. The details are there without Mann making a fuss of it. It ain't the South of Gone With the Wind, it's simply the 30's as good as it gets in any film. In this surrounding the actors can only do it as straight as possible. Together with all of the other characters, Depp's Dillinger is peeled down until he's just a human being, walking and talking and robbing banks. We are not watching a myth come to life, nor are we spending time on the psychology couch with him. When he courts the woman of his choice (that's the kind of man this is) she attempts to make him go away by pointing out that she doesn't even know him. He says, almost annoyed, just to get it out of the way: ""I was raised on a farm in Moooresville, Indiana. My mama ran out on us when I was three, my daddy beat the hell out of me cause he didn't know no better way to raise me. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, whiskey, and you... what else you need to know?""So, John Dillinger was excellent at robbing banks and even better at jailbreaks and that's about it. If a man like him would ever need to be a movie hero he would have to be played by Johnny Depp. He's ideal and immediately makes him inexplicably likable. This is the best quality of the film, and it's also it's weakest point. He's not likable in any romantic sense, but he's not somebody you get angry with either. It's a Rise and fall-story of an American gangster, but there's no emotions involved. The great counter-example is Christian Bale playing Melvin Purvis, the Special Agent assigned by J. Edgar Hoover to track him down. He is paradoxically cold and thorough and, great as Bale is, we understand his character even less. In fact, these two characters seem disjointed from each other as if they are both inexplicably doing something pointless for no reason. It's especially a bit of a letdown when Michael Mann have been such an expert in the past dealing with the psychological problems of destructive masculinity. The biggest comparison that comes to mind is of course Heat, the gorgeous and intelligent cops and robbers-film where Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were to meet up face to face. At times, Public Enemies inevitably feels like an unofficial prequel or remake and it does fall short by comparison. There was psychological strength and emotional heaviness there that Public Enemies deliberately avoids. What it does instead is filling the screen up with great tech stuff. Any fan of film making should see this film just to witness professionalism working in sheer, eclectic delight. Well disciplined dialog scenes are intercut with hand-held DV and delicious editing make any viewer watch these characters move along with delightful ease. Right down to casting choices, the film is in many ways impeccable - Anna Sage, the woman who eventually betrayed Dillinger, is played by the wonderful Branka Katic who was unforgettable in Emir Kusturica's wonderful 1998 comedy Black Cat, White Cat. Someone certainly had to convince someone with that choice.Public Enemies is a little tricky. It's not a bad film, but it's not entirely worthwhile either. It's a good looking film - and well dressed, with Depp and Bale in 30s suits - about a gangster who's neither Tony Montana nor a real person. We've seen it before, but on the other hand it has been done a lot worse in lesser films. At the same time: It's a good film, but Heat is better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mann is back,"Mann is back, back on his chronological track of men and gunpowder, amidst which you can distinguish that this time, a little more than before,a back-flash into the darkness of history, and a trying earning of applauseThat's doubtless an ever good experience to see the challenge a gangster-addicted director tries to overrun on the narrow screen, let alone the indulgence of the cast, which burns up my modest expectation by the easiest way; yes, you can count on the taste of blood-rocking glimpses razored down from corners of Depp's eyes, but that must eat your heart out to see the Batman and Piaff flank the Pirate in old Jazz.The tempo and temper in the first half hour are still as sharp and clean as the shot could be from the behind of camera against Mann's aiming eye. He never loose his lens hair-thick away form his action-loaded guys. But as road runs noisy and crowded, something there, something thinner. There better be an umbrella in the stormy bullets, I have to say, to rest a room where the characters' soul can breathe in adequate air in case the physical elbows away the chemical. The same between two men as before, the Insider runs out, Heat down to hot.Maybe the little bit of heavier involvement of the opposite sex dissolves down the complexity of men. That cliff-cut goodbye for a girl comes to shy in hilly slop. It stops to function mirror but mate in the meaning of its own for the lady along side of the uncompromising tough hero. That's a pleasing new in Mann but plain in the genre.Plenty of measures from style to plot are applied in the end to save density and richness and they work in an efficient way, still sharp and clean. That's safe to say good, however, we opt to reserve our regret as long as it is by Mann.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Average,"I went into this expecting an outstanding film - great cast, good look and a great character to centre on. And on these fronts, it delivered.However, there was something lacking - character development. None of the primary characters (Dillinger, Billie, Purvis) were interesting. If Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were this one dimensional in their film, I never would have heard of it (having been born 20 years later).This film will get a lot of attention, and disappear from our minds rapidly. The characters are not endearing.The best part of the film was Johnny Depp, and his facial expressions. They told us more about Dillinger than anything else. (by the way, that's not a good thing).All of the characters are stubborn, and their internal conflicts disappear in a haze of machine gun fire. Only one conflict survives: Good guy must kill bad guy because he is bad.All I can say is that I am disappointed - another film with a lot of potential that tries to wow us with the adrenaline of the chase scene and of the gunfire.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Die the way you lived,"I've been a fanatic of Michael Mann's filming style for quite some time. His filmography is focused on ""stories pitting criminals against those who seek to put them behind bars"" which I previously watched and enjoyed in Heat starring Pacino and DeNiro.Johnny Depp blended well into the character of John Dillinger a notorious and charismatic bank robber.
I sensed John Dillinger to have had a Robin Hood edge when he says ""I'm here for the banks money, not your money"", and he lived the way he wanted to and didn't compromise as I saw his face nourish to the saying in the movie in the movie ""Die the way you lived, all of a sudden, that's the way to go. Living like that doesn't mean a thing""
The scene when he suffers Billie being abducted shows Johnny Depp's acting and also the real Dillinger's compassion towards his loved ones.The scene where Billie Frechette is beaten during interrogation depicts the painful acting of Marion Cotillard making it very real.
Also, in the last scene where starts weeping when the copper gives her Dillingers last message, ""Tell Billie for me, bye-bye, Blackbird"" I could see the tears flowing down her cheeks, again making it real.Lines that show that he even a Gangster/ bank robber has got morals:You can be a dead hero or a live coward.You know, when I'm not doing this, I'm a scout for the movies.We're having too good a time today.
We ain't thinking about tomorrow.Some of the places I've been ain't so hot.

"Very worthwhile, especially with Depp as the star and Bale, Cotillard & Crudup offering great support","John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is very adept at robbing banks in the 1930's. He and his closest friends have done well, so well that they have a definite swagger in their steps. And, since they have executed successful jailbreaks a time or two, their skills are formidable. Naturally, this is most upsetting to the young director of the FBI, J.Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), compounded by the fact that there are no laws to cover the crossing of state lines during a crime spree. But, JEH will press on. Enlisting the services of one very determined G-man, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), Hoover assembles his gang of ""go-to"" guys. In the meanwhile, John has spotted a beautiful but poor gal in Chicago, Billie (Marion Cotillard) and insists that she become his woman. Bowing to his looks, wealth, and charm, she accepts his advances and the couple enjoys a brief interlude of romance. But, money does run out and John & Co. have to plan their next heists. They even join forces with Babyface Nelson for awhile. Can the ""public enemy"" criminals escape the hand of the law forever? This is a very worthwhile film, especially for those who love action, gun battles and history. The casting of Depp as Dillinger is terrific, making it difficult to see anyone else in this role. But, Bale, Cotillard, Crudup, Leelee Sobieski, and all of the others are quite fine, too. Then, too, the re-creation of the Depression Era deserves much praise, for the sets, costumes, camera work, script, dialogue and direction all work well to fashion this bygone time in American history. One small comment to add is that it is pretty violent, so if you don't like a bit of blood and guts, stay away. But, then, its not excessively gory, either. Therefore, while it may not be the best film of 2009, it is hard to imagine anyone not being enthralled Public Enemies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Heat of the 1930s,"The summer of 2009 has offered nothing by poor blockbusters. Public Enemies is so refreshing, a mature film for grown ups.The 1930s were a poor time to be around, The Great Depression was in full swing, unemployment was high and fascism in Europe was on the rise. It was also a poor time to be a lawman or bank employee in the Mid-West of America. The 1930s was a time were America had high profile bank robbers. One of the most famous was John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). He was thorn in the side of American law enforcement and became public enemy number 1. He you going between states to avoid being arrested. But Dillinger was a popular, Robin Hood like figure who only robbed the banks, not the people. He terrorise banks in Chicago and Indiana and frees his crew from public. The director of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) was lobbying Congress for more funding and give the FBI more power via the Crime Bill. Congress rejects the proposals and so Hoover starts a media campaign. He declares America's 'first war on crime' and names John Dillinger his big target. He is obviously playing politics. He makes G-Man, Special Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), the head of the Chicago Field Officer and more importantly find and arrest Dillinger. Purvis aims to bring scientific and professional methods into crime investigation. In the middle of all this Dillinger finds romances with Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), a half native-American cloakroom girl from Chicago. A similar sub-plot to what happen Robert De Niro in Heat.Michael Mann is an excellent director but had recently had a dip in form with Miami Heat. He is back with a winner, directing excellent actors, story and action with this film. He directs with style and flair and does fancy tricks which show that style can add substance. He directs excellent action set pieces with instance camera work, and doesn't overuse shaky cam. He also gets a good feel for the 1930s. He keeps the story going for the most part, but the film does drag occasionally. Mann also leaves it ambiguous on who is the hero and villain of the film.Johnny Depp is excellent as the charismatic John Dillinger and easily the best performer in the film. He is an early contender for best actor for when award season comes around. Christian Bale offered a good performance, but his character does lack depth and disappears when he is not around. Marion Cotillard is a good actress and does well in the film, she even has a good American accent. Billy Crudup was also fine and slimy as J. Edgar Hoover and was last seen being big, blue and naked.Public Enemies is flawed, but is one of the better films of 2009.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Passable,"As a huge fan of the depression era outlaws and just an all around organized crime devout researcher since the cowboys in the 1880's, I wanted to see this film.John Dillinger is a national icon, whether it was for his criminal popularity or his larger than life persona, you can't help but credit the guy for adding excitement to an otherwise completely miserable era.It's not to say that we should revere criminals but he wasn't exactly Hitler or Jeffrey Dahmer, both of whom ironically are somewhat revered in 2021, due to the constant retellings of their horrendous existence in media. In their cases, I think once or twice is enough to revisit their disgusting life stories.In Dillinger's case, he was a celebrity, who actually relished his criminal lifestyle and became the country's #1 Most Wanted man. The 20's and 30's were full of different men who rose in the underworld, either independently or co-dependently and it always amazes me to read about them.This movie should've been a better portrait of who John Dillinger was. It only delves in certain aspects of his life while combining other elements of his time as a bank robber, along with his runs in with the law and his eventual downfall.The acting in this movie is top notch. Johnny Depp keeps proving why we like seeing him in movies and never fails to turn in a leading performance but in this movie he is not alone.Jason Clarke, who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine since I saw him in ""Pet Sematary"" in 2019, now, all the movies I haven't been able to see him in before are catching my interest. Christian Bale always commands the screen and seeing him square off with Depp here was a welcome joy.We also have smaller roles with big names and experienced actors like Stephen Lang and Stephen Dorff, who do a fine job with the little screen time they get here. Been a fan of both since ''Tombstone"" and ""Blade"" respectively.My problem with this movie is that it couldn't make me stop fretting over the many inconsistent facts to what happened in real life. If I wasn't as big on the subject, I'd have enjoyed it more but I was unable to every time the movie tried to change the facts on me. I appreciate the creativity and the simplistic approach in order to fit a 2 hour movie but a figure and a story like John Dillinger's deserved better.Plus, the fact that it was Michael Mann who directed this, a guy who gave us insane classics like ""Heat"" and ""Manhunter"", it was rough to wash.It's an entertaining film with very strong and decent performances but it can't hold water to the many details we already know about this period.Too many people have complained about the camera work in this film and I have to also agree that I was shocked to see its employment used in a Michael Mann film. At times, I felt like I was watching a webisode or a found footage film.Definitely not the cleanest Michael Mann shot sequences around.Too bad about the inaccuracies and the reimagining, it could've raised the worth of watching this somewhat muddled crime epic just a tad more.Good movie, not bad but could've been great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
True gangster classic,"I saw this film really late and was sleepy but it kept me mostly awake, which really is a testament to this movie's great story and action. First, I liked the delivery of this one as it was real and at times I felt like I was watching a real stage play. The music was infrequent but good, acting was top notch, and action/shootouts were as good as it gets without heavy special effects. It was raw bone but not really violent. The main violence was in the bloody gunshot wounds that were consistent throughout. Nothing too graphic and certainly nothing disgusting. Violence flowed well with the movie and was about equal to that seen in the Untouchables. Depp played a wonderful portrayal of Dillenger and outdid Bale. Bale's role was good too but not as convincing as Depp's. Bale's Pervis was not nearly as ""tough"" as Connery's character from Untouchables, and , if I do say so, this may have been one of the few character roles Bale wasn't well suited for. McConoughey or Russel Crowe would've been better choices for the role of Pervis. Did not like the actor who played J Edgar Hoover. He was not a strong enough actor to deliver a real punch for that role. All of Dillenger's crew were well played by each respective actor, and Dillenger's girl was also a great role. I guess it could be said that the ""bad guys"" really dominated this movie. The gun fights were very realistic and fun to watch. This movie could easily win an award for best sound. I don't care for movies with a lot of profanity, and this one suited me fairly well. Profanity was very minimal, especially for an R rating. Movie was lengthy but never dull. Overall, I really liked this one and would say it was one of the top 5 action movies I have ever seen. This will be a REAL tough guy movie classic one day, and will join the likes of Dirty Harry, Untouchables, Godfather, Platoon, and all those John Wayne classics.

One of the worst films I've seen in a long time,"Contrary to the opinion of the previous commentator, this film was an execrable mess. It was completely ahistorical, to begin with. In the year 1934, when three of the biggest strikes ever in the United States were called and the country was in ferment due to the Great Depression, this context didn't receive so much as a mention. Nor was it explained why the ordinary people were cheering John Dillinger as a hero. It was because he worked against the state and returned money that he took from the banks to the ordinary people who were being screwed out of their money, much as we all are today.Depp, Christian Bale and the other actors should be ashamed of having participated in such a farcical rendering of the Great Depression and of the famous criminals that emerged from the financial devastation of the country.The FBI and Hoover were rightly portrayed as the enforcers of capitalism and the police state, but this seems only to have been inserted into the film for violence value. There was no genuine analysis by the filmmaker of the true meaning of this American gestapo and the fact that it not only went after bank robbers and gangsters, but also union men, strikers, and ordinary citizens who dared to protest against government policy during the Depression.What a shallow film. And the lengthy scenes of violence did not advance the story one bit. They seemed to be there to pad out the excessive length of this travesty.What a piece of crap. I'm glad that I got a free ticket or I'd be even more disgusted.

Johnny Depp: The perfect public enemy,"Public Enemy or i should say the perfect Public Enemy was Johnny Depp.The way he has acted in this movie is just stupendous.The portrayal of John Dillinger is tremendous.The way he escapes literally from anywhere is just incredible.Towering presence of Johnny Depp of John Dillinger just overshadows the prowess of Christian Bale.Same,what Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight,here we see a superb performance overshadowing every one else.The ending was also very good.Michael Mann wanted to replicate the touch that he left for us in Heat.But Public Enemies never lives up to that level.Nor the star-cast neither the story setup can replicate the history of Heat.All in all,public enemies drags in certain places but the actors have done very well.Be prepared for a prolonged series of bloodshed & violence during this film.Some dialogs make your day like 'Bye Bye Blackbird'.Just watch this one for Johnny Depp,his best performance i have seen till date.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good movie worth the watch Depp is good as usual.,"I find it very hard to dislike basic dramas when Depp is in them. His talent is to often wasted on movies of a comic book type. This is your basic retelling of the Dillinger criminal hero of the 30s. I liked the story line. Its hard to tell the life of such a famous character in 90+ minutes and you have to fit a lot of stuff into the movie so you also tell history as well as the personal story of the character.It's a sad story of a somewhat decent but violent criminal(Depps role) who becomes the target of governmental change in policy. The story is told in a way that you see Dillinger as a political target as the mob is forming into a business entity and the beginning of federal enforcement on a local level. Though one might find pity in how Dillinger is made the scapegoat, one has to remind themselves that he was an arch criminal and had to be stopped. But the rebel in oneself might want him to escape with his woman to a far away place.Depp gives humanity to Dillinger and Bale does a very good job as the hunter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I Would Not Care About the Inaccuracies as Much if the Film Didn't Disguise Itself as a Painstakingly Genuine Docudrama.,"Public Enemies masquerades in digital camera-work, painstakingly nuanced settings and period details that go so far as to be actual objects held by the characters in real life, the movie disguising as a hyper-realistic docudrama when it is really a complete and utter butchery of history. I would not care about the historical inaccuracies as much if the film were given a more romantic treatment by its cameras, sets and props. It is a novel technique for Michael Mann to bring his recent adoption of digital film-making to the Hollywood biopic, but it gives us every signal that we are watching dramatized history when we are watching nothing but fiction. So there have been many biopics which have taken poetic license, but why do so when the true story is head over heels more intriguing and surprising? When compared to opening the film by featuring Dillinger in prison breaks he did not and could not have been involved in, thus propelling the narrative in a fictitious direction immediately, I don't mind the script having Dillinger and Melvin Purvis meet each other; it is undeniably Mann's echo of the key scene between cop and criminal in his masterpiece Heat, in a strikingly different context. (Rather than blending into the hustle-bustle of L.A., Purvis and Dillinger talk on either side of jail bars in the middle of the sticks, in a time where men on opposite sides of the law knew the starkly defined doctrine of right and wrong too well to permit themselves empathy for each other as the two leads of Heat do in a modern age where the line is much thinner.) But consider the gunfight at the wooded lodge: In reality, over seventy exiting patrons were accosted by mistaken FBI gunfire and Dillinger's gang got away clean. Purvis was not a cool, patient hero but an under-qualified officer tormented by his constant mishaps under pressure. Mann uses it as an excuse for an admittedly spectacular Tommy gun fight between cops and robbers. As a result of his urge to force in great gunplay, every single Dillinger associate who survived him in reality is killed in the movie, all instances being completely different than the way they actually died. Baby Face's real death was a sheer phenomenon that this impatient and simple-minded film revises completely.Mostly, it is Mann's focus on Dillinger's relationship with Billie Frichette that mutes its impact. Dillinger never had less than two girls at a time, whereas this film not only jacks the tear jerking romantic love-at-first-sight convention up to 100 degrees but also portrays Dillinger's legendary death purely in terms of how sad it is that the lovebirds won't be seeing each other anymore. This, too, affects true account in unnecessary and even implausible ways.This is not a terrible film. Mann finds great success in bringing Dillinger's middle-class folk hero status to veritable life. Johnny Depp is not playing the clever hood based on other movie gangster performances he has seen. He fits into a kindred link with the man's earthy, down-home clarity. He plays Dillinger as a fact, and we thoroughly believe every behavioral note he hits. It is a perfect performance. That goes for every performance, in their own ways, whether they're hemmed by the script or they require something off-putting like Billy Crudup's transatlantic accent playing J. Edgar Hoover.Maybe the reason Mann and his co-writers permit him to outlive his associates is because in the minds of the succeeding generations in flyover country, he has. Born and raised in Ohio, I know older people who have but a very few degrees of separation from Dillinger. As opposed to the American coasts, where the country truly is a melting pot and not nearly as much comes as a surprise or a break from the norm, the American Midwest is an incurably normal region of general traditions and populist values, where a dangerous criminal who was involved in the deaths of several police officers, robbed at least two dozen banks and four police stations, escaped from jail twice and was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood considerably stands out against the backdrop. Thus the deeds of Dillinger and his gang controlled the attention of the American press and its readers during the Depression era, a period which led to the result of the current, more advanced FBI.As an entertainment, there are so many highlights here, especially Stephen Graham's maniacal portrayal of Baby Face Nelson. Tommy may not have been named after a gun, but here we learn he unequivocally should've been. There's Marion Cotillard's prudent, humble performance as Dillinger's main squeeze, the various creatively captured Tommy gun fights and the idealistic use of Otis Taylor's great song 10,000 Slaves. But whatever rationalizations can be made for the romanticization of the Dillinger story, there simply is no reason why we should be deprived of the remarkable, fascinating and truly presently poignant true account of it, which is incomparably more engrossing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Manns back...,"Michael Mann is a guy I've looked up to for some time now. He is indisputably one of the greatest film makers of our time and has provided the world with some ground breaking films. Let's forget 2006's hiccup that was the Miami Vice movie and feast upon his latest offering, Public Enemies. But is Mann turning up the heat, or is it collateral damage.Based on author Bryan Burrough's ambitious tome Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-43, director Michael Mann's sprawling historical crime drama follows the efforts of top FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale ) in capturing notorious bank robber John Dillinger. A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Crudup) FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? It was the movies that killed John Dillinger -- Gangster No. 1 until he was gunned down outside a Chicago theatre after taking in the pictures one hot night in 1934 -- and it was the movies that brought him back to life. More than once. But this time it's different. This time Michael Mann is in charge. This is undoubtedly a Michael Mann film. From the intense close ups to the thrilling soundtrack its clear who's running the show. And boy if he doesn't do it near perfectly. This is masterful direction on his part; each scene is pitch perfect and balanced to the point that there isn't a speck of dirt on camera, in this aspect Public Enemies soars. Unfortunately the film does have some technical issues, none of which are large enough to take you out of the movie, but at times the audio editing is, jumpy to say the least. One minute we have guns blazing defining anybody sitting in the aisle seats, other times speech is misheard as the characters speak lines so softly it's easy to misinterpretation.As far as the look of the film, it's absolutely phenomenal. Shot entirely on digital, which seems to be Mann's new forte, the picture looks crisp, clear and utterly classy. Sporting some unparalleled cinematography that encapsulate 1930's Chicago, there no denying that Public Enemies is the best looking film of 2009. The acting is nothing below extraordinary with favourite Johnny Depp and Christian Bale recovering from the rough patch they been through recently. This is them back on form and better than ever. Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard delivers a solid is underused performance.Verdict: Public Enemies shows Michael Mann's steady recovery from 2006's Miami Vice, there are a couple of casual bugs, the sound can be dreadful at time but for the most part Public Enemies shines as one of 2009s brightest gems and could be up for some serious awards come Oscar time. The running time may scare some and with it being a Michael Mann film it's definitely not for everybody but for thoses who appreciate his style of movie making, this is all for you. A stunning, sumptuous sensation that acts as one of my favourite films of 2009.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Solid acting, but not a very surprising plot","Being an admirer of Johnny Depp, I had to see this film. And again, it was a very solid performance in my opinion as John Dillinger. He wasn't the only one who shone here though. Christian Bale did just as good a job as Johnny's FBI counterpart. Furthermore I liked the (repeating)score, it fitted the atmosphere.I didn't know John Dillinger's story before seeing this film. I only saw a trailer and read that John was a bit of a Robin Hood kinda guy. So for me, a plot twist would have been actually surprising.I must say, looking at the story, it lacked surprises. On the other hand, the story of John Dillinger couldn't be radically changed of course. It is just the way it is. So keeping that in mind, than this is a good production.If you like mafia/crime/heist movies, you'll probably think this film is at least OK. If you are interested in John Dillinger and know his story, it is probably even better. For me...I must say, I expected more of this...maybe too high expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies,"Public Enemies tells us the story about America's first war on crime and the pursuit of John Dillinger by the fledgling FBI. The film picks up four years into the Great Depression, which was a time when many people were out of work and standing in soup kitchen lines. The film begins with what appears to be John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp, being taken to prison, but we soon find out that it is really a part of his plan to bust out some fellow criminals. Meanwhile, Melvin Purvis, played by Christian Bale, successfully hunts down Pretty Boy Floyd, and due to this success is tapped by J. Edgar Hoover to lead a task force to capture Dillinger. This is the story that the film centers on as we see these two men play a game of cat and mouse.Throughout the film Michael Mann utilizes a lot of hand held camera work, which puts us right into the scene with Dillinger and Purvis. Also the look of how some of the gun battles with lighting and camera work gives the film almost the same look as a war documentary. It is almost like you are there with Dillinger dodging bullets and racing to avoid the police. The lighting is very dark and moody for many of the scenes which gives these scenes a feel similar to old gangster movies from the 1930's and 40's. In fact near the end of the film there is a Clark Gable film playing in the movie theater that Dillinger has gone to for a night out. I think that many of these old gangster movies were on the mind of Michael Mann as he made this film.Johnny Depp delivers a wonderful performance as the lovable outlaw and pulls you in with his charisma very quickly. He plays Dillinger just as I would assume him to have been in real life. Dillinger became somewhat of a folk hero in America since his exploits in the 30's stealing money from banks and not the banks customers. While these stories may or may not be true Dillinger is portrayed in the film like a kind of rock star to the common man. Christian Bale also delivers a great performance that is very different from what many people dubbed as an ""arrogant"" character in his other summer blockbuster. Bale comes across as a determined man that will stop at nothing, within the law, to catch Dillinger. Bale is very effective when he gets to play in roles where he has to be motivated and stern, not just told ""look as serious as you can about everything."" Public Enemies is my favorite movie so far this summer and it is captivating. The scenes are shot beautifully. The lighting fits the mood quite well, and on top of that the sound track is great. When Dillinger robs a bank we get this great Blues track and fits the swagger of the men walking into the bank. If you've sat through some of the bad movies this summer, like Transformers 2, then Public Enemies might be just what you need to wash that bad taste right out of your mouth.

"Well-made, with Depp at his subdued best","A worthwhile tale of a notorious, but charming killer. Depp plays this role as smoothly and care-free as most of his performances, while Bale is comfortable in his role as the straight-and-narrow lawman trying to take down his target. The movie, albeit a bit long, goes at a smooth pace until the careful direction of Mann, who rarely misses a step in his films. A robust cast of characters play their respective roles effectively, but the highlight is Depp who commands the screen whenever he's on it. Although it's light on development of the actual robberies, it's deep with regards to the planning of capturing Depp's character, which shows you how serious the police were with regards to this Public Enemy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Robbed!,"""They ain't tough enough, smart enough or fast enough. I can hit any bank I want, any time. They got to be at every bank, all the time."" John Dillinger (Johnny Depp)Yes, they were ""smart enough."" Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Crudup) chosen agent to find Dillinger, uses his smarts to get associates to rat on him, and some ""tough"" heavy artillery to bring down the pop culture hero.Johnny Depp in Public Enemies is about as distant from an Oscar playing gangster Dillinger as he could get playing a pirate: he underplays one of the most infamous bank robbers of the Depression as if director Michael Mann told him to hide while the feds were tracking him for spilling milk.Although other attempts to portray this rogue in film and TV have fallen short as well, you'd think the director of Manhunter, Heat, and The Insider could come up with a more exciting rendition because Tommy guns just don't an interesting movie make anymore.Saving the film from complete boredom is the relationship between Dillinger and his love, Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), because both actors are capable of subtlety: The characters dance around each other, especially Billie, who is reluctant to hitch up with a ""most wanted"" guy. Although Depp never shows much emotion, Cotillard makes a fine reluctant lover, developing her love to the point of a devotion that happily endangers her with the feds. As for Mann, he has always peopled his films with difficult, frustrating loves, in a sense saving himself from being compared to Michael Bay.""He could be the man sat next to you!"" So says the announcer about Dillinger on the 1930's movie screen as he uncomfortably tries not to be noticed. He should have paid attention to his nerves: a movie house will be his undoing. Meanwhile, our theaters will be undone with weak ticket sales; he's still robbing the establishment.To give Depp his due, he has the best line of the movie, and we can't hear it.

"Decent film, but deviates from facts of story.","By itself, Public Enemies is a fairly decent movie that recreates the atmosphere of the time, the so called golden era of bank robberies through the escapades of John Dillenger. I especially give high marks to the recreation of some of the bank heists and shootings that took place. However, the major failure of this film is its deviation from the facts. Most of us generally understand that movies rooted in true stories will at times stray from the facts to make the story more profitable. What deeply disappointed me was how wide a deviation was taken in a number areas, especially the Little Bohemia shootout. If they had stuck to the facts, they still would have had a good film.

The last romantic bank robbers,Seeing a historical movie that has so must style and product it behind it is marvelous.Watching this movie.

I really sold attention to the movement.

Riley's Review: Public Enemies,"Let me first say Gangster movies are my type of cinematic genre, thus bias was a component of my high rating of this movie.Another reason why I think this movie is the best of its kind since 1987 (The Untouchables) was the good selection of actors. Whenever you have Johnny Depp you are bound to not have a bad performance. Stephen Graham's facial expression and delivery as acting as Baby Face was merely sensational. Christian Bale is Christian Bale. You may hate his off the camera antics, but he did an adequate job. I think Marion Cotillard (Billie Frenchette) did an amazing job acting as an emotional woman falling in love with the infamous Dillinger.The art direction was one of the best I have seen. I felt like I was in 1933 Chicago. The action scenes with the tommy guns were awesome. Thus, the action component of a typical gangster movie was fulfilled.So far this is summer 2009's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Much better on a second watch,"I never hated this movie, but it felt like a missed opportunity, I kept waiting for the directors cut and I'm still waiting. But since this came to Netflix I figured I'd try it again and I was surprised. Really I guess the only problem was pacing? I don't know. A couple weird musical choices. Something seemed to be missing but I can't put my finger on it. A lot of things were very similar to Heat, of course that movie was based on this real event so they was unavoidable but as a movie watcher it was familiar.I'm a huge Michael Mann fan. Heat was my favorite movie before that became cool, I even love Miami Vice and The Keep. When I go into one of his movies I expect a game changer which this wasn't, but there's nothing wrong with that. I was impressed. I may watch it again. The shoot out in the woods is crazy cool. And I love how the muzzle flash lights up their faces when they shoot.I followed the development closely on this one, again huge Mann fan. When Christan Bale and Johnny Depp were announced I was excited. I'm not even a huge Depp fan but of course he's good and he's got the necessary presence for the role. And he was great. And arguably Mann has the best casting sense. You go back on his movies and so many people you saw for the first time are big now, or at least established. This movie was no different.If you weren't a fan the first time it's worth a second watch. If you hated it then I'm sure you'll still hate it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Okay, but not what it could have been","Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are probably two of the best-known actors around at this time. Between them they have clocked up a wide range of varied characters and have proved their acting might on more than one occasion. Therefore, the temptation by studio bosses to get the pair of them in the two leading roles must have proved too much to resist.Therefore, we have Johnny Depp portraying real life gangster John Dillinger, with Christian Bale as the FBI agent hell-bent on bringing him to justice. Naturally, as the film's about Dillinger himself, Depp gets the lion's share of screen time. In fact, fans of Bale may feel a little cheated regarding how much they get to see the man behind (arguably) Batman's most successful incarnation. He's little more than a figure who turns up every now and again to narrowly miss Dillinger. We never really get to see what makes him tick – he's just a particularly driven lawman, who has to catch his man. I don't recall ever seeing anything that shows us if he has any real life outside his work.Depp too feels more than a little underused. Dillinger's not a particularly nice guy. Okay, he doesn't rob 'regular' people, only banks. But he's prone to acts of extreme violence and doesn't think twice about killing if it suits his needs. So the audience might find it hard to relate to him, let alone support him in his side of the story. Depp's better at playing larger than life characters. Dillinger is pretty one dimensional. He steals and he hits people and has little else to his personality.I haven't read Dillinger's life story, so I can't comment on how close the film is to portraying the real man, or how accurate is, but there were a couple of scenes which didn't seem to fit – namely when Dillinger finds it easy to walk among entire departments of the very police officers charged with bringing him in and yet they don't actually recognise him.But, despite the film not really utilising its two trump cards, i.e. Bale and Depp, it's not a bad watch. I'm sure it's a reasonable account of Dillinger's life and, even if it isn't, it's a decent enough crime drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Stylish but Uneven Gangster Saga,"Public Enemies (2009) delivers a visually striking take on the rise and fall of notorious bank robber John Dillinger, with Johnny Depp bringing quiet intensity to the role. Director Michael Mann crafts a period-accurate world filled with Tommy gun shootouts, fedora-clad criminals, and the lawmen determined to bring them down.The film's greatest strength lies in its meticulous attention to historical detail and action sequences that feel raw and immediate. Mann's signature digital cinematography, however, gives the film a modern, almost documentary-like feel-sometimes enhancing realism, other times feeling oddly detached from the classic gangster aesthetic.While Depp's Dillinger is charismatic, the film lacks the emotional depth to fully explore the complexities of his criminal life. Christian Bale, as the relentless FBI agent on his trail, plays his role with steely precision but little nuance. Public Enemies is a stylish, well-crafted gangster film, but it never quite reaches classic status.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Offers Nothing New,"Movies about cops and robbers are as old as movies themselves. We've seen hundreds of versions of bank robberies and yet somehow we're still drawn to the very nature of breaking the law. So in that sense, Public Enemies offers nothing new. It is as formulaic as movies get in this world of crime. Formulaic is not always bad – but movies require something new as well to keep me entertained.Set in 1933 during the Depression, John Dillinger is Public Enemy #1 and we see him on many accounts robbing banks, escaping the seemingly useless lawmen, and murdering people who get in his way. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger the same way he plays Jack Sparrow (and many others) only without the make-up: he is an upbeat and likable bad guy. And in this one he somehow manages to be chewing gum throughout it all. He squares off against a countless number of ugly cops in suits, led by none other than Christian Bale. Bale doesn't add anything to the film. It is truly unfortunate that Mr. Bale hasn't really done much good lately; he seems to be dead weight in all of his recent films (Terminator Salvation comes to mind). In fact the last movie where I thought Bale was good was Rescue Dawn (2007). Billy Cudrup has a small role as J. Edgar Hoover, the head of this war on crime, but he doesn't do anything either, besides give us a good accent. And Marion Cotilliard, who recently won the Best Actress Oscar, has a very important role as Dillinger's girl. While she is good in scenes without Depp, she doesn't hold her own when she's with him. Giovanni Ribisi, David Wenham, Jason Clarke, and Stephen Graham (as Baby Face Nelson) round out this bloated cast. In terms of acting, this film isn't going to get any Oscar nominations.Director Michael Mann is a master of crime movies. His movie Collateral is one of my all time favorites. Since Collateral, Mann has used Digital Video –the same thing I use, and not Film, to shoot all his movies, creating a look as if it is a movie made by a very good amateur. This was great in Collateral, adding some realism to the LA modern-day film, but does it work in a 1933 Crime movie? I think it's fine, but it doesn't add anything to it. And once more we see another director using the ""Paul Greengrass Effect"" – shooting the action sequences so close up and with hand-held cameras that we sometimes don't get what is going on. While I respect Mann for bringing something new to this period piece, I don't think it is justified, and I don't find it impressive.There are two scenes that I really enjoyed – I loved the scene where Dillinger walks into the police department, and I loved the last scene of the film. Other than that, a large amount of the movie was predictable, too long, and most of all generic. The screenplay itself feels like it is stealing parts from other great ones – on a couple occasions I heard movie lines that were straight out of Bonnie and Clyde, which this film seems to rip off of in plot as well. Here's a movie with a dream cast and director, and yet still we get a mediocre picture. Public Enemies will not be remembered as one of the great heist films, and in fact, I don't think Public Enemies will really be remembered for anything at all. My Rating: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The FBI and Dilinger,"""Public Enemies"" is another movie about a real life outlaw. This time the outlaw is John Dilinger played by Johnny Depp. This movie adds itself to a genre of movies about Bonnie and Clyde, Billy the Kid, Al Capone, Bumpy Johnson, Jesse James, and a host of other known outlaws.John Dilinger was a bank robber in the 30's who became iconic due to the grandiosity of his crimes. The public hates small-time criminals, but we love big-time criminals. Go big or go home.Dilinger was being hotly pursued by the J. Edgar Hoover-led FBI. He put agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) in charge of catching Dilinger. Throughout the movie other known gangsters were shown such as Babyface Nelson (Stephen Graham) and Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). But Dilinger was the focus as was the clear shift in law enforcement tactics. It would seem that at this point in American history law enforcement got better and more committed to stopping interstate criminals. So, while Dilinger was making a name for himself, the FBI was trying to ensure that another Dilinger would never arise again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
gangster period piece.,"Snapshot of the gangster crime wave taking place in the 1930s. Depp is dillinger; stephen graham is nelson; tatum is floyd. Capone, nitti. Christian bale is purvis, the fbi agent, trying valiantly to take them all down, at the chicago office. It's pretty good, in spite of some minor liberties with the facts. Told from purvis' point of view. A few digs at hoover, who was all about the public image of the fbi, and was constantly trying to get more funding. As expected, lots of shooting, violence, blood and guts. It's quite good! They focus on catching dillinger.

"Two words, one name: Michael Mann","Michael Mann makes better decisions as a producer in ratio to his outcomes with films. Allow me to explain with a few movies of his he produced that I thoroughly enjoyed compared to the movies he directed he made that I was ecstatic about. Produced: Aviator, Collateral, Hancock, and the Kingdom. Which of these did he actually direct? Collateral and I really am on a fine line of liking that movie as much as I do. To top it off he didn't help write any of those movies, however he did write the screenplay to: PUBLIC ENEMIES.Public Enemies was a disappointment and I can say that if a person truly wants to learn more about the 30's and the life of John Dillenger without a book then I suggest watching History Channel's specials on Bank Robbers.Michael Mann fails to truly give a heavy direction on the mind of Dillenger. Perhaps it was because no one can quite be sure what was going through the minds of the Bank Robber/Good Friend and the FBI agent Purvis. Really the only pin point thing in this movie is it's time line, but at the same time, the time line provided no real time stances on every scene.Public Enemies did do somethings well. The weapons were very accurate on how they were used, the outfits and the cars were extremely accurate. Also the lines and attitudes used by each character. Michael Mann doesn't do anything close to JUSTICE to the story of John Dillenger and those surrounding him. I believe it would be nice to have seen a little opening of how John Dillenger was raised and the surrounding misfits that came about his time.The movie can be waited on, it is well drawn out and you may just wish to wait for video so you can fall asleep in the comforts of your own home.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Convincing,"When the movie is all about the crime, robbery, mafia, and the police thief mega-play then the arise of complexity in the plot is not unusual, you get to see lots of twists, sub plots that follows the main story and plenty of confusing stuffs, yup it also might be the style of presenting such genre.But after watching 2009's ''Public Enemies'' such idea totally changed, the narrative is so simple and exact to the point, the movie sets during the black crime age in US where the name of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger made many cops insomniac, the frustrated agents get into the search after losing him once from their clutches, meanwhile there goes the inseparable bonding story between Dillinger and his love interest Billie, all his men are shot dead by the federal men and his only hope is to reach Billie, does he get to her and what happens to such a most wanted criminal? This forms the rest of the story.Johnny Depp had always succeeded in rendering the most magnificent performances in his several movies and this isn't the exception, he had done the best in the shoes of Dillinger, Christian Bale as the FBI agent had made quite a appreciable performance, its Marion Cotilard who steals the show with her marvellous acting skills, her role as the Billie is the best, cinematography and the entire settings of the movie is so convincing with heightened authenticity, overall its best of its kind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Biography in first place? it wasn't really authentical and also why try to make more out of it than it is? The editing lacks of accuracy and the small parts are not really played the way they should be. the simple viewer drifts away at times when nothing seems to make an impression on you, anymore... it's like you watch through out the first 30 minutes a weird biography and then suddenly a too serious drama that can't provide a real and useful message for the viewer. I personally regret watching it and also watched it in first place just because of the two great actors, who made an impression on me as never before, in movies such as Equilibrium and American Psycho(both Bale) or Fear and loathing in Las Vegas(Depp).",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Like an exciting modern thriller, only done in '30s gangster style","It's been awhile since we've seen a good cat-and-mouse thriller done old school, and that's exactly what ""Public Enemies"" is. Merely trade in your usual summer crime movie full of thieves in ski masks wielding uzis for ones wearing suits and fedoras armed with tommy guns and suddenly you're getting entertained Great Depression-style. ""Public Enemies"" is a neat crossover between the action-packed thrillers of today and the mob movies of yesterday, and one that comes to us well-armed with the talents of Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and a master of the thriller genre: director Michael Mann.""Public Enemies"" is about 80 percent action thriller, 20 percent biography of infamous '30s bank robber John Dillinger (Depp). It gives us a colorful character portrait of Dillinger as a care-free crook with a sense of humor, but its main goal is to give us a handful of flashy crackling gun fights. It's not an intimate or dramatic character study that makes us think twice about what it means to be America's most wanted; the intention is to develop Dillinger enough so that Depp can make him an intriguing personality for us to follow on this 140- minute ""catch me if you can"" adventure. So check your Oscar-caliber expectations at the theater entrance.Depp is a perfect fit as Dillinger, a man who lived in the moment, doing only as he wanted and hearing only what he wanted to hear, even when it was ""you won't get away with this forever."" He's a likable criminal type, not unlike a clean-shaven and articulate Jack Sparrow. Basically, he makes life hell for the Bureau of Investigation (it's his example that will later add the ""F"") and the chief detective on his case -- Melvin Purvis (Bale). He's the silly rabbit that keeps getting away, and Bale -- in a strong but unremarkable performance -- vows to hunt him down.This isn't unfamiliar territory for director/writer Mann, whose thriller ""Heat"" was basically a more sophisticated modern version of the cat-and-mouse story with two other stars on opposite ends of the fight (De Niro and Pacino). Like that film, ""Public Enemies"" has a lot of exciting and dramatic nighttime action scenes. The gunfight at the Wisconsin getaway with the guns lighting up the cold night air is most memorable. Mann more or less film this movie like someone who's been here before. His only weakness is overuse of hand-held camera shots. In a period piece, you'd expect a filming style that would be a little more classic, framing every shot perfectly, but Mann insists on this modern technique that does sort of shatter the bubble of being in the '30s in spots. There is definitely a sense at times that these are just modern people playing gangster dress-up -- it's not a flawless recreation of the era.I'm unaware of the historical truths surrounding Dillinger and his cronies ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd and ""Baby Face"" Nelson, or even if he had a relationship with a Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), but all their roles and the facts that may or may not accompany them are of little consequence to the enjoyment of the film for those who aren't crime history buffs. Billie is the best example of a character rendered ineffective because the movie cares little about her (despite Cotillard's talents). She's just there because every no-good gangster/mob guy has a girlfriend, which isn't great, but it's fine because it gives us another side of Dillinger and he's what is supposed to make the film stand out.Keep in mind that ""Public Enemies"" was released in July and not December and you should enjoy it -- it's an action thriller done '30s gangster style, not an Oscar-contending biographic crime drama. It wouldn't be unfair to expect a bit more character conflict or development for all characters and actors not named ""John,"" but it's definitely appropriate summer movie fare.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The film does a good job of capturing the mood and atmosphere of the time period, and the direction by Michael Mann is top-notch.

"Solid, but lacks imagination","Bryan Burrough's book, 'Public Enemies', was an exhaustive account of the wave of bank-robberies that afflicted America in the early 1930s, and the people who undertook them. In his forward, the author makes the interesting point that the story proceeded in an essentially modern world, a place with automatic weapons, automobiles, and air-planes. Michael Mann's film dramatises some of the book, concentrating on the person of John Dillinger, and it's a fairly typical Michael Mann film: heavyweight and solid, slightly over-glamorising its participants, pitching the tale as a personal fight between the lawman and the criminal (though to be fair, the book also does this to some extent) but somewhat emotionally unaffecting and impersonal. The sense of Dillinger as one-part folk-hero, one part cold-blooded murderer, never quite comes through as Mann prefers to show us a story of people just doing what they have to do (a world-view he also showed us in 'Heat'). This is a fairly true representation of what happened; but a little bit more creativity would not have gone amiss.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good but nowhere near the epic it could be,"Michael Mann returns to the familiar territory of the American Crime drama to explore the life and times of John Dillinger, probably America's most famous bank robber and public enemy number 1. Mann models this as a conflict between the foundations of federal crime fighting and the burgeoning criminal network of the time. Representing the side of law and order is Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis, one the FBI's most famous agents, whilst Johnny Depp plays Dillinger. Shooting in digital Mann brings his usual expertise at accuracy, authenticity and lends an epic scale to the story as well as creating a number of thrilling action sequences particularly an elongated shoot out at a country lodge. The acting is generally high calibre and both leads are excellent and Depp is admirably restrained as Dillinger when compared with his more recent wilder roles. He portrays him as a serious bank robber who knows how to foster his own mythology, one scene where Dillinger is questioned by the press allows Depp to loosen his control and play with his audience. However Dillinger's relationship to the press and the public's reaction to Dillinger is one of a number of interesting topics that the film sheds little light on rendering the near two and a half hour running time a little frustrating.Mann reduces this story to a battle between two men and adds layers of stereotype and cliché where none were needed. Dillinger's romance with Billie Frechette, a solid if unremarkable turn by Marion Cotillard, is given undue focus and portrayed as the traditional doomed romance between gangster and moll. Mann continues to hint at the more interesting aspects of the story, the way Hoover manipulated the pursuit of Dillinger to get press coverage and support for the FBI, the evolution of crime and crime fighting, the public reaction to the criminals of the era. In one scene near the end of the film Dillinger enters a betting racket run by the mob and witnesses the vast sums they are taking the film briefly touches on the idea that this was the end of an era for bank robbery but, again, goes nowhere with the idea. Similarly on the FBI's side there is continued reference to the transition of tactics to a recognisably modern crime fighting outfit but it is never fully explored despite the length of the film. Purvis witnesses escalating police brutality in their attempts to capture Dillinger and is clearly affected by it but little reference is made to the impact it had on the FBI and on police behaviour in America.Ultimately Mann has the characters, era and time to create a true classic of American crime but clings too close to the well worn confines of the genre and ultimately the film could really be about anyone and set anywhere and have a near identical plot. That is not to say it's a bad film, it's enjoyable and watchable but Mann had the scope and actors to aim so much higher that it is hard not to be disappointed and a little frustrated with the end result.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Good if a little more impersonal than it needs to be.,"The ""Public Enemies"" of the title are Baby Face Nelson and more specifically John Dillinger and Michael Mann's movie is about how Agent Melvin Purvis brought them down. Being a Michael Mann movie you know it's going to be stylish, action-packed and probably a cut above other real-life gangster films but it's not one of Mann's better pictures despite first-rate performances from Johnny Depp as Dillinger and Christian Bale as Purvis and some terrific set-pieces. The problem is Mann's always been a somewhat chilly director, a consummate professional more concerned with getting every detail right rather than fleshing out his films with empathetic characters, though perhaps the likes of John Dillinger, Hannibal Lecter and the gangsters of ""Heat"" could never be thought of as empathetic. Still, thanks to some extraordinary casting ""Heat"" wasn't just a great gangster/heist movie but a fill full of people you might actually relate to. ""Public Enemies"" doesn't offer us the same pleasures even if it does what it says on the tin and does it very well but then so many other films have done the same thing and done it better. Maybe what ""Public Enemies"" needed was to be about thirty minutes shorter, shot in black and white and with the likes of Mickey Rooney or Rod Steiger in the lead. Unfortunately those days are past.

"******* colorful, violent, 1930s gangsters with machine guns","It's all about attitude and machine guns. What was John Dillinger really like? I don't know the history or the man well enough to tell you if this film captures him and his time, but it seems to do that. It feels like you are there seeing his life and understanding how he lives and thinks. You are the most wanted man in America, maybe in the history of America, and your life may end at any second. You'd like to get away from all of that and spend your days on a sunny beach somewhere, but that isn't how this story ends.The film provides some incentive to read a little bit about Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, J.

Not the best crime drama film you will see,"Man, I was expecting better. And probably because I was expecting this movie to be really cool, I gave it such a low rating. It was very disappointing. I mean, a crime drama with Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard in the main roles, all of them Oscar worthy actors. What more could you want? I think for starters I would like another DIRECTOR. Michael Mann has done some great films. And by done I mean directed, produced and wrote. The Insider and all the others he did, I'm right up there with him. But man do I think this is a poorly directed film. The screenplay isn't that thrilling also. I mean even in those RARE scenes in which we have tension, one of the characters comes up with a stupid line and screws it all up. Marion Cotillard wasn't that great. But if we are in the ""bad acting"" category over here, might I say that the performance Christian Bale gives in this film...AWFUL. Maybe it's just me but I would've preferred him with his Batman accent or whatever.Now what was good? I found only two things positive about this film. The first one is Johnny Depp. Even with the whole ""opposition"" he had from the script he still managed a strong performance. Now the second one is the cinematography. Have to say, that was actually great.I will not give this movie a 5 because it is not as bad as movies like Legion or Priest but I won't want to see this movie again unless it's with someone that can attract my attention while I am watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The film is bland - I think on purpose - but the overall effect hasn't quite worked out, and this film could have been a lot more.

Filled with great moments but ruined by shallow characters,"During the great depression, John Dillinger and his gang loves to rob banks. After leaving prison on parole and then successfully breaking out his men, We follow the life of Dillinger who robs with ease and then hides out among the public.The film looks beautiful and filming it in HD was a great decision.

It felt like they showed the behind the scenes footage. It ruined the movie for me.The action stays visceral and energetic and Depps character is thoroughly entertaining, though. The historical setting is represented with a distinct as well as likable style.Sadly, this movie suffers from an unbalanced portrayal of its protagonist and antagonist.

Surprisingly Disappointing,"I'm an admirer of Michael Mann films, and when I heard about this project, I got quite excited by the prospect of the famously meticulous director working with the equally obsessive, and detail-oriented Christian Bale. Oh, and I suppose the idea of Johnny Depp as Dillinger in a high budget period piece didn't hurt either. Unfortunately, one can't watch a Michael Mann film without drawing comparisons to his best work, and on that note, it doesn't live up to the man's incredible standards.Let's put it this way: it lacks the suspense and existential banter of Collateral, the character play and development of Heat, the action of Last of the Mohicans, and the simple brilliance of The Insider. It does, however, borrow many of the negative factors in previous Mann films: the too-conventional love story from Last of the Mohicans that feels rushed and poorly strung together, the pacing of The Insider, and the sometimes too-obsessive attention to historical detail as in the case of Ali. That brings me to my next point, which is that Mann obsesses over some very small details, making sure that they are authentic to the way history has written them, while taking huge creative liberties with others. What makes this frustrating is that it's hard to see the pay-off when he chooses to be creative, and when he chooses to get bogged down in details.From a technical standpoint, I'm not opposed to the use of digital photography, which has proved itself as a dependable medium (Benjamin Button, Collateral, Sin City etc.); however, the choice of colour pallet and minimalist lighting makes this film incredibly ugly to watch, and is one of the few overtly digital quality films I've seen where you know for every frame that this wasn't film. I imagine that Mann did this in order to differentiate himself from other period films, like The Untouchables (DePalma), which depicts prohibition era Chicago in an all-too-self-aware grandeur. Having said that, it's still no excuse for some of the really poor setups where you can see the actors' make-up, which is distracting, and takes you out of the experience. And perhaps it was the theatre I was in, but I've heard many similar complaints about a bad sound mix. Due in part to this latter fact, I felt the movie lacked a sense of rhythm, and never quite found its stride.In the end, this film is not as thought-provoking as Mann's previous works, and it really lacks the two-way head-to-head that Heat did so well. In that film, one got a sense of the cat- and-mouse struggle despite the two opposing leads sharing very little screen time. In this film, you know that Purvis (Bale) is chasing Dillinger, but you only know this because you're told; otherwise, it's really like two separate films, both of which lack any sense of urgency between either party to take the other out. It also lacks a great deal of excitement, even in what should be its most riveting moments. I still say see it, but go in without expectations, otherwise they'll be dashed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
John Dillinger and more...,"""Public Enemies"" is a Biography - Crime movie in which we follow the lives of the notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Pretty Boy Floyd. During a major crime wave in the 1930s, they were the first priority for the Feds due to their actions on robbing banks, murdering a lot of people including many police officers.I liked this movie very much because it is based on real facts and incidents that happened in a very difficult period of time for the United States. It has a very interesting plot with many plot twists which were really unpredictable and made this movie even more interesting. Regarding the direction which was made by Michael Mann, I want to say that it was simply amazing. It has to be mentioned also the great interpretation of Johnny Depp's who played as John Dillinger and he was outstanding. Other very good interpretations that have to be mentioned too were Christian Bale's who played as Melvin Purvis, Jason Clarke's who played as 'Red' Hamilton and Marion Cotillard'S who played as Billie Frechette.To sum up, I have to say that ""Public Enemies"" is a very good movie with an interesting plot, many good action scenes and equally great interpretations made by its cast.

"Good try, but no cigar.","If John Dillinger was even half as brutal as depicted in this movie, then Johnny Depp was the wrong actor for this role. As a 1930s period piece, the movie is excellent, but that cannot be said for the story itself because the movie attempts to portray the lead character, John Dillinger, and his friends as deserving of some empathy which is entirely disingenuous. They were in fact, violent, brutal criminals who were practically asking for what they finally got. So how can one be expected to care about them? Further, Dillinger and his friends are incorrigible but there is no explanation for their aberrant behavior, leaving one to wonder why they were so violent. Not offering any explanation, the movie becomes just another cops and robbers story, but with one big difference: there are no good guys, thus depriving the audience of even that satisfaction of having somebody to root for. Johnny Depp must be given lots of credit for taking on a role that is way out of character for him, but his portrayal simply fails to project the mean-spirited, menacing nature of a man who whose very name is synonymous with crime.Although Johnny Depp is a wonderful, gifted actor, when it comes to his portrayal of John Dillinger, he is no Warren Oates.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Not exactly 'number one' in the Mann back-catalogue, but Public Enemies is a roaring and pulsating return to form which  will certainly suffice.","This surely must be the proof that Michael Mann can now make these sorts of films in his sleep.

I think a degree of getting back on track accompanies Public Enemies, much like Tarantino's film from that same summer of 2009, Public Enemies is a going back to basics for a man whose last film was flat-out woeful: a deprived and stupefying exercise named Miami Vice. If Inglourious Basterds was an acknowledgment of the tried, tested and failed experiment that was Death Proof; and began with a sequence involving a Nazi officer and a scared French farmer somewhat reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson's Jules and his badgering and interrogating an apartment room full of kids as he senses what he wants is nearby, then it was Tarantino as a whole going back to what he is most known and liked for in Pulp Fiction an re-jigging the material to win us over again. Here, Mann revisits the same sort of material he's best known and liked for, in 1995's Heat, only he delivers Public Enemies with a slight re-jigging in that it's a retelling of the plight of real-life gangster out of the 1930s: John Dillinger.There is no Pacino chasing De Niro around modern day L.A. here; instead, the still rather ample replacements of Johnny Depp's Dillinger and cohorts running amok in a number of locations, predominantly Chicago, and Christian Bale's Bureau of Investigation agent named Melvin Purvis, an additionally true-to-life character, after him. Mann's toying with the material is an entertaining and substantial enough yarn, the men here apparently connected not by way of the fact they know not how to do anything else nor their link in that they struggle domestically with their lives and friends around them; there is no coffee house scene to highlight the similarities both men share as they occupy different sides of the coin, but there is a sequence when Dillinger and Purvis stand opposite one another whilst Dillinger is incarcerated. What follows is an exchange that sees both men forced into recognising they share the same experiences with death, specifically the deaths of friends and co-workers, and thus are somehow intrinsically linked. It'll sound loose and flimsy, but then few will say it's a better film than Heat anyway.Dillinger's superiority when compared to other criminals is established in the opening sequence, a scene that sees a number of jailed prisoners out in the courtyard shuffling forward whilst chained together in drab, striped prison uniforms. Cut to Dillinger, by himself, and being escorted into the prison whilst decked out in a smart black suit and hat. That small sense of hierarchy is complete when it's revealed he's there to aid in instigating a breakout. Meanwhile, Purvis is on the run after gangster Pretty Boy Floyd through some woodland; Purvis' men outnumber him but Floyd's automatic weaponry dwarfs Purvis' bolt action rifle: the catch being Purvis is a crack-shot, and we soon find out that he is. The link between the establishing of both men is chase, Dillinger's dominating of the guards as he lays siege to their watch tower outside the jail in getting away with most of the men standing in contrast to Purvis' chasing and apprehending of Floyd; Dillinger's dominance of his pursuers and Purvis' clinical efficiency of his apprehension of those fleeing neatly teeing up the later match between the two.It is indeed after these pleasantries the film becomes the game of oneupmanship you'd expect, a cat and mouse thriller in which both sides suffer losses, lick wounds and revel in glories. Like Heat, the principal thief character in Dillinger is given a somewhat spur of the moment love interest; someone he promptly sleeps with, falls for and promises to ship on out of the country with in due time. Here, rather than De Niro promise Amy Brenneman's Eady tales of New Zealand, we have French actress Marion Cotillard's character Billie Frechette coming into contact with Dillinger and tales of far off nations plus the good life. Billie's character arc is given due attention, the sorts of dangers that face her becoming slow realities after a handful of incidences and the stark realisation of which side of the fence she's on becoming gut-wrenchingly apparent when a police station beating occurs. In a film about a feud-come-relationship between two men, it's pleasant that Dillinger's bonding with Billie doesn't detract too much.The film is punctuated with an array of shoot outs and heists, heists often turning into shootouts; the centrepiece of which is a woodland area shootout perhaps comparable to that grandeur post-bank robbery shootout which spilt out into the street and beyond found in Heat. Supporting characters on either side are not given us much attention here, but at a small cost; with an interesting sequence unfolding later on, in the camera lingering on Purvis' pained face as a captured and injured gangster in serious need of some anaesthetic lies next door being interrogated – these are sadistic and cruel methods being administered in sadistic and cruel times of crime by the enforcers of the law themselves. Does Purvis seem minutely allured by it all? A small taste of what Dillinger himself inflicts, either physically or by reputation, on people all the time? It'll remind you of Barbara Stanwyck's perverse expression-come-smile in Double Indeminity, as her crippled husband is strangled next to her; it's the feeling of being this close to off key, off colour tactics for the first time to garner what you really want, and it comes out perfectly in the slightest of facial expressions. Mann is back on track after a temporary blip, and here he and his team have crafted a fine thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
another film cursed by the dreaded wobbly camera,"What is Michael Mann's obsession with digital camera's in all there grainy glory? For me all it does is take me out of the film and remind me I'm in a dark room with a hundred strangers. It makes the film look amateurish and slapped together at a moment's notice. This has an effect on the sound depending on where the camera is some guns sounds like they'll blow a tree in half while others sound like firecrackers. The acting varies widely and while depp is fine as Dillinger the character's a bit one dimensional. The same could be said of bale character but for once he doesn't feel the need to growl his way through a film. The most interesting characters are the side ones J E Hoover, Depp's girlfriend and the Texas lawmen but none really get fleshed out there are area's there of great potential particularly for the Texas lawmen who get brought in half way through the film as the saviours of the investigation but no reason is given as to why there suited for the job, i've just got to take it on faith. As mentioned before though the biggest problem for me is the wobbly camera, so many film these days think that it's OK in action scenes to have things moving about so fast that you can't see what's going on, make the audience dizzy and they'll believe they've just seen an awesome action scene but the with no frame of reference to where the players are it's just a swirling mess. it's the same problem which effects the bourne films, greatest action scenes ever i hear you cry! oh behave I retort you wanna watch a great film about gangsters with action go watch heat and remember what Mann use to be like. in fact compare the shoot out scene in heat to the shoot out in the cabin from this film, there's no comparison. Michael Mann use to be a great director but he seems to have lot form completely. I thought Miami vice was terrible but it had a great trailer and likewise upon leaving the cinema last night Public Enemies had the same effect on me.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies,"Chronicling the criminal escapades of John Dillinger, famous bank robber, in his later career Public Enemies plays cop (or in this case FBI agent) and robber on a grand scale in the 1930s American Midwest. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Dillinger, always cool and confident to the point of cockiness he makes the role really come alive. Set against him is Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis, an agent of a FBI still in its early days. He is also great and a good counterpart to Depp as he relentlessly tracks him. The acting and filming is good and makes the story come alive but do not mistake Public Enemies for a documentary or even an extremely historically accurate film. There are numerous factual discrepancies which is fine as long as it still tells an interesting story. That brings up one of the other problems in that Public Enemies falls halfway between history and story while neither completely recreating events as they were or coming up with something completely original. Some characters are not as fleshed out as they could be and a lot of knowledge on a particular figure is sometimes expected to explain their behavior. While those things can be a bit of a problem at times that doesn't stop Public Enemies from being an enjoyable film which while not on the level of some older gangster films like The Untouchables is still good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Decent but flawed,"I was reminded of the film Bonnie & Clyde in which we see a vast expanse of the great plains with grass blowing in the wind, and then a shadow of a cloud rolls across the grass creating an effect of vast isolation for the criminals. A vastness that goes on forever giving the feel that raises the question of what are the criminals escaping to? The latest film staring Johnny Depp as John Dillinger directed by Michael Mann is a decent period film with the costumes, set designs and locations but has a feel of claustrophobia. The camera never really lets us see the whole surroundings of the bank robbers or the G-Men. Everything is up close and tight with a little camera shake at times plus the characters seem to be always in the dark even when it's daytime. Maybe that is what Mann wanted, to give a feel of not knowing what is around you, of always looking over your shoulder. Depp is good as always playing Dillinger and there is never a short supply of action. One interesting scene has Johnny walking into a police station and then precedes to walk slowly around the desks looking at mug shots of his gang, and even asks a group of cops(who do not even recognize him) listening to a ball game on the radio what the score is. Now do you suppose this really happened? As public enemy number one I doubt very much Dillinger would have been that stupid or careless. In any case this is still a watchable film with good performances all around....I just wish that camera would have opened up a little bit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"PUBLIC ENEMIES - ""Locked & loaded but misses the target""","If you loved the preview for Public Enemies, then you won't be disappointed, as it fundamentally a two and a half hour preview.The movie is essentially a brief biopic of John Dillinger, famous outlaw of the depression era, and the cop who pursued him, Melvin Purvis. This is the information you go into the theatre with and that's about all you leave with. The movie stumbles from scene to scene, with no coherent connection between events and characters, I was constantly left wondering who people were and why something had just happened.Despite the above criticism, Public Enemies is not a bad movie/preview and it ticks all the boxes needed to make a great movie/preview ; A-List actors – CHECK, Big Budget – CHECK, Accomplished Director – CHECK, Famous Historical Figure – CHECK, Love Story – CHECK, Big Action Scenes – CHECK, Batman & Willy Wonka II – CHECK. The list goes on and it is an entertaining, if unsatisfying viewing experience.So why wasn't this movie awesome, well if you know nothing about any of the characters it is unlikely you will care what happens to them. Amidst all the jail breaks, bank robberies, and strangely edited love scenes it seems as though there is no time for character development, a few quips from Depp and screams from Bale is about all you get to flesh out the characters. Was the audience supposed to automatically relate to the characters based on the actors resume? I would liken Dillinger to a combination of Don Juan & Donnie Brasco, where Purvis was basically a deep southern version of Batman minus cape & Batmobile. I'd love to mention other characters but they were to unmemorable, pretty boy something?On the Fruit-Meter, Public Enemies get the ""WATERMELON"" - Big, Bold, and Flashy, goes down smooth, but once you've finished eating you realise there wasn't much substance to it.MART-FLIX PUN-FUN - Tommy-guns and big action can't ""bale"" out movie which suffers from lack of ""deppth""...terrible",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Underrated Gangster flick ( C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10,"Film would be generic even back in the 1930's with James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson, but it's one of Johnny Depp's strongest performances",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Where's the HEAT?,"It's hard to watch any Michael Mann film these days without feeling even the slightest of tendencies to measure it against HEAT- Mann's cops- versus-crims epic that stirred, stunned and starred a couple of 'alright' actors called Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Ask any Mann fan what they consider his best film to be and they'll almost certainly come back with the aforementioned. Ask a stubborn film snob like me and I'll insist on The Insider. Anyway, whoever you ask, whichever Mann film you favour, the above-mentioned movies actually have a lot in common: superbly acted urban allegories with clear eyes about the importance of look, sound and feel. They're also comprised of great scripts, photography, sound, scores, half a dozen lens filters and rather memorable endings.So, ""where does this leave Mann's latest film?"" I hear you ask. Well, not only is Public Enemies his finest since the quite brilliant Collateral, but it's reasonably akin to the above-mentioned movies in a variety of ways, especially HEAT. Public Enemies is a relatively well acted, well shot and scored US based action/thriller that's loaded with breathtaking shoot outs: it looks, feels and above all sounds pretty good. What's more, Mann's grafted A-list stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale onto its set-up, employing vintage yet somewhat bare characterisation techniques to show the similar mind sets and emotions of cops and robbers. Having said that, though, Public Enemies lacks that (for want of a better word) 'zing' that made Mann's finest work just that. To rank his latest film amidst his best would not only be generous, it would be wrong.Pubic Enemies is an overlong, self assured film that has been drained of all depth and complexity to make room for some fast, profit- reaping commercialism and high concept. Spun from Bryan Burrough's equally titled book, the film tells the true tale of notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Depp), a charismatic, Robin Hood like maverick whose swift and graceful raids made him the number one target of J. Edgar Hoover's newly founded FBI and its chief agent, Melvin Purvis (Bale).Back in a Depression ridden, 1930's America, Dillinger's name and antics held somewhat of an illustrious place in society. No cop could stop him. No bank could beat him. No jail could hold him. His magnetism and foolhardy prison breaks widened his appeal to almost everyone, from his girlfriend Billie Frechette (a superb Marion Cotillard) to a society who felt no compassion for the banks that had thrust their nation into a Depression. If only Dillinger and his band of crooks were among us now, eh? Anyway, the film is basically a far from extraordinary dramatisation of a particularly 'eventful' year in the life of a love- struck Dillinger with Purvis' bid to catch him acting as an omnipresent plot boost.Pitting Depp against Bale, Public Enemies certainly harks back to Mann's metro' crime classics HEAT, The Insider and Collateral, yet, it ultimately fails to tap Bale's true potential. If there's any area that the film can be seriously accused of faltering in then it's in the sheer depth of Bale's forgettable supporting character: there isn't any. Depp is excellent, playing a tortured, bent kind of anti villain who, like De Niro's character in HEAT, has a heart, a dream and enough principles to steal the audience's sympathy. Bale is far less convincing, though- trapped inside a shallow, uninspiring role that begs to be explored. He does the best with what he's been given, yes, but I'm afraid the usually reliable Bale has been upstaged for the third film on the bounce by an actor who's just had more to work with. Ledger had the Joker. Worthington had Marcus Wright. And now Depp has Dillinger. I'm not even sure why Bale even went for this role. He's a side character at best. I found Marion Cotillard's character and performance far more interesting. Anyway, enough Bale bashing. Onto the film stuff.Mann's hands-on approach to filming combined with Elliot Goldenthal virtuoso score and sound mixing are the film's underlying strengths. A modern sheen on 1930's styling is also brought to fruition but Mann and DP Dante Spinotti shoot and frame the locations in such a way that they ultimately fail to boast the same kind of presence the urban spaces did in their previous work. For me, Public Enemies does not reflect Mann's knack for transforming city and landscapes into screen characters. A few overhead shots, tracks or even the odd long shot or two would've been nice. Maybe even a tea-stained, saturated lens filter would've added a little more authenticity, a little more character. It sure did the job in that Francis Ford Copolla gangster film. I forget what it's called. Anyway, I guess I'm nitpicking, but when it comes to Michael Mann, when it comes to one of the most experienced visualists in the business, you expect better. The dark and largely sombre palette employed along with the cold, clear interiors certainly add to a detailed mise-en-scene that works well with a whole host of hand-held coverage but Mann's summer smash stirs in the shadows of his transfixing, urban masterstrokes and emerges a forgettable gangster caper.Good: At times suspenseful, sometimes sensual and very well scored, Public Enemies is a decent yet unremarkable film riddled with remarkable gunfights. Mann's authorial traits permeate the plot throughout and his droll Cagney homage a la Stephen Graham was a very nice touch, but I guess Public Enemies belongs to Johnny Depp- if anyone.Bad: The comparisons are there alright, but Public Enemies is no HEAT. Bale's talents all but go to waste inside a second-rate supporting role and the film, itself, is nothing more than a flimsy genre mash-up when weighed against the likes of, say, Scarface, Once upon a time in America, American Gangster and Miller's Crossing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
masterpiece,"i saw the trailer for this film long before it came out and was blown away by the trailer alone. but what the trailer did was, it gave me the impression that it was a good, exciting action film with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, two of my favourite actors. so i went in with high hopes, but as soon as it started i got the sense that this film was so much more then an action with good acting. it was a film that as i say ""knew what it was doing"". The film was shot on many different locations so to move fast they used a small HD camera to film. this for many people almost ruined the film for them, but for me it only added to the realism in the direction and performances. you are in 1933 with John Dillinger and Melvin Pervis...you aren't in a cinema watching a film. i would give this movie a solid ten as it is a landmark and a break through in the world of film. I hope i'm not alone in my opinion. thanks for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not without its faults but I enjoyed it- nice to see Johnny Depp playing someone normal,"I enjoyed this, it was nice to see Johnny Depp playing someone normal,(not a cartoon character). A longish movie well set in the 1930's following notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during their booming crime wave.Possibly because of this has story has been written but John Dillinger's life seemed pointless to me. He was either on the run, escaping from jail or being shot at and never seemed to be able to just sit back and enjoy his stolen bank loot.Many scenes that I enjoyed but where he walks right into the FBI headquarters and asks the score on the baseball game was pretty hilarious. The ending was also very good. I enjoyed the romance here too, that scene when Billie gets arrested and Dillinger has to leave her and drive away, that look ...a little heartbreaking. 01/13",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Technically poor. Creatively worse.,"I carried knowledge of the real story into the theater. Therefore, I feel that because I was well versed in the story of Dillinger I really felt what was missing.What was missing? The mood of the country: It was the Great Depression and people were poor and out of work - they looked at the banks (wall street) and the govt as the real 'public enemies'. Thus the elevation of fame: John Dillinger came along and stole from the banks, but refused to steal from ordinary hard working people. He did this while constantly humiliating the burgeoning FBI, thus the Govt. He was seen as a modern Robin Hood. A hero. He was media savvy and knew what to do to bolster his image. He became more famous than any movie star or other public figure of his day. None of this was really in the film. It was only alluded to. Character development/motivation: Who was Dillinger and why was he a bank robber? We don't know. What drove him? Never even hinted at. How did he change/grow/fall from the beginning of the film to the end? He didn't. Who was Purvis and what drives his sense of justice and the law? Don't know. Why is Dillinger so important to him, in particular? Never addressed. How did he change/grow/fall from the beginning to the end of the film? He didn't. It ended exactly as it began for him. What is the counterpoint between these two characters? Not played upon. Melvin Purvis much later eventually killed himself, as is stated in the end tag... but nothing we've seen in the film has shown us even the slightest bit of what character flaw or events might lead to this.In addition, the technical flaws in this film were far too many to overlook.Sound: The sound flaws were UNFORGIVABLE. Many times throughout the film, the three of us watching the movie turned to each other to ask what the actor on screen just said. We thought the theatre was shitty or something, until it became obvious that it was the design or lack-there-of. Director Michael Mann made one of the biggest mistakes I ALWAYS see amateur filmmakers get reamed for at film festivals, which is underestimating the power and IMPORTANCE of SOUND. It is 50% of the film experience and he treated it like it didn't matter in the slightest.Lighting: There is no consistency between shots even WITHIN THE SAME SCENE. The color palette of the film is all over the place (and changes from scene to scene and even within the same scene). And there never seems to be a reason for it - no storytelling reason at least. I would understand warm tones to tell a certain tale or cool for the same - but it would be warm to cool for no reason whatsoever. Night shots looked like giant spot lights through the trees. In fact, there are at least three shots where you actually SEE the giant spot lights, dead on. They didn't try to diffuse the lights at all or hide the fact that they were there. It was just giant harsh flood lights raining unnatural super-bright light on the scene. I am aware this is how most films shoot at night - but most of the time they are disguised and diffused enough to at least PASS for FULL MOON light. But these were coming in at the wrong (90 degree) angle to-boot! And the exterior night shots right in front of the cabin, where you might it expect it to be slightly brighter, were appropriately dark (well lit), and only seconds later when deep in the woods, it is bright as daylight - from a source you can actually see just behind a tree. Ridiculous.In summary, I learned what I know of the Dillinger/Purvis story by watching a 2 hr History channel documentary reenactment of this story, which was far more engaging & technically competent than this film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Public Enemies hits the vault, but doesn't take everything...","John Herbert Dillinger is still one of the most recognisable names that emerged from the 'Public Enemy Era' during the Great Depression in early 1930's America. Some say he was a dangerous criminal, a sociopath who lived to simply kill and rob. Others admire his Robin Hood-esquire quality of taking from the capitalist institutions during a period of economic crisis. Michael Mann paints Dillinger (Johnny Depp) in his latest action-blockbuster 'Public Enemies' as a man with pride, self-respect and principles – he ""never leaves a man behind"" – but adds little more to that characterisation and that is the principle fault with a very enjoyable film.The film starts in 1933 as the audience are thrown straight into action typical Michael Mann style, as John Dillinger and his gang orchestrate an elaborate plan to break-out their remaining gang members still held up in prison. Following the break-out and a resulting shoot-out in which Dillinger's mentor Walter Dietrich (James Russo) is killed, we are shown the other side of the law as FBI Agent Melvin Pervis (Christian Bale) hunts down famous Depression-era criminal Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). The film then primarily revolves around Agent Pervis's pursuit of the elusive bank robber and romantic. Minor plot points pertaining to the time period are covered briefly in-between including an incredibly strong performance from Billy Crudup as the Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, who is constantly fighting for further recognition of the Bureau's activities and power within the American system of law and justice.Depp, as always, brings to life the character he is playing as he uses the little characterisation he has been given to turn Dillinger into a womanizer, a man with principles, but at the same time a human being who doesn't mind spilling blood for the greater good – the bigger picture. However, the substantial effort Depp places into the role of Dillinger cannot salvage it from the little depth Mann chooses to explore in Dillinger and the surrounding cast, which can be attributed primarily to the fact that with so many different characters involved in the minor side-stories in the film there simply isn't enough time for Mann to expose the main characters in depth. Yet, despite this major flaw in the film, Mann still manages to bring his exciting, and startlingly realistic action-set-pieces to life.When the Dillinger clan is cornered in a cabin in the woods by the rabid law-enforcement officers looking for Mr Public-Enemy Number One, a brilliantly shot shoot-out takes place between the two sides of the law in which every window pane of glass broken and every empty shell-casing disposed of is startling photographed in such beautiful realism that it places there and removes you from simply being a impartial audience member to one of men holding a tommy-gun and firing aimlessly for your life. As we have come to get used to, Mann takes advantage of his skill for shooting violent-action oriented scenes, whether it is a shoot-out, a murder or the many bank robberies that we see Dillinger commit, and brings the audience closer to the action happening just in front of them. Aside from the cinematography a solid soundtrack, including Otis Taylor's brilliant Ten Million Slaves, seems to compliment the 1930's depression-era almost perfectly and is guaranteed to get you tapping your foot to the beat.Mann's 'Public Enemies' is a competent crime-drama that contains just enough exciting set-pieces and charm to win over most audiences for the two hours it is on-screen, but it is by no means a flawless piece of cinema. The lack of characterisation is a serious flaw in Mann's well-layered film, while the fact that the film also plays around with history and has certain important events occurring before they actually did also takes away from the historical accurate nature of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Mann's and Depp's greatest job,"Johnny Depp has always been a showman, and he does it fine, but with a little of Michael Mann's help, he gave the best performance of his career as John Dillinger, not even Tim Burton could do that. Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard are also pretty good, but I think 2 acting monsters like Depp and Bale could have interacted more, but the scene where they act together is greatly performed because they speak each other like thinking ""this guy is an idiot and I'm a genius"". Michael Mann achieves to show a cynical and brutal gangster, who is at the same time a passionate romantic. We men should learn from him on how to get a girl. That makes Public Enemies the film where Mann best develops his characters and plot, specially in Film Noir, where characters have to be as good as they are evil. Speaking on Film Noir, the 30s atmosphere giving tribute to James Cagney and Clark Gable films is enjoyable. In resume, it's Michael Mann's best film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mann Limits Dillinger/Depp in Otherwise Great 'Public Enemies',"Hollywood has tried to make history more exciting in movies. 10,000 B.C, Braveheart, 300 and even The Da Vinci Code had some social studies packed in it somewhere. Public Enemies tries to retell the story of John Dillinger, the notorious 1930s bank robber. But who could portray Dillinger? Nobody could possibly live up to play himbut Johnny Depp looks a little bit like the guy. Enter Depp as Dillinger, opening the movie being taken to prison. He later tricks the guards and shortly him and the other convicts escape. And what do you know, Johnny robs some more banks, and the rest is pretty much repeated for the whole two and a half hour runtime. It's only when Christian Bale enters the scene when the movie gets exciting. Bale plays FBI Bureau chief Melvin Purvis, a guy who is just losing his mind over the bank robber. ""He's making a mockery of the U.S justice system!"" He follows him to cabins, movie theaters, apartments, etc, etc. His role is one of the best in the movie; however not to say that the rest of the cast was bad (Marion Cottilard especially was fantastic), it's that Bale once again really gets into his role as he always does. The Dark Knight, Rescue Dawn, Terminator Salvation. Now remember questions were stirring when the posters for Public Enemies came out and Bale wasn't on any of them? Because this is Depp's movie, not Christian Bale's; he's had his fair share! What Enemies is saying is fairly simple: ""Depp is back, bitches."" Michael Mann is no stranger to shoot-em-up flicks. This is the guy who directed Miami Vice, Collateral, Heat and produced The Kingdom, Hancock and Nobody Loves Alice among many others. One thing that you notice is that his style of film-making is that of a documentarian or a Michael Bay movie. The gunshot scenes are explosive, yet you won't know who's shooting who or what. My friend even pointed out that the top of the character's heads aren't visible for nearly half of the movie. In the beginning this is kind of funky (did I just say that?), but by the third shoot-out, it's pretty damn annoying.Public Enemies isn't that bad of a movie, but it's not fantastic either. It is, however, the most historically accurate movie about the golden age of crime I've seen so far. Don't rush out and see it, but don't skip out on what is yet another memorable role for Johnny Depp without Tim Burton.3/5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Masterpiece - That's bloody underrated,"No doubt when I watched it at the Cinema the pacing was something I had to get used to.This is grand intelligent film-making people. Hypnotic Cinematography, superb direction and performance from all those involved.I saw it once at the cinema and rented it on DVD recently to see if I wanted to buy it on DVD. Yes I absolutely do, the more I watch it the faster pace the film seems, something I would recommend to those who found it to boring The cinematography is purely realistic. Bright and in our eyes as if we were there. The great Mann doesn't try and put us in our own time and gloss up the cinematography to make distanced from the era.The sound is loud with it's Rat-a-tat ness that also strips away the space between you and the film. Some don't embrace directors ditching celluloid, I for one am sold on it, I guess that makes me luckier We are there, everything is visible and it's something once use to and watched again really works.Another treat is our lead character (and John Dillinger is quite one indeed) is enigmatic. His drive is a furious one that fuelled his bank robbing.To quote Empire Magazine Johnny Depp underplays John Dillinger to perfection. And he does, no clichéd Cagney Tribute. Dillinger feels real and out there all at once. We see his tears and vulnerability along with his balls of steel livin in the moment life style.Once his mind is set on something. Nothings gonna change it. This brings in the girl of his dreams. Marion Coltillard plays her and really makes me sit up and take notice of her as an actress (something I did with Angelina Jolie and Changeling) obviously later than everyone else.Public Enemies will go underrated. But I'll be getting this movie to own for the rest of my life. It is grand, stylish and intelligent.If you thought it was good and not great.

Hugely Boring,"I haven't liked all of Michael Mann's movies, but when I don't, it's usually because they're a hot mess (""Miami Vice"" comes to mind) rather than because they're boring. Until now.""Public Enemies"" has no real conceivable reason for existing. It tells the story of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) but feels like a warmed-over and irrelevant rehash of every gangster movie that's come before it. It suffers from a serious case of identity crisis. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a character study of Dillinger, a love story about the girl he brings with him on the lam (Marion Cotillard) or about the specifics of the investigation leading to his eventual murder outside of a Chicago movie theatre. It ends up not really being about any of these things and gives its actors, all good ones, nothing to do. It's a giant bore of a film, and a long one at that.Much of the film reminded me of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" and made me wish I was watching that pretty much perfect movie instead of this one.Grade: C",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good story, acting, costumes and sets. Great visually. Poor sound lets the whole thing down.","I'm a big fan of the gangster and crime genre, especially those that are based around the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. Therefore, I could be a little biased towards this film, and this is my first review, so please be nice. The story and plot were good, I was thoroughly entertained throughout (as films should seek to do!). There is an argument that the film is lacking in depth and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters, but I enjoyed deciding on which character to support through the film. To put it simply, it's about the American criminal John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and his gang of bank robbers. They are pursued by cop Melvin Purvis (Chritian Bale). Both give good performances, as do Marion Cotillard and Stephen Graham. The make-up, costumes and the overall look of the film are brilliant. They capture the late 30's and early 40's great and the high-definition picture is definitely up there amongst some of the most crystal clear images I have ever seen. However, it is the sound that really lets this film down and costs it scoring a seven or eight. Having bought the blu-ray release, hoping the sound quality would improve on the digital version I had previously, I was bitterly disappointed to hear no change. The sound changes volume at will and in periods needs to be drastically turned down. It was so bad I had to hole the remote throughout the film, for fear of blowing my speakers! Simple review, but I feel my point is made. It could have been great and would watch it more often if weren't for the poor sound.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good story, terrible cinematography","It's really a shame that the action sequences and scenes were filmed in the way that they were because it really killed what could have been a perfect movie. The story was engrossing and the acting was well executed, but... the way this movie was filmed was god awful. During action sequences, shot angles were strange and poorly done. At times I felt like I was watching someone's home video. There were no emotionally highlighted scenes. No pause for dramatic effect in any way. Don't get me wrong, I don't like cheesy music and drawn out pauses, but this movie had so many characters and so many chopped up shaky action sequences (thank you Bourne series for starting this trend...) that you often couldn't tell who had died and why this was an important event. The story, however, is great and I would still recommend this movie, but would not recommend Michael Mann direct anything ever again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Cinematography Amazing and Plot Not so Bad either,"I wasn't expecting much when I went to this film. I am a major Johnny Depp fan, I believe his acting is amazing.

I felt like I was watching an old time movie.Aside from the guy texting constantly in the row ahead of me, I thought the movie was interesting and a great view of John Dillinger. Don't go to this movie expecting to learn everything about his life. For that I recommend that history channel. This movie was a nice portrayal of what he was like. Almost like a slice of life. I don't need long drawn out explanations. Just cut to the point. I can find out the rest for myself. I loved it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Entertaining and fun, but short of deep and moving.","If anything can be said about Michael Mann's Public Enemies, is that it is hardly a sensationalized version of John Dillinger's life. Depp plays Dillinger as having a good time robbing banks and breaking people out of prison, but the film itself doesn't portray these acts of crime and violence as fun, daring, or morally acceptable. Depp's character never stops to celebrate his victories or dance in glory. Unlike The Godfather or Goodfellas, where the audience is rooting for the criminals the entire time, Public Enemies does not take the same stance. Instead the movie portrays the tragedy of a man who has no other vice then to rob banks and the consequences of those actions.Christian Bale plays, Merlvin Purvis, a newly appointed FBI agent assigned to hunt down American's number one public enemy, John Dillinger. Again, the film does not try to glorify the hay days of the 1930 and the fun and excitement one might get from day to day gun battles in the street. Purvis is a torched character, who seems to long for something besides massacring criminals on the street, in a sense he feels genuinely afraid of Dillinger – or afraid of failing to arrest him.Like Mann's film Heat, this has a dramatic narrative and laced in between are hard hitting, and terrifying at times, gun battles. Where in other films, characters might be dodging bullet left and right, here Mann creates greats tension in the feeling that anyone of us might get shot. Many of the angles from the gun battles are looking down the barrel of a Tommy gun – like a third person shooter game. Mann does tend to keep the camera a little to close to the action and drama on screen. It would have great to see a few more wide angles. However, the aesthetic of the film is how close and shoulder lever the camera always is in respect to the characters, creating of feeling of being a part of the action or another character in that location.This film is certainly a great film, with rich characters that probably are best brought to life through Depp and Bale. The only fault to this film, is that narrative it holds it's character entirely at arms length. Unlike Heat or The Insider, where we are drawn into the characters and their psyche, this film never lets us in. If it were not for Depp and Bale, we might even be a few more steps back then we all ready are. The perspective for the audience isn't as an audience member but as an observer who might be there watching them now. Public Enemies does have great acting and a lot of violence. It is entertaining and fun to watch, however Mann who usually puts out A+ material, falls a little short here. But still, Public Enemies is better than many of them films out there today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Hooked,"I did not know a lot about the history before watching this, though I understand that this is highly accurate, with a few liberties taken for creative license. I have a great degree of respect for Mann's work... apart from obviously this one, I've watched Last of the Mohicans, Miami Vice, Collateral and, by far the one most comparable to this, Heat. The endings of the latter two have been disappointing, and while it may not be completely perfect, the final portion of this is considerably less anti-climactic and unfulfilling than that of those. However, the Pacino/De Niro piece does get something completely right in an area where this one stumbles: The amount of characters is spot-on, and we get proper insight to the motivations and personalities of them, we get to know them. This one has too many, and as a direct result, not everyone gets to stand out as an individual. Worse still, at points, you'll find yourself forgetting who this or that guy is, and what side they're on. Each of them is credible, as is the background that we do get. The writing is excellent. Dialog and script are solid. Every single acting performance is marvelous, Depp is charming and sympathetic without being Orlando Bloom-y, and Bale gets to use subtle hints. One can definitely tell this is directed by Michael... the level of detail is incredible, and the action is awesome(and doesn't divert the attention from the plot), realistic and genuinely exciting. This does not feel like a Hollywood flick. He also makes you care about the people, if this is not his strongest in that regard. You can also see that this is recent, with the hand-held cinematography and such, but I enjoyed it(and the fact that, done right, it can be rather effective should not be neglected, simply because it can be argued to be an annoying current fad). This is entertaining and, at times, quite suspenseful. It's fast-paced, and you do have to be ready to pick up on a good bit of information to follow it completely. The editing is sharp. All of the music is well-chosen and fitting. This evokes the 30's feeling and mood well, it doesn't try to ""update"" it. There is bloody violence, with a bit of language, and sexuality that is never graphic. None of this is gratuitous. I recommend this warmly to anyone who likes film depictions of the period and its criminals. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mediocre - at best. And I'm easy to please...,"This will go in my books as one of those movies that was so ""almost there"". On the face of it the movie has all the right ingredients, but it fails to come together to make a meaningful movie experience. The acting is largely flawless, but the cast is let down by a script that delivers shockingly bad lines at times. The cinematography sits in an uncomfortable space between traditional movie and docu-drama with disjointed use of traditional film flow and handy-cam scenes. The soundtrack went largely unnoticed. Filming in digital video for such a complex movie was also a mistake as it killed the atmosphere of some critical scenes.You never really get absorbed into the movie because at every step you are working hard to fall in step with it, but its stochastic storytelling and distracting mistakes/errors of judgment leave a plethora of questions and a headache.Overall watching the movie was a very frustrating experience. As I followed it I willed the movie to pull through and succeed, instead it flatfootedly dragged me through it for over two hours.My three stars are for the obvious effort the cast and crew put into it, not for the final product.

So historically inaccurate that I cannot recommend it,"I have no problem with Hollywood movies. However, when you pretend that you are making a biopic or reenacting history, well, you need to be kind of realistic. This movie is one lie after another. It opens up right from the start with lie #1, Pretty Boy Floyd being killed by Melvin Purvis. Not only did Purvis not kill him, but Floyd would not die for several years later, well after Dillinger. Later we see Baby Face Nelson being shot and killed after the shoot-out and Little Bohemia. Uhh, nope, that is a lie as well. Nelson would die over a year later in another incident, well after Dillinger. Then Mann makes up this bogus relationship between Dillinger and Billie. Nope, did not happen that way either. I thought filmmakers had evolved into a position where they were able to make entertaining movies while sticking to the truth. Apparently Mann does not regard truth as being important. I mean, why even bother calling the movie Dillinger if you are going to lie about so many historical events, why not just make it a complete work of fiction? And the romanticizing of Dillinger was also ridiculous, the man was popular, but he was not nearly as ""saintly"" as Mann tries to make you believe. Dillinger had a lot of blood on his hands and many dark things in his past.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public Enemies is a Great Movie,"I saw the movie this evening, and was expecting a good movie because of the trailers I'd seen, and because of the other info I had read online about it. It far exceeded my expectations! Johnny Depp's portrayal of John Dillinger was perfect -- Depp really buries himself in the role, and plays a very plausible, believable Dillinger. Christian Bale was good as Melvin Purvis. One of the actors (I don't know his name) grated on my nerves, but that was his role -- and he played it very well; kind of the man you love to hate. I may see the movie again with a different group of friends, and will definitely purchase the DVD when it becomes available.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
an honest review of Public Enemies,"Public Enemies is a good idea in theory, especially with the phenomenal Johnny Depp as John Dillinger. John Dillinger was a legendary bank robber in the 30s. He was a symbol of hope to society in a time when the government was unjust and greedy. He was known for his many bank heists along with his many romantic conquests. This movie does not show that at all. Public Enemies is far longer than it needs to be and it just drags on and on. The only thing keeping me from walking out was Johnny Depp's fantastic performance. Christian Bale is an amazing actor and he could have been in this movie too, if he didn't keep switching from about 5 different accents. Which was extremely distracting and annoying. The camera work and directing is disgraceful and headache inducing. It was obvious that Michael Mann (the director) was going for a realistic, almost documentary-like movie. All it did was make things confusing and frustrating. It was extremely hard to tell what was going on throughout the entire movie (and this is a long movie) and most of the movie was spent wondering what the heck is going on. Then there was the ""romance."" It didn't seem believable and just dragged on while seeming utterly pointless. I have no idea why Hollywood seems to think that it MUST have a romance as part of the main plot. Dillinger and Frechette's romance was greatly dramatized in the movie. If this entire romance had been thrown out the movie would be much shorter and there could have been room for an actual plot and some action. I mean, seriously, only 3 bank heists, seriously?There are so many things wrong with this movie's plot. First off, nothing is explained. Ever. Why does John Dillinger rob banks? Why were the people on the streets cheering him on? Who are pretty-boy Floyd and baby-face nelson? The writers of a movie cannot just assume the audience knows the movie's background. Second off, they really needed to mention the other things going on in this time. Like, you know a little thing called the Great Depression and the other Public Enemies, such as Bonnie and Clyde. Third, why the hell was this rated R? The reason given is ""gangster violence and some language."" For what was in this movie, it could easily have been rated PG-13. Fourth, Why was Billy Crudup's accent so ridiculous and yet no one else's was? All of the accents in this movie were ridiculous, except that of Johnny Depp. Billy Crudup really should have had more screen time and maybe the movie would have made some sense. Marion Cotillard's screen time needed to be cut in half, at the least. Another irksome thing about this movie was that it didn't show a single one of Dillinger's jackrabbit-like moves he was famous for. Public Enemies also did not show John Dillinger in a positive light. He was known as a sort of Robin Hood and that was not apparent in this movie.Johnny Depp's acting is the only redeemable part of this movie and the only reason I did not walk out, but this is not enough to see a movie. Do not see this movie, unless you enjoy having your brain raped.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mann's best since HEAT,"3 years after the underwhelming Miami Vice, Michael Mann returns with Public Enemies. To say it is a great movie is an understatement. This is why movies are made, so stories like these can be told by artists like Mann. The performances, especially Bale's, are great and restrained as many people are probably wondering. Depp shows that he is an actual actor who doesn't just put on makeup and appear in Tim Burton films and makes Dillinger incredibly human and likable just like the real man himself was and also shows his violent side with subtlety instead of being over the top. The HD cinematography by Dante Spinotti was also incredible and probably the highlight of the movie since it brought so many dull things and dark rooms come to life with color and light. The sound design is of course amazing as is the case with every Mann film and Elliot Goldenthal's score brings so much emotion and ambiance to every scene it is used in. Go see this film, it truly is a great film and one that you will not regret that you saw at the cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good Movie With A Sour Note,"I thought this movie was very well acted, shot, directed, and written. Johnny Depp can do no wrong these days it seems. The violence was brutal and Mann did a great job at making the audience sympathetic to Dillinger. For the record, I was not sympathetic, as I am fully aware of Dillinger's violent and murderous actions. He was a monster. Nevertheless, my wife was very sympathetic.The downside to this film was the horrendous sound mix. It was one of the worst I've ever heard. At first, I thought it was the theater's problem, but once I had the operator change the mix from surround to mono, I realized it was the film's problem. Too bad. I was amazed that the studio let the final print out in that condition. Thumbs down for the sound designer, editors, and producers.Overall, Public Enemies is a crowd pleaser and enjoyable movie that doesn't glorify the gangsters of that age, but portrays them in a very real and shocking way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Wanted Dead- JOHN DILLINGER.,"I have always been a fan of the director Michael Mann, and I thoroughly enjoyed his 1995 film Heat, which is known for having arguably the greatest action scene in the history of film making. So naturally, I was eager to see what he could do with telling the story of, in my opinion, the best criminal of all time- John Dillinger. And let me tell you, he did NOT disappoint.As expected, the acting was superb. Johnny Depp is always great, and he did a fantastic job playing John Dillinger, and Christian Bale was awesome in his role as Agent Melvin Purvis, especially with that old-school accent. I was previously unfamiliar with Marion Cotillard, but she impressed me with her role as Billie Frechette. All of the supporting cast did a good job as well, but Depp and Bale are the ones that truly made this film.From the instant the film opens, you feel yourself submerged in the movie, and you truly want to know what happens. This movie has a good amount of very intense and adrenaline-pumping shootouts, and the camera will often go to angles that are over the shoulder of one of the gunners, and it often makes you feel as if you are right in the middle of the firefight.I have read some reviews that said this seemed rushed, but I disagree with those statements. The film ran just over 130 minutes, and for a film of this type, that's the perfect duration. Perhaps it would have been nice for the film to open with a flashback depicting Dillinger's rough childhood, but the film pretty much covers the main details of his childhood in all the conversations Dillinger has with the various characters in the film. The movie covers all of the main points of Dillinger's criminal life, and that's what I would have done if I had been director. There's no need for all of the minor things that have nothing at all to do with the main story, and that would have thrown wasted time into the film, and I think it would have made it an overall inferior film to what we got.I would only recommend this to people who enjoy crime films with a good amount of action, so basically what I'm saying is this- Public Enemies is a 100 percent guy film, so if any of the guys are looking for a compelling, testosterone-filled thrill ride, head over to your local cinema and check out Public Enemies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Lowest Common Denominator,"This film is terrible from start to finish and I am convinced that Ebert is being paid by the studios to give good ratings to the trash that is being spewed from Hollywood. This film is a prime example of what Hollywood has been doing for the past decade or so. Assign a hack of a director (Michael Mann), hire A-list actors (Bale & Depp), half-ass a story, offer little to no editing and expect the masses to accept this crap as a masterpiece! People need to wake up and realize that if they support this nonsense Hollywood will continue to make this trash. This is the lowest common denominator that has infiltrated our films, TV shows and music. People stop thinking for themselves expecting someone else to think for them and tell them what is good and what is not.Still not convinced? Well let's see if I can help a little more since a lot of people on this site apparently liked this film, which is very sad really. OK, let's start with the script. There was not a single actor in this film that could deliver these lines in a believable way. It was as if the actors already knew that this movie wasn't working and they were there for a pay check. Editing, pretty sure if I had edited this movie I would want my name removed from the credits. This movie should have been 90 minutes long, not a minute longer. So many scenes should have been cut out completely or shorted by at least half. This leads me into the terribly underdeveloped plot. How many actors in this film looked, talked and acted in exactly the same way? I was confused by all of them b/c not a single one of them were developed in the story in anyway other than Depp, Bale and Cotillard. And if you were wondering why there were so many overly drawn out dramatic close-ups, its b/c there wasn't enough of a story written and Michael Mann can NOT make a movie less than 2 1/2 hours! It's like he wants to be Scorsese, but he just doesn't have the talent to be him.The time has come to stop accepting this crap as filet mignon and calling it what it is, crap.

Very enjoyable.,"I'm not a fan of gangster films, I've never seen The Untouchables or anything of that ilk. I'll fully admit that the primary reason I saw this film was because of Johnny Depp. So I can't comment on how good it was versus other movies of a similar nature.But as a stand-alone film, I enjoyed it immensely. Lots of action, the gun battles were breathtakingly realistic, and Johnny Depp did a wonderful job, as always.I did have a few qualms, however. I felt that the romance was a bit contrived; Depp and Cotillard did have some chemistry, but the fact that their relationship was so hurried didn't help to showcase the connection between them I also had trouble understanding some of the lines, I don't know if it was the delivery (from multiple characters) or due to the background noise.Overall, however, I really liked this movie. Dillinger's character was believable and Depp played him with a cocksure intensity that he has never displayed before. Hopefully we'll see at least an Oscar nom for his work!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Depp doesn't disappoint, but, in the end, almost everything else does.","First of all, we must address the critical issue here. Johnny Depp is the best actor currently working. This places upon him the awesome responsibility of building a body of work while he is in his prime that will be worthy of him as a legacy. It is that standard against which Depp's work, including Public Enemies, must be measured. Even in those lofty terms, Public Enemy is successful, but hardly a triumph.I should also admit that I am a notorious Michael Mann hater. Sure, I liked The Aviator, but probably more despite Mann's touch than because of it. His envisioning of Will Graham, the central character of Thomas Harris's Manhunter, as an ersatz Miami Vice cool cat was criminal, and in the decades since he's really done little to redeem himself.Public Enemies is, of course, set in post-depression Indiana, where John Dillinger was an unlikely folk hero. His grave at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis is regularly visited, as evidenced by the stacks of coins that are always resting on his stone. Depp's portrayal of Dillinger, perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the movie, reels with charisma befitting the legend, without becoming corny like Warren Beatty's Clyde Barrow.Depp's scenes with Oscar winning leading lady Marion Cotillard smolder with a sexuality which the eccentric characters Depp often plays rarely give him the opportunity to portray, but which he does searingly. Throughout the movie, Depp is almost constantly on screen, and his presence is always electric and incendiary.The rest of the cast is superb. Christian Bale, looking a little wan in this movie, is beautifully wooden as Melvin Purvis, reminding me a bit of Kevin Costner as Elliott Ness in The Untouchables. Speaking of The Untouchables, Billy Drago's portrayal of Frank Nitti in The Untouchables was much more powerful than Bill Camp's version here, but then Drago's character was more central to the story in The Untouchables.Billy Crudup, fresh off his turn as the all powerful Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen, is almost unrecognizable as J. Edgar Hoover. He manages to capture the ambition and determination of Hoover, while avoiding the clichés associated with him, particularly with regard to Dillinger.It's wonderful to see Giovanni Ribisi in a major picture again, and it looks like we'll be seeing more of him in the near future. Likewise Stephen Dorff and Lili Taylor. In fact, one has to give Mann credit for assembling such a great cast, although credit for this probably goes to the amazing work of Avy Kaufman and Bonnie Timmermann, both of whom are among the most sought after casting professionals in Hollywood.And now to the movie. Although the story plays out pretty predictably, as any such movie must, at times it reels and lurches like a music video, complete with period soundtrack. Little could be presented about this story that isn't already known, so, instead, we get touchstones decorated with details most likely imagined, albeit convincingly.Technically speaking, the movie is put together nicely, and why not? Master cinematographer Dante Spinotti and his HD cameras illuminate every scene in scintillating detail. Elliot Goldenthal's soundtrack is equally thrilling, if for no other reason than its authenticity.Now you might be asking, at this point, with all the talent assembled here, what went wrong, because, as you might imagine I have been leading up to, something did go wrong. Well, it's the script. Cowritten by Mann, along with Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman, it just doesn't happen.With Mann and Bennett, I'm not surprised; neither has shown himself to be a particularly capable writer as such. But Biderman gave us Primal Fear and Copycat, so I expected more. Essentially, however, the story ends up dramatically inert and more than a little uneven. As I mentioned, it ""reads"" like a music video, desperately lacking narrative foundation and structure. The central characters, most of them epic in real life, lack depth, and little is done to capture the dramatic tension inherent in their collisions.I'll be honest. I went to see this movie for one reason – because Johnny Depp is in it. When Mann works with marquee talent, it usually works. Take Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat, but then, how could you go wrong with that much talent? With Public Enemies, despite all the assembled brilliance, what you end up with is essentially a wind-up story left to unwind on its own, which it does predictably and without much of a payoff. Definitely worth a watch, and Depp doesn't disappoint, but, in the end, almost everything else does.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Excellent Movie,"OK, so some of the people who have posted comments on here have serious mental disorders. You can't say the film is bad because it's historically inaccurate, because it's about making a good movie - not a documentary. You can't say the film is bad because you have gripes with John Dillinger's ethics, dig him up and argue that with him you fool! You also can't moan about awesome camera work which made the film so unique, bitching that the film looked like a ""B-side"" movie (when it's B Movie idiot!). Finally, you can't moan about the excellent sound, spouting about how the guns were too loud because guess what... GUNS ARE LOUD!!!It seems that people have become too used to the Hollywood sheen of fixed cameras, steady-cam, and unrealistic sound effects. You know... filmmakers intentionally make things sound and look more extreme than they are to wow you as the gullible, popcorn shovelling, brainless audience. Then when someone like Mann chooses to make a realistic recreation of the Public Enemy era of the 1930s, you get on your high horse because it didn't live up to your deluded high standards of small pistols sounding like APC-mounted .50 cal machine guns, and every second not being filmed on hyperHD laser-cameras from the future.It's about film making, not impressing pointless you with feats of technological prowess.The cinematography was beyond reproach. The amateur non-steady-cam work coupled with the lack of any musical score in all of the main action scenes really made it realistic. It became so convincing and exhilarating, as though the camera man was back in the 30s getting shot at too. The acting by all was excellent, with Depp and Bale giving great character performances. Michael Mann really knows how to play with your emotions and perceptions of good and evil (with the aid of Depp and Bale), and he made me switch sides in my mind on many occasion throughout the film. One of the best aspects of this film for me though, was how Mann captured both the danger and the romance of the era.If you are interested in the Public Enemy era of the 1930s, and/or are interested in John Dillinger, you should definitely see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A return to form for Mann that signals the future for period films,"I have read a number of comments that are critical of Mann and Spinotti's use of HD photography in the film but I believe it is ideal when one considers Mann and his overall 'agenda' as a filmmaker. Watching films such as 'Theif', 'Manhunter' and 'Heat' it is clear Mann is a director who strives for authenticity and for realism and by using video rather than film he can achieve this:'...the DV made it feel like you were right there in 1933. You could reach out and touch that drop of rain on the black enamel paint of that car. That's what I wanted. I wasn't interested in nostalgia. I wanted the immediacy, you know, 11:17pm on a Tuesday night in 1934.'(interview with Mann, Sunday times) This quote essentially sums up Mann and the film itself. Unlike other depression era films such as 'Road to Perdition' where beautiful film stock adds to a nostalgic and romantic view of the time, Mann's film, with its frankly astonishing cinematography, brings an immediacy and authenticity to the era that I have personally never witnessed.In typical Mann fashion, exposition is hardly present. Like all of his films, Mann drops the audience immediately into the action almost as the characters have already begun their journeys and time is metaphorically and literally running out. This notion of time and being dropped into action without exposition is typical of Mann. In 'Thief' the film begins with an extreme close-up of Frank (James Caan) breaking into a safe and he is already a professional thief with years of experience. In 'Heat' the films begins as a heist is set in motion with no explanation as to why and who is carrying it out. Essentially, Mann is documenting criminals and as audiences we are being given just a slice of things they have been doing for years. It is in this slice that we witness these characters as time runs out for them.'Public Enemies' is a bold piece of art from one of America's finest living auteurs. The cinematography, action sequences and music are superb. Depp as Dillinger is wonderful, a memorable performance and the finest I have ever seen him deliver. The only weak aspect of the film is Christian Bale's performance, which is somewhat average. This does not and cannot detract from the one of the great crime films of this decade. The film is a return to form for Mann, certainly his best since 'The Insider' and with its unique juxtoposition of HD video and period piece it signals the future for period films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Huge Disappointment,"Michael Mann is capable of directing good films, i.e., HEAT. However, Public Enemies isn't one of them. This film is overlong, and even borders on boring in several unnecessary scenes. While Depp is, as always, fine in his role, all the characters are one dimensional, and Christian Bale is so wooden even his facial expressions seem to be carved in pine. Mann's hand held camera technique, annoying enough on the small TV screen, is nauseatingly bad on the large screen. The historical inaccuracies drain the film of any believability, and the action sequences generate next to no suspense. Visually, the cinematography and art direction are quite good, but nowhere near good enough to carry the film. The finale is anti-climatic in the extreme. Ironically, the scenes of Manhattan Melodrama toward the end of the film remind the viewer how gangster movies ought to be made.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Classic gangster movie with a heart,"Very satisfying movie. This film has a great deal of violence and it is perfected. At times i felt I was playing a video game.I felt that John D. was a born risk taker. He would have been a fine race car driver if he had not robbed banks for a living.The breakouts were amazing. What a brazen man!I loved the dark rich colors, reminded me of the Godfather. The ""handycam"" work made the gunfights so realistic; the sounds of gunfire really used the theater's pro sound system.Now that the banks don't want to lend, maybe we need another John D. to loosen them up and teach them a lesson.I would see this movie again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Heat, but better.","I think there is no doubt in most peoples minds that Heat was a fantastic film. No means perfect, but pretty darn close. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Public Enemies is Heat, but better.Acting was good on all parts from everyone. Matching, if not surpassing that of Heat. The realism was accurate to the last detail. I don't know what it was like being alive in 1933, but I sure believed I was there. At times, I even thought this was a documentary. The camera work was fantastic and definitely unique. I've heard many bash the use of digital, but it really isn't that noticeable after a short while. The angles, shots and cinematography was awe-inspiring. Character development was right on the money, although I'd like to have had more on Melvin Purvis. The amount of character development was a major thing that puts it above Heat in my opinion. I often found Heat concentrated more than necessarily on developing the characters, even in the late stages. A good half hour could've been cut from Heat by reducing the development of each character, without it affecting to the final product much. The music and general sound also put it above your average film. It was sparse on music, but when there was music, it was used extremely well in all the right places and situations. The effects of guns and footsteps, and especially atmospheres in a room full of people was spot on. I'm guessing Mann opted to record the sound of what was going on as it was being filmed and including as much of it as possible, which is usually frowned upon it seems, but it really creates a mood and atmosphere, really makes you feel like you're there.However, although the relatively amateur techniques work, it does at times feel like an amateur movie. For this reason alone, I give it 9/10 rather than 10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A good action film, but that's it.","Like many more I was waiting another 'Heat'.As many said before, this film isn't.Mann resonantly burdens films weight on Depp's shoulders despite the cast he has under his hand.Which of course Depp menages to handle all alone but one thing he can't seem to success on his own is revealing who he really is.Who was Dillinger, why the hell he did die trying to reunite with a cloak girl ? His motives, morales simply could not be fed to us as simply with '...daddy beat the hell out of me' sentence.Heat was a true epic with compromising all the casts individualities but Public Enemies does not even give a hunch about who they are, not to mention Purvis, the fonder of FBI, his girl.Over all Mann captures very well made, raw, realistic, non-glamorous actions sequences in his movie one should admire. Fun to watch, to lack too big in characters and what was going on at that time in USA.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Great direction, great acting","I think that Public Enemies is a really good movie. It might not be the instant-classic a lot of people (including me) hoped for, but from the first minute, I knew that Public Enemies is a lot better than most films in cinema. It's not hard to tell why: first, there's Mann's excellent direction and mise-en-scene and second, there's the level of acting, which is really high. Especially Johnny Depp: and so, I'm glad to see him in a film like this and not in a mediocre blockbuster (such as Pirates of the Caribbean). Johnny Depp is really incredible as the famous bank robber, John Dillinger: this is a movie character that you won't forget. Although Depp draws most attention, I must not forget Marion Cotillard: the French, Oscar-winning actress shows that she easily can cope with roles in major American productions. I have to add that I was a bit disappointed in the character of Melvin Purvis. This is not the fault of Christian Bale - his character is simply too flat (all we know is that Purvis wants to catch Dillinger - and you don't even have to see the movie to find that out). In my opinion, that's a shame,'cause an actor like Bale deserves better roles than this one - think not (only) about the Batman-movies, but (espacially) about The Machinist and The Prestige. I do hope to see him in such movies in the future. But let's not forget the great story, the great Dillinger-character and of course the excellent direction of Michael Mann. Mann uses the blackbird-motive in a great way and, although some scenes (in the forest, for example) are too quick, he shows his experience throughout the whole movie, especially in the epic and just fantastic ending scene. This is a really good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Public Enemies"" could very well be the best bank robber biopic since ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and may be even better","Let's use our imaginations for a moment. Create an alternative reality universe in your mind, something I think all of us do whenever something does not go according to plan or to preference. Like the Academy Awards for 2009. I was completely dissatisfied with that list for one fundamental reason. If I could have changed that list, I would have removed ""District 9"" in the Best Picture category and substituted for it, Michael Mann's marvelous ""Public Enemies."" Not only that, but I would have given it the Award itself. I have not seen ""The Hurt Locker"" yet (I hope to soon, because I'm told it's very, very good) but I do sincerely think ""Public Enemies"" was the best film that I saw last year. And yes, I saw ""Avatar"" too.""Public Enemies"" is a mostly accurate screen transition of the story of John Dillinger, the notorious bank robber who rose to the top of the F.B.I.'s most wanted list during the 1930s. He is played by Johnny Depp (in one of the actor's finest performances) as a cynical, clear-headed man with no other desire than to push for what he wants. Yet, as we discover, he's still just a human being, when he falls in love with Billie Freschette (Marion Cotillard) and takes her on his gun-blazing, bank-heisting journey. Meanwhile, of course, there is a government agent, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale, one of his best performances as well) determined to hunt Dillinger down by all means necessary. Not exactly an original setup, but with any great film, it is how director Michael Mann and his cast and crew execute the project that makes it work so well.""Public Enemies"" may very well be the best bank robber biopic since ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and maybe even better. Even though it has a sort of obligatory setup with ostensibly standard characters (a bank robber, his moll, and a government agent) it is done with such energy and such raw power that it nevertheless absorbed me right from the beginning. Watching ""Public Enemies"" I felt very much like I was one of the people in the holdup banks: unable to take my eyes or strict attention away for just the slightest second.One of the things I admired most about the movie was the way it handled its characters. Turning what could have been stick figures into fleshed-out, three-dimensional human beings. For example, Dillinger is not a hardheaded killer impervious to emotions. There are parts to him that are more than subhuman, if just barely. He is devoted to those around him, and most of all to Billie and their story is really one of the more touching romantic subplots that I've seen in a movie for a long time. The reason? Because watching them together, I really got the sense that they were in love. Whereas other movies throw these in obligatory and without any passion, I did not see an actor and an actress going through the motions of rehearsed dialogue, but two people who loved and cared about each other and were willing to put themselves on the line for each other. And also, I like how the government agent, Melvin Purvis, does not turn out to be either a sheer genius or a bumbling fool. He's a conflicted, troubled individual himself. And I also like how the movie touches on the subjects of partnerships being torn apart (e.g. mobs splitting from the robbers). In addition, there's a particular FBI agent played by Stephen Lang who, although important, is not rushed into taking up one of the leading roles. Somehow, by suppressing his screen time, it makes his important moments in the film so much more powerful. It's like a documentary.Mr. Mann is a very talented director. He knows how to shoot a movie well. The action sequences in ""Public Enemies,"" in particular, are tense and exciting and they go on to great lengths without wearing out. This is not the Hollywood fantasy land where the protagonist scores a direct hit every time he shoots but the band guys can empty machine gun magazines in the direction of their target and never come close. There's one scene in particular, which stretches on to great lengths because it acknowledges these realistic scenarios, and it's utterly gripping. But also Mr. Mann knows how to coordinate his actors and his camera, taking note of what he has to and excising what he does not.But perhaps the best stronghold are the performance. As I mentioned before, this is one of the best performances that Mr. Depp has ever given. Oliver Stone was right when he guessed the young actor he cast in a bit role in ""Platoon"" would one day become a big star. Mr. Bale redeemed himself in this film from his lackluster, drained performance in ""Terminator Salvation"" and proved once again what a talented actor he is. Ms Cotillard is certainly a beautiful-looking woman, but she's also a professional who excels at communicating passion. She's more than just part of the scenery and her denouement is one of the most haunting, yet beautiful images in recent movie history. Bit parts are played by Stephen Lang, Billy Crudup, Stephen Dorff, and Stephen Graham (a lot of Stephens in this cast, eh?).Is there anything I don't like about this movie? Well, I am not particularly moved by the digital photography of the picture, but that's a minor detractor. As Bosley Crowther said, movies should be assessed on their ""dramatic architecture, not the hocus-pocus of the eye."" And the dramatic architecture here is excellent. Unfortunately, the Academy Awards (and many people, I'm shocked to see) did not think so. Rex Reed and I seem to be virtually alone on this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Johnny and Mann's best in years...,"Michael Mann's Public Enemies is definitely one of the best films of the year and probably the strongest of his career. Taking into account Heat (savagely overrated), The Insider (his only Oscar nominated work and definitely worth it), and Collateral (which fails for me on multiple levels), when you place Enemies next them, one must wonder what critics and audiences didn't get about the film.It was by far Johnny Depp finest dramatic turn of his career. This would be a role I would love to see Johnny at the podium receiving a gold man for. Marion Cotillard is much of the anchor of the picture as she is a beautiful presence, igniting the screen with every word, tear, and smile. Billy Crudup who takes on his role with much ease and makes it seem effortless (which is his downfall for this awards season I presume) takes on his minimal screen time and takes charge. The worst part of the film, unfortunately is Christian Bale who's flat acting and seemingly useless role (which might be the screenplay's fault) does nothing more for the picture than a 30's automobile.I expect big chances in editing, cinematography, acting nods for Depp and Cotillard, and a possible Best Picture nod for Public Enemies. Oscar take note, this is something of a revolutionary picture.***1/2/****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
140 Minutes Of Tedium,"Public Enemies is a pretentious piece of rot that has just stolen 140 minutes of my life.Prolix and tedious, ""Public Enemies"" unspools at an excruciatingly slow pace and is best recommended as a cure for insomnia. The script is at times unintentionally laughable, clichéd, trite, historically inaccurate and ultimately boring.The lighting is so poor that at times the film appears to have been filmed in a closet, the dialog is often unintelligible and the musical score at times is intrusive.Michael Mann's ham-handed directing and producing worked much better on the small screen in Miami Vice and Crime Story.Christian Bale is noteworthy solely for the utter ineptitude he brings to his performance as Melvin Purvis. I've never been a fan of his but here in ""Public Enemies"" he is particularly dreadful.The saving grace of the film (and the only reason I gave it two stars instead of the one it so richly deserves) is Johnny Depp's nuanced performance as John Dillinger.

"A bit slow, but good overall.","It stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. This movie takes place in the 1930's and is about John Dillinger who was a bank robber and the last 18 months of his life. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger and he was a very good choice for the role because he looks very much like him, but not as much as Leonardo Di Caprio would have. Since Johnny Depp has done so many great roles, I can't say that this is his best but it's just another great role for him and a great performance. Maybe it can fall in his top ten.Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis and spends the whole movie hunting down Dillinger and trying to put him behind bars. Christian Bale is actually a great actor despite his recent years. The Dark Knight was a great movie, but it wasn't because of his performance. It's great to see that he's not using the Batman voice anymore like he was using in Terminator: Salvation.Everyone else was solid.This in definitely a great movie, but unfortunately it is a little bit flawed. The gun battles are amazing and the gun shots are very loud and realistic like it's supposed to sound. If there's something you can expect in a Michael Mann directed film, it's that it will have great gun shot sound effects. If you don't like loud noises, I don't recommend it.However, there is this one gun battle that takes place in the forest that's probably about 15 minutes long. Way too long in my opinion and I started getting bored at that point about an hour and a half into the movie. But, it managed to pick up near the end.A major complaint that I'm hearing is the constant use of HD video. The entire movie is actually shot with hand-held cameras which is said to have a negative effect on the film. What these cameras did was make several parts of the movie much more blurry when you would like to be able to see, darker and and whole lot noisier. Personally, I wasn't bothered too much by the use of the cameras. They actually are able to make you feel that you're part of the action, which is great. They are still a bit unnecessary, because the movie could have been shot with film, but I didn't enjoy the film any less because of it.Also, this movie had a very good soundtrack. It seemed to go very well with the visuals and was a great selection of the best tunes of the 30's, which I am not familiar with.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I would give it a 7.5/10, brought down because it was slow for about 25 minutes but it managed to pick up again. You'll be entertained, but if you actually want to learn about the life of John Dillinger, that's not what you'll get. What you'll be seeing on the screen is only his time robbing banks. If you really want to learn more than you can browse Wikipedia, which is always available. That's my review of the film and I was helpful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Interesting and enjoyable,"Public Enemies tells the story of the life of John Dillinger and his brief but well known fame as a bank robber. It is an almost 2 hour and a half movie but its length doesn't make it tiresome, in fact it is a very interesting drama full of action that will catch you from the very first minute and will keep you on the edge of your seat. the story is very interesting and the plot very well developed. The movie is perfectly set in the 1930's with an excellent costume design from that age. The cast is awesome. Johnny Depp is the perfect John Dillinger, a role that fits him very well, his performance was great, Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis is almost perfect and Marion Cotillard although her role wasn't that big, she made very important for the movie.

"You can't think of yourself as invincible, you break one way or the other","What worked:
The mood and the tone of the movie is well done ,making it feel like the era the movie was based on. A true story, with some added melodrama, it's an okay watch, with some defining scenes and some average scenes. I loved to see the collaboration of Depp and Bale, though shared small space together, it's still worth waiting for. The movie had some real nice action scenes, gun shots, robbery and violence, making us believe the gory and the ruthlessness of the characters.
What did not work:
I would have expected a closure before the ending of the movie or something that let me empathize or view the movie from the lead character's perspective. We knew towards the end that he was going down, maybe I was expecting a bold response before the end. Also, some scenes were more gloried than the others. The movie had some major flaws I think. I as a viewer had some questions for example why did the shootout have to happen at the theatre premises when it could have been done at the apartment, they could have given better reasoning or changes the circumstances altogether. At times, the movie felt like it lost its voice and was just dragging around, with just little happening in the movie. Overall, it's a movie worth watching if you just want to feel the climate.

""" When You can't use the very best, you must in desperation, use what you got  ""","There are a small group of great directors and Michael Mann is among the very best. When he decided to make a movie of the exploits of the 1930's era gangster, I believed he would be the right one to do it. Assembling what seems to be the finest cast available, I like so many others, thought, you can't go wrong with them. The Movie is called "" Public Enemies "" and is based on the early history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the F.B.I. and the fading glory of America's most notorious gangsters. At the top of the F.B.I. list however was Public Enemy number One, Mr. John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). Other notables like Baby Face nelson (Stephen Graham) and Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) were also hunted by the fledgling Federal Bureau. The film centers much on the turmoil between Lack Luster J. Edgar Hoover who had more skeletons than most and Special agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) who outshone his boss. It also highlights Dillinger and Billy Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and their costly relationship. Although it the last years of the famous gangster's life, the movie stick pretty close to the facts, including his betrayal at the bio-graph theater. The film does contain sufficient drama and gunfighting actions to keep an audience interested, but there is something missing when one gets a superb cast and is kept waiting.

A very ordinary film,"This film was a very big disappointment, especially coming from a director of Michael Mann's reputation. There was little in Dillinger's character to empathise with and Johnnny Depp did nothing to make the role interesting. The self indulgent directing and photography made it a difficult film to focus on at times. Also the way most of the players mumbled their way through their lines made it tedious to listen to. The American gangster has been portrayed so brilliantly by such giants as Cagney, Bogart, and George Raft, that I am surprised that Mr Mann decided to make this film. Especially as it told us nothing new about Dillinger. In fact it seemed to be trying to turn a cold blooded killer into a sympathetic character. A film which did succeed in arousing sympathy for murderous thieves was 'Bonny and Clyde.' But then it would be very easy to make a list of gangster films that stand the test of time and head and shoulders above this long and boring offering. I am sure that it will soon be forgotten.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gangster's Paradise,"In true Michael Mann fashion, he has given the 1930s a reboot with his action infused, crime drama about the rise and fall of one of America's most notorious Gangster's, John Dillinger. This film has all the clothing, cars, and guns a film about the 30s could ask for. I've heard this film called an action movie, but really it's not. Granted the action is top of the line and possibly the most memorable aspect of the film, but it's not a complete action-packed extravaganza.John Dillinger was the result of the gang scene from Chicago led by Al Capone during the prohibition era. Dillinger started somewhat small and grew to national fame, catching the attention of the FBI for his lightning quick robberies and evasions from law enforcement. He was efficient, skilled, and ready for anything. He could pick up sticks and be gone within minutes. This film is a great cat and mouse chase through banks, city streets, and back roads as the law tries to put a stop to the country's ""public enemy number one.""To start with the cast you have to look first at Johnny Depp. I've read that Depp was truly excited about this role, feeling really well connected with the character of John Dillinger. He is cool, collected, and knows exactly what his character is about. First and foremost he plays a gangster. Regardless how you might feel about him, he is a bad guy. He might seem like a Robin Hood of sorts from time to time, but he really is a bad guy with manners.To be honest I expected a little more from Depp. He doesn't really play up the character too much. Maybe I'm just comparing it to his recent performances as a pirate, demon barber, and chocolate factory owner, all of which are over the top. It's almost like his character from Donnie Brasco. Nothing over the top, but a solid performance. His actions speak louder than his words, and some of his dialogue is pretty amazing.Moving on to some of the surprises in the cast, I was very impressed with Christian Bale as Agent Melvin Purvis of the FBI. His southern accent and old fashioned approach make him a very unlikable but slightly admirable character, especially with his rifle. Alongside Bale and even more impressive was Billy Crudup as the head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. He looked perfect for the part, his voice was outstanding, and his overall presence on screen was much like that of Hoover; intimidating. He added some much needed support from the cast.Academy Award Winning actress Marion Cotillard (La vie en rose) gives a fine performance as Depp's love interest Billie. She didn't blow me away like in La vie en rose, but she still did a good job especially with her American accent. She played someone who was part French and there is just a hint of the accent, making her character more believable. Other than that she did just enough.What Michael Mann film would be complete without a mind boggling shootout? Mann's debacle of Miami Vice left a sour taste in my mouth for several reasons. He has regained my trust here and in large part to his use of weaponry and special effects. The guns are real, the sounds are deafening, and the action is intense. It doesn't meet the standard Mann set with his film Heat, featuring one of the greatest shootout ever filmed, but this has one of his best. There are no wasted bullets here. Each shot is carefully aimed as if they were really trying to do some damage.Another feature of the Mann experience is the camera work. He always makes on a beautiful looking picture. The camera is a little too jerky for my liking in this movie, but on the whole the shots and angles are perfectly set up, bringing close to the action, forcing us to watch the mayhem and intensity of the scene. It's not just the action that looks incredible. The car scenes, dinners, and all of the in between scenes look stunning as well. It's a testament to the art director as well as the cinematographer.It's not the best gangster film I've seen, but it's one of the most original films of the genre. There wasn't a whole lot wrong with the film. It has a fantastic cast, great soundtrack, and amazing effects and action sequences. It runs a little too long but nothing too lengthy to handle. It's a must-see for the summer, and keep your eyes peeled for this one around award season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Good film.  Another success for Mann; Depp is an amazing actor,"Just saw this today; as I was pretty eager to see it. Michael Mann directing, and Johnny Depp, one of the great actors of today, in the leading role. The length didn't bother me, as I was engrossed in the film throughout. The acting all around I thought was very good, and there isn't enough I could say about Michael Mann's direction. Ever since Heat and The Insider, I've become a big fan of his; and he doesn't disappoint here. The HD shots are pretty amazing, and he wows us again with his mastery of shootout scenes.Johnny Depp..boy has he grown on me the last few years. What a great talent he is; I can say with great confidence that he is one of the finest actors of our time. When I saw how much of a fan I was of his performance in the first Pirates of the Caribbean, (and that's saying a helluva lot), that made me realize just how talented he is; and boy does he give a great performance here. I couldn't see anyone else play this role with the same subtlety, confidence and sheer excellence as Depp. After seeing the poster for this film; with his sly grin holding the Tommy Gun, I just knew I was gonna be in for a treat seeing him in action, and he definitely didn't disappoint. He was just perfect in the role. Christian Bale was very good as well; more voice manipulation from him. He was very convincing and a good balance for Depp. Another great talent. The leading lady was very good as well; she has a innocent sexiness about her, and it worked very well. The film took a little while to really get going, but once it did, it was relentless. Another point on the shootout scenes; there's something about the way Mann does them that's just incredible. The lack of music, and the sheer deadliness of the sounds of the weapons make it seem so real.Mann executed them perfectly yet again.The few reviews I read for Public Enemies before watching it for myself complained that they (the critics) didn't learn who John Dillinger really was. Well, I can live with that. This wasn't exactly painted as a biopic like, for example, Ali or Ray. Seeing Michael Mann's name attached to this made it obvious to me that it was gonna be a crime saga picture, a la Heat & Collateral. The sugar on top was that its the story of John Dillinger's last days as the infamous hardened criminal. For what the film WAS, I can appreciate it and enjoyed it. Its a snapshot in time of a person's life. Simple. It seems like the critics wanted more preaching, or to do deep into Dillinger's psyche and motives. My question is: because you DIDN'T get that makes Public Enemies a bad film? I totally disagree. Michael Mann is one of the best directors out there today, and has achieved success yet again with his latest offering. The fact that he didn't delve more into Dillinger's life, what made him who he was and what made him tick has not (and should not) have any negative impact on the work of art that he's given us. And that's exactly what it is.a work of art.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Mann's vision passed,It is always hard to interpret some theme which is very popular . Michael Mann took one very hard theme . Every person has different vision of the history . It is always good when you see many visions because you know then why is your different . I didn't expect some explosion of ideas . I expected one mature adaptation of the history . Movie was very good but in some scenes Depp's dose of humor is too big and sometimes it is too abstruse . Sometimes you can't expect some excitements . There are some scenes which are very well done and you then understand that this movie is good . You cannot even tell that this movie is bad interpretation of history of the criminal .Johnny Depp as John Dillinger should be awarded for his acting of notorious criminal . His acting was very convincing . In some scene he is becoming too sarcastic . Good side is that he enjoyed acting criminal . I like his movies and way how he can transform from pirate to bad criminal. Looks like he didn't loose sense for acting . He was damn good and I liked his acting . You can enjoy because he knows how to mix every acting in only one role . He did it . Very well.Christian Bale also one of my most favorite actors as Melvin Purvis . It was really hard to find yourself in this kind of roles . He was so cool and he enjoyed in this acting . He was so mysterious and so perfect that I didn't expect something like this . Every his role is very hard but he found himself . You cannot tell that he was bad . Maybe it was looking that he is confused but he was really mature and it was very convincing . With this two convincing acting you cannot find yourself in this movie so easy .This was really good historical thriller . Everything was so perfect . I really liked it .,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Disappointment,"This movie failed in many aspects. I'll list a few.1) Plot. The main problem with this movie is a lack of story arc. Great movies have development over time. In this one, the scenes could have been ultimately randomly rearranged with the same effect. The characters didn't develop much. The plot was essentially a collection of repetitive shoot outs and robberies. There was no crucial or interesting theme bonding these events to each other.2) Christian Bale's terrible acting job.3) Way too long. The film was at times, at most times, boring. There were clear instances where the film could have been cut (perhaps the scene where Depp is watching a film near the end).There are many others, but these alone made the movie a drag.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent Film - Thoroughly enjoyed,"I watched this without any expectation of historical accuracy of which, after now reading some of the more negative reviews; there appears to be some inconsistencies.However, the film is excellent - character development is absolutely fantastic, a rare example in today's 'Marvel universe' of film making. Depp plays the role perfectly, and the viewer; despite seeing a number of heinous acts, feels an urge to support Dillinger.
Christian Bale plays a role which suited him to a tee, and did justice to a man hungry to complete his duty, yet it is clear to see the absence which presides within him when this duty is no longer.The scenes for me were all of perfect length, detail and emotional value, and there is a careful balance of action and emotional tenderness, which is full credit to the director and the writing team.Prepare for a whirlwind of hell-bent loyalty, unexpected backstabbing and barbaric brutality, all rolled together in an emotional roller-coaster.I will certainly watch this again, and relive the enjoyment. Good job to the team involved, and definitely one to add into my collection of great movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
public enemies,"This film is based on the life of the notorious gangster John Dillinger. He was a famous bank robber in the mid-thirties. This period was also called ""America's Golden Age of crime"". His gang robbed four police stations and two dozen banks. He escaped from jail twice.Like I already said, the story take place in 1933 so the whole movie is in this style. This is the reason why I think it should be in the list of 'Greatest Films of All Time'. They created such a good atmosphere as a result that it seems lifelike. It's like you're dropped in this period. This is mainly due to the perfect choice of music. An example is when in the beginning, suspect John Dillinger arrives in a plane, it's with the song 'Black heart' by Calexico. The feeling that you feel when you listen to that song, describes exactly the circumstances: fear and sinister. Also they have made a great choice of clothes and scenes.The lead actors are Johnny Depp (John Dillinger), Marion Cotillard (girlfriend of John Dillinger) and Christian Bale (FBI bureau chief). I think nobody else could have done it better. The way Johnny Depp impersonates the person of John Dillinger is really phenomenal! The producer made good decisions about the close-ups of Johnny Depp. His facial expressions make the film more realistic. You can feel and see what he's thinking.Also the chemistry between him and Christian Bale is very good. Bale is hunting on Johnny Depp and he succeeds almost a few times. But when you see the arrogance between the two, you already know it isn't over yet.. They are playing cat-and-mouse games all the time. It's very nice to see the two acting in the same movie. Of course it's still a Hollywood production so it needs some romance. Because of that, there is the role of John Dillinger's girlfriend, which Marion Cotillard is wonderfully suited. John Dillinger had nothing to lose, except now. The romance becomes one of the most important things in the movie. It is all about his vow to show up for her, to protect her. Against what? Against the danger of being his girl. Will they stay together? Will they survive? You have to see it yourself! One thing that I need to mention is that the movie is well-researched. I already knew a lot about one of the most notorious bank robbers in America. The things they have used in the movie are all correct. Of course it's still a Hollywood production so they add things to make it more attractive. I think Michael Mann (producer) has made a wonderful film again! A beautiful action movie with a golden acting duo : Johnny Depp and Marion Cottilard.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Amazing crime film!! One of the year's best,"You know Gangster flicks have lost there touch over the years, they've become more and more attuned to the times and they've lost the real true sense of what a Gangster movie use to be. This film is a throwback to an Era and a style of film making long lost to time itself.Public Enemies chronicles one of Prohibitions greatest and most notorious criminals. John Dillinger. This film was a breath of fresh air in the fact that it didn't use the things that have become so common in Crime films or even modern Gangster epics at that, It doesn't use pervasive language or Violence, it doesn't use strong sexuality(which in some is needed and some not so much.) and it also doesn't use constant drug use . It's done old school so that you can enjoy your time watching it while not being turned off by it at the same time, it's great on many levels It's kinetic energy and wild bank robberies and chases make it fun and really cool to watch. But what made this a great film is the fantastically crafted story and script by Michael Mann and his team it is thanks to him that this movie is elevated high above the regular gangster movie and shoots off into movie greatness.Johnny Depp(who doesn't seem to stop blowing my mind.) pulls another ace out of his sleeve and makes this movie one of his best and one of cinema's best. His portrayal of Dillinger is both smart and ruthless , cunning and slick it is he who brings up the caliber of this film and makes it so great to watch unfold in front of you. Christian Bale( needs to get an Oscar.) Does exceptional as the relentless blood hound of an FBI agent Melvin Purvis, his smart and unflinchingly ruthless portrayal of Dillinger's enemy is nothing short of breathtaking and brilliant. Marion Cotillard(who I never heard of before this movie.) Is not as good as I thought she could be, seeing as she won an Oscar, she kind of dragged in some places and was kind of not the strong willed type she fit the more "" I need to be taken care of"" type, but none the less she did alright. But all in all the great cast holds up nicely and pulls no punches or stops to make this a fantastic film.Public Enemies is possibly one of the year's best films(No Transformer's II does not count.) It's smart, witty, clever, dangerously addictive, well played out and exceptionally well acted. It's again, as I say, a film to be relished and admired for it's style and atmospheric sense of honor to the 30's, Michael Mann creates yet another great entry in film history and can now be looked upon as one of cinema's great directors his film is nothing short of genius and bold and if you see it I can promise you it will deliver a great movie going experience. All in all Public Enemies delivers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Awful,"This was not what I would have expected from Michael Mann, Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, and Billy Crudup. While I do agree with people that video is an acceptable form of film-making, it did not fit this film at all. Also this was horrible on Mann's part. The whole movie just felt cheesy and these great actors and actresses were unbelievable and not good unbelievable. I wanted to get up and walk out in the middle but I decided to wait it out and I was unimpressed. In addition to all these the story was drawn out and had loose ends. We're expected to believe a relationship between John Dillinger and Billie yet they spend little to no time together and Christian Bale's character also was not given enough time to convince me that he posed a plausible threat to Dillinger. I could not stand it when Billy Crudup had any screen time. I love Crudup as an actor, but in this movie he seem to be just reciting memorized lines and he recited them almost like a robot. I think that the weakest part was the script though. The story was loose and the characters were underdeveloped and the dialog was cheesy. Even great actors like Depp and Cotillard sounded silly. More about the HD. For me, it took away from the look of the film. It looked more like a history channel reenactment or a film student who didn't know what they were doing then a Michael Mann film. It took away from the believability of the story and the poetry of the time. I was so excited for this film, but I was terribly disappointed. I've been telling my friends not to waste their money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Brilliant .,"I saw this film in theaters during the summer, and didn't know what to expect. I was excited for the film when I first heard about it, I loved the idea of Johnny Depp, one of the best actors out there, playing the infamous John Dillinger.I was disappointed when I read a review of 2 stars in People Magazine, so I thought that the film might not have lived up to all of the hype. I still wanted to see it (I usually don't agree with People) and when I read the Rolling Stone (who I usually DO agree with) of 3 1/2 stars I was sure I needed to see it.The first thing you should know about this movie, is that it feels unlike any other gangster movie around, sure it has all the typical mob stuff, entourage of interesting characters, supportive spouse who you can tell is hurting deep down, and totally bad-ass heists, but this film shows the true colors of mob movies like Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Donnie Brasco.In one scene, Dillinger laughs at the way Hollywood depicts gangster life while at a movie theater. The gangster life in this film is unglorified, brutal, and honest. If you come to this movie expecting giant mansions, armies of thugs, and supermodel mistresses you will be very disappointed. This movie shows the truth on America's most infamous bank robber, and the fear behind the life.Johnny Depp is phenomenal as John Dillinger. He understands that this is a different kind of gangster movie, so he doesn't act like everyone else in these roles. Depp could pull off a good performance by just being cocky, but Depp goes deeper, finding the man behind the fame and the fear in his eyes is just barely noticeable if your paying attention.Depp is not the only great performance here, Christian Bale is the enforcer of the law with hardly any similarities to Bruce Wayne, he's dedicated to stopping crime and steps in when he sees a lack of the law within the police. Billy Crudup is almost eerie as J. Edgar Hoover, in his hunt for Dillinger. Marion Cottilard, who I was not familiar with prior to this movie was also fantastic as Dillinger's love Billie, and shines throughout the film but her talents really shows toward the end.This is a fantastic film through and through, I recommend this to anyone and everyone. It may sound a little bit like this movie may take itself too seriously but there is still a myriad of hilarious moments that are there to solidify Dillinger as the biggest bad-ass of the last century.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A solid drama, meticulously made with a first rate performance by Depp as Dillinger","Led by a first rate controlled, confident but restrained performance by Depp in the lead role, film-maker Michael Mann has crafted another excellent crime drama, albeit its rather restrained and detached nature means that it doesn't quite reach the heights of involvement that a viewer gets with some of Mann's previous outings such as Heat, The Insider and Miami Vice. However, the film is so well made, the script so well put together, and performances so impressive, that it keeps you engrossed even though the ending, based on real-life history, is known from the outset.All key performances are universally impressive, most notably Depp as Dillinger, Bale is nascent FBI lawman Purvis, and while virtually other performances are spot on, there also has to be mention of some excellent performances in smaller parts by Billy Crudup as J Edgaar Hoover, Peter Gerrety as the lawyer Louis Piquett, and Stephen Lang as Agent Winstead (he previously worked on Mann's Manhunter). However, Oscar winning actress Marion Cotillard's performance is not as good as those around her. It's not bad, it's just it feels less involving than the other performances in the cast.As usual technical credits for the film are generally excellent. Regular Mann director of photography Dante Spinotti frames the shots well, certainly the action sequences, which have Mann's trademark slickness and panache, but are also very grounded. However the use of filming this particular story with digital cameras I found an interesting one, as it can occasionally feel unusual to have the video look in what is a period film. Dark Knight production designer Nathan Crowley creates a fine look to the proceeding, and editing is also slick yet subtle.Composer Elliot Goldenthals score is effective if low key, with the focus being on the effective integration of appropriate period music.Michael Mann orchestrates proceedings with his usual skill. However there is one fault in the film that prevents it from achieving greatness. Despite being very well made, the balance between a realistic portrayal of the characters and getting the audience involved in their personal journey was definitely weighted towards the former. While there was probably as much apathy towards the police as gangsters in that time period, albeit there was something of a folk hero persona around Dillinger, it is interesting that the film takes a neutral stance on this, which rubs off on an equally neutral portrayal of Purvis and his team, and does rob the film of a genuinely interesting personal story to invest in emotionally.Nevertheless, it's a meticulously well-made and impressive film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Deserves a higher rating on IMDb,"Unlike many other gangster movies Depp's Dillinger isn't one-dimensional and hardened to the core. He just refuses to comply to the fact that he is from poor circumstances and therefore has to accept to be a persona non grata in the playgrounds of the rich. Depp does a superb job in putting these emotions across and makes his Dillinger funny and likable, as well as violent and dangerous. He dresses sharp and regards his time on earth as a game.I would say this movie is about revenge. Or maybe lust for life and rage for the injustices of pre-defined life paths handed to you at birth.There's also something harder to define that gives this movie a radiance of its own. The love affair contributes a lot to that. Among gangster movies I hold this one in high regard as it paints a deeper picture than usual for this genre.Deserves a higher rating on IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Movie This Big Has to be Better Than Dillinger (1945) & Dillinger (1972),"A Film with a Pedigree Like This One Must Be Judged on its Own Merits. With an Artistic Director Whirling Around in His Wheelhouse, Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and a Host of Other Familiar and Talented Character Actors, a Huge Budget, and of Course the Story is One That has been Told and Told Again.There are Two Great Films from the Past, Dillinger (1945) Brilliantly Casting Lawrence Tierney in a Low-Budget but Hard Hitting Bio., and Dillinger (1972) with Again an Uncanny Performance from Warren Oates in a Stylish, Violent and Under Appreciated Movie.Michael Mann's Film Basically Tells the Same Story.

It was one of the highlights of the 2009 summer block buster season for me.Though I did have several problems with the movie. The problems i have include; Michael Mann is a big fan of using choppy camera motions that can be a little annoying, Christian Bale is a bit two-dimensional at times, and I couldn't understand why Johnny Depp spoke with a southern accent when John Dillinger was from Indiana.But the film does have great shots of Chicago and the bank robbing scenes are executed exquisitly (kudos to Michael Mann).

Who's your actor?,"This film proved two things: Johnny Depp can act, and Christian Bale can't. We all know Depp is a natural, who succeeds in any role. Now we also know for sure that Bale (who throws tantrums on the set while people are trying to work) is also a natural--at being stiff and grim in any role he gets. So that is pretty much what you have in this film. The rest of it -- the story, the style, the schtick, are all Mann and I do love it so. He's a director whose cinema style I appreciate because it pulls at my soul. No I don't know why but I love the moral intensity that just oozes from the visuals he creates. It's like having a good French dinner. I want to stay in it forever and let it love me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
John Dillinger Finally Is Presented Accurately,"John Dillinger is one of the gangsters of the thirties who captured the hearts of Depression-era Americans and still does. He represented the people's hate of the banks and lawmen. John Dillinger was also a charismatic Indiana farm boy, who people weren't used to in the 1930s.Michael Mann's latest masterpiece is another film about cops and criminals but this time based on a true story. This is about the 13 months of fame that John Herbert Dillinger (Johnny Depp) reigned before his death outside of the Chicago Biograph theater on July 22, 1934. The film also follows the story of Special Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) as he hunts down the charming bank robber in the Depression-era Midwest.Johnny Depp's performance in Public Enemies is something else and Christian Bale is also very good. Depp's portrayal of Dillinger is more realistic and true to history that Warren Oates in the (also great) 1973 film, simply titled ""Dillinger"". The movie has cinematography and a soundtrack that totally blew me away. Also, Marion Cotillard's performance as John Dillinger's sweetheart Billie Frechette broke my heart.Michael Mann still has not left his ability to create atmosphere in his films. Heat and Manhunter are other examples of his great atmospheric masterpieces. He is back now with this exciting film.The only real complaint I have it right below: The film focuses so much on John Dillinger that it doesn't seem to tell anything about the true causes of J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Croodup) War on Crime or other criminals of the era. The other criminals I would like to have seen more of include Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham), Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribsi) and Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). The Kansas City Massacre is also something that needed to be told about because this is a key event in the connecting history of the Public Enemy Era.Overall, Public Enemies is probably the best film I have seen so far this year and I don't expect to see better.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Christian Bale (Melvin Purvis) did amazing as the main FBI agent of this movie, Jason Clarke did amazing as the bank robber (John ""Red"" Hamilton) and so did Stephen Lang as the experienced agent (Charles Winstead).Do not let the critics scare you away, just ignore them.... Because i sincerely recommend you to watch this perfect crime movie.This is my favorite movie of all time and has been right since the first time i saw (Public Enemies) many years ago.(11/10) Perfect Movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Mellodrama,"A Strong movie and the strongest climax i have seen in so many years. Performance of Johnny Depp was a treat to see. Wasn't much for Christian Bale to do. Everything in the movie went right along with the great background score. its true that movie wasn't like that movies which can stick the audiences to there seat throughout but a strong climax was worth the wait.Acting wise there were some flaws in the way Depp acted but not so much that it ruined the movie.if you are a fan Of Depp or Bale, Don't miss this one. Direction was a simple one camera style which was the beauty of the movie because it lets us feel the movie's reality. A great movie to see after a long time.

May be greatest misfire in cinematic history - certainly for a gangster film.,"I like Michael Mann, and I like gangster movies; but the trailers on this were not inviting - flashy, slick, without a lot of tension. So I waited 'till the film got to the bargain theater. My pre-viewing apprehension proved to be spot on.While there are a number of really fine set-pieces here, I haven't seen a film so utterly lacking in focus or theme in a long time. The bare story of the real John Dillinger is strong enough to carry the viewer of the film, but did the audience not know at least something of that story, it would be hard to follow story here, it goes all over the place. And I am shocked that we get to know so few of the characters here - it takes a while to recognize one G-Man from another, even after they have become important to the narrative (such as it is).It's hard to figure out why Mann decided to go wild with the historical inaccuracy; I'll mention one I found most annoying, first because it is a seemingly small matter, but it also reflects two larger problems. I'm referring to the repeated use of Billie Holiday on the soundtrack - she's even on the radio whenever Dillinger turns it on - unfortunately, she wasn't known during the early Thirties, she was just starting out! It's clear someone wants to make a point by playing her that often - but I haven't got the foggiest idea what it is? Is Dillinger supposed to be a 'black white man' like they say of Bill Clinton? Is his career a foreshadow of Hollidays's? Couldn't they find any other period music to play? Which remarks the soundtrack itself, which is one of the worst in a major motion picture in recent years - it's a mess, evoking a dozen different emotions, almost none having anything to do with the images we're watching at the moment.The dialog is needlessly pretentious. One thing I feared was having to compare this film to John Milius' ""Dillinger"" with Warren Oates - but the comparison can't be avoided. Milius, taking his cue from ""Bonnie And Clyde,"" from the earlier Lawrence Tierney film ""Dillinger,"" and from the gaudy gangster films of Roger Corman, fashioned a film that was both flashy yet homespun, part unabashed B-movie, part evocation of American Gothic. Milius' film is by far the better of the two. Even his occasional tinkering with historical accuracy could be forgiven, since it was clear he had a firm grasp on what the Dillinger phenomenon was really all about - 'farm boy makes good by turning bad' is an undeniable folk-theme of American life.But Mann clearly - and desperately - wants Dillinger to be a real hero, not only of his time but ours. This is the most romanticized version of Dillinger - of any American outlaw - I've ever seen, making the many cinematic apologies for Jesse James seem like harsh condemnations by comparison. But it can't be done. The brilliance of Warren Oates' performance in the Milius film is that Oates plays Dillinger like a runaway farm-boy with a sense of humor and a quick temper, who just happened to rob banks for a living. That's as much as you can give any professional criminal without lying about the nature of crime namely, it's about stealing other peoples' money and hurting many of them in the process. The cowardly punk Dillinger as performed by Lawrence Tierney is probably even closer to the truth. But the sum of all this is not simply that Mann has romanticized Dillinger; that, in a B-movie at least, could have been forgiven. The real problem is that he sentimentalizes the bandit. This turns the whole shenanigans soft like mush, instead of the hard-boiled crime film we should have gotten.And this leads into one of the worst finales in film history, dragging on and on, and even after we know the story is done - it still goes on, trying to turn itself into a tear-jerker! What a waste!And what a disappointment from Michael Mann. And don't blame the actors, as some critics have done - they're actually trying to do a good job - but the script is poor, and Mann can't think of any way to direct it properly.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Dillinger, an iconic bandit in a respectful and well-made film.","There is no shortage of quality films about Prohibition and the many notable criminals of this era in American history: Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel and others form a kind of ""golden age"" of organized crime. John Dillinger is among them, occupying a top place on the list of great criminals of this era.After a rebellious and delinquent youth, Dillinger deserted the Navy and ended up being sentenced to almost twenty years in prison after a grocery store robbery. The sentence was considered excessively heavy and left Dillinger resentful. From then on, he made the Indiana State Penitentiary his school of crime until he was released in 1933. With his freedom, he formed his first gang and began the bank robberies that made him famous. In 1934, he was arrested in Arizona and sent to Crown Point, Indiana, from where he made a spectacular escape, using a fake pistol made from a bar of soap or wood. His escape, the notoriety he had already acquired and the interstate nature of his crimes led to the involvement of the recently founded FBI. Meanwhile, Dillinger formed a second group of criminals which included the equally famous ""Baby-Face"" Nelson, and resumed his robberies, while trying to elude the authorities. Months later, and after almost being arrested on several occasions, he was betrayed and denounced, and murdered outside a cinema.The film is quite good. It is faithful enough to the events and to Dillinger's life, but mixes things up a bit, changing the order of events in order to increase dramatic tension (for example, the death of ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd is shown well before Dillinger's death , but it happened months later, in a corn field). Furthermore, the film exaggerates things. However, these are concessions that I accept because the film, in addition to being a fictional piece, is reasonably respectful of historical facts. I don't accept the poorly explanatory narrative so easily: anyone who doesn't know Dillinger and his life well will have some difficulty following the film. This may help to understand why this film was a failure outside the US, where John Dillinger is little known.Michael Mann is a very competent director, thorough and respectful of the past. We saw these characteristics in ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Collateral"", among other quality films. The director does a very good job in this film, which follows well the adventures of the criminal's life and his tricks to elude the police. The cinematography is magnificent and makes wonderful use of light and color, especially in scenes filmed at night, and the filming locations, props, vehicles, costumes and sets are convincing and quite realistic. The film's biggest flaw, for me, is the dispassionate way it approaches everything. Considering that the protagonist is an outlaw and that nothing he did was acceptable, having managed to like him would have been a bonus. In fact, what stood out to me the most was the extremely thin line that separated the agents of the law and the criminals they pursued: think about it, Dillinger was not detained to be present at a trial, he was executed in a public square and surrounded by hundreds of people who could have been injured if things had gone out of control. Who is hero or villain? The waters are murky, in the film as in life itself.All I can do is talk about the cast, which is confidently led by Johnny Depp, an actor who has a special talent for complicated and unusual characters, and who gives us a very competent interpretation. Christian Bale, another talented actor for impactful characters, played the federal agent in charge of arresting Dillinger, and he is extraordinary in his effort. Marion Cotillard does what she can in the role of Dillinger's girlfriend, but the truth is that the film did not need any attempt at romance, even though the character was necessary to understand the life of the heartthrob criminal, and that's why she doesn't add much to the product. Final. There are also notable additions to the cast, including Stephen Graham, David Wenham and James Russo.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Of old fashioned quality,"When I wanted to watch this movie the ratings were on average 7. After I watched it I realized I don't understand the low ratings. Maybe the movie is not entirely following the real life story, but, who cares. Johny Depp puts down an excellent character. So unlike him really. The cool calculated gangster, big difference with his usual roles, pirate, chocolate factory, etc.. Depp makes the movie, you can see a gangster in him, determined, calculated, ruthless but a bit of a romantic too. It's a real crime movie, well played, good sets, determined police/fbi. So why only a 9, well, it does miss a little bit, the whole J Edgar Hoover thing and the upcoming FBI could have had a little bit more depth. But then again, it's not really about that, it's about the gangster. If you like a bit of gangster style movies, you like 30's atmosphere, bit of action, OK, lot of action but in a realistic manner, go and see the movie, be entertained, I was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Terrible,"I like how this movie was able to bust the top 250 movies of all time without being officially released; that really says a lot about a movie - mainly that it was rated based on its actors rather than the quality of the film over all. The hand-held camera used in the film was terrible, reducing every action scene to nothing more than shaky flashes of light, and making everything else seem like some B-side movie. It is a shame that the acting and story were ruined by some extremely bad choices on the director's part. Public Enemies could have been a great film, and it should have been, but Mann's directorial decisions didn't give it a chance to shine, nothing could have saved this movie after the way it was shot, not even two great leading roles.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
On a high,"The most awaited film of the year, Public Enemies, is a Michael Mann crime film. None among his peers are as adept at making crime dramas (with a particular tendency towards bank heists) as Mann. With films like Manhunter, Heat and Collateral Mann has established himself as a master of this genre. His latest, Public Enemies harks back to the time of the 1931-34 crime wave at its peak during the Depression Era, now dubbed the Public Enemy Era.A discussion of the film hinges entirely on two novelties here. Filmed with a High Definition camera (Dante Spinotti), the cinematography alternates between whirlwinds of activity - almost as if trying to keep track of the heady and adrenaline-filled periods in the lives of John Dillinger and the other Public Enemies, and shots of the principal characters from close quarters, again coming across as attempts to gain admission. The second stems from the fact that Mann's film is based on a non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34 by Brian Burrrough. It shows. The play of events on screen feels factual. The drama is very much present but lacks the choices-conflicts-decisions that made Heat and Collateral memorable, partly because the characters here are historical and we know what eventually happened to each of them. They are novelties for sure. A step forward for cinema in that this can serve as a model for dramatizing whilst documenting slices of history. As a result though, the nature of the participatory viewing the movie elicits is primarily of a technical nature, an invitation to be part of the ride. This has its bearing on every other aspect of the film.The leads Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are perfect for their parts. Depp's John Dillinger is as steeped in fact as the film itself and benefits considerably from the tone of the film, designed to make the audience react to his character in much the same way that America did. The role requires him to be a star on-screen and fully conscious of it. A suave Depp pulls this off with aplomb; his every exploit is achieved with a swagger. That he fleshes out the other aspects of Dillinger is credit both to him and the script. Bale meanwhile, adds his reliability to the film, playing Melvin Purvis in a manner that isn't as straight- forward as seems. It is a consummate performance from an actor whose portrayals never overshadow his films and who seems to be an ace with accents, both traits prevalent here. Marion Cotillard is a different proposition from her turn in La Vie En Rose. In keeping with the Mann tradition, a supporting cast is well picked and delivers performances that don't sink with the weight of the leads. Elliot Goldenthal, whose score for Heat garnered praise, captures the thrill of the heists and the getaways. However, the score suffers from banality when the narrative lapses into drama.Ultimately, Public Enemies' experimental nature makes it difficult for it to be judged completely now. In all likelihood, it might turn out to be a film that grows with time with certain aspects gaining greater acceptance in the future. I'm tempted to say bravo Mann.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Make sure to look,"A great acting cast headed by Johnny Depp. A great biographical film, but greatly defined where it enters the zone of dramatic and criminal. The action is intense and requires you to follow the next event every moment. The time and place in which the action of the film is placed, which is the thirties of the last century, are excellent. In my opinion, the rating could be 8.2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Public embarrassment.,"There is an efficient fluidity of failure in every facet of Public Enemies that astounds as it frantically uncoils with sloppy incomprehension and crass piousness over it's two and a half hours running time.The John Dillinger film bio which gets recycled every 30 years (45 with Lawrence Tierney, 74 with Warren Oates) this time around has a bigger budget, bigger stars and slicker production values making the finished product with its wretched excess even more appalling. Heavy handed, master of bombast Michael Mann's (Heat, Miami Vice) bloated and ponderous style jerks rather than plods this time with cinematographer Dante Spinotti's jittery camera-work shot mostly in tight under lit close-up obliterating composition and setting throughout.As Dillinger, Johnny Depp does a very impressive Elvis imitation; more lovestruck than ruthless, more thoughtful than reckless. It's an abomination. Depp may have more talent than the other Dillingers but Oates was edgier and Tierney probably would have been more at home as a member of the real gang than the Hollywood crowd he populated. Depp is too suave, noble and lovesick. Christian Bale is equally woeful as Melvin Purvis; emptily staring out from beneath a fedora most of the time, sounding like a subdued Tennessee Williams character when he does blurt something out. Marie Cotillard as main squeeze Billie looks glum throughout while Billy Crudup's mincing J. Edgar Hoover (closely and silently shadowed by agent/lover Charles Tolson) and Stephen Graham's manic Baby Face Nelson provide unintended comic relief.Of course blow hard Mann's big and empty acts of self indulgence would not be complete without the self important cathedral music scores of Elliot Goldenthal. As he did most memorably in another hot air balloon Heat, Mann attempts to elevate his hardscrabble characters and situations to mythic proportions with grand flourishes of Goldenthal's vapid score. It fits like a cheap suit. This isn't knights of the round table, it's the Depression.Amid all this ineptitude Mann manages to find time to be au courant (shades of Guantanamo) by shoehorning a police interrogation scene involving torture and it's ineffectiveness into the story. Typical of his clumsy and fatuous style he even takes it up a notch by having the craven inquisitor look like, you guessed it Dick Cheney. It makes one wonder if Mann needs a crane to lift his hands.Public Enemies is a textbook example of arrogantly bad film-making. With it's slick and expensive look, star power and self importance it displays a blundering confidence, gutting history and making the fatal mistake to go Bonnie and Clyde (not to mention the beautifully realized doomed lover bank robber films They Drive by Night, Thieves Like Us and Gun Crazy) while ignoring the grittier more realistic possibilities on the life and death of the Twentieth Century's most infamous bank robber. It's a fatal mistake that makes Public Enemies DOA.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Bye, Bye, Blackbird.""","In the first one hour, honestly, i didn't know what was going on except there were a lot of gunshots and bank robbing. I didn't understand the dialogue and the urgent. What were they trying to do there? I almost confirmed this gangster movie is lame. But soon after the first hour, I could relate to it. I was so much entertained by the chasing and it was so damn cool.John Dillinger is such a great villain. I mean, what a brave person he is to walk into the police department while they are clearly searching for him. Damn! His picture is everywhere. In the meantime, some of the team police look like they don't take it seriously. It's kinda different with other chasing movie where the police are so aware about the fugitive. So far, I think this is the first time I saw Johnny Depp cry in the movie. And the ending is just as sad. Gasping he said ""Bye, bye, Blackbird.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Impressive,"Although I haven't really been much into gangster movies, this one proved to be quite interesting. But of course, with an impressive list of actors like this, it would be odd if it turned out anything less but impressive.The story was quite compelling, and you were never left boring. There was always something happening, from action such as gun fights to the more delicate matter of character building and growth. The characters in the movie are given adequate time to grow and unfold on the screen.As for the list of actors and actresses, well nothing much need to be said here, obviously. Everyone here were doing one fine job, and lots of good acting going on.The ending was nice as well, though you would already know how it ends as you sit down and start the movie.

An old-fashioned and compelling motion picture.,"Better late than never, I guess. Although Public Enemies was released somehow late in Peruvian theatres, I admit I have taken my time to write my review, having seen the actual movie a couple of weeks before Inglourious Basterds. This has happened not because I didn't know what to write about the movie - although I have found myself in that particular kind of situation before -, but because I'm having less and less time to write reviews. This is what college does to someone who enjoys doing something that is not particularly vital for his career or every-day life, and although I'm studying something I love -filmmaking - I don't like the fact that I'm starting to write less and less reviews each week.But enough of my personal life. This particular text should concern Johnny Depp's latest movie, and thus express that, yes, I did enjoy the movie, although it didn't fulfill all of my - perhaps unreasonably high - expectations. Those expecting a very exciting, action-packed and thrilling motion picture will definitely be disappointed; although the film has its share of shoot-outs and deaths, it is more of a drama rather than a thriller or action picture, and thus succeeds at telling the story of the very interesting John Dillinger (Depp) without resorting to pointless action sequences or explosions. In fact, it is somehow old-fashioned in this respect, having more in common with movies like The Maltese Falcon than with the average star-studded summer movie of the 21st century.The film tells the story of John Dillinger, and actually starts with him escaping a maximum-security prison with most of his gang alive. He already has quite a reputation as one of the most successful and daring bank-robbers of his time (the 1930s) but isn't planning on stopping to do what he does best, at least not on the short run. He becomes involved with a very pretty coat-check girl named Billie Frechette (the superb Mario Cotillard) and also becomes the obsession of FBI big boss Edgard J. Hoover (Billy Crudup), who assigns agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) as the head of the office whose mission is to apprehend Dillinger. Needless to say, most of the film is dedicated to Dillinger's seemingly-superficial relationship with Billie, but most importantly, to Purvis' hunt of the famous robber.Although director Michael Mann has proved in the past that he can be a master of tension and intensity, even when working with a not-so-great screenplay (as in the case of Miami Vice), he has decided not to turn Public Enemies into an action-fest, and I applaud him for that. He understands that, being the story of a real life figure, it is more interesting to present the film in a more dramatic, old-fashioned kind of way. Fortunately enough, he succeeds at emphasizing the drama having a particularly slow movie, although it definitely isn't as fast-paced as other movies of its ilk. Interestingly enough, it is the performances, the plot itself and the character interactions that managed to interest me the most in what was happening on-screen, not the few action sequences. Don't get me wrong - they are expertly shot - and there are a couple of very tense moments here and there - it's only that Mann hasn't made any of these sequences the real focus of the film.Performances are superlative. Johnny Depp once again proves that he's one of the most chamaleonic actors alive. Although Dillinger is not presented in a truly three-dimensional fashion, Depp manages to make him a suitably sympathetic figure, a very charming and ""cool"" kind of character, without turning him into a caricature of a gangster. Marion Cotillard is, as usual, great, even if her character is nothing more than an archetypical love interest. Christian Bale is a little bland as Purvis - and his accent never managed to convince me - but that's more due to the screenplay than to his acting. As Edgar J. Hoover, on the other hand, Billy Crudup is great, and Stephen Graham (Snatch.) manages to create a truly memorable and vile character in the form of Baby Face Nelson.If there's one thing that truly bothered me about the movie, though, and that, for my money, prevents it from being a quasy-masterpiece, it would be Mann's visual style. Not unlike his previous efforts, Collateral and the aforementioned Miami Vice, Mann has used digital videocameras to shoot the film - without ever trying to hide the fact that he is, in fact, using videocameras - and it doesn't really work at all times. He's shot most of the movie using hand-held cameras, and although this works during the shoot-outs or the more intense sequences, because of the ""different"" nature of the digital cameras, all the blurriness and confusion that Mann's shakiness cause can become distracting and bothersome, especially during scenes that take place at night. I don't mind Mann using digital cameras, but if he's going the digital way, at least he should try to use a less shaky kind of camera-work.Visual style aside, Public Enemies is a very gripping and old-fashioned movie that should find its audience not in hormonal teenage boys and girls, but in a more mature moviegoers. It may not be as masterful as previous works of a similar nature, but due to its solid performances and emphasis of drama over action and explosions, it works as a very compelling character study of a gangster who, during his time, was lauded by the public and hated by the authorities. This aspect of public popularity is not particularly developed by the filmmakers - save a couple of scenes in which it is very evident - but Depp's performance, I think, is good enough to make the audience believe that, despite all his wrong-doings, the public would love a man like him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Oscar for Depp...Top Marks for the rest,"OK, firstly Johnny Depp is once again outstanding; he deserves an Oscar for a long time and his performance as Dillinger adds more meat to that.Depp stars as John Dillinger, a 1930's bank robber who rises to be hailed as America's Public Enemy No.1 hotly pursued by Agent Purvis (Bale). I'll not go into too much detail as you must see the movie, however, I will tell you that the movie follows the story of Dillinger and his many daring and brave robberies and jail escapes while dealing with his personal life and problems.Many people call this movie shallow and that it is missing a certain 'it' factor but I disagree. The movie is based on a true story which cannot be enhanced to be more entertaining with dramatic twists; Dillinger is Dillinger and is portrayed as such. Granted, there are a few historical differences (times of death, affairs etc) but these are not noticed unless you read about Dillinger and are petty.Depp's performance is superb and definitely boosts the movie, the cinematography is also really good as is Bale's performance. All in all this is a very entertaining, interesting and gripping movie with a few minor hicks that are easily overlooked when weighed against the good points.I personally enjoyed one of the soundtracks, Ten Million slaves by Otis Taylor and this was played at the most appropriate places and really adds to the atmosphere; yet another plus point.8/10 and definitely recommended",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Definitely not the best gangster movie,"I was kind of disappointed of this movie because I expected more of it. There were many flaws and some historical inaccuracies about this movie, and in the end it seems like the message of the movie is to make this Johnny Deep character gangster a hero, who never was because he was a criminal gangster. Anyway, the plot was good and the visual effects too, with the costume as well, but the real issue here is not the message of the movie, since every filmmaker has the right to make the movie as he wants, but the lack of something there, like the characters don't show much emotion when they have to. Johnny Depp definitely shouldn't have a gangster character paper because it was just not good. He didn't seem like a gangster. And his wife, Marion Cotillard, definitely she doesn't look Indian, come on! And the policeman beating up the gangster's lover... did that really happen? There seems to be some inaccuracies there.

Inglorious Basterds was another movie I found interesting but terrible in its ending.Depp was very good, as well as the other actors. The story line was not too whacked out of history, and it kept you interested throughout the movie.If you had to complain, I would say, as others did, the romance section took a little too much of the film with less relevance, but not enough to distract from the over all movie.If your expectations are to watch a good movie, then its a definite plus.

Public Enemies (2009),"I am not a specialist concerning movies and my review will not be a true criticism. I just want to give my opinion about this movie.What I really liked in ""Public Enemies"" was the alternating between action sequences, romantic ones and the moments of complicity between friends. It is very pleasant for the spectator who is at the same time touched by these scenes but at the same time under pressure because of the action. Nevertheless, I would have liked to know a little bit more about the context of the story, and more precisely about the characters.

Such a disappointment from Mann,"Other reviewers have expressed their disappointment much better than I could hope to.As a fan of Michael Mann, I guess I had high expectations.Most of my complaints center around the quality of the sound (muffled, distant main character voices), cinematography (what's with the Blair Witch docu-style?), and visual production quality. Some shots actually looked like they had were accidentally inserted from the cutting room floor.Then there's the storyline - the lack of flow, build-up and tension, both the predictability and sheer random nature of the editing and story sequence left me feeling sleepy.I was ready to get up and leave about 90 minutes in because my interest was lost, and the made-for-TV feel only held me for the first 30 minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I am shocked that this doesn't have an Oscar Nomination,"Public Enemies is one of the best films of 2009. Michael Mann directs this film with his usual brilliance. The performances by Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, et al, are exceedingly good. It is Mann's direction that takes the cake though and it is indeed shocking that this film did not receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Film and Best Director instead of the mediocre The Hurt Locker. For me this is Michael Mann's best film since Heat. Everything is handled with such care which is difficult to do, considering that this is a period film.Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances as John Dillinger. Christian Bale impresses with each new film of his. His performance as Melvin Purvis is suitably restrained. The screenplay is one of the strong points of this film. The shootouts are exhilarating without being unrealistic. Watch out for that superb sequence involving a shootout at a lodge. Finally, watch the film if you are a Michael Mann fan like me or just a movie buff.You'll not regret it. Trust me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Jack Sparrow as a Gangter?,"What can I say about this movie? I can say I liked it, that's for sure! There were a lot of great scenes in this Johnny Depp movie about John Dillenger. This movie delivered the goods, that's for sure. I liked that part at the beginning when Pretty Boy Floyd was running through an apple orchard and was shot by Christian Bale at long range. I was surprised he died so soon though. Of course John Dillinger was very classy and clever to boot. I liked that one part where he was standing in the hotel near the coat rack and the patron wanted his coat. Johnny Depp slapped him on the back of head! What about that part where he is in jail and escapes? That was pretty cool also. I am a fan of the old gangster movies and this one did not disappoint. If you are going to this movie expecting to see major violence, don't get your hopes up. Also, I hated that fat boy that beat up Johnny's girlfriend with a phone book! How dare he did that! I was hoping that he died.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Surprisingly engaging, stylish and well cast","I entered the watching of this film with scepticism. I wouldn't say that American gangster films would be my genre of choice. I certainly didn't expect the film to make much of an impression on me.I didn't know much about the background of John Dillinger, but straight away I wanted to know more and was reading up on the background.I was beginning to think that Johnny Depp had pigeon-holed himself with the slightly tedious performances in Tim Burton films of late which fit an increasingly samey formula. It was refreshing to see him play a part that broke away from the norm and seemed more of a challenge. He was convincing and witty as this smooth, intelligent and charismatic character.This film is well paced and beautifully shot. The characters were well developed throughout. Although Depp's character was the main focus, the emphasis on his loyalty and care for the other members of the gang transcended through and made me care about each of them. Focus shifts to other individuals at crucial points and there are strong performances from Stephen Graham and Giovanni Ribisi.Christian Bale is well cast as the moralistic and idealistically hopeful cop. You sympathise with the difficult decisions that he is forced to make and sigh with relief when he steps in to put a halt to the mistreatment of Billie (played by Marion Cotillard).The build-up of tension increases as you watch the situation unravel for Dillinger and his gang. I couldn't tear myself away for the final third of the film. Despite the fact that I knew what the conclusion would be (having been reading the timeline on the johndillinger.com website) there was no way I could not see this film through to the end.Possibly a slightly romantic view of gangland criminals of the 30's, I don't know enough to make this judgement- but it doesn't matter as this film feels original and is a pleasure to watch. To sum up, this film was surprisingly engaging and the kind of film I wanted to discuss after I'd seen it- now I just need to make my friends watch it too!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Bad movie,"I do not want to write long reviews and I do not want to search for some hidden meaning or uncovered depths of this film. Because there aren't any. This is SHALLOW, absolutely meaningless movie. About just nothing. They went there, they came here. Some people talk, run shoot, rob banks. Make sex. Eat. A little of everything. And you watch them with absolutely no involvement. Just some strangers, and you don't care. Even if they die, you do not feel pity about that because you do not know them, who they are or what they feel. The movie lacks of such a details. And this is a shame.Also you may call me a paranoid but I think that may be this movie is partially sponsored by tobacco companies. Probably this is the only way left to advertise smoking as they are banned from everything else?What I want to tell. Life is so short. Minus work time minus sleeping. Free time is so rare. And I just wasted three hours of my life for such a disappointing movie! I really regret about it.By the way - Depp and Bale are ones of my favorite actors. But anyway - 3 stars, and I am feeling generous.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I think it is a pretty good movie...!,"Well, first of all, I have to make it clear that I am not an American so that by no means shall I know this character better than any American. Moreover, I believe a foreigner can be more easily attracted by this film, since he/she doesn't know it equally well as an American. And, my comments are based on the above statement and a possibly consequentially biased perspective.I believe all shall agree that the casting is wonderful. Johnny Depp is the one that brings John Dillinger back to life. I was told that the director Michael Mann initially wanted Leonardo DiCaprio. Though I agree that Leonardo is also a good actor, I still believe that Johnny Depp is THE ONE. His wild and sexy charms, especially that kind of tricky smiles that hold a natural contempt against authorities, is just what we can see from a poster of John Dillinger.As I watched the film, I gradually got convinced of this. Johnny has shown his understanding of the character and put on his face very naturally the multidimensional inner world of Dillinger: On the one hand, Dillinger holds unmatchable confidence in his strong executive abilities in cold blood, a defiance against then police officials, and quite a sense of narcissism oriented towards public popularity. On the other, he was a dreamer, lover and believer in freedom. Johnny Depp, with his complicated temperament and unbelievable range of roles, has nailed everything of the above.Christian Bale also did a good job. I cannot understand those who claimed he was too obscure in the film. Let's judge his performance based on the character. Purvis didn't boast an out-going personality at all. Reviewing the history, we can find he was just the type of person who believed in the public good, the ultimate right, and gave his best to his job. That is why Christian Bale's controlled performance delivered a decent result, let us say ""Grace Under Pressure"". But in the Little Bohemian Lodge gun fights, Christian Bale kept shooting the gang nearly dead, with hatred glaring...This was an burst-out and a release of long-time pressure and hatred.Another issue is HD cinematography. Since the director favored long scenes of gunfighting. He'd better do it by HD. Besides, the great sense of style of 30s America also needs HD to make the best of it. Still, there were so many night scenes, and the actors' movements and facial expressions need to be made clean, so HD is needed. We have to admit that HD was used because the director needed it...Some viewers argued that there is a sort of inconsistency in cinematography of the film. Sometimes it looked like a master's work, and sometimes a beginner's. I guess they argued this because some scenes did look dodgy, unstable, and almost impatient, especially those gunfights. But I think there was a purpose behind it: the director wanted to make the gunfight scenes real, something you are supposed to see when you are shooting the gangs while chasing them...Yet, we have to admit that the result, when seen from the whole movie, is not so good, largely because you cannot only make the gunfights something like a documentary and at the same time the rest scenes a drama...Though I love its casting, its cinematography, its fashion style, and its score, I have to say the plot is a failure, and I am pretty sure that this failure will much likely lead to the failure of the movie as a whole.Just like what I stated in the beginning of this article, many Americans knew the episode pretty well. But this movie certainly didn't make them know it better. The plot can be easily summarized as ""Dillinger escaped - He robbed again - In jail but escaped again - robbed and robbed - finally got caught and dead""...I can see the movie's writers studied Dillinger's life and intended to attach importance to the most decisive moments, but we all knew them, didn't we? Even a foreigner like me can know all these from Wikipedia, let alone the Americans who worshiped him for decades...But it will be unfair if we say the director made no effort to explore more of the character. Echoing what I said about Johhny Depp's great performance, I believe the director tried to show how complicated John Dillinger was as a person. But, he only did it by arranging several dialogs with Marion Coutillard, Christian Bale, and the gang friends...and these were just NOT ENOUGH. Besides, these dialogs, though pretty brilliantly written, were too subtle in their expression and not likely to be spoken by a man who robbed and killed. More clever plots that told his deep inside shall be added, and the gunfight scenes deserved to be cut...As a summary, I would say this is a good film, made by supreme technical skills and a carefully-chosen casting. The fashion style, the sound mixing, the score and the controversial HD cinematography were to me fantastic, but the plot was not good, which would ultimately gave it a mediocre reception from the critics...",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Nothing Much Apart from its Stars,"I was disappointed with ""Public Enemies."" A lot of expectations were developed for this film because of the star combination that it features -- Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. It also has an interesting central character, John Dillinger. I have read about the gangster Dillinger in various books in the past, but don't really know much about him, so I was curious to find out more about him.Unfortunately, I did not really like this movie. The direction seemed to be rambling. The running time was too long. The scenes were confusing. I could not recognize the other characters during those many heists and gun fights. There was no excitement that develops despite the subject matter. I found several parts of the movie actually sleep-inducing. There was no build-up on the character of Dillinger at all, which I found the most disappointing. We meet him at the height of his career, but we do not know how he really got there.Johnny Depp does not really disappear into his role as Dillinger. I can clearly recognize his acting tics, like how he wears his shades. I do not think Dillinger ever wore shades that way. Despite that, he is still the best part of this movie. He is charismatic and likable, like how Dillinger supposedly was. His scenes with Marion Cotillard (as his moll Billie Frechette) were the most involving parts of the whole film.On the other hand, Christian Bale is simply turning out to be one boring actor for me. His scenes are very uninteresting. His acting is dull. His line delivery is quite monotone. The way he was eating his words was reminiscent of his Batman character, if you can imagine that. During his scene with Johnny Depp, Bale could not hold a candle to the incandescence of Depp's star appeal.Overall, this was a waste of time for me. I expected too much, and got short-changed in a major way. Director Michael Mann was not able to deliver the best product out of the promising subject matter it had. I think another better film about John Dillinger can still be made in the future, as this one is not a definitive biography.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Another Epic crime yarn from Mann.,"Michael Mann has done it again. This man is a genius when it comes to the epic crime saga. It started back in 1995 when he released the masterpiece 'Heat' which blew the world away with it's amazing acting and fantastic memorable shootouts. Then in 2004 he stuck with crime in L.A. and came out with 'Collateral' which again featured great acting and some memorable action sequences. He was back at it again in 2006 with the film version of the 80's TV show 'Miami Vice', which admittedly wasn't as good as the previous two, but still had some engaging action scenes. 2009 came along and Mann decided that for his next project he would tackle the story of infamous bank robber John Dillinger and once again doesn't disappoint.The story opens in 1933 with John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp) and his crew breaking out of prison in Indiana. So right off the bat Michael Mann is showing off his skills as a director by staging this prison break and including a mini shootout between the gang and the prison guards. This film is a true team effort though. Not only is the director at the top of his game, but the actors are all uniformly excellent. Johnny Depp completely absorbs the role of Dillinger and literally becomes him. Depp has always been one of the greatest character actors and once again can do no wrong. Christian Bale plays the role of FBI agent Melvin Purvis and is also quite good. Bale has become the go-to- man for movies over the past few years. Batman, Terminator, 3:10 to Yuma, and many more on his resume. Leading or Supporting, it doesn't matter, Bale can handle any role and in this film he becomes Depp's equal as the two go back and forth throughout. Dillinger toys with Purvis by narrowly escaping him a few times before being caught which sets up a fictitious showdown between the two at a prison. Though the scene isn't nearly as good, it does have a lot of similarity to the now infamous coffee shop scene from 'Heat'. Just to see Dillinger and Purvis go back and forth even for just two minutes was really something to behold.The supporting actors in this film play small yet important roles. Stephen Dorff, Giovanni Ribisi, Marion Cotillard, Stephen Lang, & Billy Crudup. Dorff and Ribisi play members of Dillinger's gang, Crudup is very good as FBI head honcho J. Edgar Hoover, & Cotillard is pretty good also as Dillinger's love Billie Frechette. Actors of such caliber as Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard really bring out the emotion in their characters and make us as the audience feel for them and even though this is a true story and we know how it ends, we still kinda wish they end up together. Stephen Lang's character ends up being the one that fires the fatal shot that finishes off Dillinger as he was walking out of a movie at the Biograph Theater in Chicago.In the end it all comes back to Michael Mann, who almost perfectly crafts the story of John Dillinger in a way that blended fact and fiction quite seamlessly. While it did have a few historical inaccuracies; that doesn't take anything away from the achievement of Mann and the actors. They all do the story justice and really transport us into the world of the Chicago area during the depression era of the 1930's. 'Public Enemies' doesn't quite reach the heights of Mann's masterpieces 'Heat' and 'The Insider', but that doesn't stop him from staging huge shootouts that try to rival the ones seen in 'Heat'. And this does continue to show that Michael Mann is a cinematic genius when it comes to the epic crime saga and I can't wait to see which crime world he decides to tackle next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It should have been 10 but...,The quality of the sound is terrible!!! I sounds like it was shot on an iPhone! It's a pity because Johnny Depp is delicious in this role - and any movie with Stephen Graham is going to be a successful project. But - this should have been a block buster but it isn't because of the lack of refinement. There should have been a lot more detail but instead it skirted over the characters and just made it one long big boys gunfight. At least the cars looked good - but truly this is an opportunity missed to have created something really magnificent. I wish there has been more emphasis on the quality rather than the fight scenes.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A slickly recreated documentary with little substance,"I agree that Mann succeeded in showing a great ""visual story"" but this movie offered me little else.As noted, Bale's portrayal of Purvis is perfunctory and Depp had few moments in which to dazzle us with character development through words and voice - other than when he was in jail speaking to his captors. Others might disagree claiming that less is more.I think the writers should have taken more creative licence to create dialogue that would have allowed his principles to shine. I see this film as a slickly recreated documentary of Dillinger's life: a marginal movie that draws interest from branded stars, great set design, costume and historical accuracy.Mann does illustrate the pop status of Dillinger - a 1930s Robin Hood, so to speak - but I'll be curious to see if the movie wins any Oscar's other than best sound or cinematography, or some other 'craft' award.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Compelling and Gripping But With Weaknesses,"12 July 2009. Until the very end, this movie had enough technical weaknesses to become a disappointment in terms of how great this movie could have been. Yet, it delivered enough to make this a quality period police drama. Michael Mann who directed MANHUNTER (1986) starring William Petersen in a CSI movie predecessor delivered the sharp, colorful, and even more grit. But the series of technical oversights had the potential to drag this movie down. (1) African music near the beginning of the movie seemed at odds with the American time period. (2) The shaky photography at times during the first third of the movie where the characters are seem bouncing up and down, out of focus was distracting and distancing. (3) The were a number of shots during the first third of the movie where the characters are heard but not seen talking which almost felt like they could have been dubbed. (4) There relational development between Dillinger and Billie didn't quite seem to have sufficient screen time to really cement the relationship. (5) The introduction of a new FBI agent from another office later in the movie was underdeveloped (who seemed like an early form of FBI profiler). (6) The high tech FBI gadgetry didn't seem to provide a direct connection with the sudden second arrest of the Dillinger. (7) The interplay between Christian Bale and Johnny Depp was never really given a strong emphasis like HEAT (1995). (8) The night time raid was also awfully artificial with an impossibly bright lighting set scheme which might have been much for successfully darkened (as in a horror genre) to heighten the fear element. (9) The interrogation of the severely injured cohort and his subsequent disposition (whether he lived or died) was left too unclear. (10) Billie's interrogation scene left out the physical humiliation shot that would have provided an even more outrageous emotional reaction. (11) The actual demise of Dillinger in the movie was surprisingly confusing and awkwardly shot.Nevertheless, the whole tone of the movie, the strong underplayed performance of Johnny Depp kept a strong, underlying sense of heightened tension throughout the movie. The shot fights were actually even more compelling that the blockbuster, extravaganza, special effects driven TRANSFORMERS: THE REVENGE OF THE FALLEN (2009) in which the sound effects and the you are there realism was potent and riveting. Emotional and intimately intense with excellent physical action, this movie is one of the strongest of the year. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Wrong focus on this romanticized crime film,"It's okay to make a modern movie about one of the most notorious criminals in American history. And, the makers and cast of ""Public Enemies"" did a good job in portraying the main characters. Johnny Depp does a decent job portraying the fun-loving nature of John Dillinger. If anything, he is not as humorous or frequently smiling as the real J.D. And, Christian Bale portrays the always somber FBI agent Melvin Purvis well. Billy Crudup does a good job portraying the young, impetuous J. Edgar Hoover.""Public Enemies"" also is a good portrayal of the widespread lawlessness of the time. Prohibition lasted from 1920 to the end of 1933. Bootleg booze was big business and organized crime flourished. The Great Depression was on and many homeless and jobless Americans turned to crime. The almost wholesale corruption of law enforcement in Chicago made it a haven for criminals.Thus, John Dillinger returned often to his base of operations after his bank robberies. To this extent, this film does a good job. But, from then on, one begins to wonder. Dillinger joked with the press and liked publicity. And, there was something of a cult following, especially among the young, including boys. Some had a skewed notion of Dillinger as a sort of Robin Hood. And this film seems to play along with that. If anything the dour Purvis is pictured as an obsessed pursuer.Of all the criminal charges against Dillinger, he had just one charge of homicide against him. But this film shows him in scene after scene with Tommy Guns and pistols blazing away and people falling to the ground. Is one to think that Dillinger couldn't hit anyone and that only others in his gang were able to shoot all those people?The film has a scene of a fictional meeting between Dillinger and Purvis. They never did meet face to face in real life. In the movie, Dillinger is behind bars and Purvis comes to look at him. As Purvis walks away, Dillinger says to him, that he should change his line of work. At that point, Bale (Purvis) stops and the camera holds on him a few seconds, showing that he's obviously thinking something.What was the point of that piece of fiction? Might not the writers instead have had Purvis make that statement to Dillinger? That would have squared more with the matter of right and wrong among those shown in this film. After all, wasn't it Dillinger who was being hunted and constantly fleeing to avoid the law? Wasn't it he who was in the wrong ""line of work?""The film overall seems to have slight empathy for Dillinger and his girlfriend, Billie (played by Marion Cotillard). It never shows anything about the FBI agents, police, people in banks or others who are killed. There is no empathy for the families of those people.""Public Enemies"" overall seems to glamorize the lives of a bunch of brazen bank robbers and killers. It sure is a lousy public statement about right and wrong, justice and law and order. One wonders why this film was made at all.Incidentally, the Tommy gun could be fired with a 100-round drum or a 32-round magazine feeding bullets at a rate of 900 per minute. In the film, the actors were using magazines. Yet only a couple of times did it show anyone changing a magazine. But many scenese showed the robbers firing the Tommy guns for long blasts, one after another. And never a change of ammo.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Disjointed, Haphazard, & Jarring","If you want a film where you are thrust into an action sequence, bullets flying, glass breaking, and all around chaos erupting onto a screen wrapped in shiny foil and a filling of movie stars that don't save the film, this poor excuse for a film might interest you. You will see characters shot and killed without a discernible identity, and you will be confused and lost during most of the film. You may find yourself asking ""Did Babyface Nelson get shot or was it that other nameless gang member?"" The lackluster, poor semblance of plot together with utter failure of maintaining an engaging narrative leaves you with a bad taste in you mouth. The film begins to seem like scenes of poorly written dialogue, aimed at filling time while leaving the audience waiting for a gunfight to break out, obviously feeding into the action oriented thirst that masses of movie-going meat-heads seek out in theaters today. The gaps and structure just leaves you wondering how in the hell was this adapted from a book? The only explanation is that they omitted 2 chapters every time they crafted a collection of scenes from one. The shaky, Blair Witch-esque camera work was worse and more jarring than that of Cloverfield. A perfect analogy would be rolling yourself down an enormous steep hill within a garbage can.On the more positive note, Johnny Depp's portrayal of John Dillinger was excellent, as was his lover's, played by Marion Cotillard. However, their relationship seemed to be nothing more than Dillinger finding and holding onto a piece of ass that was madly in love with him and seemed to be constantly wearing her own pair of rose-colored glasses when she was with him. Christian Bale's portrayal was a little too robotic to be characterized as a human, driven by his superiors and an irrational obsession chasing Dillinger, but that may as well been how it was, but that I cannot comment confidently on that without more knowledge behind the man.Finding yourself looking for a look into the hunting down, death, and destruction of one of the most infamous criminal gangs in American history, instead go save yourself the grueling 2-hour 23-minute cinematic vomit comet that Public Enemies is and rent ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" However, if John Dillinger is your thing, its been done countless times, each once either strictly Dillinger, or some derivation of the criminal.If you really want to see the film, go right ahead. It was decent, the starring performances were solid, just try and decipher who is who very earlier or your'll find yourself lost within the gunfights.

"Too long, over ""Hollywood-ised"".....and since when did making a mass murderer look like a hero become a good idea??","I'm not going to use up much of my time writing about this film as it has already consumed enough of it in the cinema. There are three main things wrong with this movie:1: Far too long 2: Far too much Hollywood 3: Glamorized a killerThis movie has a running time of 140 minutes. Cut it down to 90, which could be done incredibly easily, and I might not have been so disappointed. There are several scenes, which I assume are to give a sense of drama, anticipation and build-up (which seems to be the way these days), that should be cut either completely or way way down. For example, the love scene between Dillinger and Bille; a complete waste of time and kept in purely for the sake of sex.My biggest issue however, is that the movie glamorized a serial cop killer. This man was not a hero, even if the American public did brand him a ""Robin Hood"" of the depression. He was a bank robber who was prepared to remove anyone who got in the way. We see in the movie that he used innocent people as human shields so he could make a clean getaway from his jobs. He also claimed the lives of many law enforcement officials. These do not make up the character of Robin Hood or a hero. Good riddance to him.That aside, as a movie, it's far too long, boring story line and some quite shoddy acting displayed in places.Don't waste your money.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
'Heat' with tommy guns and fedoras,"An appealing recipe and list of ingredients: two equally smoldering, brooding leading men with fab jawlines; a well-chosen supporting cast; gorgeous period costumes, sets and props; an American legend based in the reality of a not-too-distant past; cops-n-robbers action and the requisite conflicted love interest who stands by her man and looks the other way despite his obvious flaws.Unfortunately the finished meal isn't going to win any Foodie awards - mostly because we've all been here before with Michael Mann. Mann has made great contributions to both television and film. 'Miami Vice' is often derided as strictly an 80s phenomenon but its film-noir darkened sets, whispered dialogue and quirky supporting cast (with some unlikely gorgeous policewomen thrown in) influenced dozens of shows from NYPD Blue to CSI. 'To Live And Die In LA' was a Friedkin film but it borrows liberally from the Mann cookbook.'Heat' is one of the few stylish crime thrillers of the 1990s that still feels fresh today thanks to its pacing and players and it's clear that Mann thinks so too. He can't be faulted for revisiting a successful formula but it all feels too familiar: Depp/Dillinger is a curtain-twitching DeNiro ready to skip town in 60 seconds flat, Bale/Purvis is Pacino stalking his prey and apparently never sleeping, Cotillard/Frechette is Ashley Judd wailing and gnashing teeth over her criminal boyfriend. Mann even reuses the 'criminal meets cop up close and personal before the end of the movie' scene in which the two have a staredown and exchange threats pregnant with ominous foreshadowing.Many would-be Hollywood blockbusters are mindlessly edited to squeeze into a predetermined running time but at an expansive 2 hrs 20 min 'Public Enemies' feels overlong with too many lingering shots of its stars (usually a tight closeup of the eyes) and a surfeit of shaky hand-held camera work meant (apparently) to convey the frantic nature of bank jobs, police ambushes and prison breaks. The gun battles are admittedly well done with impressive sound effects and believable damage to buildings and bodies.'Public Enemies' isn't a bad film and may even be a good one - it's definitely preferable to have two stars sharing screen time than to have only one (think Tom Cruise in the MI series) tearing through scenes and scenery. Unfortunately if you've already watched films by Michael Mann particularly 'Heat' the frequent moments of deja vu are too distracting to allow one to fully enjoy his latest offering.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Overrated and empty,"I have been expecting so much more from this movie. While this movie doesn't disappoint me in the usual way Hollywood does. It is not extraordinary silly, nor cheesy - but nonetheless, it still has one of those really bad Hollywood endings. But the worst is, and this really destroyed the movie for me: The characters. There is 0 depths in them. Jonny Depp was nothing but cool. No fear - barely any humanity was given to this character. So I couldn't feel any sympathy for him. The whole movie was making an empty, dull impression on me. It didn't convince me in any way, not historical and not emotional.The Action: Those constant repetitive gunfights bored, and even annoyed me. I usually don't dislike shaky cams, but in this movie I did. I often didn't like the angle from which this movie has been shot. I even disliked the cutaway in a lot of scenes. I might have to over- think my opinion of Michael Mann.The atmosphere was another thing that I really disliked about the movie. With all the money they had, and the awesome set they have been able to use, this movie could have created an awesome 30's atmosphere. - But, it sadly didn't. The camera they have been using was a digital one. The movie sometimes looked like an absolute B-Movie. Colors lacked warmth and everything looked artificial. One of the worst things for me, has been the jazz-music. It didn't add any emotional weight to any scene. - At max it added some ""coolness"" feeling to the movie. Something I personally didn't find fitting. Atmosphere wasn't created by the jazz- music at all. It was as cold, as the movie looked. Only in the end, they used a good musical score - too bad that the ending was cheesy and not fitting to the rest of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Nothing much,"In the last few minutes there are a few minor things not in the other better and much shorter Dillinger films made. Minor meaning for instance that the famous woman in red was wearing a different color. Does that make it worth the 2 hours you have to spend to get to that moment? No. These tiny new things don't affect the basic story that's been done better almost every single time it's been done before in various formats.Attempts to make Dillinger into some kind of true love story aren't convincing and slow the story down.Though many names are dropped of other gangster pals in the film none are explained in a way that will make any sense to someone who isn't a big Gangster buff already. The whole thing feels like a cliffnotes version of a story that then you take the test and find out all the questions on the test aren't in your cliffnotes that you wasted time reading.There are many but not no exciting shoot outs in this film and in between not much that tells you anything deeper about Purvis or Dillinger other than the failed attempt to make Dillinger out as a one woman man--which by the end it's clear he isn't.Recreations of some of the scenes at the real locations again may be fun for the buff, but recreation is a good word it all feels passionless and dry. The shooting on HD and the style of the audio even seems dank thin and slip shod. Perhaps an attempt to have some documentary energy to the film. It has none, the HD is murky frequently you can't see into the actors eyes and most of the night and action footage looks like home movie material. Very little music and then rather ponderous music where you don't need it. Director of photography has worked with Mann before but seems to have no sense of how to make HD look good. If you ever wonder what THE GODFATHER would look like shot on HD here it is and it's a contrasty unforgiving look with some green tones and total blackness and blown out video look coming and going. HD, this time, is not up the the job for this high contrasty look.Depp doesn't make much of an impression, Bale comes off better but he's not even in the film for the long mounts of time that are spent on the non love story aspects. It sort of seems that Purvis story would have been more interesting, or at least more of him to balance out the story.Not as ugly look visually that Miami Vice had in director Mann's hands but this is a way long shallow slog and frankly pretty dull movie. Really poorly editing and oddly shot; it's a mix of hand held and locked down shots that don't justify either use or cut together well.Warren Oates starring version remains the best by far.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Forgettable, with a surprisingly weak performance by Depp","Watchable but unmemorable, the biggest problem with the movie is, surprisingly, the reason I watched it to begin with: Johnny Depp. While one gleans from the script that Dillinger was smart, charming, brutal and equipped with a strong sense of showmanship, Depp underplays the role, resulting in a Dillinger who is reasonably intelligent with a little flare. For someone who has portrayed so many quirky characters, it's surprising to see Depp so determined to make a famous gangster into someone who could as easily be a stockbroker. Dillinger turns out to be the least interesting thing in the movie.More interesting is Christian Bale's intense performance as Purvis and the portrayal of the FBI changing the way criminals are pursued. In fact, had this movie focused on the search for Dillinger and the FBI's search for publicity and made the mobster himself a minor figure this would have made for a much more interesting movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Shot way TOO DARK,"The lighting is absolutely dark in the movie. Avoid. Ruined a good script and the audio at times was too quiet. The acting wasn't bad beside a few of the bank robbers looked really cheesy. Mr. Depp was good in the movie, when you could see him. It's hard to imagine in this day and age they would light a set like this and expect us to think it is some mood setting depression era look or feel. It's not. Also many of the Chicago cliques were repeated that you see in every Chicago film that is overdone. Also while the dialog was mute at times, the fighting scenes were way overdone. The sound would spike up to the point that it was deafening. Maybe they went with a cheap sound and lighting crew to pay all the big actors in the movie, but it shows in what could of been a great film had they caught on early and re shot all this junk.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Dragging and limp, a massive disappointment from Michael Mann","A hugely disappointing experience - I am a big Michael Mann fan: the coffee shop scene in 'Heat' is one of the most bristling moments of recent cinema history. Perhaps that's part of the problem. 'Heat' works because the entire film is drawing to a meeting of the colossal forces that are Lt. Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley (played, of course, by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro). In the coffee shop scene the audience realises that what they are seeing are two sides of the same coin - they are the same people, and their confrontation can only end in self-destruction.In 'Public Enemies' there simply isn't that kind of collision between the characters of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. There's a brief, witty yet flippant meeting of the two between the bars of a jail in the first half of the film, which entirely dissolves the tension between these supposedly titanic enemies. A real flop after the fizz of Mann's previous work. In the end, I found that I just didn't care enough about the characters to stay interested.The HD handy-cam style works perfectly in the slow dialogue of scenes like the race course scene, picking out every stitch in Depp's expertly tailored suits. Or in the half-light of a photographer's flare as the plane brings its prisoner onto a journalist-packed airstrip. But as soon as it tries to capture a fast-moving firefight in a cottage in the woods, the style collapses. Mann simply hasn't hit the mark with his cinematography. I have no problem with the style in general; it just doesn't work here.Finally, Mann's enduring weakness with his female characters really stands out in 'Public Enemies'. When you have a screen presence such as Marion Cotillard at the beginning of the film and then take her away half way through the film, you really notice. Worse of all, to then bring her back only to beat her unnecessarily around the head for 15 minutes in a scene dangerously close to misogyny just grates. Give me more of her, and less of unwatchable shootouts in darkness please! I'm sorry, but it's an overly-long, overly-busy movie that could do with a few more days in the editing suite. 140 minutes - a real let-down for a otherwise praising Michael Mann fan.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Feels like someone describing the movie.,"My title might confuse you, but allow me to explain. Have you ever jumped on a movie after it has started and somebody gives you a little ""Important Points"" rundown?This is the problem with Public Enemies. Michael Mann shows a lot of things that are important, you'll see John Dillinger checking his guns and cars. You'll see Melvin stepping in because Hoover has no ""street credibility"", the FBI being born. But all you see is a 30 seconds scenes about every and each one of these features. The movie feels shallow, like a big box for a small gift. It goes on for a long time, but is basically made up mostly of these small tidbits of ""trivia"" on the characters.While on Heat you could relate to both the cop and the thief, in Public Enemies you will have a hard time relating to any. While Deep has his usual charm, and plays very well his ""Deniro meets Deep"" take on John Dillinger, there is no depth given to this character, he says he wants the world but he doesn't look like up to it.Bale gives us a lovely vocal interpretation, but his character has absolute no depth. He has no past, no family, nothing to care for other than catching Dillinger and dealing with the way some of his co-workers behave.Ironically, Marion Cottilard who plays Dilinger's girlfriend is the most interesting character, you can relate to her struggling in life and being swept away by this ""whole different world"" that Dillinger brings to her.The action scenes are good, but there aren't many. The movie seems to build up for a incredible heist that never happens.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""the worst crime in the film is that I just didn't care""","The newest Michael Mann film to date so it should be good right? Well no.The good points first.There is a level of quality to a Michael Mann film, a look, that lets you know you are watching a Michael Mann film. This is present in Public Enemies.A story created around two central male figures and their place in their world is also inevitably here.But this is also where Public Enemies shows its failings.We have the characters place in the world but it isn't a world we care about. Their goals don't draw you in and in the case of the character of Dillinger his goal isn't clear. He cares for a woman but you're left wondering why? as we are given such a brief introduction to her. This is not to say the actors, with the exception of Bale, are not in acceptable form just that they aren't given enough to work with and consequently you don't really care.Bale is perhaps giving his worst performance to date, fewer roles might see us getting a higher standard from Bale but this has to be his worst, with an accent that almost draws a giggle and a performance that isn't believable.Superficially Public Enemies looks and sounds good. Everything is in place for a good film and yet it doesn't work. Sometimes a film no matter what the ingredients is just kind of boring. At times I wasn't sure who had died but the worst crime in the film is that I just didn't care.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
PE Movie,"Distortion of the historical facts made it difficult to enjoy this movie.I will not go into details, but by the time Baby Face Nelson died, i was wondering if there even be a scene of Dillingers death at the Biograph Cinema.I understand, this is not a documentary, but at least you can try and get some things right.Anyhow, read the book, if you really want to know what happened...... ... ...ps. 10 lines for the review are dumb, no wonder i don't post any.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"So, it's a period piece, period.","With fine period scenery, props, and a wealth of possible details involving facts of the period, this should be a great work of historical fiction, but instead, it's just a period piece, period. There was a number of interesting tales to be told, but the ones chosen turned out to be the driest and least interesting possible story lines available.With a truly great cast, not a single actor was allowed to shine in his or her role. The direction that this film was allowed to take was the barest bones of what could have been. The story that was presented was not much better than an article in any of the hundreds of True Crime magazines that touched upon the career of John Dillinger and the other criminals with whom he was associated.Even the artistic license that was taken was the least meaningful possible changes to the historical facts. The inaccuracies were less artistic license than misinformation. In all, I'm disappointed. Even Christian Bale disappointed me with his cringeworthy attempt at a southern accent, which could have been anything from a bad Back Bay Boston accent to a bad Tidewater Virginian accent. What it never came close to was a South Carolina low country accent, which is what Purvis would have had when he was living. 5 stars of 10 is too generous, but I would be too depressed by giving it a 3.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Hugely disappointing,"I don't know what it is that's missing from this film but there's definitely something.. Not that Johnny Depp didn't do a bang-up job as Public Enemy Number One, a role that the Pirate of the Caribbean had long coveted. He probably deserves kudos for the best Dillinger portrayal, but you can't do a whole lot with a worn and weary script. Mann should've called John Milius for advice: his own 1973 Dillinger starring Warren Oates was an awesome flick but, as he learned, Dillinger just doesn't go over big at the box office. Even Lawrence Tierney could've told him that. Oscar winner Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis and Award-winner Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette added star appeal but you just can't make a good meat loaf out of spam. No teasing, no toying, just things happening. there's little plot movement, zero character development and the muted acting comes across as sleepwalking. Depp has the odd moment, mostly in the love sub-plot when he finally shows some intriguing charisma and as a result you're left wishing there was a lot more smooching and a lot fewer gunfights. bale is blank - such a shame when he can often do the inner-turmoil/explosion thing so well.For Depp, Bale and Cotillard fans, this is a solid effort for which these actors deserve recognition for putting over a registered stink bomb. For Michael Mann watchers, this ranks right up there with Manhunter as a classic book-to-movie fumble. For crime buffs and action/adventure flick fans, well, let's say this is better than Boys In The Hood... but not much. All in all, a big disappointment; I had expected much better! Overall rating: 5 out of 5.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
