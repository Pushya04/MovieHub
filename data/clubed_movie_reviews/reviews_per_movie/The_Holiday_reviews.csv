Enjoyable escapism,"I think this film deserves a better rating than the current 6.9 on IMDb. I to expected it to be just like other rom com's but it was much better than i expected and very enjoyable.The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Iris (Kate Winslet) fed up with their love lives; Amanda's boyfriend has been cheating on her and the man Iris loves has just got engaged to someone else. They both decide to switch houses for Christmas for an escape from their complicated lives; so Iris jets off to Amanda's place in sunny L.A and Amanda goes to Iris' quaint cottage in snowy Surrey, England (if only it really did snow at Christmas!) Amanda soon meets Iris' handsome brother Graham (Brilliantly played by Jude Law) and Iris meets musician Miles (Jack Black) and you can guess the rest...The acting is strong and well handled. At first i found Cameron Diaz hugely annoying but as it went on i warmed to her character; she and Jude had lots of chemistry and their relationship was handled well and Graham's secret was a good twist.I thought Jack Black was great in this different role, he and Kate also had chemistry and he was totally believable. I wish their storyline had been a bit longer though as they spent way more time on Cameron and Jude's part.Kate Winslet as usual was funny and touching as Iris and maybe one of the best parts of the film was her relationship with the old man (Eli Wallach) they both seemed to have a connection and it was nice to hear his stories of when he was a writer in the good old Hollywood days when he knew Cary Grant and co! If you want beautiful scenery, escapism from the millions of horror and action films out there and good characterisation, than this is for you. It's not as soppy as other rom/com's and it's easy to identify with the characters, it's also very festive and my dad even liked it and he hates romantic films!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost Like Old Times,"Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fluffy Fun for a Winter Evening!,"If you are expecting an epic cinematic masterpiece, then ""The Holiday"" is not for you. However, if you are looking for a light, entertaining movie, I would definitely recommend this film. While the previews were intriguing, I was thrilled to find that not every plot element was revealed before I even entered the theater. I completely enjoyed Kate Winslet as hopelessly devoted Iris. She was neurotic, a bit spineless, and absolutely winning. Although I do wish that her story had been developed more thoroughly. I felt a bit like her relationship was rushed through and the film spent a majority of the time focusing on Amanda (Diaz), Graham (Law), and their developing relationship. Despite the fact that I am not a huge Cameron Diaz or Jude Law fan, I was pleasantly surprised with their part of the story! Jack Black kept his character to an energetic hum rather than an explosion of crazy antics. You've just got to love that eyebrow! The scenery was beautiful! The supporting cast was hugely entertaining. I laughed out loud. The ending is fairly predictable. This is a romantic comedy after all. However, ""The Holiday"" is a great film for those of us who would like to suspend reality for a while and just enjoy. Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Swiss Chocolate of Romantic Comedies,"Do you like chocolate? Do you know that moment, even before you put it in your mouth? You can imagine that taste. You can feel that rich sweetness on your tongue, the smoothness going around your mouth . . .The Holiday is a romantic comedy. You know what that means. And if you don't like romantic comedies, don't go and see it. If you do, you will know what to expect. The mushy feelings creeping up on you. All those 'If Only . . .' emotions telling you there is a lovely place somewhere in which people fall in love and everything works out kinda perfect. If only for a while . . . say, for the holiday period over Christmas and New Year . . . or for the 138 minutes which this film lasts.Two Women on the Verge of Emotional Breakdown do holiday house swap. They escape lovelorn predicaments and find 'unexpected' love on their opposite sides of the Atlantic. Cue picturesque English country house just the way Americans imagine it (with sheep out the back). Cue enormous L.A. mansion with swimming pool (just the way Brits imagine it).Cameron Diaz is Amanda, owner of a movie-trailers editing firm. Since she's played the same comedy character several times, there are few surprises; but an excellent script, written directly for her and the other three leading stars, projects it rather better than average. Kate Winslet as Iris, a successful writer on The Telegraph, is more nuanced: an actor with considerable range, we cannot but help admire the way she does 'pathetic girl' rather beautifully in a role that she could manage with one hand counting the ways to have fun and get paid simultaneously.Formulaic it is (wonderful women with scoundrelly fellas eventually get The Real Men They Deserve - meeting puppy dogs, children, and falling snowflakes on the way of course). But, well-done within a narrow genre, it still stands out. No-brainers like this tend to have dumb scripts and dumber acting, but The Holiday contains warm, natural dialogue and heartfelt chemistry. If this was the 40's, you'd want Jude Law and Cameron Diaz to get married off-screen afterwards. Charismatic and entertaining, unless you find Diaz, Law or Winslet personally irritating (some people do), they are a joy to watch, filling their parts with love and light. Excellent production values keep the rather trite story flowing. Everything is picture-perfect, long lenses flattering the features of the already handsome stars, filters and soft-focuses carefully delineating the mood.There is an overall honesty to the performances. ""You look like my Barbie!"" delights a four-year-old excitedly to Diaz. Ironic? But said with so much affection it is self-deprecating rather than cutting. Jack Black struggles to get out of his music-and-silly-faces typecasting but just manages to look the part for an intellectual Iris who is not attracted to skin-deep. Jude Law, on the other hand, could be an advert for men's skin cream, and too rounded a character to be mere pin-up material.With more Christmas songs than you can shake a piece of tinsel at, The Holiday is a warm, snuggly romance to lose yourself in before coming firmly back down to planet earth. It might be shallow, but it's seasonal entertainment - and a Swiss chocolate of romantic comedies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A movie without overt sex, violence, gunfire, explosions or profanity...and I still really enjoyed it!","While this movie is not going to be a masterpiece and held up in the future as an example of ""great"" film making, it was, in my opinion, a well made, albeit predictable, movie.I did appreciate the storyline was a bit of a formula, but it had enough in the sub plots to keep me interested all the way through.I got what I expected and a little more from the lead characters, but was a little disappointed in the performance of Jack Black. I am a fan of Jack, but am seeing a lot of the same from him in his facial contortions. Even so the character was ""lovable""! The real surprise for me was the whole ""Arthur Abbott"" (Eli Wallach) sub plot. It was delightful and saved the show from the malaise that plagues the romantic comedy, that being predictability.I am not a romantic comedy type of guy, yet I was sucked into this movie well and truly.As I left, I felt like I had been treated as a human being. I had not been assaulted by the violence, overt sexual references, gunfire and the explosions that seem to be everywhere. (Not that I don't like a good ""shoot the baddies"" or ""indecent suggestive action"" type of movie).This was just good clean ""fun""! And I would see it again (next year maybe!)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Twice the rom-com,"Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is a pushover for her ex (Rufus Sewell) and she's blindsided by his engagement. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is tired of her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns) and leaves her LA life for a few weeks. They use a vacation website to chat up a home exchange. During their vacation, they each fall for their own local guys.It's a double rom-com. Jack Black is trying to be a romantic lead. He and Winslet make an odd couple. She's absolutely charming. He's not himself, and Eli Wallach is better as the lead. Jude Law is a more conventional choice for a leading man. He and Diaz work well together.It's an unabashed chick flick. It does exactly what you expect it to do. It just does it twice. It explains the running time of over 2 hours. It's kinda corny and kinda formulaic, but it has its heart in the right place.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Christmas favourite,"This is probably my all-time favourite Christmas movie. I actually watch it every year!What's not to love? Wonderful actors, a heart-warming script, beautiful connections/chemistry throughout the movie and a depth in characters you rarely see anymore in the ""Christmas-feelgood-romance"" kind of movies. Oh and such a fun soundtrack, I really enjoy that too.Eli Wallach (RIP) is just charming and a reminder that good actors can make a simple storyline a film you want to watch again and again. Just beautiful!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good ChickFlick Even This Bloke Loved It,"Well I have to confess I was dreading seeing this film, but actually I loved it.The story is quite fantastical. But once you can go along with the ridiculous plot, it is very funny and totally charming. It's a bit like eating liquid chocolate, and somehow manages to last for 2 hours and 10 minutes without you feeling sick.At the start of the film, the acting is very hammy, but this removes your desire for believability enough to carry the film. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law look absolutely lovely. Kate Winslett really pulls off her comedic role brilliantly. The are some beautiful touching moments about Hollywood history and a couple of famous faces appear in cameo roles. The English countryside is lovely. Lots of laughter and tears in the audience.The nutritional value of chocolate is limited. This film will uplift you though if nothing else. Excellent Christmas movie (from a bloke!).",,Anonymous,Romance
"Love, improbably","Iris (Kate Winslett), attractive, if somewhat dowdy, young English journalist (she works for that citadel of fogeyism, the ""Daily Telegraph""), on the rebound from an affair with the shiftless Jasper (Rufus Sewell), one of the paper's columnists, decides she needs a Christmas holiday. She goes on-line and has soon swapped her Christmas-card pretty, but cramped, Surrey cottage with a mansion in Bel – Air owned by Amanda (Cameron Dias), the ebullient head of a company that makes movie trailers, who has just thrown out her latest useless partner. The girls swap places and in no time Amanda is romancing Iris's dishy brother Graham (Jude Law). Meanwhile in Hollywood Iris is getting to know Miles (Jack Black), a workmate of Amanda's, and a 90 year old neighbour, Arthur (Eli Wallach) who happens to be one of Hollywood's forgotten great writers.One can of course dismiss this sort of stuff as glossy fairy floss because basically, despite all the money and talent expended in making it, that is what it is - ""Love, Improbable."" This film is rather long for its genre, over two hours, and it does drag a bit, as if the scriptwriters couldn't decide how to end it. However it must be admitted that Kate Winslett and Jude Law are always interesting to watch on screen and Cameron Diaz has a nice line in parodying some of her earlier performances. Rufus Sewell shows he can out-act Hugh Grant any day (not hard I guess). Jack Black on the other hand seemed strangely out of place as Ms W's love interest – romantic comedy doesn't seem to be his forte, he's more of your gross-out guy. It was nice though to see Eli Wallach, a great Hollywood tough guy of old, who at 90 seems to have the market for nice old buffers sewn up, as the neighbour.Perhaps I am setting my standard too high, but compared to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Bedrooms and Hallways"" and even ""Love, Actually"", this was a pile of mush, far too sweet and sticky and nice. Good comedy needs a certain bite, a reality bite, a bit of astringency, whereas what we are given here is pure fairyland escapism. Writer/Director Nancy Myers has a record of light entertaining stuff (""The Parent Trap"", ""Father of the Bride"") and she certainly is not trying to extend her range here.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really entertaining and sometimes sweet!,"There are some romantic comedies that I don't like, but The Holiday is an exception. I found it sweet and very entertaining at times. The four stars, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black are very talented actors, and their performances take centre stage here. Kate Winslet was lovely as Iris, but I was really delighted with Cameron Diaz as Amanda, especially when she is seen wearing stilettos in the snow. At my first viewing the whole cinema were like ""How does she do that?"" I also thought their exchange on the phone was hilarious too. As the men, I really liked Jack Black as Miles, a perfect blend of subtlety and spirit. Jude Law, an actor who isn't always my cup of tea, does very well indeed, as Diaz's new friend Graham. This tells the story of two women who swap homes and make lifelong friends, or something along the lines of that. My sister has this on DVD and absolutely loves it. I have only two quibbles with this movie, the script is a little weak and frothy at times, and there are some places where the story is underdeveloped. Still a beautiful-looking and hugely enjoyable film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, but some casting issues","This somewhat odd but distinctly likable film involves two women, one in L.A. and one in London, both unhappy in love, who switch homes to shake up their lives.The movie is often funny and sometimes touching, with solid performances from all. Perhaps the biggest issue is the absence of chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jack Black, which gives the movie a false note that could have been avoided if it wasn't so determined to follow the standard romantic comedy path. Winslet has much better chemistry with Eli Wallach, wonderful as an aged scriptwriter.One interesting thing to note is Jude Law, whose handsome, empathetic, nurturing, understanding character could best be described as lady porn, plays the sort of role usually played by a woman: the perfect person, wonderful in every way, whose main role in the story is to allow the main character to transition to a new phase in their life.It's not a great movie, and I don't love the structure, which simply involves cutting back and forth between two unrelated stories, but it's a nice feel-good chick flick thing that is perfect for days you don't want your brain to work too hard.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nice~  very nice,"This was a really good, light hearted movie, with GREAT characterization. There are points where the movie is a little slow, but not slow enough to loose your interest.All of the characters are wonderfully developed especially Jude Laws-the under-story of Jude's character adds an extra dimension to his character and really makes you love him all the more.Kate Winslet's character is another that was well worked out. She helps out this little old man . . . and the character development between her and this older gentleman is wonderful . . . it adds so much to her character, makes her more human, more real, someone very likable and someone you want to end up with a good ending.Jack Black's character was sweet, not corny . . . and you end up liking him very much. He was not a goober like he usually is in his movies.Over all, it was a wonderfully character driven movie, that was enjoyable and had you leaving the theater feeling good. I recommend it highly!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday,Winslet and Diaz both have men problems so they swap their perfect houses in Surrey and LA for Christmas. Diaz meets Law and Winslet meets Black.The difficulty here is that both romances are largely unconvincing. The Cameron / Law romance is deadly dull and it's hard to imagine Winslet falling for Black's unfunny idiot. The Winslet side of the story is the most entertaining due to the presence of Eli Wallace as an Oscar winning writer neighbour to Winslet and indeed this friendship feature the best scenes in the film.Nice cameo in the video store,4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cute Christmas tale,"Everything about this movie still stands up. Cameron Diaz is flawless and adorable, Kate Winslet is endearing and adorable, Jude law perfect for the role... the only thing that I have never been able to grasp for the last maybe 22 years that this movie has been out is Kate Winslet with Jack Black. Obviously they gave her a very handsome man that she's supposed to be getting over and is no way ever going to get over him with Jack Black. They did Kate Winslet dirty. Going and giving Cameron Diaz some hottie like Jude Law and then she's gotta make out with Jack Black and pretend that he is funny enough to be adorable? It doesn't fly..it doesn't pass...it's not believable... especially when they give him a super hot girlfriend. That's the only part I would change the casting of Jack Black. He was hilarious in Jumanji but does not round out this ensemble cast very well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good to pass a rainy day,"Although this isn't my typical pick on movies I'd love to see, I have to say I enjoyed screening this one. The run time is a bit long, and the movie gets a bit soft in the middle, but considering you're actually watching two love stories (as opposed to one), I guess the run time is justified. It still seemed a bit forced to get the story told in a descent amount of time (still over two hours). The performances were moderate to good, with exception of Jude Law as Graham, who was wonderful.If you're tired of holiday films that are so stacked with so much Christmas cheer that it makes you sick, this is the perfect alternative. Light enough for some serious laughs, and with enough drama to keep it interesting to audiences, this one's a good date movie. Leave the kids with a sitter. There are a few adult themes that could be uncomfortable to try to explain to a younger one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love the old times,It's 2021 and I have seen the film numerous times over the years. I love the solid cast and think they did a good job considering the material.

Still continues to give me happiness when I'm feeling down.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best holiday romantic comedy yet.,"I laughed. I cried. I awed. My jaw even dropped a couple of times. This movie surpassed all of my original expectations. At almost two and a half hours, I thought it might drag on, but I never felt like it was really that long. This movie is not only about heartbreak and heart ache, it's about finding yourself and appreciating the true things in life. I felt that Kate and Cameron did a wonderful job. Their characters come from two very different worlds yet they both seek the same thing...escape. They encounter so much more upon arriving at their destinations, and ultimately end up finding the completely unexpected. Jude is a star charmer as always, and Jack, well, he's Jack. Seeing this movie should be on everyone's holiday ""to-do"" lists, and I can guarantee it will be in my DVD collection once it is released. Nancy Meyers hit a home run with this one and it is sure to bring everyone a nice large dose of holiday spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very cheesy, by far not as good as 'Something's Gotta Give, but do-able...","I have my moments of wanting to rent a sweet nothing B-movie to crawl under the covers with and I was anxious about Nancy Meyer's new production since I sooo enjoyed 'Something's Gotta Give'. But... I found 'The Holiday' somewhat of a disappointment. Although it has some good lines (particularly Kate Winslet's ones), beautiful sets and - to me - astonishing(!!) similarities (from Iris' profession to the interior of her house up to the exact disastrously manipulative, lying and cheating ex-lover - like I have been secretly visited by some fly on the wall with a hidden camera) the corniness of the structure and annoying too-over-the-top acting of totally miscast Cameron Diaz drove me up the wall. Darn, what a pity... could have been such a cute film. And Nancy Meyers did so well with 'Something's Gotta Give'. Now why did she go só wrong here?... A shame. But a good enough watch for when you can't sleep but shouldn't watch anything too dramatic, I guess...",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a good movie,"This is what it's all about. This is such a nice, heartwarming, emotional movie.I absolutely love this movie. So much stuff to love about it. I serioualy cannot understand why it has such a low rating here on IMDb.I overall, loved the message and the theme of this movie and probably even more importantly the execution of it and the way it was delivered. This movie is well made. It has great, complicated, 3-dimensional characters, who actually have a background and emotions, problems, feelings, insecutities, needs...etc. etc. etc. All this maeks them feel real and relatable and that results into us, the audience, to become invested and care, instead of counting down the minutes until the movie ends. This is such a basic concept in order for a movie to be succesful but ironically you rarely find it these days, especially in romantic comedies.As far as the story goes there are a few very pleasant surprises. When I first watched this movie I knew nothing about it. I hadn't seen any trailers or knew who plays in it so (if you've seen it) you probably know what I'm referring to. But anyway, the movie has a beginning, middle and end. And the journey is very enjoyable to watch. It starts... ok with not much going on and you kinda know where it's going but then the story starts to unravel and it slowldy gets bigger and bigger and it gets better as you see more while more characters enter the story.The cast is amazing as you'd expect from actors like Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law and Jack Black. Likeable and charming they all do a great job and they convey emotion so masterfully and with such heart.The supporting characters were amazing as well. The supporting cast is very important as they make the world feel real, they can literally make or break such movies and the actors who portrayed them were great as well.Like I said, overall, I loved the message and the theme of the movie. It's essentially a story about 4 (2?) troubled adults who are lonely. They seek to find love, find themselves and find happiness. Something which I think the entire world can identify and relate with. And what I liked about it is that the movie and the characters don't pretend like love is something stupid or cheesy or childish. They don't play it tough and strong, they don't deny or try to block off their feelings in order not to open up and be vulnerable (Just like the while of society does today unfortunately). They ARE vulnerable and open and in love. These people need love and affection in their lives and the journey through which they find it in this movie I thought was very charming and heartwarming.This is a well thought out and put together movie with heart. Perfect for a cozy Christmas movie night if you ask me. Highly recommended if you like romantic comedies.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Big question: did I miss some gigantic special effects?,"I don't understand how a film of this nature could cost $85 million. Certainly no one expected to make money with it costing so much. At a normal budget of, say, 20 or 30 million, it would have made quite a bit.Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet play two depressed, lovelorn women who switch homes for the Christmas holiday, Diaz leaving her Los Angeles mansion for a small fairy-tale like English house and Winslet trading the English chill for a big LA lifestyle. Diaz and her live-in boyfriend have just split, and Winslet is escaping from her great love, her boss, who just announced his engagement. Both are in for surprises.""The Holiday"" has a lot of warmth, likable characters, and it's a lovely Christmas movie. That's about it. There's no real pacing. Winslet is by far the more interesting actress, and she's teamed up with Jack Black, as a potential love interest and Eli Wallach, as her Oscar-winning screen writing neighbor, for the L.A. adventure - and the L.A. segments are better than the British.Diaz meets Winslet's brother, played by handsome Jude Law, and it turns out he has a secret that we don't learn until later in the film. At one point she reminds him that she's leaving in nine days. I don't know. If Jude Law were after me, I doubt I'd be going anywhere in nine days.For me this film was mildly entertaining. I'm not the demographic it's geared to, though. And I still can't understand how it cost $85 million.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good date movie that is entertaining and sweet,"(Synopsis) Two beautiful women, Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) both find themselves at the end of failed relationships just before Christmas. Amanda decides to take a two week vacation and surfs the internet. She meets Iris online, and they agree to swap their homes for the holidays. Amanda lives in Los Angles and Iris lives in the countryside of Surrey, England. Even though they now have a change of scenery and want no contact with men, they are both still depressed and lonely. But things are about to change when Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) drops by Iris' house and meets Amanda. On the other side of the world, Iris meets Miles (Jack Black) a film composer. Romance is in the air and sparks are about to fly.(My Comment) If you want to see a romantic comedy with real chemistry, especially between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law this is one chick flick you must see. This movie is a good date movie that is actually entertaining and sweet. You are actually seeing two love stories instead of one. There is a great subplot of the friendship between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach's character that will touch your heart. Actually, I enjoyed that part of the movie the best. Overall, the movie was enjoyable to watch with touching and funny scenes throughout the movie. The ending is predictable, but what do you expect, it is a romantic comedy. You will leave the movie feeling good, and isn't that what movies are all about. (Columbia Pictures, Run time 2:18, Rated PG-13)(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Why, Hollywood ,Why? Great Cast; Slick Production; Lifeless Script","Why do movies like this get made?

Let's demand that Hollywood hire people who can write.""The Holiday""'s cast is top notch, except for the terminally mediocre Jack Black, whose entire film career is some sort of cosmic joke.The very best thing about ""The Holiday"" is Eli Wallach's relatively large part as a great writer from Hollywood's Golden Era. Wallach is especially strong; being ninety years old does not diminish his charisma one whit.It's ironic that a movie with such a disaster of a script features a character playing a classic Hollywood writer, who makes repeated reference to well-written chick flicks from yesteryear.Jude Law is very winning here. He juggles his external beauty and inner complexity marvelously.Miffy Englefield and Emma Pritchard are adorable as moppet sisters too cute to live.Oh, but the script. It's drek. It's an insult.

Charming Holiday Romances,"Sweet syrup is expected from romantic comedies but what makes them tick and likable, even if they are predictable is the charm factor. 'The Holiday' is a charming romantic comedy. It pretty much has all the ingredients of romantic comedies and I loved how Myers has used numerous references to old classics. The locations are marvelous. Amanda's luxurious condo contrasts well with Iris's cozy cottage but they both give exude a feeling of comfort and home. The soundtrack is a plus and cinematography is brilliant.'The Holiday' tells two simultaneous stories (which are interlinked of course) but I liked Iris's holiday story more than that of Amanda. Thankfully, the director does not overtly focus on contrasting the two and the dialogues are a nice inclusion. Most of the comedy is not overdone either as its genuinely funny.The Amanda and Graham love story is more or less the typical holiday romance one has witnessed earlier but it is still a fun watch mainly due to the two leads. Both Cameron Diaz and Jude Law share wonderful chemistry. The genre is not anything new to Diaz and she definitely has become quite skillful at it. In the beginning of the movie, she reminded me a little of Meg Ryan. Law holds his own proving that he is competent in this genre. Edward Burns has a small but hilarious scene which reminds one of the Romeo and Juliet balcony scene except this one is the reverse of that.Iris's holiday has the added charm of the endearing Kate Winslet - Eli Wallach track which was such a delight to watch. This story is more about Iris's growth into an independent self-sufficient woman. Winslet's chemistry with both Black and Wallach is beautifully displayed and the actress demonstrates a flair for comedy. Black too downplays his comedy making Miles different from the usual goofy characters he is normally associated with. Eli Wallach is simply superb.'The Holiday' is quite a warm and fluffy piece of entertainment and a good enough holiday movie that will entertain. One should not expect anything other than a rom-com but this one has an extra appeal of a stellar cast and a splendid subplot.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Surprisingly Rich Romantic Comedy,"THE HOLIDAY was one of the biggest surprises I've had at the movies in years. This fresh and funny comedy stars Cameron Diaz as Amanda, the owner of a company that makes movie trailers, who has just dumped her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns)and decides she needs to get out of LA for awhile. She goes to a real estate website and chats with Iris (Kate Winslet), a lonely publishing employee who lives in England, who has just learned the man she's in love with is engaged. Amanda and Iris agree to exchange homes over the Christmas holiday. Iris arrives in LA and strikes up a friendship with Amanda's neighbor, a retired screenwriter (Eli Wallach) and Amanda's ex's best friend (Jack Black ). Amanda lands in London and finds herself in a whirlwind romance with Iris' bother (Jude Law), a sexy charmer with baggage. As silly and predictable as this film appears on the surface, it is just the opposite...cleverly written and performed with exuberance and sincerity. Diaz' performance is kind of all over the place and kind of hard to latch onto but Law has rarely been more appealing on screen and Jack Black shows solid leading man potential without losing that goofiness that we love about him, but it is the luminous performance of Kate Winslet that raises the bar on this one...Winslet's Iris is a delicious combination of vulnerability, sweetness, and silliness that makes this film well worth sitting through. Wallach is also a delight as the old gentleman brought out of his shell by Iris. A delight from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Super cheese....,"I am editing this review because I was a little bit harsh. If you want to crash out on the couch with a glass of wine, a box of luxury chocolates, a pleasant partner and maybe an annoying cat competing for attention... it's fantastic. The idea is good, Anglo-American cultural exchange bursting with chocolate box properties.Cameron Diaz romps through it - almost bonkers. Jude Law could own a cheese factory but does have good chemistry with Cameron. Kate Winslet coasts and shows absolutely no stress for her part. There is minimal chemistry with Jack Black.

Jack Black just can't pull of being a love interest,"Jack Black does have one very nice moment in The Holiday -- it is very early in the opening scenes when he's at his keyboard and glances up at the camera -- his hair is fluffy and he looks wistful and vulnerable and altogether adorable, and for a minute you believe he just might pull it off. But then comes the rest of the movie. No matter how hard he tries, he has absolutely no chemistry with Kate Winslet -- what's with all of those pecks on her face, anyway?? I found him to be totally unbelievable as a love interest for her. Too bad, because she really deserved one after dumping that daft twit she had pined after for three years... I think that Jack is much better being his loud, raunchy, uproarious self and leaving the loving to Jude Law.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Found no fault at all,"The Holiday (2006) is an out of the ballpark smash hit! I thought about it after seeing it and just seriously could find NO fault whatsoever. This is such a feel good, cute, romantic, and sweet film. And it's not one of those stupid run of the mill romance movies, it actually has depth and is well made. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz are two women recently out of relationships with men, and pretty fed up with life in general, so they decide to go on vacation. They switch houses, Cameron goes to stay in England in Kate's house, and Kate goes to Los Angeles to stay in Cameron's house. The plot in and of itself is interesting and draws you in to keep watching. The script is well written and original, with little sparks of comedy thrown in where needed. And then there are scenes where we get to know our characters, usually through deep conversations with them and other characters. There definitely are NOT cardboard cut out one dimensional characters here, they are characters with real life issues, true depth, and interesting backgrounds. The romance and chemistry between the couples is great! It's truly eclectic and comes so wonderfully natural. I also love the side plot between Kate Winslet and the older screenwriter next door neighbor, it's so undeniably cute and so sweet, it's just endearing, I actually cried during the scene where he is honored at that ceremony! 10/10 for The Holiday! It's so well deserved!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Adorable Movie!!,"I'm a mom of two and I decided to get out of the house while my husband watched the kids and go and treat myself to a movie. Having never seen the preview for ""The Holiday"", I paid for my ticket, got some popcorn and sat down. The movie came on, I laughed, had my ""awwwwwwwww that's so sweet"" moments, kinda got teary, and empathized with Kate Winslets character so much that I wanted to throw something at her crush guy in the film. When the movie was over, I felt good. Money well spent on a delightful movie. Also, it must be said that Jude Law and Cameron Diaz are so beautiful on screen. I hope to see them do more movies together.My only dislikes were some of the scenes felt over dramatized, and unreal (which I'm starting to think that it was purposeful), and the movie felt a bit long. But overall this is a great movie. Made me definitely want to plan a trip to London and stay in a cozy little house for two weeks. Well, almost.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sometimes there just isn't enough vomit in the world.,"I went to see this film because some of it was filmed near where I live and I wanted to see what my town looked like when airbrushed to within an inch of its life and covered in fake snow.

Surely there is only so much twee, fluffy cuteness and cliché that one film can contain - well you'd think so, anyway - but this one goes for the all time record.The cinematic equivalent of eating a half-ton marshmallow sprinkled in artificial sweetener. Had I not been trapped in the middle of a row I would have walked out - very rare for me - as more and more sappy piffle, two-dimensional characters and paint-by-numbers acting were paraded before me.If you are someone who harbours any kind of suspicion that it might be possible to live some fragment of a fulfilling life whilst - dare I say it - single, then please learn from my mistake and do not waste two precious hours of your life on this film.

As for the cast, Jack Black might not have been the best choice to play this ordinary good guy. But Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, and Jude Law all shined gorgeously with glittering star aura.

Can long distance romances really work?,"Film Review: The HolidayCast: Jude Law; Eli Wallach, Cameron Diaz; Kate Winslet and Jack BlackCan long distance relationships really work?The Holiday is the feel good 'chick flick' of the season. It boasts an impressive cast and a universal theme which transcends international boundaries.The film is more than a mere soppy love story however. It is an insight into the sometimes endearing, sometimes tumultuous, yet always pertinent question of true love and reality combined.When a successful American businesswoman decides to take time out from a difficult relationship, she searches the internet for exotic vacation hotspots.By chance she happens to find a small, homely cottage in England. The two women, both enduring difficulties with their love lives, decide to do the house swap over the Christmas period.The results are hilarious and heartfelt.Jude Law delivers a polished performance alongside the sultry Cameron Diaz. Kate Winslet pits her acting pedigree against the rather unrefined comedic genius of Jack Black, with surprising results.This is truly an excellent film; two-thumbs up!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic originality from a would-be cliché storyline,"What would at first seem to be a particularly predictable storyline turns out to be a wonderfully written, beautifully told love story. Two women currently unhappy in their own skins decide to temporarily trade lives, or homes at least. Iris (Kate Winslet) escapes the horror of unrequited love and ends up in an enormously plush house in L.A. Amamda (Cameron Diaz), fresh out of an unfaithful relationship finds herself in a cramped little cottage on the outskirts of a small English town. While Iris is immediately impressed with her new surroundings, Amanda needs a little convincing and this comes along in the form of Graham (Jude Law), Iris's brother, in whom Amanda takes an immediate, if very reluctant interest. The story goes on from there to include a mixture of both wonderfully cliché and surprisingly original situations. The dialogue between the characters is brilliantly written and completely believable and the little snippets of movie trivia along the way keep it interesting and fresh. This movie was a delight to encounter and will be a pleasure to watch over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cozy well written and well acted romantic comedy with a twist,"One of the best romantic comedies in last few years. It's extremely well written and avoids becoming a cliché in most scenes. Acting is excellent for the most part, and characters well rounded and likable - that is except for Mr. Black who doesn't feel believable for a second. Casting him made a movie unnecessarily unbalanced. On one side you have sparkles flying sky high (Diaz and Law) and on the other side you get Winslet trying to make up for the poor choice of Black by developing chemistry with sweet old screenplay writer played Wallach. If I get this on DVD - I'll be sure to fast forward most of the parts with Black/Winslet.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Comfort Film,"The Holiday is a top tier ""chick flick"". The four leads in this movie are perfectly cast. Also, they all have the perfect names: Iris, Amanda, Graham and Miles. It might sound stupid, but I think their names add to the story.The setting in England is charming and the house in LA is exciting. The dynamic between the two couples is brilliantly executed. As a movie guy, I loved everything with Iris and Miles. As a father, I loved everything with Graham's daughters. The film is full of clichés (like Cameron Diaz running endlessly at the end), but they all work.The entire scene when Arthur is being recognized for his career is fantastic. Everything in that scene makes me smile: ""Arthur's Theme"" playing, the kiss, the fist pump and smile, every subtle gesture.On top of it all, the score by Hans Zimmer is an underrated gem. I couldn't stop watching it, even after my wife fell asleep. The Holiday is a comfort film at its finest.Best Character: Miles

All three displayed great comic timing.Bonus points for casting Eli Wallach.On a negative note - Cameron Diaz proves once again that her acting talents are fair at best. Her opening scenes with Edward Burns are stiff and not believable, but she grows into the part.

One of the coziest holiday movies,"The Holiday is one of those feel-good movies that just feels like a warm hug. The story of two women swapping homes-one in sunny L. A. and the other in a charming English village-is such a fun setup.Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz are so relatable in their roles, and Jude Law is ridiculously charming (seriously, who wouldn't fall for him?). Jack Black is sweet, too, and brings a lot of heart.Surprisingly enough, the most touching part was Winslet's character ineracting with the elderly screenwriter. Did not expect it to be hitting so hard but they really captured the bittersweet reality of supporting an elder person through finding their way back into what they love to do.The whole movie has this cozy vibe that's perfect for the holidays. It's funny, romantic, and a little cheesy in the best way. I watch it every year, and it never gets old!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It is what it is,"Maybe it's because I watched Jingle All the Way the other day, but I liked this. Sentimental movies, double for Christmas movies probably, package maybe the last fairytale into romance and holiday ""spirit"". The ones that are successful, I find, tend to play into it more. These people don't have communication problems and deep seated psychological issues, they just need a push to tell people how they feel and break a particular pattern.But that's why they're so appealing. Everyone has a pattern that needs breaking and so every character is simultaneously mythic beyond belief and relatable. Coupled with the spirit of the holiday, telling people how you feel and enjoying the company of others, and you have some harmless sentimentality that is divorced from real life and grounded in it, making it an enduring message.Of course it's unbelievable. What genre really is? It's all about messaging and trappings.

Doesn't quite live up to the potential.,"""The Holiday""  B- How can a film that highlights so many great films of the past then sell out all its potential? Because it's one of a plethora of this millennium's romantic comedies, where in Contemporary Movie Land there's always the non-surprising happy ending. In my opinion however, that's a crying (no pun intended) shame.""The Holiday"" tells two separate stories. Two single women, one in England (Kate Winslet) and the other in Los Angeles (Cameron Diaz) decide to swap homes for two weeks in order to heal themselves from their respective recent heartbreaks over the Christmas fortnight. On her first night in her new cottage, Diaz meets the drunken brother of her hostess (Jude Law). Big guess as to what follows. Although Diaz and Law are competent, this entire plot line was contrite, lacking originality and written flatly. Both actors have done better work elsewhere.The interesting story here is Kate's. While driving around in LA, she meets her neighbor (Eli Wallach) pushing his walker, obviously lost. Being the ever-helpful Brit, Kate takes him home, only to discover that he's actually an Oscar-winning writer. The two develop a friendship, and Wallach entertains her with stories of early Hollywood. Winslet soon meets Jack Black, a movie scorer, and the two chastely hit it off. Winslet and Black team up to assist (and at times, push) Wallach into accepting a Writers' Guild honor.This film is filled with artsy, educated people (Black and Diaz are in the film business; Winslet and Law are the bookish set). Sometimes the dialogue is spot-on and unpredictable. At times, I found the film quite charming and entertaining. Unfortunately by the last 10 minutes of the film, the big red Christmas bow becomes apparent.The director and writer of the film is Nancy Meyers, who seems to have developed a chick-flick niche. In addition to this film, her credits also include ""Something's Gotta Give"", both ""Father of the Bride"" films and the completely forgotten ""I Love Trouble"". Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, given the credits of the cast and of Meyers.As they say in ""Casablanca"", ""We'll always have Paris"" (or England, in this case). But sometimes the woman alone on the plane is just better.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Has its share of problems, but is great for a light laugh","I am a sucker for romantic comedies. I have always enjoyed watching them, no matter how cliché-ridden or awful they are. So when The Holiday was announced, I was immediately intrigued. Kate Winslet and Jack Black in a romantic comedy? Cameron Diaz doing a comedy that looked mature, and not raunchy or animated? It spoke to me as something that could have been different. And while it partially was, it still was inherently just as clichéd as romantic comedies always have been.Amanda (Diaz) and Iris (Winslet) are alone for the holidays. Having just gotten over some devastating news regarding the men in their lives, they meet by chance on an online house swapping website. The two instantly bond, and decide to swap their homes, despite Amanda living in Los Angeles and Iris living outside of London. And despite going on vacations to stay away from love, they end up developing romantic relationships anyway.Even without mentioning the Jude Law or Black in the synopsis, I am absolutely certain everyone can tell what is to come when they begin watching the movie. It is very much in tune with being a romantic comedy, and only vaguely pretends to not be at certain points. For some odd reason however, it runs over two hours. It easily could get chopped down a bit (leaving out a lot of the idiosyncratic tendencies of the two women), and would feel a bit tighter than it is (although I did enjoy the little trailer moments that show up from time to time).The story, as ridiculous as the set-up sounds, is sweet and packs in a few really great character moments. Unfortunately, it also adds in a lot of subplots that seem a little random. The entire friendship between Iris and the elderly screenwriter Arthur (Eli Wallach) feels more like filler than anything else. Hell, it does not even make for the entire reason she and Black's character Miles meet in the first place. So as tender and poignant some of the moments between Iris and Arthur are, they feel a bit out of place for what is supposed to be the main focus of her plot line (as convoluted as it is).But even with its problems, Winslet delivers a fine performance. Switching between being totally depressed and as happy as can be, she brings a certain authenticity to her role that is usually completely non-existent in female rom-com leads. Coming from a background of fairly dramatic roles, she truly blossoms as the haplessly confused Iris. The majority of genuine character moments are given by her, and the real likability of the film rests solely with her. I was really absorbed by her moments on screen, and I could only wish that she would make more movies like this (or was the main character in the story).Sadly, the lead is Diaz, and she fares quite badly. Until her and Law's characters are developed beyond the limits of what the trailer shows, she is basically playing a caricature of herself. Not showing any depth or wanton desire to excel in any of these early moments, Diaz just kind of wanders around, seemingly acting as if she was living her day-to-day life. Now, I know I do not know Ms. Diaz personally, but from anything anyone has ever read, seen or heard about her, this would probably be a spot-on re-enactment. Could it be that this role was written so well and so close to Diaz that it is easy to see no difference between her and the character she is playing? Maybe. But if your likability starts off low, I cannot imagine that is the intended reaction.When she finally does come out of her shell and begin to at least look like she is acting, she still does not hold a candle to Winslet. She just does not seem nearly as strong, and is overshadowed in every way by her. Yes, she does give a few intentional laughs and acts adequately, but when paired off against someone with such a more unique and eloquent thespian style, one can truly see how mismatched and ordinary her acting talent is. It is not that she is a bad actor, she just does not seem to have what it takes to overcome the pitfalls of a role like this. If she does not begin picking up soon, I can only imagine that this is going to be the standard film she will be acting in exclusively (like her Charlie's Angels pal Drew Barrymore).The guys fare about the same. Law seems a bit confused for much of the film, not giving his usual intense and charismatic all for this character. Like Diaz, he does rise to the occasion a handful of times, but he just does not seem to be all there. He is the most enigmatic of all of the characters, and it shows in how loose and unconcerned his character is most of the time. Black on the other hand, delivers in spades. I was impressed with his astonishing range in King Kong, and again, he does not disappoint here. He clearly does not have to grasp as far, but his usual zaniness is curbed to a minimum, and it allows for him to really pull off a good performance. This is the stuff of a guy who does not just want to be known just as a bizarre joker.Small turns from Edward Burns and Rufus Sewell come off as a bit forced (especially Sewell), but they add a bit of depth to the movie that is usually missing. Wallach, as random as his plot line is, does great for the limited role that he has.It may not be a monumentally original achievement, but The Holiday is an enjoyable romantic comedy. It is better than most, and is great for a light laugh or two.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Over expectations!,"Today is just one of those days, when you get tired from work and just want to chill a little, with a beer in one hand and remote control in the other. It's been a month or two maybe, since this movie passed on our cinemas, but I was not able to see it on the big screen and here I am - at home playing it on the DVD player. I like Jack Black - this is the reason I got the movie. Like Cameron Diaz, Jude and Kate too, but of all those four, Jack is my favorite and what I was expecting to see was something more like ""The School of Rock"" (2003) or ""Nacho Libre"" (2006) - I wanted something funny to release the Friday work stress. Well... I got something else. ""Different"" is the actual word. I remember I saw the trailer few times months ago, but as I now remember it was little misleading. Jack Black plus Cameron Diaz should be equal to who-knows-what, similar maybe to ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998), I though to myself and that's exactly what I need this Friday night! Today is one week since I work for another company, some more stress as You may guess and I prepared for a little fun. First of all to say - it was not funny. There were some amusing moments, but this movie for me was not funny at all and not a bad one at all either! It just was not ""comedy"", no matter how some label it. Surprisingly for me, this is one of those movies who really could make You think of the world around You and the way we live our lives. This is like ordering a sausage with fries and getting a fine fillet au champignons instead or however some would like to compare it, because in this movie, we see Jack and Cameron in very serious situations. It's not all credit for Jack and Cameron, of course - Jude and Kate did great too, as well as the director and writer did. I almost cried in few moments. It is a long movie - my player stopped at credits at 2h and few minutes, time now is 2:40am but I wanted to write this anyway. As my girlfriend sleeps next to me and I was watching the movie, it really made me thinking and recalling different moments of my life with her. I do not know - maybe I am just too emotional, please tell me Your opinion. Anyway I totally recommend the movie to everyone, really. In brief: story is not bad at all, actor play at the end is great, music is great, great level of originality, make you recall of movies like ""The Cable Guy"" (1996) a little. Great work guys!

Feel good Date flick,"When I saw that this film clocked in at over 2 hours I thought I'd be asleep within an hour, but there was enough going on to keep me awake. Although this is strictly a piece of date-flick fluff it has its enjoyable moments. Jude Law and Kate Winslet are good and Cameron Diaz is, well, cute.

Winslet is terrific with Eli Wallace and Law is great with the two young actresses who play his daughters. It's a shame Black and Diaz learned nothing from watching Eli Wallach perfectly inhabit the aging screenwriter. That being said, I still enjoyed the film and recently watched it again. I suppose I've just become a rank sentimentalist in my old age. There are so many actors who could have greatly improved upon the Black/Diaz roles but the filmmakers chose perceived Box Office over talent. A chronic mistake in Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too much hysterical hyperbole,"I remembered this as a better movie than I found it to be when I rewatched it. What may be my bias away from RomComs and towards RomDrams might have been the filter that lowered my rating. Romantic Comedies seem to root the comedy in hysterical hyperbole and the first 35 minutes of this movie is exactly that (I was not amused) but after those initial scenes there are some great moments of Romantic Drama (which I liked) that finds the core of it's comedy in people confronting the unexpected consequences of their life choices. Jude Law and Kate Winslet bring more rooted performances but I think the hyperbolic tone of the film was a directorial choice, so even they were pushed to the extremes. I also wondered if the roles were cast to highlight stereotypes of Yanks and Brits. Good acting smooths off the harsh angles of stereotypes by filling out the characters, which is what great performers do. Jack Black is always better than I expect him to be. Not a bad movie but more so a fair movie with nice moments. I give this film a 6.8 out of 10. {Holiday RomCom}",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fine movie. Had potential to be better,"My family watches this film around the holidays every few years or so. For a Holdiay movie it's pretty good given that most holiday movies are awful.The beginning of the film is it's weakness. It gets to the fun part of the story way too late. A lot of the exposition material could have gone unexplained or been told in flashback after the two main characters had already exchanged their houses for the holidays. Which is really when the story becomes interesting.Both of the leading laddies are mostly likable and it's interesting to see how the strangers interact in their new lands and to see how all the likable characters end up together as friends in the end.Women are likely to like this film more than men. But it's still a decent movie for guys if you can bear through a few slow cliche chick empowering moments and male character stereotypes. It's nice that both the women do have very different types of disfunctional love lives they're escaping. But like usual for chick flicks ""evil"" men are portrayed a bit too evil and the ""good"" men are a bit too perfect. The heartbroken women are a bit too perfect too to believe they would have such struggles getting a nice guy to like them.Luckily the film has a few moments where they address these issues. And a few of the narrative elements are very entertaining and make-up for errors or nonsense.

A Movie To Come Back For The X-Mas Holidays,"I have been coming back to this movie every year during Christmas and i have no shame in admitting this is my favorite Christmas movie after Home Alone.

But what stood out for me is a Jude Law, a Kate Winslet and a Jack Black u don't get to see very often. Most of the time Jude Law/Kate Winslet are seen in serious characters whereas Jack Black in comedy, but here, Jude Law as a rom-com hero was dream come true.

They both experience breakups and are looking for a change of scenery, so to speak so they communicate on the internet and then go to temporarily live in each other's residences for a couple of weeks. I'll stop there and just say that they as well as Jude Law, Jack Black, and Eli Wallach make this quite charming and there are also some funny scenes that make this go down quite easy.

I could go on about the script being predictable and tired. Indeed most failed movies go back as far as script or storyline calibre; but not as far as the initial premise which, in this case is okay if not a little familiar to Hollywood punters.However the main thing you'll find is you don't care for the plight of the characters because they're badly drawn, do unrealistic things and we see neither enough of their back-story or their relationships developing with each other.I'm a real fan of the cast; top actors such as Law and Winslet, a great comedian in Black and, when well cast, a huge talent in Diaz. I really felt for the actors combined career low-point and hope they will recover.The movie business seems to be driven by money rather than story-telling and in this the movie will no doubt succeed. But there are many examples of strong RomCom scripts so I don't think we should excuse the producers. Meg Ryan or Hugh Grant is practically a seal of approval and then there's Bridget Jones, Forget Paris, If Lucy Fell to name a few.I was laughing in the wrong places, cringing at the (assumed) intended jokes, planning my week in my head during most of it and feeling utterly tortured and cheated out of 2 hours of my life afterwards.Sincerely hoping Meyers doesn't write any more screenplays. Failing that, sincerely hoping no more of Meyers screenplays are made into film. Craig",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A mindless bit of fluff,"Watch this movie when you want to escape from the world. It won't thrill you and you will probably forget it as soon as you turn off the TV. But Jude Law is as beautiful as ever, Kate Winslet takes horrible dialogue and somehow makes it not-so horrible and Jack Black is actually good in this movie. Cameron Diaz - never realized what a truly mediocre actress she is until I saw her in this. But, still, the scenery is lovely and there is not one scene or line of dialogue that will overtax your mind.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Holiday Soufflé,"""The Holiday"" (as the name implies) is that unique animal: the holiday film. You know, the one that comes out a few weeks before Christmas, intended to counter program against all of the serious (read ""depressing"") Oscar contenders. The one that takes not an ounce of concentration to follow, that goes down as smoothly as a cup of hot chocolate, and is as quickly forgotten.Well, there's a time and place for movies like that, and if December isn't exactly that time and place, I don't know where or when is. All I know is that my wife and I ended up at this on opening weekend because our other two choices for new movies were ""Apocalypto"" and ""Blood Diamond."" 'Nuf said.As for the movie? Oh, what's the point. It's too long, the pacing is all over the place, it has some good moments and a lot of flat ones. But the cast is gorgeous, the settings are fun, the conclusion is warm and fuzzy. I could be a Scrooge and say ""bah humbug"" to the whole thing, or I could just sit back and enjoy it for what it is, which is what I did.And let's face it -- no movie with Kate Winslet, a superb actress who makes anything she's in better by virtue of her sheer talent alone -- can be entirely bad (well, except for maybe ""Titanic."")Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday is ideal holiday viewing,"Although a chick flick, this is a movie that will warm your heart. A strong cast lifts it from the mere fluffy romance genre. While Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Cameron Diaz gave expected quality performances, Jack Black was a pleasant surprise in a romantic ensemble. Eli Wallach!! What can I say? At 91 years of age, he very nearly stole the show! From the first minute he was on the screen, I fell hopelessly in love with him. It just shows you that acting skills can get better with time. My husband enjoyed the film too. Usually an action film fan, he got into the swing of it and enjoyed the comedy situations and the very touching moments, that abound in this film.

STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...Wow! I have put watching this movie off for far too long. What a wonderful film with inspired acting and a crowd pleasing story. I found ""The Holiday"" to be charming, heartwarming, and touching.Two women who are both going through a break-up, decide to get away from it all for a couple of weeks and find each other on the internet and swap homes. One going to England to a small cottage and the other to a posh Los Angeles neighborhood and estate. While there, they both rediscover themselves, the will to go beyond their own personal comfort zones and reach out for something new and exciting. Oh yes, and they both also fall in love - real love.I'm not going to write how improbable this is, or how it all just kind of neatly fell together for them ... etc. After watching this movie, who really cares? This is romantic fantasy, and light comedy. It touches on honest emotions we all have experienced at one time or another. It was such a fun movie to watch. You are taken away and you want to laugh and cheer, and in parts, cry. This is movie magic. It's why we go to movies - to drop the cares and concerns of our own worlds and lives and enjoy a couple of vicarious hours of entertaining film making. And this is very good film making. You really care for both main characters and want them to find love again.I loved ""The Holiday"". I just watched it for the first time today and it has already become a very fast favorite.

Feel Good Holiday Rom Com,"Pretty relaxing movie to cozy up to with when the weather gets cold and there's not much else going on. There are a couple different storylines to hold your attention. The Cameron Diaz and Jude Law romance was the more interesting of the two because Diaz's character seemed a bit scattered and unpredictable and you weren't sure which decisions she was going to make in the end. Law's character was equally mysterious to match that.In contrast, the Kate Winslet side of the story feels a bit forced at times. Her romantic pairing in the end feels a bit more out of desperation than finding her true love. But in the end the conclusion bringing the storylines together is nice enough.The side story with the retired movie writer is also a nice feel good addition. Hard not to put a smile on your face there.For those into the rom com scene this is a nice addition to the collection. The musical score by Hans Zimmer, not surprisingly, is perfect. I'm sure I will end up watching it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good and not exactly predictable,"How did it take me so long to see this? When I saw the date, I was afraid I might have already seen it on TV at some point and I delayed watching my recording for several weeks. But it was not familiar.The movie was a little slow to get started and I couldn't imagine liking either one of these women, but they both surprised me. I'm a little more familiar with Cameron Diaz and Amanda managed to be quite likable after being such a spoiled rhymes with witch to start. There's no way this character could have changed so much, and yet she did, and she made her half of the movie work quite nicely along with another fine job by Jude Law. They were so good together and she was never really anything but charming.Kate Winslet was even better. Iris enjoyed the life of a spoiled Hollywood big shot so much, and yet she was kind and helpful, not spoiled. She was in a swimsuit a couple of times. Her relationship with the great Hollywood writer Arthur Abbott was something special. Eli Wallach was excellent. We need more people in that age group playing roles like this. It was nice to see Bill Macy again and the other old guys.Jack Black seemed to be an unlikely choice, if Iris was going to find a new man. He did a good job with his role, and for once he wasn't a crazy frat boy type, which is where he excels. I just didn't think anything was going to result from his platonic relationship with such a hot looking woman. Iris and Amanda's ex? Well, that would have been more likely, but ...Anyway, the half of the movie devoted to Iris doesn't really work as romance. It's something else entirely, but still special.And Black has better taste in music than he usually does. Not all the music in this movie is good, but most of it is. Several great movie themes, some Christmas music, even some Hannukah music. Both female leads have the opportunity to show they love what I consider absolute garbage.I don't want to give away too much, but there are some adorable children and the scenes with the kids and certain adults were very special. Still, kids shouldn't be watching this. Some scenes might be all right, but most of Amanda's scenes are not.England looked great and the cottage and the larger houses looked good.There are the obligatory scenes of exes trying to make up with those they wronged. Can the relationships be fixed? Do you even want them to be?I will say we get one ending we want, at least with the potential to be happy.This isn't your everyday Christmas rom-com. It's something different if you want that.",,Anonymous,Romance
not too bad - funny and cute,"I actually did like this movie, more than I thought I would.... However, I didn't care for Cameron Diaz in this film. In fact, her acting made me want laugh at times - but I think that Jude's character (exceptionally sexy) made her scenes bearable. Kate was absolutely the star of the show here. Her skill as an incredible actress, along with her more mature story lines (that's right, she had more than one) made the movie's LONG run time a delight to sit through. Kate, Jack, and Jude are wonderful...Ms. Diaz really stood out - not in a good way...all in all a nice film to see with your girlfriends, after a breakup or even by yourself to have Kate remind you of the relationship mistakes we ALL make!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well written and well made romance film that although sometimes forces its humour, definitely holds out.","Despite being another 'rom-com', I got the feeling The Holiday didn't need to go down such a route in order to prove itself. It's a typical, all star cast, character relations drama that relies on easy humour thanks mainly to the fact Jack Black is in it but also allows a group of four characters in two different countries to bond in a satisfactory and sometimes meaningful manner.What The Holiday does to try and draw you in is that it sets up two women called Amanda (Diaz) and Iris (Winslet) in two very different situations. One is just coming out of a relationship after their boyfriend Ethan (An unfortunately underused Edward Burns) had an affair with his secretary and the other is coming to terms with a long time love, who never quite returned the same feelings, that is getting married - one woman is American and the other is British; so this gives at least the ladies of the audience two people to latch onto and relate to; pick your situation that you might have found yourself in and let it enthral you. For me, I related to Iris more but for reasons more to do with the fact I found her to be far more tolerable than Amanda.Regarding what I said in the opening paragraph, I feel the film didn't need to use some of the humour it did. I respect the fact that Amanda is working in the film trailer business but to have her life's situation narrated to her and more frustratingly; to us, on more than one occasion was tiresome and just stuck out in what was otherwise quite a charming and funny film. Twinned with this, most of the humour that revolved around Amanda wasn't that good and just felt gimmicky. These also include things like the whole 'trying to cry' scenario and the 'funny' online conversation she has with Iris, especially the way she gushes at the fact there are 'zilch' men in and around the area she lives yet contradicts herself a few hours into the visit.Onto the men of the film and Jude Law's Graham and Jack Black's Miles provide the intended laughs and love interest. Needless to say; both do well as both are so different when compared to one another and of course since we know them as actors, both have done very different films in the past to one another. Graham's introduction comes first and basically consists of him stumbling into a male wet dream. He knocks on the door expecting to see his sister let him stay the night after some heavy drinking but instead finds a blonde American woman who asks him to bed within about five minutes. So there he is: in a remote English cottage with heavy snowfall outside and all around him whilst a girl he barely knows comes onto him  although a complete contradiction of what we thought Amanda's character was, it still acted as a humorous introduction to Graham's character and he handled the situation well.What scrap of extreme credibility The Holiday does have comes in the form of Arthur; played by Eli Wallach, an old film writer from the classical Hollywood period. He not only acts as the anchor in terms of respectability but also manages to analyse the film as it happens. 'You're the star', he tells Iris regarding her lost love situation and I had to agree since Amanda was becoming too much of a cartoon. Each woman's story is cut back and forth to in a very pleasing and satisfying manner, not to mention well paced as certain events and twists become apparent. Iris' friendship with Arthur and Miles' own heartache as even they grow closer works well since we are lead to care for these people prior to the final third through good film-making. Even tiny things such as the scene involving Amanda, Graham and the 'other person at Graham's house' work well and are highly effective since it's near the end and we care.Although not normally one to recommend nor commend films like this, I found The Holiday rather enjoyable even if it had a few things I didn't like but it's possible to ignore these things as other themes and conventions work with other character to create something much more memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A chilled romantic story to enjoy, but no depth to it","I really enjoyed watching The Holiday. It had the right amount of Christmas cheese, light hearted comedy, and something to chill out to.But if like me, you notice every little detail and read into every conversation and situation like your life depends on it, then this is isn't the movie for you.Jack Black was the wrong fit for this movie. He just doesn't really fit in, and his desperate attempt to appear gentle and loving came off as creepy and deranged.His obsession with movie scores did my head in all the way through the movie.The rest of the cast were bearable! Arthur was just adorable, and he was the stitch that kept it together. He was my favourite, I wanted his back story more than anyone else.To keep things brief, these were my bugbears: Amanda slept with a stranger, and so did Graham in his sisters bed! Iris' overreaction to her non-boyfriend getting engaged. ""I hate my horrible life??"" Oh come on!! She needed a break from it all-woe is me!! Leave the dog with someone you don't know, it's all good!! Scoff! You never see the poor dog ever again after Amanda changes her mind at the airport.It just felt like too many ingredients in the pot to mash together in 90mins.I'll still sit and watch it, but will never get past the annoyances, plot holes, and jack black!!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Delightful romantic masterpiece,"Writer-director Nancy Myers has created a modern masterpiece in the delightful romance The Holiday. Not only are there extremely likable characters, a storyline that belongs in a fairytale book, fun and fitting music, great performances, and relationships that make us believe in love again, but it takes place at Christmastime! Everything's better at Christmas—how many terrible movies have we all sat through just because they take place in December?—and you can now add a modern classic to your box of black-and-white films you watch every holiday season.Kate Winslet opens the film with a poignant narration about the different types of love, and a montage overlay introduces us to all the characters in the film. Then we see Kate at her office Christmas party, pining away for her former lover, Rufus Sewell. If there's a woman in the audience who doesn't swallow a lump in her throat inspired by their rapport together, that woman should turn off the film and only resume it after she's had her heart broken. The dialogue is so realistic it's painful, and Kate's expressions are absolutely perfect.Next, we meet Cameron Diaz, who's having a terrible fight with her boyfriend, Edward Burns. It's a wonderful introduction to her character as well, because even though she appears to be tough and not as sensitive as Kate Winslet, we see subtleties that indicate she has deep feelings in her she's been repressing for a long time.Without describing every single scene—which I could absolutely do, since I've seen this movie close to a hundred times—I'll get to the main plot. Kate and Cameron swap houses for the Christmas holiday, taking spontaneous vacations from their lives and getting a second chance when they need it the most. Kate is awed by Los Angeles and the sunshine, and she meets new friends Eli Wallach and Jack Black, both in the film industry. Cameron is a little frustrated by the snow and English countryside, but when Jude Law turns up on her doorstep—literally—she remembers what vacations are for.One remarkable thing about this movie is it manages to take three actors, whom I normally dislike so much so that I try to avoid their movies, and completely change my mind about them. With the exception of the film Carnage, which I hadn't seen until years later, I've usually found Kate Winslet's acting style irritating. At the time of its release, The Holiday was the best acting she'd ever done. She's the heart of the movie, and through her moving performance, women everywhere will believe they'll survive after their heart's been broken. I'm the first to admit that my animosity towards Cameron Diaz had everything to do with her similarity to a rival in high school, but when I watched The Holiday, I completely forgot about the teenager who tried to steal my sweetheart. Cameron shows off her acting chops in this film, and as her character grows, she helps the audience vicariously grow. Jude Law, while normally drawn to upsetting roles, plays a character who should have been named ""Every Woman's Fantasy."" Everything you ever wanted in a man, but deep down know you'll never get, is represented by Jude in this film. If you don't develop a massive crush on him, you must have very bad taste. Plus, he's very believable when he speaks his unbelievable lines, which is a testament to his acting.I've always liked Jack Black, so while The Holiday didn't change my mind about him, it did show me another side to his acting. He's extremely convincing as an L.A. Hollywood type, and the mixture of his confidence and uncertainty adds another layer to his character. Eli Wallach, at ninety years old, still has a wonderful screen presence. His scenes are some of the most touching, and the film wouldn't be the same without him.The dual-settings of the film provide an ideal Christmas for everyone in the audience, so whether you like the sun or the snow, you'll be happy. Hans Zimmer's music, to quote Jack Black in the film, is ""very unexpected"", and it adds to the delight of the film, making it clear that someone should snatch up the rights and turn this into a Broadway musical! I absolutely love every part of this movie. It's funny, charming, sad, realistic, inspiring, heartwarming, and irresistible. It's simply wonderful, no matter what time of year you watch it.DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, there's one tiny part of the movie in which the camera spins in a circle. After Jack Black and Kate Winslet sing ""Arthur is a doodle-y-doo"" on the piano, look away for about ten seconds. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why isn't there a '0-10' button on this thing?,"Since seeing this dreadful heap of muck last night as a favour to a young relative I have racked my brains for a reason this garbage was made. Thanks to IMDb I now know why: there are clearly enough utterly and completely stupid people in the world to make it some money. But: shame on all of you IMDb users who have boosted The Holiday right here: shame on you for being lame brained, feckless and dim. This movie is less intelligent than a Lassie movie, and I tell you this: far less entertaining.The word 'money' has also been revolving around my brain, as in this sentence: 'Why did these stars do it? They don't need the money, surely?' What in the name of all that is an actress with the talent of Kate Winslet (who I last saw in Extras, for goodness sake)doing in this dog-muck? And Jude Law also? Their careers deserve a couple of years of freefall after this. And Jack Black? The magnificent tyro of School of Rock? Your cred is in the shredder, baby (Mind you, he did, come to think of it, at times look embarrassed, so perhaps there is hope for him after all). Did someone threaten to kill their parents or children if they didn't do it? It must be that or something like that: there is no other rational explanation.I was in physical pain whilst watching it in Chesterfield last evening. If the extraordinary cynicism of its religious adherence to every immoral and unethical strand of formula-Hollywood drek in here isn't bad enough: if the fact that the script that could have been written by a 12 year old dewy-eyed girl weaned and educated on every piece of schlock Disney every produced, or some kind of parodist with nothing better to do, but was apparently written by an adult isn't bad enough; if the torrent of clichés isn't bad enough - including the intensely vomit-inducing, utterly laughable inclusion of olde-tyme Golden Age of Hollywood writer winning a lifetime achievement award scene - AND CAN I TELL ANY American READING THIS THAT IT HASN'T SNOWED IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY BEFORE AND AROUND Christmas FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS?; if the complete lack of verisimilitude to real life, like the fact that women of thirty-odd don't make love in bra-tops, isn't bad enough; if the fact that Jude Law's character begins as a woman-a-night beer-slugging rogue then by half way becomes a winsomely sincere widowed single Dad who adores his two girls (and one is called 'Miffy' in real life: for God's sake, what next?!)isn't bad enough; if the fact that Cameron Diaz's 'performance' was the most embarrassing I've ever seen isn't bad enough; if the woolly mammoth-esquire touch of the miserable, shoddy direction isn't bad enough; if the fact that the studio thinks this pathetic nonsense is so good they let it stretch on for over two hours isn't bad enough, then the fact that these film-makers actually gave this evil monster of a movie pretensions to intelligence and relationship-profundity most certainly is.I was going to say that The Holiday is an insult to anyone who ever went to school and earned a single GCSE pass or a 25-metre swimming certificate, until I logged on here and found that people presumably over the age of 12 actually liked it. Tell me again: you actually liked this film?And to pass off Cary Grant as coming from Surrey - ""I know!"" pipes Kate, ecstatically when the old geezer tells her this - is mind-numbing is what is tells us about the attitude of studio producers (and for good measure, this director and screenplay writer)to all of us: factual accuracy in movies: ""Forget it, it doesn't matter, because you numbskulls, chuckleheads, mimbos and bimbos chewing popcorn and sucking down Coke won't notice and don't matter."" For the record, just in case no-one else has mentioned it in this review section - and do forgive me for not reading every single one because to me, suicide is immoral - Cary Grant was brought up (or 'raised' for you USA'ers) in Bristol, which is a port in Gloucestershire, which is in the west of England and therefore, nowhere near bloody Surrey.So The Holiday takes its place in my pantheon of the absolute and utter crap where it joins Orlando, The Piano and Cronenberg's Crash. It makes for a very strange bedfellow. I suppose this proves that if there's one thing worse than a supposedly intelligent art-house movie that stinks the place out from sheer badness and pretentiousness, it's a movie which by all that is sacred should be presented as being as dumb as it looks and which doesn't so much insult the intelligence and good nature of the audience as trample up and down on it with hobnail boots with sharp nails sticking out of the sole, pointy end down.I came home, switched on the TV and watched an hour of House. All, thankfully, is not lost. Yet.PS Since more and more people have logged on to the website to sing the praises - supposedly - of this film, I have become completely convinced that all of them, especially the one's saying, 'Phew, thank Heaven for romance', are kidding. No one intelligent enough to press the 'On' button on a computer can possibly like this movie: it is, simply, the worst movie ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I try to resist and it just keeps pulling me back in,"One of the most pretentious things one can be is a movie snob, someone who can't take a movie just as fluff. now sometimes, i do believe i fall into that category. my friends will start ooing and ahhing over the latest chick flick. i'll scoff and groan with exasperation, thinking i'm better than that sort of rubbish. yeah not so much. i just finished watching this movie, and it took me down a peg or two. sometimes all you need is a little fluff to make you smile. this movie made me smile. i liked all of the characters, fell in love with Jude law and his eyes, and i must admit, i might have developed a slight crush on jack black. the character Arthur was absolutely wonderful. it made me glad that some people in Hollywood haven't forgotten where they came from and that films weren't always like they are today. moving along, if you just give yourself a little fluff, you'll be left with an excellent feeling, and this is the fluff to do it with (please excuse my horrible closing line)",,Anonymous,Romance
So likeable,"With Nancy Myers' films, you know that everything will be fine in the end. Sometimes I need such trivial stories and I don't care how believable they are. Especially when Kate Winslet shows up, I feel good right away because I think she's one of the top 5 actresses of the last 20 years. She plays her role in a correspondingly differentiated way, sometimes with a little too much verve, whereas Cameron Diaz falls down considerably, even if she is so likeable that you quickly forgive her for it. In addition to Jack Black's renewed attempt to play a serious role without any antics - which he once again fails to do - Jude Law makes for a clear 2:0 in the Brits versus Yanks comparison. He plays the mischievous father of two adorable little girls so charmingly that you can't help but be thrilled by his first appearance. So Nancy Myers - with a few clever cameo appearances - doesn't light a comedy fire, but a thoroughly likeable story with lots of artificial snow and an Eli Wallach in a great supporting role that goes straight to the heart. All's well that ends well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a Holiday!,"Absolutely adorable! Like any romantic comedy, it was anything but realistic. However, it just leaves you feeling happy, no matter what. And as Iris (Kate Winslet) said: ""anything could happen."" As for the cast, what an ensemble that is! How could anyone possibly miss a movie in which Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black and Rufus Sewell star?! They were all exceptionally funny and beautiful, especially the great Kate Winslet (this woman never ceases to dazzle me). Even Cameron Diaz (I've never been a fan myself) struck me as wackily cute. I think Nancy Meyers did a great job there. If you want to see this one, you'll have to drop down your defenses, stop comparing, and just let the good feeling flow in.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow,"When I first saw the cover of this movie I thought to myself, why oh why must we see another romantic movie? But, when I saw the actors, I couldn't help but think, ""This is going to be interesting."" And it was! Very!This movie shows a new side to some actors, especially Jack Black. This movie shows the range that he can act in. I was not impressed, I was stunned. Jude Law also gives a wonderful, emotional, acting that shows he is one of the best male actors to date.For Cameron Diaz, this movie didn't really take much. For the acting in this movie is similar to some of the older films she has done, her character does not change much, at least not until the end of the film. As for Kate Winslet, this is probably the first time I have seen her play who she really is. A British girl. I liked the change and I liked seeing her like this.To anyone who wants to watch a comedy, with good acting, I highly recommend this one. I will also point out that the movie was specifically written for these 4 actors. This is a movie about finding love in the strangest, yet not unbelievable circumstances.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fun and charming movie...,"This was a fun, charming movie about 2 women who swap houses to get away from their lives/problems. Both meet new people, have new experiences, and learn some things about themselves. My husband even admitted to enjoying it, and he normally hates anything that could be called a ""chick flick"".Unfortunately, a major stumbling block to one couple's happiness is simply unresolved and ignored at the end of the movie. A few well-chosen lines of dialog could have remedied this, but it simply wasn't there. Had the movie been given an actual ending, instead of just stopping when it hit the 2-hour mark, it would have been worth 8 stars...maybe even 8 1/2 or 9.....",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The first of a genre,"Over the intervening years since 2006, there have been a number of ""house swap"" movies on Hallmark, and probably some other places. This was the first one we saw, and one of the two best. Hallmark's ""Trading Christmas"" is also wonderful.The difference between those two movies and the rest is the quality of the cast. ""The Holiday"" has established, good film actors. ""Trading Christmas"" has established, good TV actors. The rest have Hallmark's revolving casts, many of whom we like, but frankly, they don't often display the depth of movies like this.This movie is funny and moving.

"It looks like a fairy tale, but still very sweet","First of all I would like to say something to Nancy Meyers, allow me: your are the goddess of the comedy/romance genre, your movies has that very particular romantic feeling that makes me want to take of this earth and fly away to be with the characters of your movies.The story of The Holiday looks like a fairy tale, love failures and home exchanging at the same time, it is a serendipity, then comes the unpredictable; the unseen love in the most unexpected sweetest way, imagine two lovers falling in love quickly and madly, but they are facing a separation, there is no need to scream and cry, all they need is a little bit of sense, reasonably they decided to meet soon or stay together for the sake of their newly born love, that is exactly what happened in the movie, and that is exactly what I loved about it.About the acting a liked Kate Winslet, she was so beautiful and painfully funny, Jude was so handsome and Cameron was so sexy, but the surprise package was Jack Black, he proved me that he is a really good actor, and the presence of Eli Wallach; which I think was a brilliant idea; was a very refreshing thing, by the way he is still in a good shape.Like I said it looks like a very impossible fairy tale, but still sweet like no other and funny as hell, really good stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday,"A story that would probably never actually happen unless you lived a fairytale life, idealistic locations perfectly capturing the little country house in England and the mansion in L.A. complete with swimming pool, and an ending you could predict within the first twenty minutes...usually I would not have chosen to see this, however there are times when you want to watch something that is heart warming, makes you smile, shows Christmas as you imagine it to be (the miserable rain that now characterizes England replaced with the perfect crisp winter's day complete with snow), is too idyllic to be true, romantic, funny and easy to watch. This is exactly what ""The Holiday"" offers and is very successful in delivering.The highlights for me of this film were being surprised by Jack Black playing a character completely unlike what I expected, when your preconceptions of him come from seeing Tenacious D and films like School of Rock and Shallow Hal to see him playing quite a sweet, calm yet funny character made a change, and you fell in love with his character almost as much as Jude Law's.There's no need to go into details on this film as it is exactly what you expect. Four well known actors, a cheesy, clichéd story a predictable, unoriginal ending. If you're not into chick flicks then this probably isn't for you. However sometimes films like ""The Holiday"" are exactly what you want to watch, one of those films that makes you warm inside and go away smiling, perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Appalling. . .just. . .simply. . .appalling,"I could write volumes on what is wrong with this movie. However, for the sake of brevity, I will keep it to this:1.) Cameron Diaz is the personification of nails on a chalkboard in this movie.2.) The musical score (if it should even be called that) is pathetic, cloying and wantonly manipulative, which really could describe most of the movie in general, too.3.) Those who can act are given such tripe for dialogue that I was embarrassed for them--painfully so: I had to literally pull my coat over my eyes during the worst scenes.And last but perhaps most telling:4.)

The PERFECT way to celebrate the new year,"Ladies, listen up! What do you do when a boy that you really, really like breaks your heart? Cry? Stuff your face with chocolates? Stick a picture of your ex and throw darts on their picture? Well, not for Iris and Amanda. Both trying to get away from their everyday life, they go on holiday to forget about everything... especially men. But can they really run away from men, while on holiday?Two women, who are quite unlucky in love, decide that they want to get away from their every day life. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is a workaholic who breaks up with her boyfriend because he cheats on her. Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is in love with a man, who will never love her back. Because he is engaged to someone else. So, what can they do? Both decided to swap houses, cars, etc and just get away from the hectic lives they are living. But as fate has it, Iris slowly falls for Miles (Jack Black), who is going through a heartbreak himself and it is the case of 'love at first sight', for Amanda, when she meets Graham (Jude Law). This romantic roller coaster is a world-wind adventure of finding the right person for you. And never giving up on love.A feel-good romantic comedy for all women. And the best bit? Director, Nancy Meyers challenges the fact that romantic comedies are only for girls... boys can watch this film too as it doesn't have the classic conventions of a romantic comedy, which men will be relieved to know. The character of Iris has the best actress playing her. Kate Winslet's comedic timing is perfect, as is Cameron Diaz, who plays Amanda. In my opinion, this film has a very important message for all women out there- not to stop believing in love. Why should they? Just because one relationship fails? Meyers takes into deep consideration that women in our generation are so involved with their work, that they forget about love and tries to show women that there is nothing wrong with 'just looking'. Not forgetting the male leads, Jude Law and Jack Black portrays their characters, Graham and Miles wonderfully and depict the perfect partners for Iris and Amanda. I think that these two men represent the fact that it isn't all about the looks- it's the personalities that Iris and Amanda fall in love with. And I am sure that all women today, will agree with me.I really recommend that all women (and men) watch this film, as you will laugh, cry and really feel for the characters. And people who haven't watched it yet... download it or buy it on DVD. I can guarantee you will not regret having it in your film library. I promise you.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday - Just a romantic dream,"When wrinkles are crawling on Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet's canthuses and Jude Law's hair is going to be like ""mediterranean sea"", it all proves that I'm not used to the Hollywood's romantic comedies anymore. Maybe because I'm reaching an age that can have some immunity to these cliché love story.This movie has a dream cast, although I think Kate and Jack are not quite match, Kate is goddess but Jack is always a typical clown in despite of he is quite charming in this film. But anyway his part is not that big so I can endure it.Still this is a typical Nancy Meyers's movie, I love ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""What Women Want"", but this one is not as good as these two. The sparkle between main roles are not that amazing, and the plot line is all Nancy's wishful thinking, maybe romantic but no resonance here. Just for a holiday reason.Two women's exchange of their apartment, to taste different lifestyle and leave all the trouble behind. Great idea, I often dream about that. And meet some different persons there, have some fun, then turn back to the normal track, face the trouble and maybe it will not be trouble anymore.Kate and Cameron are very suitable for their roles, and it's a new attempt for Kate because she has little experience in this genre, she did a decent job, a lovable ""Bridget Jones"", but far from excellent, she needs more practice. As for Cameron, she is on her way down now, losing her star-power day by day, the once highest-paid actress, does need a strong film to prove her ability, but not by this one. Her next project is Shrek 3 and no other new films. Quite an embarrassment for her.Love the cameo of Dustin Hoffman and Lindsay Lohan + James Franco's imaginary movie trailer, interesting!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance didn't die,"I watched ""The Holiday"" mostly because I am interested to know what Nancy Meyers wants to say in this new movie. I was impressed by her previous ""something's gotta give"". To be honest, this new movie doesn't super it, yet with my favorite young actors, it is totally worth watching.Basically you can know everything about the movie by the trailer, yet the message from the writer was finally delivered by winslet, in my opinion. Cameron is lovely in the movie as usual, yet I love her ""in her shoes"" better. Jude is fine, but I didn't see anywhere that he can stand out. He just did well, but didn't surprise me. Jack black did much better than that I expected. What can I say? I don't like someone like him to appear in a romantic movie, yet I think it is him that makes this movie lovely, also Eli Wallach, he was great too.But Nancy Meyers didn't solve the problem when romance meets the reality. I was expecting that she could develop more in the meaning of life and love, yet this one doesn't help at all. It's a fairy tale that you can't see its back coz it's such a fragile dream.But anyway, if you want to just have a romantic dream, want to relax, or you always fall in love with wrong persons, go to watch this movie. You might learn a little.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I do feel at home watching this movie. Love Kate Winslet's acting, she is for me, the young version of Meryl Streep. Cameron can be good playing dramatic scenes as well as comic and funny.

It's is a fairly original idea about 2 potential couples finding their way after various levels of emotional trauma. It has some nice moments and Kate Winslet steals the show.Despite the good elements, one cannot get away from the fact that Jack Black is miscast and Cameron Diaz is utterly hopeless. Watching her flit aimlessly about the screen followed by a string Kate Winslet is like j and cheese.And the story feels schmatzly and contrived at points descending into too much of a cliche.

Better than expected,"When I visited the MultiPlex, the choice was between ""The Good Shephard"" and ""The Holiday"". I went w/my wife, I let her chose since the last few times I picked, she snoozed.Anyhow, ""The Holiday"" was clearly a cut above the ordinary romantic comedy fare. First, Cameron Diaz was simply luminous. Obviously, I've seen her many times before but for some reason, for the first time (at least to me) she appeared to be truly beautiful. But the real surprise was the natural performance of Jude Law. At first, I thought he was simply a reprise of his prior roles. But then, all of the sudden, he started to hit some disarmingly true notes, like when we are introduced to his children and then when he admits that he has fallen for Diaz.The other out of the ordinary aspect was the Eli Wallach character. While he may at first blush appear to be out of his element, he brings in an unexpected storyline about the ""old"" Hollywood and connects with Kate Winslet character in a very touching way.I would also be remiss if I failed to mention that Ms. Winslet turns in another fine performance but I guess at this point, that is to be expected and therefore, sometimes overlooked.All in all, a pleasant surprise which I rate a 7 and I am an extremely harsh rater, almost never doling out a 10 or even a 9.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing and Bland,"The Holiday is a sad excuse for a romantic comedy, with very little romance and even less comedy.The main plot of the movie revolves around Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz's characters switching homes for the holiday, allowing each to meet their obvious love interests. The predictable plot would be far less painful if the actresses were given something to work with in the script. Sadly, the dialog is clunky and without wit, and while Winslett struggles to rise above the material, Diaz flounders. By the middle of the movie, her scenes are painful to watch, and one can only hope that the scene switches back to Winslet's character, whose scenes with the elderly screenwriter are genuine and sweet.The men exist only as romantic foils, and Jude Law plays this part well, managing to exude some charm and playing believably off of Diaz, despite their lack of chemistry. Jack Black, on the other hand, probably shouldn't have even bothered with this movie at all. His comedic lines are generally unfunny, and as a romantic partner, he is given essentially nothing to do. If you were hoping to see Jack Black branch out as a romantic lead, don't bother with The Holiday.In the end, The Holiday doesn't earn the title of romantic comedy, and ends up being another piece of cliché chick flick fluff. Lovers of the genre would be better off renting Love Actually, French Kiss, or His Girl Friday for their holiday entertainment.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A light, feel good rom-com...perfect for a girly night in!","The Holiday = Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, Kate Winslet, and Jude Law. A chocolatey and heartwarming romantic comedy, you will love it. I know I did.One thing I found about this movie is that is it very realistic. The situations are something people would experience in everyday life, though I disagree with the house-exchange part. There isn't much of a chance that most people would go for house exchange in a day (unless they were either drunk, high, or just stupid)Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is the owner of a big company in L.A., that produces and makes film trailers. Living in a great house, with a great career, and a great guy in her life, Amanda's life seems perfect. But not exactly. Iris (Kate Winslet) is an absent-minded, but lovable, young journalist, lives in a small but cosy cottage in Surrey, and finds out the man she has been so in love with for 3 years has no interest in her. After both Amanda and Iris' relationships crumble, they are left with a sheer sense of heartbreak and decide a Christmas holiday is vital. They meet over the internet and decide to go for a house exchange, swapping homes, cars and everything. In a flash, Iris is in L.A., and Amanda is in England. It doesn't take long before Amanda meets the dishy Graham (Jude Law), an attractive man with a charming smile and a slightly dark past, and Iris bumps into the jovial Miles (Jack Black), a gentle, music-lover with a cute smile. But...what happens now.Kate Winslet was very likable in her role, and exuded a charm which endeared her to the audience very much. The gentle nature and innocent charm brought her to you. Cameron Diaz was also very likable, though not in the same way that Kate managed it, but again her character was a lot different than Kate Winslet's. But Miss Diaz certainly showed she has skill. I enjoyed her performance. Jack Black was cute and funny but he seemed a little off. I don't know if it is me, but I don't think rom-com is his genre. I prefer in the all out comedy scene. Jude Law impressed me, and the charming, suave performance I'm sure will get all women weak in their knees. I mean, good looks, a strangely sexy British accent, and a great performance with a soppy smile. He IS Graham Simpkin. Eli Wallach is lovely in the small role that he plays as the elderly Arthur.One of the best things about The Holiday is that each character seems to have a great chemistry with one another. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law just flowed without stopping, it was very sweet. And Jack Black and Kate Winslet also seemed to have a connection, this made each relationship very real and likable.A very enjoyable movie. Forget the haters, The Holiday rocks.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Nancy Meyers, like her or not, once again portrays these women who, despite all their achievements, place enormous importance on love","One of the most abused genres of commercial cinema, romantic comedies invariably end up looking all the same, and for a very simple reason: they follow old formulas as if they were enshrined in already dusty primers, leaving aside any and all opportunities for change or originality. It's always the poster couple meeting, falling in love, breaking up, and getting back together again at the end. What changes are the actors and the sets, and not much else. This time, the situation is not much different. What serves to attract - and justify - the attention of the most unsuspecting spectator is the talent of the protagonists, all of whom are very comfortable in the scene, seeming to be enjoying themselves as much as the characters they strive to defend. The result, therefore, turns out to be a little above average.The plot tells the story of two women who, after a decision, will have their lives transformed. Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) writes a well-known marriage column in London's Daily Telegraph. She is in love with Jasper (Rufus Sewell), from her work, but soon finds out that he is about to marry someone else. In Los Angeles, we meet Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz), owner of a thriving advertising agency specializing in the production of movie trailers. After discovering that her boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) has not been faithful, Amanda finds a website specializing in home exchange. Seeing an opportunity to go far away to forget her love problems, she and Iris get in touch and arrange to exchange their homes, with Iris going to Amanda's luxurious home, and Amanda going to Iris's cabin in the English countryside. Soon the change will reflect in the love life of both. Iris meets a neighbor, Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), a man who was a very important screenwriter in Hollywood, and a composer of soundtracks, Miles (Jack Black), who is involved in a relationship destined to fail and who will be interested in Iris. Amanda becomes involved with Graham (Jude Law), Iris' brother.With this third feature, Nancy Meyers matures an issue already explored in ""What Women Want"" and ""Something's Gotta Give"": the lack of love in the lives of women well resolved in their professional lives. This search can often be synonymous with dependence, with contradictory and subjugating postures, as the meeting of the ""ideal"" pair is configured as a true salvation. By making this dependence visible and caricatured, she exposes a dilemma that, if it does not cover most women, at least touches on some of the questions experienced and thought by the person who writes to you: why do we put so much energy into a romantic ideal of happiness in which love is the main source? And, that's quite a dilemma: accepting the role of love in a woman's life, being one of several things to be conquered.What could be a kind of anti-feminism - why do these strong and productive women need a man so much? - points to a very interesting dilemma, if seen from another perspective. After all, if a woman only feels complete when next to a man it can be a sign of deplorable submission, the fact is that, despite so many achievements, women are still immersed in a deep romanticism - in fact strongly influenced by Hollywood films. Of course, in principle, there is already a caveat: which women and what kind of experience are we talking about? It is not a rule, it is not a question of considering that we will only have existence in front of the man who loves us, but of identifying a romantic ideal, very influenced by cinema, that surrounds our imagination. But, if this is certainly an extremely relative topic, if we stick to Nancy Meyers' women, they are totally consumed by the preoccupation with love and what it has in store for the cinema.Right at the beginning of the feature, you can see the style of Nancy Meyers for those who already know some other work by the director. The way to conduct the comedy in a more ""mature"" way is an asset that she demonstrates again in this film. In this way, the story ends up becoming closer to real life and more attractive to the viewer. Iris and Amanda show themselves, albeit in a somewhat exaggerated way, perfectly plausible characters to exist and, so to speak, charismatic. The dialogues of the feature also form a point to be commented, with good lines about love, although sometimes they can seem a little sugary for the less sentimental audience.The cast, formed by actors with a certain support, seems perfectly synchronized and with a chemistry that seems to work very well. In the role of Amanda, we have Cameron Diaz, who demonstrates to be comfortable in the character. Kate Winslet, more beautiful than ever, lives the passionate Iris, without falling into a stereotype. Jude Law, who has proven himself to be one of the most talented actors of his generation, proves again his versatility by playing Iris' sensitive brother Graham, who is torn between the tasks of a widowed father and a single man, and Jack Black completes the group of protagonists like Miles, a composer of soundtracks who also experiences some love conflicts in particular. The real surprise is when the charming girls Sophie (Miffy Englefield) and Olivia (Emma Pritchard) enter the scene, starring with Graham and Amanda in fun, sensitive and touching scenes, with special emphasis on the scene in which everyone is gathered under the tent set up in the girl's room.Nancy Meyers vaguely shows differences in the way of life, and at first she in fact shows well the fascination of Iris when she arrived at the mansion in the United States, living with all that technology and comfort that she now had at her disposal, while Amanda who has to brew her own coffee, and squeeze into Iris's little cabin. Evidently the film shows the differences in location and creates good moments. The parallel montage of the two women in their temporary homes helps the film's pacing, making the pacing never slow. And even showing the cultural and purchasing power differences between the two, Meyers prefers to bet on the similarity between the two from the beginning: having broken hearts, the two seek and find each other.Aside from this influence of cinema as a symbolic-psychological correlate, Meyers is well aware of the codes that govern a romantic comedy. Therefore, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is fundamental, and the direction is very attentive to the exchange of looks as a crucial point of romantic comedies (also exposed by screenwriter Arthur), that moment when two strangers find themselves in love. Here the great work with the actors is latent, with the exception of Cameron Diaz (who doesn't give nuances to his somewhat neurotic character), perform this exchange of glances in a wonderful way. The dialogues are also accurate in the portrayal of love mishaps, in addition to being often funny, such as the caricature scene of the two women crying (which seems to come with the rubric ""Dedicated to women"").The metalanguage is also present in the film through the character of Jack Black and the veteran Eli Wallach, who plays a former Hollywood screenwriter. In several scenes where they are present, they make reference to great titles of the present and past. The artifice used with the character of Cameron Diaz also becomes something quite interesting: since Amanda is a film trailer producer, we constantly hear that classic voice that narrates the trailers talking about the situations that the character is living. This approach is very interesting.The clichés and idealizations abound, of course, but without them the romantic comedy would lose its raison d'etre. Narratives about love always bring a bit of chance and the cinematic magic of the encounter. After all, who hasn't dreamed of the arrival of their great love entering a bar in a totally cinematic way? Or a hit-and-run that would reveal your ideal match? Or a camera panning around the couple on their first kiss? As a female-centric director, Nancy Meyers, like her or not, once again portrays these women who, despite all their achievements, place enormous importance on love.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A very sweet and charming film, I loved it!","My girlfriend and I just saw The Holiday this afternoon on it's opening day and I have to say that honestly, I really did like The Holiday. It was a nice breath of fresh air for an all together feel good movie for the season. I think because in one way or another we can relate to the characters and their love lives, because they each had different situations. Like Cameron couldn't commit, Jude had a hard time opening up to his real life, Kate couldn't get out of love with someone who wasn't treating her right, and Jack was falling in love with the wrong women. This movie was a very special treat for the holidays.Iris and Amanda are two women who have just been horribly bashed around in relationships and need to get away for a while. Iris lives in Surrey, England, and Amanda lives in L.A. in the states, they look each other up on the internet for a house exchange to get away from their problems for a while and agree to do the arrangement. When both ladies arrive, they are excited and anxious about their new lifestyles and countries, they also both meet each other's brothers and while Grahm, Iris's brother, and Amanda hit it off immediately, it takes Jack's character and Iris a while to realize that it's time to move on from their unhealthy relationships, of course, it's difficult since they live on separate sides of the world from each other.The Holiday may be a bit hokey and cheesy to watch, but for a girl's afternoon, I think this was a great film that was honest and anyone could use for those broken hearts. I would highly recommend The Holiday, it did actually have good acting, a wonderful story, and lovable characters that weren't too over bearing or annoying. Please, don't listen to the critics on this one, it was a very touching and lovely story and I hope it is an honest success at the box office this weekend.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm too much male for this flick ;),"I don't consider myself being a macho male, but chick flicks like The Holiday do drive me to the edge of being very annoyed and agitated. Men just weren't born for sugary romance stories, with a sappy Christmas atmosphere. The characters are annoyingly psycho-analyzing each other and themselves all the time - this movie must be written by a female, no man tells openly about his fear for relationships like Jude Law does at one point- and every character flaw is brought upon us as being cute and adorable. And don't forget the extremely adorable twin sisters, the cuddly dog and the nice old man. But I must be fair, I did enjoy this movie to some degree. It's always a treat to see beautiful actors as Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law interact with each other. Jack Black kinda ticked me off. The guy is hilarious, but in this movie he just didn't fit in. Overall, it is a decent RomCom, one that deserves its place amongst Love Actually and Pretty Woman. I'd favor a more darker approach to the subject of love, but I can also understand why a lot of people like this. Everyone has the right to their taste, don't they? :)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I couldn't believe the main user comment when I read it.The acting, for a start, is very sub par particularly from Cameron Diaz and Jack Black. Kate Winslet does the best she can with the poor script while Jude Law is the same as always! The star of the film by a long way is Eli Wallach, who delivers a top notch performance.There are too many scenes (particularly in the beginning) with just one character (Winslet or Diaz) in it. The actors narrate every single movement they make during these scenes which I found very irritating.The plot is so clichéd its amusing. This is a combination of many other run of the mill Christmas films. The characters are very clichéd, particularly Jude Law. They cram more clichés into Jude Law than I thought possible.I enjoyed 'What Women Want' and expected an awful lot more from this. There is so little comedy in it, it could barely qualify as a romantic comedy. Kate Winslet's character is so so silly, it beggars belief. Please go and see something else instead.

"A good Fairytale...worth watch for Kate, Jude and Hans's performance","A straightforward fairy tale-like story having no surprising moments, predictable screenplay, worth watching for the acting of Kate Winslet, Jude Law and soulful music by Hans Zimmer. Kate Winslet and Jude Law both steal the show and make you feel the emotions the character is feeling. Kate delivers very brilliant performance while portraying a confused girl, struggling with her emotional conflicts. Hans Zimmer created on of the loveliest theme a romantic-comedy film has ever had. Direction is okay. Memorable for Kate and Jude's characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A good holiday romantic comedy for once!,"I usually go to the cinema disappointed with romantic comedies; they are not a genre of film I enjoy because they tend to be lacking in storyline or tend to be a little too cheesy. However, I did enjoy 'The Holiday', a film about two women (one from the UK and one from the USA) with troubled love lives who swap houses. Both women end up improving some aspect in their life and finding romance at the same time. The film has a list of well-known actors and actresses. It's just a happy little romantic comedy for the holiday season and it succeeds where 'Love Actually' fails. The story is a good one, and it's a complex series of stories for each character. The film is filled with surprises, and well - it's a must-see for the holiday, even if you don't care for this genre, you'll be surprised.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable Christmas escapism,"After the year 2020 has been, I caught this on TV and watched it for the umpteenth time. It was just the tonic. Warm, romantic, feelgood and fuzzy, it's just complete escapism from all the crap going on in the world at the moment.
2 women trying to get over bad relationships swap lives over the holiday season leading to unexpected events. All the characters are likeable (okay maybe with the exception of Rufus Sewell's 'Jasper'). I think this is a lovely film that should definitely be on par with the other big British romantic Christmas films (although I find Love Actually grates on me a little these days, whereas this one seems to have aged well). This is the perfect movie to stick on over the holidays when the weather is rubbish outside, or when wrapping presents, or just when you fancy a lazy day on the sofa. Who doesn't like a bit of warm and fuzzy?!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Touching but room for improvement,"I had some time to kill and figured, what the heck, I'll see this to help keep up on what's selling in Hollywood. I was pleasantly surprised on one hand, but there is definitely room for improvement with a little bit of work. This is a perfect example of a story that would have benefited greatly by some scrutiny and revision by professional writers. I could identify with parts of each of the two main characters, played by Kate Winslett and Cameron Diaz. Especially Amanda (maybe because the story focused heavily on her and not so much on the other), how she has an affair (okay one night stand) and wants to make it something serious/permanent. Anyone who's ever been in that situation with someone either in or from a foreign country could probably identify. But I thought parts of the story were weak and some of the direction amateurish. With a little work, it could have really been a very good, much stronger work. But still worth seeing, especially compared to much of the junk that's out there. The pickings are slim.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
As slick as a magazine supplement...and about as profound; nearly saved by Winslet's work,"Nancy Meyers writes knowingly facile scripts, and then attempts to 'cute' them up with show-bizzy chatter and characters who can be described completely by their occupations: Newspaper Writer, Movie Advertising Boss, Book Editor, Film Composer. Meyers plugs in the gaps with nostalgic soundtrack choices and clean, glossy locations. She's living in a storybook. Kate Winslet's opening narration--a deduction of modern romance for the masses--is supposed to ring amusingly true (at least for the females in the audience); but instead, this montage of hit-or-miss romantic snippets is so sterile and Hollywoodized, it looks as though it were created by committee, by a TV group designing a commercial. Comedy about two women, a British writer and a show business denizen of Los Angeles, who switch houses over the Christmas holiday has nary a single joke that resonates with truth. It's about as real as a cartoon, and some of the performances (Cameron Diaz's in particular) are indeed cartoonish. Diaz gave some wonderful performances earlier in her career, but she seems to have lost touch with humanity (she and Meyers are living in the same neighborhood of La-La-Land). Only Kate Winslet's warmth and intrinsic intelligence manages to shine through, but her lovely presence cannot camouflage the fact this is artificial goods: phony, slack, unmoving, witless. *1/2 from ****",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
'The Holiday' is for the romantic fool in all of us,"Formulaic it is, but at the same time, 'The Holiday' manages to be a light-hearted, feel-good rom-com with a really impressive cast. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz are extremely charming and gorgeous in their roles, as well as Jude Law. Jack Black is excellent but rather miscast here as romantic pair of Winslet. Eli Wallach is simply superb. The settings are integral to the plot, lovely photography sets the tone and enhances the mood.

Lots Of Perky Moments,"Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and Jude Law stars in this romantic comedy ""The Holiday"". Cameron Diaz and Jack Black are innate comedians so we are assured that these two can handle comedy scenes quite effectively. On the other hand Kate Winslet and Jude Law, both British and Oscar nominated, are known for its dramatic roles. Though, I think Kate and Jude surprisingly gave me some giggles and smiles whenever they appear on the screen so they succeeded in doing comedy which is something new for them.""The Holiday"" is more like two movies rolled into one. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) had just broke-up with her boyfriend after she caught him cheating while Iris (Kate Winslet) was heart broken when her boyfriend decided to marry another woman. Both felt the need to get out from their lives by going faraway from where they live.Iris is from England and Amanda is from LA. When these two meet over the internet chat room, they impulsively decided to swap houses. That was just how the story started for both women. While Iris is in LA living at Amanda's house and Amanda at Iris' in England, They are about to meet new friends w/c provides them fresh outlook on life and love. As the story goes, Graham (Jude Law) and Miles (Jack Black) comes in providing our two heroine some badly needed new romance.The movie actually makes you smile a lot with lots of perky moments. What makes me giggle a lot was when the fake movie trailer called ""Christmas Day"" pops up. It surprisingly shows James Franco and Lindsay Lohan on cameo roles as the actors on that fake movie out of a fake movie trailer. In the end, there is nothing really special about ""The Holiday"" but I can say it's a good movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Take in This Holiday ***1/2,"Wonderful romantic comedy that will remind you of the comedies of the 1940s. Jude Law does a wonderful take-off of Cary Grant, who this picture certainly was made for.Two women- Hollywood's Cameron Diaz and England's Kate Winslet exchange their homes online for two weeks after experiencing major disappointments in their respective boyfriends. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to them. Both are literally swept off their feet in new endearing love affairs.This film deals with the ability to be daring and make a change during times of adversity.As Arthur Abbott, a retired screenwriter of Hollywood's golden years, Eli Wallach etched still another unforgettable character. He is just fabulous in the role as an elderly widower who with his Oscar and other accolades, refuses to be honored by his peers.This is just a grand film and I certainly recommend it for viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Totally gushy, but a delight to watch.","The Holiday is a romantic-comedy that's immensely gushy, with a thick layer of cheese. But that's OK, because it works. Yes it envisages a love that's almost circumstantially impossible. It's absurdness that's at least sweet and warm. Two women, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, decide to house-swap for two weeks over the Christmas period. One's in L.A., the other in Surrey (wow, what a comparison). There they meet their retrospective partners. The four main characters, including the charming Jack Black and Jude Law, are very well developed, making it easy to feel their emotions. Regardless of the outcome (and that's easy to grasp from the off), I want things to work out for them. If anything it was nice to see Jack Black in a completely different role to what he's comfortable with, which probably explains why he's so awkward throughout. The Holiday, as much as it's aimed at a certain gender type, can be for all if you just want it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Made For DVD,"I'm not sure where to start. Have you ever spent $10 to suffer in your seat for two hours and twenty minutes while watching some of your favorite actors lose years of credibility acting in a film with a story that is written for people that have an IQ of 80 or below? That's what happened to me. The film is touted as a ""romantic comedy"". This was neither. There is nothing romantic about two single women with successful careers being portrayed as pathetic if they don't have ""Mr. Right"" in their lives. Additionally, no one was funny. Miles, played by Jack Black, who I think is brilliant, was not even close to funny. The painfully bad acting and spoon-fed dialogue between Cameron Diaz and Ed Burns in the first scene, two actors that I usually like and respect, set the tone for the movie which never changed. The premise of the story, the ridiculous time-lines, the painfully contrived dialogue, and unlikable characters, made this one of the worst films I have ever seen. This may be a good time for Nancy Meyers who wrote and directed this film to apologize for hurting the careers of some of Hollywood's most promising and established actors. This movie should have possibly been titled ""The Recycled Hollywood Crap Holiday Movie"".",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

the perfect movie on a rainy Sunday,"The Holiday is THE perfect movie to watch an a cold, rainy Sunday. It makes you laugh and cry at the same time. You might think The Holiday is a lengthy story, because he almost takes two hours and a half. I can tell you the Holiday isn't verbose at all. I have watched this movie at least 15 times and I still don't get bored while watching. The Holiday goes about two women who switch houses. Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz, lives in a massive cottage in L.A. Iris, played by Kate Winslet, lives in an romantic, little house in Sunderland, 20 minutes from London. They both needed a vacation to escape, especially from the men in their life. But a good movie wouldn't be a good movie, if they wouldn't fall in love again.

Standard romantic comedy with above average prettiness,"Lovely sets, some interesting lines and concepts, and a few good acting turns. But overall your standard romantic comedy. The only real surprise is an all-too-unusual setting for Jude Law's character.In the DVD extras, the director commented that Cameron Diaz reminded her of Carole Lombard. It was a connection I'd not made before, but it was immediate obvious once heard. But perhaps Diaz's occasionally gleefully spastic performance was due to the director's pushing her in the Lombard direction.The cast was outstanding but under-utilized with a ""so close but not quite"" script and average direction. Everything seemed to move towards a resolution or breakthrough but then stop short for no apparent reason.Overall, absolutely average -- fluff for a brainless day. The eye candy of sets and actors help it along. Would be wonderful to see the same cast on a film with a better script and director.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Shallow, predictable, but good enough","One American girl, cheated on by her boyfriend. One English girl, seeing her unanswered love getting married to someone else. One change of houses, cars, lives and pretty much everything for a holiday. Three ingredients for what turns out to be a very lightheaded but rather fun film.The Holiday starts quickly by showing the events that lead to the change of lives - neither event needs a lot of explanation and that part is over with rather quickly. What then starts it the actual change, and that one couldn't have been more dramatically for either party - from a tiny house with no luxuries at all to a large one with all luxuries available and vice versa. It all works out very well.The film is rather predictable - the ending is clear in sight for just about everyone from somewhere in the middle of the film. But that doesn't make it any worse - it works in the same ways as any other feel good film. Characters are worked out well enough, but not very deep. Not bad either.All in all, worthy of screen time.7 out of 10 beats of love.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Back when Rom-Coms were at their peak,"The Holiday is focused around two women unlucky in love, who despite being so different will find each other a second chance at it.The plot is simple but engaging, especially Iris' segments. What really makes this movie memorable is its portrayal of the differences and common elements 'tween AmE accent and BrE accent and how Iris and Amanda exchange their places in the two contries. Also it shows when DVDs were the main way to watch movies aside of cinemas (I love DVDs, I'm really addicted to them!) and it gives a powerful criticism of modern day movie industry, focused only on revenues, box office results and not on good stories. That was back in 2006, but what would have Arthur said of 2024 situation?So, a great rom-com and a deeper movie, I definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Somebody please put Diaz out of her misery,"I have to say I am shocked that so many people online are posting that they liked this movie. Not only liked, but LOVED this movie. In the theater people were laughing at scenes that were not meant to be humorous, and I myself rolled my eyes so many times throughout it that my eye sockets got sore. I nearly walked out of the theater. I only stayed because someone else had paid for my ticket. Let me start with CAMERON DIAZ's character since she is the loudest distraction from the scanty elements that make this movie bearable. I think she squeaks, whines, moans, grunts, growls and bounces up and down more than she speaks. And no, I'm not referring to any sex she has in the movie. I almost wish I was, so she could have gotten it all out in a bedroom scene instead of tormenting us with her overacting and childish dramatics throughout the film. In the scenes where she actually does talk, her acting is so atrocious my efforts to ignore it were easily overpowered. Jude Law was fine, except that he got stuck with Diaz as his only real character to bounce off of, which left him flat. And his character was overdone and very very contrived. Kate Winslet was good, though she seemed ten times better than she really was in this because of the contrast of Cameron Diaz. Jack Black added some easy humor to it. He and Kate Winslet had some chemistry, surprisingly. It was clearly a very American film, despite half the cast being British, and being that half the story is supposed to be set in England it was, in my opinion, unrealistic and hard to believe. And yes, I have been to England. Another problem with the movie is it dragged terribly. It could have been an hour long. They took forever to advance the story line, and the scenes were bland. Over all I felt that I got half of a movie. The story between Winslet, Black and the old man was plenty. Perhaps a better-done version could toss in Jude Law as Winslet's character's charming brother or something. Get rid of that three-yea-old Cameron Diaz person. Nobody would accept Law as anything but a main character, but it would have been fine for me. Some have described it as a romantic comedy with a fairy-tale sensibility. I love movies with a fairy-tale feeling added to real life drama, but this movie was nothing more than baldly unrealistic. I'm just glad the money spent on my ticket wasn't out of my pocket.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good comedy,"Good comedy. They switch houses, Cameron goes to stay in England in Kate's house, and Kate goes to Los Angeles to stay in Cameron's house. The plot in and of itself is interesting and draws you in to keep watching. The script is well written and original, with little sparks of comedy thrown in where needed. And then there are scenes where we get to know our characters, usually through deep conversations with them and other characters. There definitely are NOT cardboard cut out one dimensional characters here, they are characters with real life issues, true depth, and interesting backgrounds. The romance and chemistry between the couples is great! It's truly eclectic and comes so wonderfully natural. I also love the side plot between Kate Winslet.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's lovely, but it could be a lot better...","I loved this movie, but I could have loved more if it hasn't Jack ""Annoying"" Black in it. I got this movie without knowing that he is in it, and I swear that when I saw his name in the opening credits I thought: I hope he's just as much as a supporting-supporting actor can be. Yeah... almost.He's one of those current actors being cast in the movies not because he's actually GOOD, but he's funny enough to cover some holes on the plot and to make Americans laugh a lot with those annoying joking faces when there's nothing to be said or when the movie is getting a lot dramatic or sleepy. I'm sure he's one of those Jerry Lewis fans that really makes hard to be so funny as Mike Myers, and I just hate that.I think that this movie flaws with some things. First it suffers for so much characters and relationship happenings, I think that it was a lot talk about 3 broken relationships that resolves into 2 new ones because that's a lot for a movie. So, when a story starts getting interesting with Iris and Mr. Abbott, we are cut in the middle to see what is happening with Amanda and Graham, and when these last ones' story is getting interesting, we are cut back to Amanda that needs to answer the door, and guess who is it? ""Annoying"" Miles, of course! Another thing that is quite annoying (and this time it's not Jack Black) is the fact that Amanda's story is more interesting than Iris's, or that's what writer and director Nancy Meyers tries to make us believe when we check the fact that more than a half of the movie is about Amanda dyslexic and embarrassing moments. That's sad because Kate Winslet is a lot secondary in it and she does her part a way lot better.Don't get me wrong but one more time I loved this movie and I LOVE all the cast (except Jack Black), I just think that it could be a lot better without these wrong steps and turns. Even I have pointing a lot of negative comments, this movie deserves a great look, just try not bothering with Jack Black annoying acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Endearing if plodding rom-com,"On the list of holiday movies, this ranks high, perhaps because it could take place at other times of the year, hence its title so bland it must have been AI generated.Also AI generated is Cameron Diaz's acting. The rest are great, especially Kate Winslet who is a consummate darling. Jude Law plays it safe and Jack Black plays it silly. Overall it works.Aside from the rather dull and sappy subplot involving Eli Wallach (sorry Eli), the rest of the film is entertaining and hits all the usual rom-com notes. Although one wonders if the director - who has been doing these forever - could have added another layer of action and humour - perhaps a case of mistaken identity plot development, and better use of Rufus Sewell, re-introduced earlier and now more cravenly desperate and pathetic?Not as jet-fuelled as Love, Actually, but a decent way to spend a lazy winter's afternoon. 6.5.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I've watched it a couple of times and it's really very good, I was going to give it a 9 but I asked myself, what would I change about it if I could, and the answer was nothing.The chemistry between Jack Black and Kate Winslet wasn't as strong as Cameron Diaz and Jude Law, but their story line was (in my opinion) secondary to the main characters. Their attraction was one rooted in commonality and just being perfect for each other, where as the main characters attraction was more of a blindsiding, unexpected, deeply romantic attraction. The kind that only a day before, you couldn't have imagined it even being possible and the day after, couldn't live without. So in the overall scope of the movie, even this small imperfection, ended up being perfect. Very well done and a must watch movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel good movie? More like feel better movie.,"This movie helps me understand a little more about myself, even tho in essence it's just a family movie.It's about toxic patterns and the importance of getting outside of your own bubble of friends, family and little problems that sometimes gain control over your life.It is not a revolutionary movie, not one of those recomandations that change people lives, but it's surely a movie to watch again from time to time. I mean sure it's a popcorn flick, but at the end of the movie you get some important lessons and a clear remembering of what you should prioritize in life. That is yourself, you should respect and listen to yourself more.Sometimes we get in a loop of thought and believe everything we think about world is our only reality, but you just have to step out of it and listen to yourself and how stupidly solvable some of your problems are by cutting some connections with people.

Of course, with Cameron Diaz back in star form -- and I do mean burning bright -- it's hard to imagine anyone not being able to work up chemistry.The movie's more than a little saccharine, but Kate Winslet is very winning and Eli Wallach's sweet performance more than makes up for the constant annoyance that is Jack Black. It's just too bad that Nancy Meyers thought that anyone could create a romantic tension with Black.

We particularly liked Eli Wallach - simply wonderful.If you imagine curling up with a glass of wine, a blazing fire, and a film; then the film you want to complete that picture is The Holiday. Pure Hollywood - and pure as the driven snow. England and Los Angeles never looked so perfect, and yet inside the package there are enough surprises and little touches that it never becomes too saccharine.The Christmas spirit suits well - and it is neatly and expertly directed by Nancy Myers. Yes, it wears its heart on its sleeve all the time, but it didn't make us cringe.Too perfect? Of course it is, and proud of it - if you are in the mood for a feel-good romance, with enough heartache to make it bitter-sweet followed by the clean resolution then this is your slice of movie magic.For out and out holiday cheer The Holiday is a winning and heady mix.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sentimental sickening load of rubbish.,"I took a date to see this film and halfway through it she turned to me and said 'This is torture for you, is it not?' I replied 'Yes, especially Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet trying too hard to be funny and only making me more depressed.' There's a nauseating bit where Diaz's Amanda puts on The Killers' Hot Fuse album and dances her head off to the great band's Mr Brightside while slugging from a bottle of beer. Believe me, the cinema was full and no one was laughing.Oh Yes! The plot. Cameron Diaz (five miles OTT) is Amanda, an American cinema trailer editor with her own business. After dumping her man (Ed Burns) because he slept with his secretary she desires to get away from Los Angeles to a place where there are no males. After chatting on the computer with Iris (Kate Winslet) they agree to swap places for a few weeks or so. After arriving in England, Amanda finds herself falling in love with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris at Amanda's place, bonds with an old screenwriter veteran (the magnificent Eli Wallach) and slowly, SLOWLY falls for film composer and Amanda's work colleague Miles (Jack Black, on autopilot).This is one of those films that tries too hard to make you feel good and warm inside, like the Al Pacino film Frankie and Johnny. Anyone who is a bad egg gets their just deserts and anyone who is a good person triumphs in the end up. Not my cup of tea.However, Cameron Diaz is absolutely beautiful in every scene shes in. And the scene where Iris is telling Miles about her unrequited love for Jasper (Rufus Sewell) while he listens had me in tears of laughter when it reminded me of the scene in Airplane! when Ted Striker is boring the old woman passenger to death about his love for Elaine.If there are any witty scenes in this dross, its when Miles and Iris are in a DVD rental store and Dustin Hoffman has a five second cameo, when you see it you'll smirk.

Not a great film!!,"The Holiday, was a waste of two and a half hours and £8. The stories reminded me of many other genuinely funny rom coms. I thought I was watching Bridget Jones to start, then I recognised a bit of Notting Hill and ended with possibly Love, Actually. The writer has embarked on an interesting but entirely predictable story and poorly concocted romantic scenarios in a way that has little or no punch and looks like a debut screenplay.The director coaxed their extremely talented leading cast into a ""do your best with the script we have"", who did do their best i'm sure, but I've never seen a cast look uncomfortable, even in character, with what they are asked to perform. It was embarrassing to watch them , almost cringe worthy. I fully realise I was there to see a romantic comedy, romantic it was, to the point of being sickly, but a comedy it was not. Seeing the jokes come and go, me and the rest of the packed theatre were quiet through most of these ""funny moments"". I mainly found myself wanting it to be funnier or anticipating that surprise that I didn't expect, but this was to no avail. Well marketed though!!!",,Anonymous,Romance

A sweet but far too cliche romantic tale,"I have lots of mixed feelings about this film. Overall I did enjoy it and it is a nice, sweet film. But it does feel overly long for what it is.For those who don't know, the film follows two women who are down on their luck in the romance department. With their belief in love at an all time low, the women find each other on a house swap website and impulsively decide to swap homes for the holiday season, with one heading to a Surrey village and one heading to LA. Its a farcical but enjoyable set up and from here, romance begins to blossom to nobody's surprise.It is here where the film gets a bit messy. We essentially get two parallel love stories and I found this to be a bit of a chore. Just as I was getting invested in one I'd be forced to sit through 20 minutes of the other. I found the constant changing of focus to detract from each story. So the structure didn't really do it for me.Speaking of the love stories themselves, they are full of cliches and overly sweet moments. Not to say they are bad, but for a 2 hour 20 minute film it becomes a bit tedious.The performances are all very good however. I don't think Jack Black shines but his character is given the least to work with. Winslet and Diaz are a delight however, and it's a joy watching them if nothing else.All being said I think this film is good, but it is just too drawn out and a bit too cliche in parts. The constant changing of focus also stopped me getting invested in the characters and the stories. Still, if you are willing to surrender to the cliches and get swept up in the saccharine romance then there's a lot to enjoy here.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Altogether perfect,"I haven't seen this film for quite a while, but I can definitely remember that I really enjoyed it. The casting is perfect, with a range from Kate Winslet to Jack Black. I can certainly tell you it was unexpected to see this group of people together, but it definitely worked out well! The storyline and character development is also so amusing and entertaining. Couldn't keep my eyes off it for a minute, I was glued😳! It's a lovely romance and definitely something to watch and share with your teenagers and family. It's a great recommendation for anyone that's into films like Nativity and Love Actually. Personally, I'd recommend it to a friend!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun the first time around, but...","I enjoyed this film hugely when it first came out on the big screen. Alas, I have finally revisited it on DVD, and oh dear - what a disappointment! It's not that Cameron Diaz's character has to cope with fairly obvious cultural differences once she's in England - nerve-shreddingly narrow roads, low cottage beams etc: I have to say that these totally chime with my experience with all my American friends who have come over here. But the slipshod plotting (how come the car can't drive up to the the cute little cottage at the beginning, and yet can at the film's end?), the all-too-worthy agony aunt-style philosophising, and too many clangers (Cary Grant's from Surrey, eh?) which evidently only got through due to the whole thing being all too firmly under the control of Nancy Meyers (no room for actors to improve some of their appalling lines, or for someone to point out glaring inconsistencies in the story line): all of these things are too glaringly obvious for comfort.So I'm less than sure, now, that the film is really much of an improvement on such popular yet brainless romantic comedies like 'Notting Hill' (or indeed most of those embarrassments by Richard Curtis): at least Curtis's productions are quite openly about wish fulfilment, ungrateful though his roles for the American actresses are. And I can no longer see why I thought the characterisation in ""Holiday"" was particularly ""sharp"" - it now seems pretty much a mixture of generic and wishful thinking (the Jude Law character, for instance).Overall, too, this is a seriously poor showing of some fine actors: Jude Law's endless mugging is ghastly to see after such films as 'The Talented Mr Ripley' where he gives a sensational performance. The lack of sufficient chemistry between him and Cameron Diaz (or was it just their trying to get through that awful script?) finally destroys even the latter's performance. And Kate Winslet, at her best in off-beat and feisty roles, is here given the ungrateful task of being a rather worthy, conventional English lass - quite a weepy one at that. So in all, OK if you have just short of 2 hours 20 minutes to waste - but definitely not something to add to your collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A bit of everything, mostly bad","The ending was better than the start, so I rate it just below average. The thing is that some parts were nice, others brilliant, while most of it was boring and unbelievable.To start with the beginning, two women who don't know each other decide to swap houses without even meeting each other. Is that even possible? Anyway, they both have complicated love lives they want to escape from, one being British, the other American. Now here is a great opportunity for humour, but there was little or none of that.To continue, the stories of both women are completely separate. It's like there are two movies into one (which partly explains why they made this film 130 minutes long!). The situations in both movies are partly interesting, partly cliché, but most of the script is boring or completely unbelievable. It's very hard to relate to any of the characters.To end it, I think that Eli Wallach and Dustin Hoffman made this film. Yes, Dustin Hoffman plays in this one with a role he couldn't have failed, since it involved one cameo line. It's not like the other actors did not play well, it's just that the script was awful in some places and the embarrassment of trying to place themselves into a bad role was obvious. Frank Black in a romantic role? At least we didn't have him belly dance in his underwear in this one.Bottom line, it is a shallow film. It brushed past so many interesting themes like Anglo-American interaction, old movies, movie soundtracks, movie trailers (yes, it seems most movie professions were present in this one!), the golden age of movies... All that remained was two confused couples spending New Year's Eve together. Can one destroy a (potential) romantic movie more with something more than make it also a Christmas movie?So, my suggestion (strangely it makes me sad to say it) is to avoid this film. Great potential, horrendous delivery!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Rom-Com over Xmas,"The 2006 production ""The Holiday"" starts off quite generic but once it gets rolling, the story gets more interesting by the minute. Soon we have a bunch of folks struggling with relationships, emotions and personal needs. Their encounters are interconnected and despite the story rolls out between two continents thanks to the pacing I could follow the narrative easily. I heard that this film was written specifically with Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black in mind. Their chemistry on screen is great. This is one of the rare movies where Hollywood actors actually show genuine human emotions. Cameron Diaz plays a troubled character and through her effort she puts into her performance it feels a bit like over acting but okay. The most convincing part comes from Kate Winslet who did a tremendous job of making her character emotionally palpable. Her facial expressions are truly significant. Jude Law does great. Only Jack Black is the one I could not relate to since he plays like he does not want to be there. Prefect soundtrack by Hans Zimmer!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A new Senta,"This one is known in Germany as ""Die Liebe kennt keine Ferien"" (Love does not know holidays) which even within the glorious tradition of mal-translations of German cinema is a true highlight. Now, Holiday is what is called a Romantic Comedy which basically means there are 2 people a boy and a girl that fall in love and marry at the end (well, they ""stay"" which each other these days). And in between, if it is any good, some funny things are said and done and we all feel happy. There is not too much wit in it because if there is it is called a screwball comedy and they do not make them any more. Here there are four instead of two. Two woman, who had suffered enough from the male of the species decide to swap houses. Cameron comes to a lovely English cottage and Kate to incredible L.A. This is really done exceptionally well. How they react to their new domicile. Of course a synonym for romantic comedy is predictability. And it does not come as a surprise that both fall in love with the leading men. Which of course, is nice and right. But when you think of it it is sort of sad. Cameron has all this wonderful books with her. And instead of reading them and enjoying a couple of quiet days she has to fall for Jude Law. Anyway. The story is very silly but lovely enough. And if Hugh Grant had played the part of Jude I probably would have really enjoyed it. Law is not really bad but who can care for a man who claims to be drunk and thus has to sleep at his sister's house when it is plain from his behavior that he could not have had more than half a pint? Kate is also okay the subplot with the old writer guy touching. Black totally unbelievable. But Cameron is just brilliant. She saves the movie. And why? Because she looks like Senta Berger (with just a touch of Meg Ryan). I never noticed before. Very nice.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining romantic film,"This film is about the spontaneous holidays that 2 women arranged after being hurt by their respective love.Due to the nature of the film, it involves the romances of 2 couples. It is more like 2 parallel love stories in one film, which explains the length of this film. Fortunately, the transition between the two stories is smooth and clear. Cameron Diaz is excellent in her portrayal of her character. She can really act! Kate Winslet's expression of joy and surprise when she first arrived at her house in Los Angeles is memorable.The story is predictable, but it is entertaining anyway. The fact that Kate Winslet's character derived pleasure ans satisfaction through helping others contrasted with Cameron Diaz's character. This contrast s well done and well planned, as having 2 identical love stories would be boring.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, Improbable, Enjoyable","This is not a great movie.....maybe not even a good movie. But thanks to a good cast and a heart-warming story, it's not that bad. Could have been made 20 or 30 years ago, probably starring Doris Day and Rock Hudson and who knows who else? But it's been updated so there is sex on the first meeting, too much drinking, and other ""current"" traumas. But the basic premise is still looking for love in all the wrong places...and finding it in the least likely places. All the stars are easy on the eyes (although Jack Black looks more and more like Rose O'Donnell to me) and the sound track is recognizable, and it will be a movie to watch more than once. That being said, it won't be on the Oscars list. Take your mom, your teen-aged daughter, or just yourself and enjoy it for what it is....a fairy tale with a happy ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"One of the most romantic, funny, and touching holiday season films of all time","THE HOLIDAY, in my opinion, is one of the most romantic, funny, and touching holiday season films of all time. When Iris (Kate Winslet) and Amanda (Cameron Diaz) met and started seeing Miles (Jack Black) and Graham (Jude Law), I was really touched. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. If you ask me, everyone looked nice in the dressy clothing they wore. At the beginning of the film, when Iris got dumped by Jasper (Rufus Sewell), I felt a lot of sympathy for her. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the direction was excellent, the performances were terrific, and the production design was lavish. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of any of the stars of this romantic, funny, and touching holiday season films of all time, I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
If only we could Have got a better actress then Cameron Diaz,"This movie is not as bad as boring as clipping your own fingernails but pretty close. Does anyone else think Cameron Diaz should stop with the cheek lifts (collegen ?) and invest in some acting classes? She over acts far too much. Jack Black is great, as always. Kate Winslet is Frumpy in this one. Jude Law is the best actor in the movie. Unfortunately, dulling down Winslet's looks still ain't gonna get me to believe that a guy who looks like Jack Black could date her. Unfortunately this movie ran over 2 hours. Also, who's gonna believe that Cameron Diaz would randomly go online and pick a dump in England to stay in over the holidays. Ludicrous. More nudity (ie. some) would have made these 2 hours go by a lot quicker.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday 2006 - A Brief Review,"Well, anyone can tell you what this film is about (2 30+ year old women - one in US, one in UK - swap houses for two weeks and find love in their respective new vacancy), so here are some fun facts about the film you won't find so easily:1. The movie is not only a romantic comedy, but also a movie about making movies. Be prepared for many inside Hollywood jokes, including surprise cameos by Lindsay Lohan, Dustin Hoffman and others. 2. It' the only movie you'll ever find who shows you (brief) images of the DVD covers of classics such as Gone With the Wind and Jaws, and then show you a library who has the horrific Gigli in it. 3. Watch out for that boom mike that comes in the most inadequate scenes. 4. Two much product placement: I wonder how much Google, Universal Studios, that damn Blueberry palm computer and others put into this thing.The Holiday's negative points (IMO):1. Lack of editing: the film has at least 30 minutes that could have been easily removed whilst keeping the plot intact. Some of the scenes take way too much screen time (the film clocks at over 2 hours - way above average for a romantic comedy). 2. Lack of Jack Black: the guy is supposedly one of the main characters but hardly has any screen time, and becomes an important player in the plot only towards the end. 3. Lack of credibility: when you have Jude Law and Cameron Diaz together with two little girls in one scene, and the girls ""steal"" the show from the stars, you know something is wrong. Black and Winslet, on the other hand, were more exciting on screen for me. Black actually shines more than ever in his rather small part, and is cute as a button. 4. Lack of continuinity: the UK and the US plot don't always mush together like the director might have intended originally, and seem like two entirely different films occasionally.Most of all, remember: this is supposed to be light Christmas fluff, so handle it with the right thing in mind. If you ignore all the negaive points I mentioned and simply enjoy the film, you'll be having a blast.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Nice, and feel good","What happens when two heartbroken women swap their lives (or most of it) for a holiday season? It would predictably be almost like flowing with the course of other's life and to revel in the little or large pleasures the life of another person would bring. To that extent 'Holiday' is full of rather predictable outcomes with Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet both eventually finding some love and some solace for their broken hearts. That the final outcome of their foreign ventures has been left to the audience's imagination helps the viewer focus on the 'Holiday' aspect of the experience and not look beyond.'Holiday' succeeds is in making the audience feel good with a Christmas time story of finding love away from home - and in the process may be finding another home. The script's unwillingness to explore possibilities that would have been - if the writer and director were willing to explore outcomes less predictable - means that the movie ends up being a typical Hollywood feel good comedy. But then trying outcomes less predictable would be depriving 'Holiday' of its essence of being a light love comedy. In all, it is a good movie for a weekend relaxation but not the one that would excite a critic's mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

good film for a wedding anniversary,"I am not a great fan of romantic comedies which I can stand only in small doses at large intervals in time, but 'The Holiday' plus half of bottle of champagne from yesterday's party was the best film viewing for the occasion. I should add that it's not a bad movie as you can believe reading some of the critics, succeeding to raise above the usual kitsch level of the films in the genre.The two main protagonists of the story are a Californian trailer producer (Cameron Diaz) and a British journalist (Kate WInslet) who on holidays eve are abandoned by their years long love interests who happened both to be absolute jerks and in order to run from depression and solitude enter a home swap, exchanging residences for the period of the holidays. In a very convenient manner a few screen minutes after landing at each others home salvation knocks at their doors incarnated by the comic super-genius Jack Black and by British beau-of-the-day Jude Law. What follows is what you suspect it follows but surprisingly the parallel story develop in quite a cursive manner, dialogs are most of them funny, though they do not avoid completely being too wordy, and the four acting stars seem to have a good time. A special mention is to be made to the character of the old Hollywood script-writer, aced with emotion and nostalgia by Eli Wallach in a deep reverence to the good old American movies industry.Good entertainment for Christmas, wedding anniversaries and maybe in other occasions too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday from Hell,"I can't think of one redeeming feature in this piece of schlock. Except, maybe, that it gave me a chance to get about 30 minutes sleep in a near deserted theater on New Year's Eve day. Apparently we must have missed the word that The Holiday is a total waste. But we had absolutely nothing else to do that afternoon..so we ""snuck"" into the theater under the senior rate. Just a couple of questions I'd like to pose...Does it really snow that much in suburban London? Did I miss a sex scene while I was napping? Does Cameron Diaz have a shape? Do all women wear bras during sex? Would any less than desperate woman, take back Jack Black after getting dumped in a restaurant for another woman? Is the over-acting, comic wannabe, Jack Black, miscast in this disaster movie? Would any sensible person let a total stranger stay alone in their multi-million dollar mansion without even meeting them first? Would you lend your home to someone, travel 6000 miles away and expect to find it in perfect shape when you return? AND..who can I write to to get my money back?

"One of the sweetest, nicest ChickFlicks","I didn't have high expectations about The Holiday, I'd assumed it was a typical chickflick with a good cast; however, it turned out way better than just that. The plot is as full & satisfactory as it can be for this kind of movie, the characters are nicely reflected, and the film brings you a smile, brightening your mood in one way or another. One of the main problems with this genre is trying to add funny bits and ending up in a ridiculous scenario, but thankfully, this does not happen in The Holiday - there's no exaggeration regarding the comedy aspect. There's also a bonus in this film, the character, ""Arthur Abbott"", played by Eli Wallach, who pretty much steals the show. I loved his parts and Kate Winslet surely did not disappoint, either. All in all, I can recommend The Holiday for those into sweet, heart-warming movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
geared toward single females,"This movie aims for one audience, the single female. The two women in this have these two nearly perfect romances while on vacation.

I just can't take him seriously as someone who deserves pity or good things.The movie is cute in places, a few laughs.

Embarrassment of the 'chick-flick' genre,"Amanda in L.A (Cameron Diaz) is an emotionally retarded workaholic who has just kicked her boyfriend (Edward Burns) out for cheating on her with his secretary. Iris (Kate Winslet) in Surrey, England is a writer for a London newspaper and has just been delivered the biggest blow at an office Christmas party when it is announced that the ex-boyfriend (Rufus Sewell) who she is still madly in love with, has become engaged to the woman with whom he cheated on Iris with three years ago. Both women find themselves at an utter loss. Iris mopes about her little cottage, near suicidal, while Amanda desperately wants to prove something to herself and her ex  namely that she can relax, cry, and be happily alone. Amanda's solution? A holiday. She finds a website where people swap houses for 2 weeks and decides that Surrey is the perfect place for a vacation, choosing to swap her L.A mansion for Iris's quaint 'Rosehill Cottage'. In Surrey Amanda meets Iris's handsome, drunkard older brother, Graham (Jude Law) and Iris meets the best friend of Amanda's ex, music composer Miles (Jack Black) and you can most definitely guess the rest.This is an atrocious film. And what makes this film all the worse is the irony of a character called Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) who is Amanda's next door neighbor in L.A and fast becomes companion to Iris. What's funny is that Abbott plays a man who was a screen-writer during Tinsletwon's hey-day. Abbott prescribes fantastic classics for Iris to watch and appreciate and in one scene lets out a great long spiel about how awful today's cinema is; specifically that box-office and blockbusters hinder creativity. Was writer/director Nancy Meyers shooting herself in the foot or what!?It's not just that 'The Holiday' is predictable to the point of boredom. Chick-flicks are usually predictable, but that doesn't mean they can't still be good. Take 'Bridget Jones's Diary', for example. Everyone knew that book was based on Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' and therefore that Bridget wins Mr. Darcy in the end but it's still a bloody good chick-flick, even though the ending, and in fact the entire plot is some 194 years old. The film's plot leaves a lot to be desired. For one, it's not particularly encouraging to women, which is surprising since it was written by a woman (the same woman who wrote 'Something's Gotta Give', no less)  the whole story hinders on this idea that even though Amanda and Iris are both successful working women, they are lacking because they don't have a man in their lives. Amanda's boyfriend cheats on her and instead of rejecting his claims that it was her, who deliberately sabotaged the relationship (forcing him to cheat?) she privately agrees with his claims and unintentionally sets out to try and be the sort of woman he wished she was.No, 'The Holiday's' failure does not solely lie in its plot, a lot of the film's faults have to do with the cast. Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, both actresses who have proved in previous films that they do indeed have acting chops, both over-act. Diaz more than Winslet, but the over-acting is completely and utterly cringe-worthy. Honestly, watching Diaz jump around hysterically after punching her boyfriend in the face, I felt nauseous. And what really didn't help matters was the fact that these characters were specifically written by Nancy Meyers with Law, Diaz, Winslet and Black in mind. The result is a mixed caricature of each actor, compiled of previous film roles and media persona's. Cameron Diaz plays the breezy goof-ball slash every man's ideal woman; hints of her from 'There's something about Mary' and 'in her shoes' shine through. Iris seems more inspired by the real-life Winslet, as Iris is self-deprecating and entirely modest. Jude Law's Graham also seems to have been created with a great deal of influence from the actor's real life  as a womanizing drunkard in the beginning, but then becoming a sort of 'fantasy' of what his female fans wish the real Law was, a sexy wounded white knight with demons in his closet who just needs to be saved by a beautiful maiden. Jack Black of course plays the clown, though in this he seems to be going through the motions, and his 'comedy' is hollow for it.This is a really, really awful film. I thought, in the last half hour or so, some tragedy would befall one of the pretty couples: perhaps one of the relationships would be abandoned, or the old man would die. Nope. I won't be spoiling anything for you when I say that there is a happy ending (well, theoretically speaking Lord knows I didn't come out of this film 'happy'). Perhaps the film could have been salvaged with entirely different casting, or if the story was a bit more balanced  though it is meant to be about both women, we mainly follow Diaz & Law, who had the most banal storyline of the two.So, so bad  don't even bother hiring it on DVD when it comes out.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

There's always next time...,"A long time ago, writer/director Nacy Meyers did a glorious romantic comedy, ""What women want"". It was funny, it was romantic and it had its main actors in completely unexpected roles. With time she was apparently captivated by nice sceneries, and left the city to show her characters in wider places, living longer, almost ending love stories. This led into ""Something's gotta give"", a film full of repeated moments in which actors still shone bright.With ""The Holiday"", Meyers' finest attributes (the direction of actors and her writing, that is) are still in top form; the problem is that in every other aspect she's trying something more ambitious than her previous efforts. This film presents us four main characters that live two major love stories (that include, we might say, other two) in two different places in the world. It's not what I would have prescribed for someone like Meyers.Although ""The Holiday"" is better than her previous piece, some things are almost embarrassing and show us a writer that might be running out of ideas. To do a whole sequence with the old joke of 'driving on the wrong side', the typical American problem when in England; to give Jack Black a role completely different from what he's done and finally asking him to do his classic act (singing and dancing like a fool, but like nobody can); introducing a plot line involving an old writer and comparisons between the modern Hollywood and what it used to beIt's not that the words characters speak seem off, it's the presence of all of this things that make us doubt the director's originality.About the words, well, it isn't too different from what we've seen from Meyers before or what we get in the typical contemporary film of the genre. As in every script, there are things that shouldn't be spoken by the characters, silences that should be respected, musical montages that are unnecessary (this is more related to direction).To her favor, Meyer hasn't followed the typical developments of the love relationships and has been able to introduce a couple of unexpected funny and dramatic situations; and while there's an important lever of corniness that some characters admit to be looking for, expressions are never too far-fetched to be doubted.It's understandable that Meyers does a balance. After all, ""The Holiday"" is for every kind of audience possible, and it has to contain an obligatory familiarity. For this Meyers takes the wisest decisions related to acting. The four main characters are kind of familiar, and it looks as if the roles had been written for the actors who play them. Kate Winslet (is it possible to be that good of an actor?) plays the depressing Iris, who's in love with someone who doesn't love her backShe's the one who gives the movie's initial speech, about relationship.Cameron Diaz plays Amanda, an also depressing woman who worries too much about herself and is on the movie trailer making industry. Amanda and Iris are the one who take the holiday of the title and meet Graham and Miles, respectively. Graham is played by a subtle and calm Jude Law who abuses of his oldest winning trick: the smile. Meanwhile, Black delivers a confusing performance that doesn't decide between the serious and the ridicule and that finally rests in his typical act, as I said.""The Holiday"" does no harm, but it still could have been a better ride. With fewer characters and a more centered love story, and some other things that don't come to mind right now. Anyway, maybe next time, right?Hans Zimmer's scoreNo words for that magic.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Way Better Than I Thought It Would Be,"On the 31st December 2022 I sat down and watched The Holiday with my partner.For years I had dodged this movie. The first name anyone mentions is Jack Black and I find his acting in movies way over the top. I could not imagine him as a romantic lead and as it turns out I didn't have to.The first 40 minutes was just as I thought it would be, a Cameron Diaz movie with sledgehammer humour. Then it settled down very nicely to become a gentle romantic tale. I do wonder if somebody took over the directing half way through.The stories became more personal and the characters rich, I will not spoil the story but I was very and quite pleasantly suprised by this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Professional and assured romedy made a few bad choices..,"Semi-excellent emulation of a modern romantic comedy at times but still takes huge leaps away from the intuitive joy that makes up the majority of this crowd pleaser. As one of Hollywood's few female mainstream forces, Nancy Meyers immediately reiterates why she is an intelligent enough writer and director to justify many clichés her feel-good material thrives off of. Nothing here is trying to reinvent the wheel, or reinvent the corny, sappy contrived nature of these films for that matter, but Meyers and her acting entourage get enough mileage out of the mediocre script by the sheer amount of warmth emitted from chief cast members. Heck, even the overcooked score still manages to evoke emotion where one would feel manipulation in less apt hands.Unfortunately, the cute and intimate performances that provide this popcorn muncher's adorable heart also serve to backfire on the film's small but significant redeeming qualities of emotional substance. For the most part the surprisingly engaging performances overwhelm a majority of fluff provided throughout the predictable outing, with an appreciated amount of detail paid to so many effective nuances, equal parts comedic and dramatic, during the interlocked romantic stories. The women sure do steal the show here though, I guess they all knew who would be watching it. Kate Winslet continues her emotional dominance, unparalleled even when in cinema's most trite of circumstances. Her attempts at more overt humor may pale in comparison to the heart-sweltering realism her dramatic chops bring to even the dullest of lines, but remains enjoyable enough. Surprisingly, Cameron Diaz gives one of her best performances to date, helping to justify her overrated stature with substantial proof of a masterful caricature, complete with an array of subtlety to boot. It is her powerful chemistry between an appropriate Jude Law that will keep the chicks coming back to this flick, sustaining the somewhat corny affair with an inspired Hollywood love affair.Which brings me to the backfiring part. Unfortunately the movie only works half as effectively as it wanted to due to the terrible casting, or acting of Jack Black. I really admire the guy but he obviously has quite a ways to go before conquering the romantic genre, even if it is comedy-based, in which his character resembles an infinitely dorkier version of himself (the only person Black has really mastered playing). Black shines when he is involved with a project near and dear to his offbeat heart, but here he feels awkwardly out of place, and in a very unintentional way. In effect nearly half of the movie's dramatic heft is severed by his inane take, even worse canceling out some of Winslet's moving work (thank goodness for Rufus Sewell adding some romantic dimension to her story), a character misread that seriously undermined the integrity of this light but tight direction.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Would not recommend it.,"I rate this film as 2 out of 10 for the cast and the scenery, otherwise it would be 1 out of 10. It is the only film I have left before the end. The Holiday is a very poor imitation of Bridget Jones, the only difference being that this time you have the American Bridget as well as the English Bridget. The scenery is nice, the script however is hopeless. None of the four stars were able to distract me from the standard of the script. It all felt very forced and so very predictable. It was a very disappointing experience as it had such a good cast who are all capable of so much better. I was not expecting an epic but this film failed to deliver on too many levels. Would not recommend it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Underrated, But Very Heartwarming Transatlantic Yuletide Romantic Comedy from the year 2006","I find The Holiday (2006) is good, Because it's maybe underrated compared to Love Actually (2003), But it's very heartwarming as well. The story is very interesting. It's about the British woman called Iris Simpkins is going to the USA for Christmas and fell in love with the American man named Miles Dumont. Also it's about the American woman called Amanda Woods is going to the UK for Christmas and fell in love with Iris' brother named Graham Simpkins.

An average Nancy Meyers Rom Com,"I chose to watch this movie because almost every woman rates the Surrey cottage as one of their favorite homes on film. It did not disappoint.The film is just ok. I would have rated it higher if the movie was under 2 hours and Cameron Diaz was replaced. Cameron's acting was terrible and I had to stop myself from FF through her lines. Her character was also incredibly shallow and unlikeable. Jack Black also came off as slightly creepy when he delivered certain lines. Winslet, Law, Sewell, and Wallach were outstanding.Winslet's story was a rip off of Bridget Jones. I wish there had been one Christmas love story with one couple. The movie became rather dull with the focus on two stories and Cameron Diaz repeating the same lines over and over throughout in order to convince the audience her character has commitment issues. We got it the first 10 times.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Happy Holidays to the planet's female population,"Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a high strung owner of a LA company that makes movie trailers. She has a nice looking live-in boyfriend but, alas, he cheats on her. And, it's almost Christmas. Meanwhile, in England, Iris, a journalist, learns that the man she has devoted herself to, for the last three years, is becoming engaged to someone else. Both of these gals need a holiday to recover from their losses. On the Internet, there is a website devoted to home swapping, as both Iris and Amanda discover. Getting off their respective continents sounds mighty good to these lovelorn gals. They do it. Amanda heads to England and Iris goes to the City of Angels. Unexpectedly, Amanda meets a good looking guy who happens to be Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) while Iris runs into a nice composer named Miles (Jack Black). Neither lady is looking for romance, having been burned so recently. But, life is what happens when you are busy making other plans, no? This is a movie that will probably resonate with females more than with males, no doubt about it. If this seems unfair criticism, so be it. After all, is every female out there lining up to see Jackass II? We gals deserve a nice romcom, now and then and this year's movie entries have been pitifully few, in this category. All of the principal actors here do a very charming job, with Black a surprising choice as a love interest, a choice that works out nicely. There is plenty of nice dialogue, nice costumes, nice scenery, and nice situations. One inspired concoction is the ""trailers"" Amanda sees for her own life as it unfolds. At times, the whole affair seems just a touch forced but this does not really make the film unlovable. Women, do yourself a favor this holiday. Go treat yourself to a matinée of this pleasant film and visit the local tea shoppe afterwards, for a topper. This movie was made for ladies everywhere to cherish like a beautiful Christmas package, wrapped up in red and gold, and holding a surprising, but very welcome gift, inside.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A feel-good movie,"This is one of my favorite ""feel good"" movies, I must have watched this 5 or 6 times already, and every time i have the same feeling. With just an idea of Christmas flavor, this is more like a romantic movie in my eyes, which is why i watch this all year round. Nice characters (nothing very deep/complex, just nice & charming to the point that you actually care for them as if they are real people and you know them in person), even nicer performance from all, the music is really lovely and the whole atmosphere (the plot, the places...) makes you warm inside, you feel hopeful and kind of happier and remind you that we all need simple things in life. For me, it is just like when i watch the TV series ""Friends""; it is not a movie to be nominated for Oscar, but in all simplicity and romance it actually is a sweet movie that you feel good every single time you watch it.

Holiday rom-com that delivers on what it promises,"The movie is buoyed by the strong lead acting of Winslet, Law and Diaz. Despite the movie showing a very idealised, glammed up version of Los Angeles and a very cozy version of England, it is intimately a story of two love stories. Diaz finds a perfect figure in England that couldn't be shown as a more version of a man for a woman like her. At times Jude law and his story is so saccharine that it seems to be a parody. Whereas Winslet is a more unique situation where they don't really develop her interest thoroughly enough. It's not a good sign when the story with the 90 year old neighbor is more engaging then the romantic interest. Jack black is the odd one out, whose pairing with Winslet does not really work. Yet, it still is a fun holiday movie to watch on a lazy afternoon.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Heartwarming Yet Predictable Romantic Escape,"The cinematic work The Holiday, directed by Nancy Meyers, can be classified as a romantic drama.The narrative is characterised by the exploration of the lives of two young women, Iris and Amanda, during a Christmas vacation. The character of Iris has been in a romantic relationship with a colleague of hers for a period of three years. However, the latter is engaged to be married to another individual. Amanda has a relationship with Ethan. He committed infidelity. The narrative reveals that both womens subsequently experience a period of depression. It is imperative that they extricate themselves from this situation. Iris is from London and Amanda is from Los Angeles. Their connection was facilitated through a home exchange programme for vacation purposes. The decision to engage in a home exchange was made with the intention of taking a break from their respective lives. Following the exchange of residences, the lives of the two women underwent a profound transformation. Iris established a company with Amanda's neighbour, Arthur, an individual of advanced age who had previously been employed in the field of film writing. Additionally, Iris established a friendship with Miles, a composer. Iris assisted Arthur in navigating a ramp in front of a gathering of people who had gathered to show their respect for him. Concurrently, Amanda encountered Graham, Iris's brother, with whom she embarked on a significant relationship. However, it was subsequently revealed that he was a widower with two children. The narrative reveals that the pair subsequently fell in love. The lives of both Amanda and Iris underwent significant change during a holiday. Both women experienced the dissolution of a detrimental relationship and the establishment of new, positive relationships.The narrative was of mediocre quality, but the direction was excellent. The musical score is noteworthy, and the performances are highly regarded. The film is considered to be suitable for a one time watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was way better than I had imagined!,"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I didn't really like it and I didn't have high expectations about it. Eventually, it wasn't as bad as I had imagined and I enjoyed it, a lot. The movie synopsis was interesting, but it wasn't innovative because there are many movies similar to this one. The storyline was unexpectedly well written and well explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The main characters were interesting, well developed and likeable. The casting choices were nice and their performances were descent. In my opinion, it was a nice feel good romance movie and it wasn't boring, at all. The opening scene was predictable and simple. The ending scene was definitely predictable, at least there was a happy ending! Regarding, the cinematography and the score of the movie they were both fine. Overall, ""The Holiday"" was a nice comedy/romance film, kinda funny sometimes, enjoyable and I would probably recommend it to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fall in love with Kate Winslet,"First off, let me tell you. I hate romantic comedies! From the bottom of my heart, they make me sick. But not this one. All because of Kate Winslet...If this movie was all about Kate, maybe it could have earned an 8 or even 9 rating, because she's so lovely and beautiful and helpless... I couldn't resist her, and couldn't help to care about her, even incurring in the ridiculous talk to the screen moments... Even though she would deserve a much more handsome pair, Jack Black ended up being a good match for her.Jack's character, in cold analysis, is one of the best features of the movie, as he is unlikely cast. The thing I hate the most in this kind of movie is that everything is predictable, so an unexpected cast is a breath of fresh air in the style, specially if you're tired of the Ben Affleck/Hugh Grant standard.In the other hand, Cameron Diaz is sooo silly. All her self featured scenes in the movie are just comedy, with no romance in it. Luckily, Jude Law and those lovely little kids of his keep her form drowning the effort for sure. Nevetheless, if the film was all about them both, I have to state that I'd never have reached the end of it.And that's very much everything there is to say about it... The whole work is set in a way tho make Kate's and Cameron's stars shine, without any deeper artistic ambition. And Kate delivers, Cameron, well, she tries...The right company may improve the fruition of this. At least, it worked for me...So, if you like romantic comedy, watch it and enjoy. If you like Kate Winslet, give it a try. But if you don't like neither of them, do like Tom Cruise in Minority Report: Ruuuuuuun!!!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What is it about this film?,"Follows in the footsteps of any vanilla-flavoured romantic comedy really. Two women decide they need change in their lives and switch locations. Mind you, this is not a deliberate search for a new love which is about as cliché as it can get.However, there's something very heartwarming and sympathetic about this story. Perhaps it's the idyllic British setting with its little holiday-themed shops and quirky English cottages that brings the charm, or perhaps it's the retired filmmaker friend in Los Angeles.I have watched this film ever since I was little and it has become the ultimate feel-good film for me. Nothing special, but still, it has a special place in my heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Be the leading lady of your own life, for God's sake!""","Amanda Woods is an LA woman in the movie business with a big mansion and everything going for her until she recently discovered that her boyfriend had been cheating on her behind her back. Across the pond we meet an English journalist Iris Simpkins- a woman who feels she just can't get away from a particular man that enjoys having affairs with her on and off. Recently he becomes engaged to another woman, crushing Iris's heart when he still constantly messes with her after the announcement. Out of heartbreak the two woman meet through a vacation home exchange website and agree to switch places for a few weeks, having a bit of culture shock as Amanda had never experienced the simple life and Iris the riches. Expecting to be on vacation in solitude Amanda meets a Iris's brother and an affair begins, sprouting something bigger than they expected. Iris soon meets a movie composer and a veteran from the golden age of cinema. She befriends the old man and invites the composer with her during each visit as their relationship grows into a deep friendship. As both women's heartbreak starts to mend, the dread of going back starts to sink in as new love heals the injuries of heartbreak's past, changing their lives forever...For a chick flick I must say, despite several clichés in the genre, it is certainly a set of heartwarming stories for the Christmas season. If you ever had the chance to view the trailer and the film both, you'll see that both are completely different. The Holiday will throw your emotions off guard in several scenes. Cameron Diaz's portrayal of Amanda is a double-edge sword of her usual mediocre, whiny, hollow characters throughout her career. Yes, she is quite annoying and typical in this film but actually works for her character when it comes to her development. Despite my disliking for her character I found her scene where she makes a surprise visit to Jude Law's character's home, discovering that he's more than just some random guy to have sex with- but a single father of two daughters with many other insecurities. It's a great scene of vulnerability for the characters on this part of the story and my personal favorite of the film. Kate Winslet's role as Iris is far more interesting though. As damaged goods from an on-and-off affair with a man, it's a far more vulnerable though clichéd performance and yet much more relatable to the target audience. A sweet young girl in a strange town, managing to come across an old man clearly in need. She is unable to resist and helps him out, discovering at his home that he spent the majority of his life as a writing in the golden age of the movie business. She also befriends a music composer of movie soundtracks that joins her in visits with the old man. This part of the story is honestly more interesting and heartfelt. It's not quite romance just yet. It's more of a portrayal of a budding relationship. Jack Black plays the love-interest for Iris. Not the greatest looking guy in the movie but he certainly has a lot of charm (and somehow able to hold some form of class for Jack Black standards, though there is a signature ""Scrubaly-doodaly-doo"" scene present, though surprisingly fitting). Overall the film makes a pleasant surprise of a chick flick that clearly has it's flaws here and there but the film itself knows it as well. It's a simple, entertaining, heartwarming movie that's best watched with a loved one (significant other, mother, grandmother). Come for the unexpected warmth, stay for the tear-jerking moments, leave for the harsh whine of Diaz. Something that could've been a really great modern classic but not quite there yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good alternative to watch at the end of the year festivities.,"Very interesting romantic film from its script. For a movie buff, it will have several hooks that will keep you glued to the screen waiting for more.But let's not deviate. This double story of love and heartbreak contains many elements with which the audience can identify, and it is precisely where the film finds its place.The performances of the choral cast are quite dissimilar, with one pair standing out over the other. Winslet and Law knew how to integrate perfectly into their roles, but Diaz and Black didn't.The soundtrack and the meta-narrative details are an excellent complement, which entertain and become part of the essence of the story.The main negative points, in my opinion, are not minor. Direction and editing have quite noticeable errors that at certain points manage to take you out of the natural flow of the plot. Everything else is of a fairly decent level, without standing out in a good or bad way.The film entertains, excites and makes you believe in love.Recommended as a good alternative to watch at the end of the year festivities.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just What It Should Be,"What can you say about a movie where an adorable little girl looks Cameron Diaz up and down and says very gravely, in a posh English accent, ""You look like one of my Barbies."" In my opinion this is Nancy Meyers's best piece of work. She gets terrific performances from all four romantic leads, the two little girls, and Eli Wallach as a Jewish fairy godmother. Diaz and Law seem like they should obviously fall into bed together. You have to suspend a bit of disbelief at the Winslett-Black couple, but Meyers does a superb job of bringing Winslett plausibly down to Black's level, both in the writing of the character and in physical appearance. Everybody who belongs together gets together, after overcoming obstacles that are entirely within themselves. And, as usual in a Nancy Meyers movie, the interiors are gorgeous.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gorgeous Entertainment in a beautiful wrapper, open the box and love what's inside!","Sometimes I can be such a jerk when it comes to movies. I was so prepared to not like this because it is so glossy and so Hollywood. But it has Kate Winslet and I've never not liked her in any film, not to mention Jude Law who is about the most beautiful man on earth. Both are so natural in their delivery and such is the case here. Cameron Diaz is also a very good actress, why I gave her short shrift is on me, Cameron is fantastic. And then there is Nancy Meyers the director and writer of the film, Meyers knows what women want. We want to be entertained, we want our characters in gorgeous settings, but we want smart dialogue like a 1930s screwball comedy and Meyers always delivers on all counts. I am sorry I waited so long to enjoy ""The Holiday"" but glad I watched this delightful film! Great to see Eli Wallach, (who made it to 98) and was 91 when he played his role, a consummate actor, Bill Macy who played Walter, Beatrice Arthur's husband on ""Maude"" and Shelley Berman (who lived to be 92) all are treated with dignity and not as punchlines.

An entertaining Cameron Diaz vehicle.,"When watching this movie one can only be impressed with Cameron Diaz. This is her movie; her wonderful performance makes this movie work. Although the story is mostly Hollywood fluff and is about as substantive as a cloud in the sky, Ms. Diaz brings life to what would otherwise be a implausible facsimile of an actual story. The always beautiful Kate Winslet is wonderful too but in this movie she definitely plays second fiddle to Ms. Diaz's lead. As for the story itself, it has so many holes in it that there is not enough room to discuss them all. Suffice it to say, this movie is character, not story, driven. The male leads, Jude Law and Jack Black, are to be commended for subordinating themselves to the ladies; after all, this is a movie about two women who do something daring and in the process change their lives. But regardless of what one may think of the story, Cameron Diaz's presence will, for you, make watching this movie an entertaining experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
So cute and so romantic,"This is almost a must to watch in Christmas season. I admit I am not a fan of rewatching the same movies every year, but once in a while this one sneaks in on my watch list on Christmas again.I love the story - even though it is a little cheesy. But the whole movie is carried by the good actors and actresses. Yes, Jude Law is sexy and all - but the performances of all 4 of the main characters is really really good.I like, that it includes all kind of elements in this movie, comedy, tragedy and love story. If there is a small minus to this movie, it's that the character of Iris is a little too sweet for me.

Typical yet somewhat Immaginative Hollywood Chic-Flic,"Another Hollywood cliché story about English Writers, Hollywood Movie Trailer Producers, Music Composers ... does this sound like ANYBODY you can relate to !? The writer, Nancy Myers (of Private Benjamin fame), should go back to her lap-top, and develop a story with REAL people ...I must admit that the home swap was a unique twist, but avoided much of the nuances of actually executing a home-swap vacation (Diaz' house was way too extravagant to swap for an English cottage)Jack Black plays an anti-thesis to his character in Shallow Hall - he gets paired up with the delicious Kate Winslet instead of a morbidly obese Gweneth Paltrow. It's a definite stretch for him in this role - thus making the few romantic scenes between him and Kate uncomfortable to watch. You'd think he would have lost that Tanaeceaous/Nacho Libre gut, but I guess ""that's just him""...Cameron Diaz and Jude Law's characters aren't even worth writing about - cliché all the way.The most evolved relationship in the movie is that between Winslet and Wallach's characters, although once again, even this relationship is ALL Hollywood.See it, but don't expect it to change your life.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's a lighthearted watch that offers a sense of new beginnings and the importance of letting go of things that no longer serve you.The acting is fantastic-big-name actors came together to deliver strong performances, and their chemistry made the movie even more enjoyable. The characters, while not deeply developed, each have distinct personalities that add to the fun. The film explores themes of hope, new opportunities, and embracing change. By swapping places, the women discover a completely different reality, reminding viewers that there's always a bigger world out there waiting to be explored.Visually, the film is cozy and perfectly captures the essence of a holiday movie. The setting and atmosphere are fun and inviting, making it a great addition to any holiday.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not typically my kind of Movie. What a surprise!,"I don't know how many times my wife and I have watched this movie over the years, but it's been a lot.1st time watch: (Two love stories in one here.)The first 15-20 minutes might put a guy off. Grin & bear it! It becomes a great movie.Black/Winslet: Opening scene: Kate Winslet wailing (bawling) over her rotten boyfriend's surprise announcement (at their Co. Party earlier), he's getting engaged to another. Save me!But, with her vacation to CA (from England), all that changed. Just loved Kate's natural look & her character. And what about Black. The pudgy son of a bitch is really charming with a pretty cool naivety about him. He needs to take more roles like this.The development of their relationship is much slower. So much so, they don't even venture a kiss until the end. Still well done. Kudos to Meyers.Law/Diaz: The speed of their relationship development is just the opposite of Black's & Winslet's. It's overnight, literally. Cameron & Jude do a great job. It is these two that get the lion's share of the screen time. (On the rebound) Diaz is dominant, wary, often the non-committal one here, but can't help going for the sweet, and great looking Jude Law.Their journey is MUCH fun as well.Jude's kids: Don't know who the young English girls were in this movie, but they're so adorable, it's just unreal. Just listening to them speak is delightful.The Wallach Bonus: So, Evelyn and I are watching this for the 1st time years ago. Kate's character decides to stop and help a neighbor she's seen before; a really old man who looks lost. Suddenly I scream to my Wife Evie; ""Holy crap! Do you know who that old guy is? She says no. I declare; ""IT'S TUCO! ELI WALLACH! FROM THE GOOD, BAD & THE UGLY!"" (We own it on blu ray since it's a fav of mine so Evie has been forced to see it several times.).Suddenly, Evelyn says ""OH MY GOD BOB! YOU'RE RIGHT! Didn't you say he was in his 50s, when he was Tuco in the GB&U back in 1966?Yes! He was. Which was amazing because he looked less than 40.Turns out he was 91 in this flick, The Holiday. His character was so great, and added sooo much to this movie. OMG!It's simple, this movie may be a bit mushy starting out, but no modern romance movie holds a candle to 'Holiday'.Nancy Meyers writing was so fresh, so original & delightful, often hilarious, that others in this genre do not hold a candle to her. (Same thing with ""Something's gotta give""; original / creative / funny WRITING!) Her direction is extremely good as well.Nancy Myers injected fresh, funny, feel-good elements into the (flailing) ""ROMCOM"" genre. And yes; it was badly needed. She's a real talent. Gotta love that lady.We've shown ""Holiday"" to friends (both guys and gals), to our adult kids and their mates; and others. When you get that many rave reviews, from such a diverse set of people, statistically alone, those collective independent corroborations, indicates a winner. (Based on the number of participants who have viewed this film as a 10, that calculates to a 'confidence level' of around 98.5% with less than 3° of freedom, statistically speaking of course:). Hence, objectively speaking, claiming this movie is a 10, must be an empirical fact.It's a blu ray in our collection. Nancy's best. And that's saying a lot since her other works are excellent.Thx.Bob R.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pleasantly  Surprised,"I believe a few of the acting pieces were weak however, I still enjoyed this film very much. It is somewhat of chick-flick but I think Cameron and Kate are truly lovely and keep the male eye entertained so-to-speak. I actually enjoyed some of the more ""corny"" lines and came away with some perspective on my own life which is what a movie is supposed to do isn't it? Though Mr. Black is charming I'm not too sure about the chemistry with him in the film. I'll also be honest that all I could think about watching Jude Law was that I never noticed he had a speech impediment before and all his tabloid hype of late. I suppose if I could have gotten beyond that it would have been better. It's worth a matinée but not the big money or wait for Netflix.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

So it's pretty much set up for success.And it surely is a success.For a Christmas movie.If it wasn't Christmas this would be a 5!It's got a great cast, but they underperform!

okay for a laugh but Diaz is a pain,"This is a likable little holiday film with all actors being rather predictable. Diaz has always bothered me with the characters she plays. I understand that her character was supposed to be going through a rough time but Diaz always seems to make her character come across as either fake or forced....either way, it makes for a less enjoyable film. I can think of plenty of other actresses who would have added greatly to this ""quaint"" film. Jack Black, Kate Winslet and Jude Law were well cast for their parts. Not deep, nothing we don't already know about ourselves....or others, but overall, nothing spectacular here.

Great...,"I'm not much for romantic comedies. In any case, put Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst, and I'll want to watch it. The plot seems a little too simple for me, and one of those romantic comedies, that are out there, but characters were so cute, and you can't help but cheer on both women, I warmed up more to Kate Winslet's character. A good movie to enjoy if you want a relaxed night in, and a movie that will make you feel warm, and is good to watch. However, I'll still categorize it as for a romantic comedy more for women, and can't imagine a guy watching it. But one of the more interesting romantic comedies, and the characters, espiecially Kirsten Dunst, is not like typical character at a romantic comedy, it was a nice change to still see. The ending was great.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming and slightly under appreciated.,"This film gets it. There are no grand statements, no hidden agendas, just an enjoyable story about relatable people interacting. Not all movies have to move mountains.Someone can identify to some degree with at least one of the characters. This alone could be what makes this movie good... but it doesn't rest on that.The fact that this movie was written with this specific cast in mind makes it worth checking out. On the surface, their dynamic might seem contrived, but I think thats just the point. I think this movie is partially saying 'Throw out your misconceptions about Cameron Diaz, she is worthy of a partner of a different nature, like Jude Law.' and vice versa. As well as 'See beyond the superficial.', riffing with Jack Black can be fun. Even for an actress who has excelled in more of a dramatic sense.Essentially, It is saying love is blind and hits you when you least expect it...And come on, who can't use a dose of that every so often? So, take these four, a fantastic Eli Wallach and solid, decent, meaningful writing and you have an enjoyable 2 hours spent.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent,"I laughed. I cried. I awed. My jaw even dropped a couple of times. This movie surpassed all of my original expectations. At almost two and a half hours, I thought it might drag on, but I never felt like it was really that long. This movie is not only about heartbreak and heart ache, it's about finding yourself and appreciating the true things in life. I felt that Kate and Cameron did a wonderful job. Their characters come from two very different worlds yet they both seek the same thing. They encounter so much more upon arriving at their destinations, and ultimately end up finding the completely unexpected. Jude is a star charmer as always, and Jack, well, he's Jack. I absolutely loved it with all my heart.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too cutesy writing and a waste of amazing actors,"The writer took an interesting concept and waxed cute instead of substantial. I spent the first half hour waiting for the movie to get beyond very predictable ""Cameron"" and ""Kate"" stereotypical moments. Wondered why these actors ever said yes to this script. (Except that everyone is shot in the most Hollywood gorgeous manner - Jude Law and Cameron Diaz couldn't look more delectable.) Given nothing going on in the movie, just cut to Cameron or Jude looking fabulous. Just when I thought the film was a total waste, it did have some very interesting moments. However, you can hear the writing in spite of the fact that each actor is working very hard to make the script work. It was a pleasant enough movie, but I had hoped for so much more, with these four actors. Eli Wallach stole the movie for my tastes.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A typical rom-com;  laughably bad.,"The movie was quite entertaining to watch and had some semi-funny scenes. But it was highly predictable and above-average cheesy, with unrealistically happy characters. Two women with traumatizing back stories swap houses because they both need a vacation, and they both have, well, a hell of a holiday! This movie is an amusing display of how unpredictably stupid and untrustworthy that men can be, and how a movie director will pass all the lines of sappiness to remind us of the magic of Christmas, and that anything can happen within two special weeks. The characters look and act like they belong out of commercials advertising fun vacations for happy families, but the movie does manage to tackle some real-life stuff that a lot of us struggle with, right before providing happy endings for all!

Sweet film amidst the serious pre-Oscar season,"Being virtually the only 'romantic comedy' playing at the moment, I didn't go into the theater with high hopes, just a wishful thought for a light-hearted escape. I got exactly what I was expecting and a tad bit more. The premise was cute, the script was better than average and it was beautifully filmed. The ending was predictable, but what romantic comedy isn't and after all, that's pretty much why we go to see them. My only problem with the film was Cameron Diaz. She got better as the film progressed, but paired next to high caliber actors like Jude Law and Kate Winslet, her overacting was more apparent than ever. She would truly benefit from a good coach who could reign her in and give her a greater emotional range without having to resort to histrionics. Ms. Winslet is able to show more emotion without moving a muscle than Ms. Diaz is waving her arms around, stamping her feet and screaming. But her talents aside, I really did enjoy the film. It was sweet and just what was needed amidst the bigger holiday films and Oscar hopefuls.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Holiday,"The Holiday is another cheesy and corny Christmas movie filled with heartwarming moments and happiness. While it is a classic romantic comedy, this one definitely leans more towards the romantic side of things. That's not to say it's a bad thing. I just wasn't expecting the film to be as serious as it was, at least at times.What makes The Holiday stand out from the crowd of holiday rom-coms, is its commitment to telling a much deeper story. These characters aren't just the hollow carcases that often fill these types of movies. They aren't just a means to an end. And although this movie, just like others in its genre, are filled with the usual cliches and tropes, The Holiday somehow makes them feel less cheesy. While that would normally be the downfall of movies in this genre, the focus and commitment that The Holiday gives to its characters, makes it feel justified.
As far as the comedy goes, it feels much more polished and deliberate than usually. Every quip or funny remark suits the situation it's in and feels uncharacteristically natural for a movie like this. Indeed, I'm starting to feel that The Holiday shouldn't even be grouped with most other Christmas rom-coms. It feels too nicely crafted. In fact, it almost feels like a movie that has some other purpose, in addition to making us feel jolly and warm and happy.The premise here is a fun one. We find ourselves in the midst of two women who have just gone through break-ups. Looking to get away from everything, they swap lives and homes for two weeks. As faith would have it, they both find love from their new temporary homes and are faced with the realization that eventually they will have to return to their normal lives. To make matters worse, the American finds herself in England and, you guessed it, the Brit finds herself in the US. It all adds up to a fun story that also leaves a lot of time for more emotional and serious scenes. And while these 'serious' scenes are well crafted and feel more genuine than the ones you'd find in the typical holiday rom-coms, they, unfortunately, lack impact. Whether or not these scenes were actually supposed to be particularly emotional to the viewer, remains a bit of a mystery to me. I certainly didn't find them as moving as some of the ones you'd find from the more cheesy movies in the genre. To be fair, none of the emotional scenes in this film felt like they were purposely crafted to make me tear up, as often is the case within this genre.One of the most notable things about The Holiday is its length. You normally expect to spend maybe around one and a half hours with movies like this. With The Holiday, however, you are looking at over two hours. This increase in length brings both good and bad things. Since this film is so focused on building the characters, it was necessary to make a longer film. And certainly, by the end of it, the payoff feels more satisfying and personal, as I had spent more time, and gotten to know the characters. But, making a longer film also means that the runtime has to be filled with something. And unfortunately, at times, The Holiday fails to fill it with anything meaningful. There are a few slow and uninteresting sections that end up making the film feel unnecessarily long. As such, I do feel like the movie could've been a bit tighter. Losing some of the most redundant scenes would've not only increased the pace and intrigue, but I feel like it would've also kept me far more interested.At the end of the day, though, The Holiday is a Christmas rom-com. Its intention was never to be a masterpiece of any sorts, but instead to provide laughter and entertainment and holiday cheer. And all those things, it does wonderfully. This film is tremendously cosy and homey. Watching it during the holidays with snow falling outside, feeling happy and calm, is exactly the kind of experience that I look for in these movies. And The Holiday delivers just that experience. As cheesy and predictable as it is, it's still a wonderful time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Ho, Ho, Holiday romance.","'The Holiday (2006)' is a festive rom-com that somehow runs for over two hours, making it a good deal longer than it has any right to be. It follows two women who each experience a heartbreak and decide to swap houses for the Christmas period so they can go through it alone in an entirely different location. However, fate intervenes and sends them just the men they need to get over their past loves. Positioning their new relationships almost as what saves them from their old ones is a bit problematic, I suppose, but the picture mostly dances around the issue by giving the protagonists commitment issues (on opposite ends of the spectrum) which they learn to overcome. One of the narratives is far more focused on this sort of internal development than the other, as Kate Winset's plotline more-or-less just chucks in a romance with Jack Black as a little bonus (a lot of it concerns her relationship with an ageing screenwriter, portrayed by the wonderful Eli Wallach, who helps to bring her out of her shell). This is the more interesting side of the story, for sure, but it's not given as much time as the other, far more conventional side. Thankfully, that side - which chronicles the fish-out-of-water affair between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law - is sweet and bouncy and entirely watchable. It's exactly what you'd expect from a schmaltzy, feel-good romance, but it's well-executed and does exactly what it needs to. The stuff set in L. A. is more interesting simply because it's ever-so-slightly less conventional, but it still hits pretty much all the beats you'd imagine (yet is no less successful because of it). Kate Winslet and Jack Black aren't really given enough time for their relationship to blossom and, as such, it isn't all that believable they'd fall for one another. There's a scene where Kate Winslet is acting her heart out during an eloquent and sentimental speech about how broken she feels and then Jack Black just swears, says ""you need this more than I do"" in the most Jack Black way possible and hands her a drink. Still, it's a nice enough dynamic that it doesn't feel especially jarring when they inevitably come together as the finale approaches. That's kind of the best way to describe the piece as a whole really; it's a bit rough around the edges and entirely too safe, but it all comes together surprisingly nicely. It's a good version of a generic, slightly unbelievable thing. There are a handful of chucklesome moments, a few pieces of successful sentimentality and a general formal competence that keeps you engaged despite an often uneven and slightly strange pacing. It's definitely too long, but it's also enjoyable enough for what it is. It also serves as a decent movie to watch towards the end of the year, as it starts around Christmas and ends on New Years Eve.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Painfully contrived, far too long","I knew what I was getting myself into when I accompanied some friends to this movie. I knew it was a ""chick flick"" but I didn't dislike it for this reason, I disliked it because it was a lesson in bad film making regardless of genre. The plot is so contrived that from the outset you just don't believe the characters are real. Horrible screen writing, chock full of expository speech, you don't have to draw your own conclusions about the characters because their only actions are explaining what they think about themselves and the other characters. Jack Black is laughable as a romantic lead, and I do mean laughable because its hard not to laugh at how bad he is. His romantic gaze comes off as downright creepy. Diaz, Law and Winslet try really hard but the dialog is so bad that they have very little to work with. I'll give credit where it's due, Law is the only one that rises above the horrible script to inject some life and charm in his character. You can see why Diaz likes him, but not the other way around. And the Winslet, Black romance is just strange. Oh and did I mention that its over 2 hours long? The final painful detail, is that there is a subplot about an old Hollywood screenwriter (played by Eli Wallach quite well) and this leads to all sorts of idealism about great storytelling that is quite ironic in this film. There are a bunch of ""awww"" moments and some funny moments that will make the film watchable for non-discerning film goers, but on the whole this is just a bad movie, and I wish I could have those two hours of my life back.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

the cross cultural aspect interested me,like most guys i'm not into romance flicks the only reason i first rented the movie was because i was interested in the cross cultural aspect of the movie. other than that the movie seemed rather mush. It seems to center around the tired old Hollywood story line of English guy meeting American gal and falling in love. of course in this film the English girl hitched up with an American guy but that aspect was glossed over it. the scene where grahams girls right away warmed up to amanda like she was a favorite aunt was unreal. normally kids are wary of adults they never met before. when i saw mr napkin it reminded me of the kkk. eli wallachs role was interesting especially comparing his role in this film to the bad guys he played in the spaghetti westerns. but all in all this ain't a movie i 'd add to my DVD collection,7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Of course, veteran actress, Kate Winslet is always perfect. The inclusion of Eli Wallach adds depth to the story and gives me another reason to love this movie.

A Seasonal Feel good worth a look,"There's no big surprises to set apart this romantic comedy in its essence; all of our characters sharing the same ups and downs we've seen before over dozens of movies. But thats not why women and men (reluctant or otherwise)in their droves turn out to see this genre. What's needed are characters with depth and natural charm you find yourself caring about, their well natured but problematic lives willing us on to root for their happiness. With an uncomplicated but softly charming script and amiable performances from Kate Winslet and Jack Black in particular, this film certainly delivers. Black plays Winslet's new laid back L.A friend perfectly; his lovable humour not commanding centre stage as in his other performances, a welcome change to see in this obviously versatile actor. Another side to Jude Law's character also reveals itself to be more human than the Alfie one might have assumed earlier on. It's a very human story, wanting someone you cant have, not knowing who or what you really want, then finding it when you least expect it. Its a story you may have heard before, but one well worth listening to again in The Holiday. Its likable, warm spirited characters that come together in believable circumstances provide an engaging and enjoyable 2 hours. As romantic comedies go, this one is definitely worth your time. Not because it'll blow you away, but because it'll draw you in to the lives and loves of these characters with each other, an experience not hugely disagreeable. I would give this film a solid 7.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A pleasant holiday,"Cameron Diaz plays Amanda, workaholic owner of a movie trailer production company. Amanda lives in a huge, beautiful home in Los Angeles. Kate Winslet plays Iris, newspaper society column writer. Iris lives in a quaint old cottage in Surrey, outside of London. Both Amanda and Iris experience romantic disappointments just in time for Christmas. Alone and depressed at home is no way to spend the holiday season. Through a home swap website the two women find each other and find their solution. They will swap homes for two weeks. In that tried and true romantic comedy formula it will prove to be two weeks that will change their lives.Initially it appears Iris has gotten much the better of the deal. She revels in the luxuries of Amanda's swanky digs. Meanwhile Amanda is well and truly out of her element in the small cottage in the English countryside. On day one she plans to fly back home on day two. But then there's a knock on the door in the middle of the night, Iris' inebriated brother Graham looking for a place to sleep. Hey, you don't suppose Amanda and Graham might fall for one another do you? As I said, tried and true romantic comedy formula. Back in Los Angeles things are going well for Iris. She meets some interesting people, most notably Arthur, an old man with quite a life story. He was a writer during the Golden Age of Hollywood and he and Iris strike up an unusual and thoroughly charming friendship.The film meanders quite a bit, bouncing back and forth between Amanda and Iris. It does drag at times, at 136 minutes long the film is probably a half hour or so too long for its own good. It's rather predictable, sticking to its formula though it does manage to spring a good surprise or two. For much of its running time the film is much more focused on Amanda and Diaz than on Iris and Winslet. Which is a shame because Iris is a much more likable, embraceable character than Amanda. Plus, it's nice to see Winslet in a lighthearted romantic comedy, just having fun. We know she's a great actress, here she gets a chance to just be funny and enjoy herself and she does very well with the opportunity. Not that Diaz is bad, she does well with her part as well and eventually some of Amanda's rough edges do wear down allowing that character's story to become more enjoyable. The pairing of Diaz and Jude Law, playing Graham, works well. Law is perfect playing a cad, albeit a charming cad. And just when you think you've got his character pegged his story goes to some surprising, interesting places. Meanwhile the pairing between Winslet and Eli Wallach, playing Arthur, is tremendous. Two magnificent performers bringing the best out of one another. Of course to fit the formula we need a romantic interest for Winslet's character so enter Jack Black. Jack Black? Certainly not the conventional choice for a romantic leading man but it works. Yes, even Jack Black is charming in this movie. The Holiday is no work of great, classic cinema.

Warm-hearted if somewhat fanciful,"If only there were villages in Surrey, England that looked this pretty in snow - come that, if only there were snow in Surrey, which there hasn't been in any quantity for years. Still, the good folks of Shere will have enjoyed some of Universal's finest white stuff when this was filmed, apparently in high summer. Kate Winslett carries the film, ably assisted by Jude Law. For me, both Cameron Diaz and Jack Black were miscast, though I too enjoyed the Dustin Hoffman cameo. I was pretty fidgety during the first 30 minutes, thinking it was all going to be too hammy for words, but then the characters kicked in and, in true make-believe fashion, I just let it all wash over me like warm chocolate. Not many laughs - in fact only one - and not much emotion-grabbing either, but just before Christmas with a full brain, it was great relaxation",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic rom-com,You can actually like this movie if you watch it without thinking it too much. It is filled with the most cliche romantic things in Hollywood movies.

This is what a Hallmark movie should be,"Multiple stories in one movie: Christmas time, completely different locales, people desperately trying to make sense of the tragic loves and mistakes in their lives, and finding new loves and adventures... and having just a wee bit of PG-13 sex (the always-missing spice in Hallmark movies).So an English country-girl woman finding herself in an L. A. mansion, and a SoCal exotic woman finally finding herself in an Olde England town (surrey), complete with a handsome widower and two charming moppets.And the English girl draws a curmudgeonly Hollywood icon (""Tuco"") out of his shell and finding a new love, to boot.What's not to like about this movie?

I love this despite the music!,"After watching and rewatching several Nancy Meyers films I realized that the common theme for me is that the character I always dislike the most is the original score. For this film, it's ironic because two of the characters (Miles and Amanda's ex) are composers. The music is dominant in this film and requires me to turn down the volume at times. The Holiday is of course corny (a reference to Iris saying she wants more corny in her life), which isn't a bad thing, but it's so thick and relies more on the music to deliver the sweet romance than letting the writing stand for itself. It's possibly helpful in this film because the acting is so unbalanced. The British actors pull more than their weight in the acting department than the Americans do. It's especially apparent when Cameron Diaz is by herself trying to convey stress or boredom or other feelings while not having anyone to talk to. That said it's a real treat to watch this every few months. Its really fun and the predictability is what I love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

(Exactly the same thing happens in Tara Road)I cannot believe Maeve Binchy is not getting royalties for this. It is the most blatant case of plagiarism I have ever witnessed.

Would be better with the sound off,"I'm serious. The sets are gorgeous, the cast is attractive, but the dialogue is maddening and the plot defies reality in ways that are brazen even for a rom-com. It is a given that everyone has unlimited amounts of money AND no time commitments. Kate Winslet has a relatively low-level newsroom job, yet she can impulsively get leave time covering both Christmas and New Year's, with no advance notice. She commutes from a spot so distant that there seem to be no two-story buildings within 10 miles. And she manages to get back and forth even though route involves a mile-long stretch of road that is deemed impassable by someone who drives cars for a living.The most insulting offense accompanies the scene setting up the home exchange. There are numerous shots of people typing text onto computers or reading text on phones - text like ""vacation ideas"" or ""is tomorrow too soon?"" And while the screen is showing us nothing but this text, the director chooses to help us by having both characters be the kind of person who pronounces every word out loud as she types or reads it. Viewing with the sound off preserves almost all the enjoyable aspects of the movie while eliminating many of the eye-rolling components.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A perfect romantic Christmas film of heartbreak and finding love,"Don't we love Christmas movies? E.g. Movies that make us feel fuzzy and feel good inside? This is one such movie. This movie tells parallel stories of two women (Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz) each both having freshly coming out of heartbroken relationships. Overcome with emotions, they impetuously decide to swap homes across the the globe to getaway and have a holiday. Unexpectedly for them, love and romance ensures. It is refreshing to see a story told from a woman's perspective. We see portrayed very sensitively the various emotions that women feel as they experience events in their life. E.g. The joys and the sorrows, the anguish and the excitement and everything in-between. Women are emotional beings more so than men.Moreover, this film explores the themes of romantic interpersonal relationships, dating and love. It is a movie for young adults who want to watch a movie about romantic love, heartbreak and finding new love. The winds of change is in the air for these heartbroken souls as their destiny of finding love unfolds. What I like about this movie is that universal themes of love and romance are explored in this movie, themes we all desire and can relate to. E.g. We see the flirting glances of budding new love, to dating and getting to know someone, how the guy makes a move and kisses her, how he makes her laugh, to boldly confessing feelings to one another. We also see how the movie explores the idea of long-distance relationships and potential complications that go with that.Also, it is interesting how we form mental pictures of people in our minds based on snap judgements on how they behave or act. Only for the mental picture to reverse and change once we get to know them better. E.g. We may think a guy is hitting on a girl when he is just saying hello. Or how a guy appears to be greeting his girlfriend when he is meeting his sister. This film touches on this play of perceptions.Having watched a few romantic movies, this movie reminds me slightly of the email correspondence in You've Got Mail as the women exchange emails with one another. There is a subtle homage to the film When Harry Met Sally when Cameron Diaz's character meets her love interest (I won't spoil it). The film also features a classic romantic scene where a person realizes the errors of their ways and starts running after their lover filled with passion.All in all, I recommend this as a solid romantic movie with a Christmas theme that will definitely put you into a feel-good romantic mood by the end of it. An enjoyable watch and highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I love a good romantic comedy...,"...and this ain't it. Wait for a rental...or better yet, a cable viewing.Don't get me wrong. The performances were fine (with Diaz trailing behind the others), the direction was adequate and the cinematography was lovely. What this movie suffers from is bad writing.It almost seems silly to complain about the predictability of a romantic comedy because the genre is usually pretty predictable as a whole. Boy meets girls, someone does something stupid or some unforeseeable tragedy threatens their relationship, love conquers all and they live happily ever after.What makes or breaks a movie in this genre is HOW they go about it. In this case, the story was weak - in believability, romance and the comedy (there was only one good laugh in the whole movie). The set-ups were so transparent that there are no surprises. Everything happens exactly as expected...no twists.I'd have been angry if I paid to see it.I rated this movie a 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
An incredibly beautiful movie with many things that make it special,"When I first heard of The Holiday, I thought it was going to be an good movie, and it was much much better. When it's mainly an Drama, it has also elements of comedy. The story is about 2 girls, Amanda and Iris, which have a lot of problems in love and they enter desperately in a house exchange website to have a little bit of help in her lives. And then a lot of tings starts to happen, making Amanda's and Iris's lives better, in many aspects. The movie is filled with hope, love, and a lot of drama. But lets see, the acting is incredibly good, with such a great cast as Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Jack Black and even Eli Wallach this movie has an incredibly depth script which will make you cry, laugh and hope that everything in your life has solution. The music is one of the top points of the movie, Hans Zimmer made an awesome soundtrack that's beautiful, charming and deep, also in the movie some songs appear which are also good, as Let Go by Frou Frou or The Killers Mr. Brightside. everything IN HERE MAKES AN BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. I've seen this film 30+ times, and each time I discover something, and every time I cry, laugh, it's an awesome film which deserved more.

The Best Feel Good Movie This Year!!!!,"Nancy Meyers is Brilliant!!! Every movie she makes is a smörgåsbord of emotions, that you spend days re-thinking and feeling. She is in touch with all our feminine sides. The Holiday is now my most favorite movie of all time. Nancy has a wonderful talent of combining actors with great chemistry, that is so tangible on the screen, that we ourselves can feel the same things they are thinking and feeling. It's magical!!! Cameron and Jude were so sexy and very real as they interacted. I think I would have picked someone else besides Jack Black for Kate, but that's my opinion. Nancy made the film so interesting and exciting by going back and forth between the two women's lives. I can't say enough good things about this movie.

Cameron Diaz is really cute, Jack Black is deeply touching, Jude Law has an interesting character less superficial than it seems (but I am not going to spoil the story and tell you why) and Kate Winslet is simply just great. I love that actress, especially since I saw her in Sense and Sensibility, another movie that I recommend. The story of The Holiday is charming, funny but also moving, and it is not something you have already seen. It has a special touch. Music is perfect, absolutely perfect.

Not so hot,"About two minutes into the movie I was ready to leave, certain I knew where it was going and tired already of Carmen Diaz Two and one half hours later I sure wished I'd followed my instinct. Less than my money back I wanted the time wasted on this insipid stem-winder. It all seemed so promising - Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Ed Burns... I hoped they would tone down Diaz and the ever-awful Jack Black. Wrong. When Burns exited stage right before the first reel, I wished I'd gone with him.

Refreshingly witty and wonderful !!!,"This is a movie with genuinely good acting. The delivery is wonderful, the acting is sincere and the emotion seems genuine. And the writing is so refreshing that it had me laughing like crazy at all the little ""interludes"" incorporated into this movie.The story progresses at a near perfect pace. It has it's twists and turns and it's wonderful. This movie is like a movie text book. It tells you how it's made in the movies (literally) and then they do it in the movie or you realize it's just been done.This is definitely a most creative way of delivering a story to the big screen, I mean watching this movie is like hearing your self commenting about it while you're watching it. So here you don't need to do it because as soon as you think it there it is actually being said in the movie. It's truly amazing and you'll understand what I'm saying when you see it for your self.And I know I've said it several times before but I'll say it again  The acting is really good! I honestly didn't know that Cameron Diaz cold act a totally different role than her usual stereotype blonde characters, but she is so natural at this that it's amazing. I never liked her before and this movie made me change my opinion of her.Kate Winslet is up to her par as well, as for the male leads, all of them play their role with so much tact that it makes you wonder how many times did they shoot the scenes over and over till they got the feeling just perfect.So it's two thumbs up for the writer/director, she knew exactly what to write and exactly how to get it on screen.

A Wonderful Rom-Com!,"There is so much to love about this movie. At first glance, it looks like a typical rom-com style movie. However, I appreciated how much this movie has to offer. First, the strength of the cast. There is a huge A+ cast in this movie, ranging from Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jack Black, to Rufus Sewell, John Krasinski, and even a cameo from Lindsay Lohan. The acting is simply top notch, along with a top notch script. Furthermore, I love the storyline. It's such a wonderful premise for this movie. And finally (but certainly not last) is the score. Hans Zimmer knocked it out of the park with this soundtrack. In my opinion, the music is another character within this film (as it should be).

Jack Black Wasn't Miscast,"Some reviewers here seem to think that Jack was miscast opposite Kate Winslet.

I'm surprised that more folks aren't criticizing Cameron Diaz's performance over Jack's. I think all four of them are appropriately cast, but IMO if there's one semi-weak link, it's Cameron. I love her to death, but she's not on the same level as Kate Winslet or Jude Law. She gets the job done and it's hard to picture another actress in the role, but I don't believe that Jack Black is the film's weak point. No, it wasn't gonna win any Oscars, but the film is a perfect and entertaining holiday flick. And it's also ripe for rewatching.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Terrible, probably the worst film I have ever seen","I am not a member of this site but felt so strongly about this film that I joined on the spot!I would have given this film zero if possible.The characters are thin enough to see through, the plot is awful and Cameron Diaz's overacting makes you feel faintly nauseous. Kate Winslet spends every scene looking embarrassed to be caught in such a turkey and Jude Law wrestles with the dreadful Amercianised English. The plot holes are large enough to drive a van through and the scenes are far too long, insulting the audience by repeating facts endlessly. The film is also quite imbalanced, as it is meant to be a story of two halves, however, the plot mostly revolves around Diaz's trip and her gradual humanisation.The comedy is non-existent, the only vaguely amusing part was the bit that was used in the trailers, however, it was actually much funnier and snappier when trimmed in the trailer!The final straw was a casual mention of Cary Grant being from Surrey, as a proud Bristolian whose family actually knew Archie Leech's (Cary Grant's real name) I was appalled to hear this rubbish!The only nice bit is that the clothes are quite lovely, but please, this is not a reason to watch such drivel.

Who wouldn't want to stay in Amanda's LA Spanish villa and the whimsical cottage in the outskirts of London. Truly a fabulous film.

His one complaint was that the women in the theater (about 95% of the audience) all sounded incredibly close to orgasm every time Jude Law appeared on screen. The plot, or rather, the way the plot unfolds, reminds me of Love Actually. (The Holiday wasn't quite as complicated since there were really only five important characters.) I laughed, sighed, and cried, and plan to see it again with my girl friends soon. I'll also be buying it the minute the DVD is released.

"Not believable, cliched story with little chemistry between the couples","I'm not sure why others liked this film. For me it was unbelievable that there would be chemistry between the two couples. Cameron Diaz plays a shallow LA Barbie type who meets a sophisticated English type, Jude but they want us to believe they fall instantly in love. The other story has Kate Winslet and Jack Black falling in love which is equally unbelievable. In fact the character Jack plays doesn't seem real. We didn't even finish this poor offering from tinsel town. The writers threw in a part about the older screen writer who was Kate's neighbor and that part was a tad interesting but once again too cliched, too Hollywood.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Movie Bar One Big Mistake,"I never write reviews about movies but this movie even though I enjoyed it has actually spurred me to make an IMDb account just to make this review! So basically let me get to the meat of it! After my partner and I finished watching this movie which in itself was actually a good movie we both agree that there is one glaringly apparent issue that needs to be addressed. And that is the choice of cast. So in a nutshell this movie could have been fantastic if it wasn't for the usual lame acting by Jack Black. It boggles my mind why in the world the choice to cast Jack Black in this movie even crossed the minds of the director?? His typical low quality immature acting and inability to play anything but a non serious role has literally bought this move down from being a fantastic movie to a movie that was good but annoying at the same time. His character has no depth due to him, and amongst the rest of the great acting his naffness stood out like a quadriplegic goat trying to swim with swans. Yes the story was actually really good but next time don't do your movie a disservice by expecting Jack Black to play a serious role. He is just one of the many actors that can only play the one exact same character in every movie they do, there are plenty of way better actors that could have played this role 10x better. Verdict: Good movie let down by one bad casting choice.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's about Love, Actually","Although this is indeed a chick flick, I hope men will enjoy the show. Unlike all other Nancy Myers films, this one is actually entertaining and sweet. I loved it, the audience had a great time, and there was applause at the end credits. It will be one of my favorite Christmas movies.Favorite scenes: Hannukah party and Eli Wallach's performance throughout the entire film. The Santa Ana winds was also a nice touch, it makes me miss Christmases in San Diego (just for a moment).It's odd, but the love stories are not what make this film so good to me. It was the friendship between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach's characters. They brought each other back to life. I especially love how he told her not to be the supporting actress in life, but to be the starring role.There's a romantic love of Old Hollywood in the movie that was magical in a way. It was nice to hear what Eli's character had to say about his past and to hear him and Iris discuss great women in film (Stanwyck and more).Another good touch, which is seldom done in contemporary romantic comedies, is closure between Kate's character and the character Rufus Sewell plays in the film. There's no loud fight or over-the-top Bridget Jones action, it was a bittersweet moment, but filled with emotion and thought.Jude Law played his part very well, as did Jack Black. Cameron Diaz was cute, but nothing spectacular there. Finally, the cameo from Dustin Hoffman was a hit with the audience.This is one movie that I plan to see again in the theaters this Holiday season.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I thought that Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet were well-cast and put in good performances. I thought that Jack Black was under-used in a comedic sense but it was nice to see him in a 'straight' role. For me though, the real star was Jude Law, who knew he could do romantic comedy? He was excellent! I've never really warmed to his acting before (maybe I was watching the wrong films) but he was so sweet and funny (in a heartbreaking way) in this film, that you couldn't help but fall in love with his character.The locations are very film-like.

Leave the theater happier than when you entered,"I really liked The Holiday. Normally I wouldn't see it since it's rated only (right now) a 6.5/10 on IMDb, but a gal friend of mine highly recommended it. I took a chance on it, and was rewarded with a fun, satisfying evening for one. That is, I'm a single, 29 year old, straight male...who likes chick flicks--or pretty much any movie that's well made, genuine, and makes me feel better about life. Who needs dark and depressing movies to beat us over the head with what we already know: life sucks. Moving on. The Holiday struck me as really speaking to the nature of romance in the 21st century. But then, I'm a child of the era, so maybe it's just a limitation of my perspective, but I think that anymore our communication skills--as a society--have diminished to the point where romance gets more and more challenging. Rather than organically connecting with someone through light, harmless, small-talk, we interrogate them--if we're interested--and don't speak to most, at all, if we're not. We have email conversations, IM conversations, and telephone conversations, but fall on our face when confronted with actually genuinely connecting with others, face to face. This is unfortunate, and sometimes tremendously intimidating. Dates become job interviews, and people that may actually be a good match for each other dismiss each other because--in the course of the interview--they didn't see the spark of...whatever they're looking for.I felt like The Holiday somehow managed to encapsulate the nature of modern dating, and the issues that make falling in love so challenging these days. I left the theater feeling like, just maybe, I wasn't completely romantically hopeless--even at 29 or beyond. Yes, the time it takes to find that love, and the loneliness and frustration that will be experienced in that time, may be arduous...but, ultimately, it is worth it. This movie connected with me, and left my life a little better, if only for a short time. And that, is priceless in its own way. See it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Have a cup of steaming hot chocolate with you, for the full effect.","Writer/director Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, Something's Gotta Give) obviously knows how to make movies for her female target audience. The trailer pretty much explains the plot: Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Iris (Kate Winslet) swap homes over the holidays to get over their heartbreaks and end up in complicated situations, involving men of course, in their adopted getaways.Amanda has the amazing bod, wardrobe, dream home plus a fantastic job as a movie trailer maker, but suffers from a cheating boyfriend (Ed Burns). She meets Graham (Jude Law), a fiercely attractive and mysterious book editor. It's refreshing to see Law play a sensitive non-cad, for once; he is still incredibly charming. Sweet and thoughtful Iris works in publishing as well, but her kindness is abused by her ever ineligible ex (Rufus Sewell). She meets Miles (the always-fun Jack Black), who is also in the creative business, doing musical scores for films.The characters are all flawed, highly relatable and likable. Even the supporting cast and cameos are all welcome additions and don't appear as afterthoughts. The scenarios, despite the obvious tragedies, make you very willing to escape to this world for 2.5 hours, inordinately long for this genre.Ladies, watch this wonderful chick-flick with your closest amigas; men, see it for educational purposes. Anti-romcom (romantic comedy)? Go see it anyway for the pretty good soundtrack furnished by Imogen Heap, The Killers and Jet. Have a cup of steaming hot chocolate with you, for the full effect.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
SERIOUS PLOT HOLE!,"Cameron Diaz shares an unforgettable scene with Kate Winslets dog, funny and heartwarming. BUT we do not see the dog again in the rest of the film!! Who was caring for him? How did he feel about Jude Law and Cameron's whirlwind romance?? Do Jude Laws girls like dogs?? If so, are they looking to take the dog on?? So many questions left unanswered.

Intriguing story of romance,"I don't know why this does not get a 10, while it is very hard to rate a movie since so different people are please by different aspects in a movie this was a truly creative romance story.When I say creative I mean that it didn't take fancy lights or characters dressed up in costumes to make it what it was. Like a good book is meant to draw you to it, I mean, the writer's job is to tell the story and both have you stay truly interested as well as feel it the way the writer feels it.This is why I liked ""The Holiday"", I feel it truly, from beginning to end, managed to both keep me glued to it as well as the ability to really feel what the writer was trying to portray. That is where I say by definition, I would think the writer really hit the mark, the mark of course being a 10.OK, now about what I really felt, not only did I love the movie, the story line but this is not what I consider a one shot (another words, a movie I see once then i'm done). This movie is able to put me in a mood and for that, it is a movie I would watch again from time to time. I hope others enjoy it as much as I have but I strongly recommend, at least see it once, you'll probably want to see it again, even more than once.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have to say I do not favor Jack Black, but he did a great job in this movie, and Kate Winslet looked absolutely amazing. The perfect romantic comedy for the holiday season or just anytime.

A movie that made me happy to be in love.,"Unfortunately the first 15 minutes or so of The Holiday were ruined by a group of punks who had sneaked into the movie to raise mayhem. However, after security came and removed them, I enjoyed the rest of the movie. The Holiday is a love movie...and sometimes love movies are cliché. Not with The Holiday. The Holiday was just a very touching, funny, and heartwarming movie that made me happy to be in love. It is entertaining. The acting is solid, and I have to give it to Jack Black especially...he really proved himself. Jude Law is Jude Law...one of the finest actors of our time. The movie makes you appreciate life. It is a great date movie.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, Yes. But it's a fun Christmas movie","Yes, it's predictable. It's basically an $85 million Lifetime Christmas movie with 4 brilliant actors and Cameron Diaz. But it's a fun movie, and Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach is the relationship you really want to see more of. Eli is masterful, and Kate is wonderful interacting with him. And Jack Black is well suited to play the music loving funny guy. Even Jude Law puts on a great performance.The only thing that takes away any chance of being a highly rated movie is Cameron Diaz. She's a horrible actress, and just about any other actress could have pulled it off better.So if you're looking for a big budget lifetime Christmas movie, this really is a great option (but don't hesitate to fast forward through all of Cameron Diaz's parts, and unit only makes the movie better).",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good romantic comedy,"The Holiday is an entertaining romantic comedy. It's about four affluent thirtysomethings who have been unlucky in love. The characters are charming and likable. It could have been made in the 1930s but the best comedies in those days had sharper dialog, better acting and a little more polish.Iris (Kate Winslet) is a reporter working for a London newspaper. She is in love with a fellow journalist (Rufus Sewell) and has conducted and on-off relationship. When Jasper announces his engagement to someone else she realizes she has been used. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a successful, workaholic movie-trailer producer who lives in LA. She discovers that her live-in lover (Edward Burns) has been unfaithful and she promptly kicks him out of the house. Iris and Amanda, who have never met, decide they need a change of country and exchange homes over Christmas.Iris moves into Amanda's luxurious mansion in LA as Amanda occupies Iris's tiny cottage in snowy England. Iris falls for Hollywood composer Miles (Jack Black). Amanda has a relationship with Iris's book editor brother Graham (Jude Law). The men are kind, sensitive and have the potential to be perfect movie husbands. It's a fairly predictable feel good movie, but I enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent Movie,"Many people have told me that they think the movie The Holiday is a terrible ""chick flick"". I happen to disagree with them. Each time I watch this movie it is just as pleasurable as the last. The Holiday is an excellent movie and will captivate your heart, jar you for a couple tears, and make you laugh all at the same time.The Holiday is about two women, one living in Los Angeles and the other in London, who are fed up with their love lives, disgusted and disappointed with men, and looking to get away from home. Coincidentally, these two women meet up over the internet on a home exchange website and they decide to swap homes and cities for a couple weeks over Christmas. Each of these women lived in totally different lifestyles, but to them the switch was a refreshing change of scenery. Both of them left their homes over Christmas to get away from love gone terribly wrong, but on their vacations they run into friends and family of the person they swapped homes with and fall into love all over again. To their relief this love brings them happiness and enjoyment, not sorrow and disappointment.I love this movie because it appeals precisely to my interests and personality. Instead of horror movies with frightening plots, I enjoy movies with an emotional storyline; movies that appeal to my heart and will bring out a more soft, kind, caring, and loving person in myself. The Holiday showed me the joy of love and how beautiful it is. However, I understand that most guys in our realistic world today do not enjoy ""chick flicks"" and love stories, or are afraid to admit it if they do. Guys that like movies such as The Holiday are thought of as ""softies"" or ""unmanly"", and at times made fun of for enjoying such a foolish pleasure. Despite this opinion towards guys like me, I still love watching this movie and will always regard it as one of my favorites.Everyone that watches The Holiday will not be able help themselves from laughing, smiling, and crying through this incredible movie. The Holiday is a touching film; one that will take you by the heart, stir you up, and make you a better person inside. You will not be able to help but feel the happiness and excitement of love that is presented in this movie. Everyone longs to be loved by someone in their lives, and with true love comes a happiness that you cannot find anywhere else. The Holiday takes you down a road of frustrated love gone wrong, to a spectacular finish of true love in its fullest entirety. Human nature is based around love and the beauty, prosperity, and enjoyment that sprouts from it. This movie defines how incredible true love really is, and everyone will enjoy this feeling from watching The Holiday.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kate Winslet simply makes the movie!,"The writing is, at times, hokey and formulatic, but not a one of the leading stars are without their due talent, though Kate Winslet as Iris outshines the lot of them. She as an actress radiates just as her character does, and it is she and she alone who make the Los Angeles storyline the best out of the two. She is simply adorable, while Cameron Diaz is a bit too work-aholic commit-a- phobic for my taste. Her eventual romance is obvious the instant one lays eye on the object of her affection, while Iris goes through a bit more character development and has a bit more depth than the other leading lady. Jude Law is adorable, perhaps as a result as the fictional family resemblance? Jack Black is funnily awkward, as he is meant to be, making his persona flawed to perfection. This movie is quite a good way to spend a night with nothing better to do, and, in my humble opinion, as I am sure all reading can already assert from reading thus far, Kate Winslet sparkles like a diamond while the rest merely glint.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very well written romantic comedy,"I expected a traditional romantic comedy here and I suspect many men will not even tune in to what's going on when their girlfriends/wives drag them to it but I loved this movie. The trailer was kind of misleading. It seemed as if the two women (Winslet/Diaz) were switching boyfriends but what they switched was houses. Diaz moves from California to England and Winslet from England to California. The movie has lots of nice little plot twists and it was a real joy to see Eli Wallach playing a retired screen writer that I suspect was based on Ernst Lehman. Elis friends get together with him one night to talk with Kate Winslet's character and we see Bill Macy from Maud and Shelly Berman who was one of my most favorite comics from the sixties. Jack Black has a nice roll as a digital musician who talks to Kate about movie scores. There is even a little scene in a movie store where Jack is talking about the score of the graduate and the star Dustin Hoffman does a cameo. There are a few movie cliché's here but all in all the movie is a winner and who could not love Jude Law's children and the ""napkin man"". I was thinking while watching this that Kate Wnslet should be doing more romantic comedies and has the range of another favorite of mine Emma Thompson. They were in Sense and Sensibilty together. Another movie I loved. So if you're a guy give it a chance if your a gal you can't miss here.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It was great, however, to see Kate Winslet branch out into modern romantic comedies as opposed to the period piece stuff she usually does. She is really the standout in this movie and should do more of this type of role. Cameron Diaz is playing basically the same great, successful career girl character she always plays (""Something About Mary"", ""The Sweetest Thing"", ""Charlie's Angels"") . Jude Law and Jack Black serve their purpose in the traditional ""girlfriend"" role, as Diaz and Winslet are the leads. Loved Eli Wallach in a supporting role...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surprising good movie, actually","I should start by saying the title for this movie isn't the best option they've got... I mean, I went to this movie basically because there wasn't running a better one at the time I got to the multiplex. But I was in for a great surprise! Cameron Diaz and Jude Law are simply good at what they're doing, but I'd mention Jack Black (the Shallow Hall guy) and Kate Winslet too. The movie has a great pace, there are many funny lines and most of all, the perspective of a 'holiday' far from everyday life makes you think... and that's what good movies do: make you THINK. Back to the subject, I recommend this if you're alone, trying to get over someone, if you're with someone (best effect if you're looking together) or if you simply want to have a good time with some friends... I gave this movie a 9 because it isn't something exceptionally great, but I'd rent it for a nice evening ... and definitely think it's worth the ticket .",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I am, however, a movie lover. And as such I could do nothing but twinge in my seat for the entirety of this film's 138 minute running time. Contrived plot. Cliché characters. Predictable scenes. No feeling for originality, chemistry, or realism. This movie was placed in theaters to drown lonely women in sugary fluff. So, if you are such a woman, and you have never before seen a film and care not for fancy film trappings such as screenplay, this film is for you. And only for you.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worth the investment...,"This past Christmas when I was home for my 72 hour visit to basically collect gifts and then fly home, my brother saw this movie without me. It shocked me, first of all, that he saw this because he would have never seen it with me and my movie buddy. It was of great significance, also, that he LIKED it.So when it came out on DVD, I was literally there that Tuesday morning to pick it up. I came home and watched it and wasn't disappointed. Kate Winslet as Iris is such a unique character in film-land. Iris has been in love with the wrong guy for years and only realizes it after he becomes engaged to someone else. She agrees to switch homes for Christmas with Cameron Diaz as Amanda. By the way, I want to play the home switch game -- especially if I end up at in a posh LA house with a Blockbuster video store in the TV room. Although, honestly, I would have been just as happy in Iris's pad outside London in the idyllic countryside.Although this Nancy Myers film weighs in at over 2 hours (like her other hit Something's Gotta Give), it flies by. I will admit, though, that there are definitely some areas to trim, but the movie is at its best spending time (albeit less than Amanda's screen time) with Iris in LA with her new friends Arthur (Eli Wallach), and Miles (a lovable Jack Black). Similarly to Something's Gotta Give, Meyers packs the movie with amazing landscapes that bring the film alive. It's another in a series of movies that makes me want to move to England.There was no disappointment for me in this movie. In fact, like some great movies of 2006, the more times I watch it, the more I love it. If you don't take my word for it, take the fact that my tax attorney anti-chic-flick brother (who is perhaps THE toughest critic of all) enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm not sure who would have been a better choice for Black's part.The cameo's were great and Eli Wallach, of The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly fame, was outstanding. I think the comment about a love connection between he and Winslet would have been more believable! The movie, despite the above mentioned casting problems was a great story!

Guess Hollywood's Big Hitters needed a little extra Christmas spending money!,"I actually left the theatre after the first 45 minutes of The Holiday. I left trying to understand how Hollywood's Big Hitters could take on a movie that bad?? The only conclusion I could arrive at was that the $20 million they make on every other film wasn't enough and they needed a little extra spending cash for Christmas. The writing was horrible, the acting...oh the acting... Cameron Diaz was embarrassing. She was over acting on top of over acting on top of over acting. I know comedic timing is extremely tough. That is why you cast accordingly. Jude Law? His good looks couldn't carry him this time. Acting was poor and his impediment of a drunk was cheap. And Kate Winslet?! Come on sister! Don't accept rubbish like this! Not you. Don't sell out in Hollywood like the rest of them. You're too good! Save your money. Please don't support bad film like this.

Being something of a thespian myself, I find myself watching films now and analysing the acting of the stars. I was not disappointed with, 'The Holiday'! Jude Law, originally, was not one of my favourite actors. I was initially a bit dubious about his acting talent. Having seen this film, I can with all honesty say, that I have been wrong about him! As well as being incredibly good looking, his character was very convincing.I've been fans of Kate Winslet and Jack Black for a while so having them in it was a huge bonus!

A Nutshell Review: The Holiday,"Trust me to look deep into a typical chick flick dealing with love and romance, and actually buying into it. The Holiday, starring Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black, carries itself through via the solid performance of its cast, predominantly eye-candy, save one charismatic Jack in a non-comedic, dramatic role.Being character and issue driven, The Holiday has its characters all suffering from and being out of favour with Love, and from there, begin the story of their struggle and development. Stories of unrequited love, being taken for a ride, doubts about long distance relationships, commitment, and of course, trust. You'll probably feel for the four primary characters, because if you're someone who have even been in a relationship, then you're more than likely to identify with them, at one point or another as they move along the story, dealing with different aspects of love, but ultimately, being afraid of being hurt by Love.I thought Cameron Diaz was back at her ditzy best, being someone unable to feel and connect emotionally, and being cheated upon by her boyfriend played by Edward Burns. Kate Winslet was very believable as someone suffering from unrequited love, and looked ultra vulnerable, pining for her supposed beau portrayed by Rufus Sewell (last seen in Tristan and Isolde). Jude Law doesn't do much except to turn on those charms when needed, while Jack Black was at his element when in the video store, with his character romancing Shannyn Sossamon, who more than faded away after her stint in A Knight's Tale opposite Heath Ledger.Much of the movie managed to unravel itself with quite a number of little surprises, as the trailer did not give away too much besides the fact that two out-of-love girls perform a home exchange during the holiday season, and found more than they bargained for with new opportunities in love. These little surprise elements are like presents being unwrapped during Christmas - you guess what's coming, get strong hints, and finally, while suspecting what the gift is, you'll still be pleasantly surprised at the outcome. Be they plot devices, elements or even characters, there are plenty of moments to warm your heart. I guess ""cute"" never ran out of fashion, not in this genre.What works is the pacing and editing. Running at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it will be rare if you find any moment a bit of a bore. While at the veneer there are tons of issues and problems about romance itself, and the trials and ghosts that each character had to exorcise, beneath the exterior are feel good, hopeful messages, those that you'd more or less expect a close friend to dispense, never mind if they sound cliché or obvious.Date movie, Christmas movie, romance and feel good drama all rolled into one, The Holiday is very much a been there done that trip down memory lane for those experienced, while at the same time giving plenty of hope to those who haven't or are holding out for that special someone. But only if you buy into its message. Feel the love, people, and peace and goodwill toward all men.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Laughter through tears"" romantic comedy.","This is a fairly typical romantic comedy. If that's your kind of movie this will delight you. Some would say it is formulaic and predictable. While that may be true, and it often is true of any movie genre, this movie has much to offer in the way of twists on the old story line. The actors shine in their roles, the scenery is a treat to behold and it has an ""old movie"" feel, which seems intentional. There is more to this movie than just the romance. I think there are some solid messages about our lives and how we live them. Of course, it depends on where you are in your own life what messages you will or won't hear. In my opinion, it's a great movie based simply on entertainment value. What you take away from it is up to you.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
How cute is this movie! Renewed our likes of Jack Black,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Just a delicious movie!

How many times can you watch Black use his goofy expressions. And then several shots of Law's pretty face with pitiful eyes. And last bus not lease pull out a couple of kids and some how this magically will fix a deep rooted emotional problems for Law's love interest.

Great movie,"This is a surprisingly great and refreshing romantic comedy. It's not cheesy as so many others are, and it has a superb cast - no matter what anyone says about Cameron Diaz, she was excellent and likable in this film. SHe really portrayed exactly what her character AManda was about. Kate Winslet was great as well, but I found some of her performance (the excessive crying) a bit overdone. The male actors were divine, especially Jude Law. It was a stroke of genius to have made Graham into a widowed father of 2 instead of just another single guy. And the scene in the tent, with Graham, Amanda and the two girls, almost made me cry. The character of Arthur is also central to this film, he's almost like a grandfather giving all of us (not only Iris) advice. Overall this is a movie about love, but more than that, about letting go of the things that weigh you down and allowing yourself to open up to life, love and happiness once again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The writer needs to find a new line of work,"I am a romantic comedy fan, but I turned this one off in the middle. There are plenty of things to dislike about the movie (acting and direction come to mind), but there is only one villain here -- the writer. This is an unbelievable, trite, predictable piece, with phony dialog, unfunny obvious attempts at humor, and bland characters. If you are a prima donna who thinks the world should revolve around her, but doesn't, you might identify with the Cameron Diaz character, for whom everything works out effortlessly and undeservedly, like a pre-adolescent fantasy. But, in fact, there is no interesting character in the entire movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A smart, wry romantic comedy for a bit more demanding viewers","Screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers continues to defy all romantic comedy conventions by doing a few things that are often missed by screenwriters of the genre. Instead of focusing on incredulous romances and meet-cutes, Meyers is quick to focus on the characters involved in these on-screen relationships, developing them by closely following their mannerisms before they become involved in the film's core romances. Secondly, she places emphasis on the dialog of the characters while they are in these relationships, rather than their actions, and even if circumstantial incredulity comes into play, you almost miss it because Meyers crafts such likable on-screen presences that it isn't so blatantly obvious that they are saying and doing things that are a bit too playful with narrative conveniences. Finally, the emphasis on conversation and character relationships helps Meyers naturally include humor and wittiness to a screenplay that would otherwise try too hard to be funny or relevant.The end result is The Holiday, a very natural romantic comedy, with a quartet of strong performers and a story that takes its time to build over the course of two hours. Interestingly enough, most romantic comedies exhaust themselves past the one-hundred minute mark, but The Holiday defies convention by taking a liberal amount of time to illustrate two brewing romances on opposite sides of the world that all began because of adventurous feelings by two introverts.The film opens by introducing two characters, Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet), a column editor for a newspaper in London and Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz), a movie trailer producer in Los Angeles. Iris has been in love with her coworker Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell) for over three years, despite him cheating on her when they were dating and that her love has gone unrequited. Iris winds up becoming more upset when she learns Jasper is engaged and she, well into her thirties, is still single. Amanda, however, has been a workaholic since the startup of her company, and the result has taken a toll on her live-in boyfriend (Edward Burns), who packs up and moves out after he reveals she has been cheating on her.Both women are in need of a vacation, and upon discovering one another on a chat-room, they agree to a ""house swap,"" where Iris will go live in Amanda's spacious, Los Angeles mansion and Amanda will live in Iris' small London cottage over the course of the holiday season. During her stay in Los Angeles, Iris meets an elderly man named Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), who was once a screenwriter during the Golden Age of Hollywood, in addition to Miles (Jack Black), a charming employee of Amanda's who has an obsession with films scores. Meanwhile in London, after initially slugging away at wine and holiday snacks, a drunk Amanda winds up meeting Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) when he, also drunk, knocks on her door one night expecting Iris. The two commit to having a one-night stand, but when they realize their dynamic and chemistry is something neither of them can deny, the morning after becomes that much more complicated, especially when Graham allows Amanda to meet his kids.The Holiday ostensibly sets itself up for immediate failure by focusing on two separate romances. That narrative structure is a constant problem with romance films because they struggle in trying to humanize and develop both relationships under a reasonable amount of time. For Meyers, time never seems to be a factor; she starts liberally, by revealing more about the characters through their mannerisms and their choices rather than by with whom they interact before inviting the love-interest into the picture. By including characters like Amanda's ex-boyfriend and Wallach's ex-screenwriter character, Meyers also shows that she has more on her mind than simply cranking out a dime-a-dozen love story. She wants to populate a film with characters that simultaneously mean something and fill a film with a great deal of entertainment value.The result is a film that's breezily paced, but never fluffed, remarkably charming, but never saccharine, and humbly emotional, and never manipulative. This is largely thanks to Meyers' screen writing, but also thanks to the talented cast of performers, specifically Winslet and Black who are trying to break out of their own character archetypes throughout the entire film. Consider Winslet's character, who could easily be a faceless, mopey spinster. Instead, Winslet is a deeply sympathetic character because she's not dysfunctional nor is she a comical trainwreck. Consider the scene where Iris is beside herself, talking with Miles about the perils and the unrelenting sadness of unrequited love and it how strips not just a piece, but several pieces, from your ability to love, trust, and sympathize with people. It's a truly sad monologue that Meyers wisely doesn't choose to milk for tears, but rather, pure, unadulterated honesty.Meanwhile, Black gives a performance that is perhaps his most delightful mixed of controlled chaos yet. While he is more restrained and casual here, his zealous, roly-poly tendencies sneak in on various occasions, particularly the video store scene where he brilliant recites harmonies and melodies of film scores. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law serve as the more predictable couple, though that's not a bad thing, for they are the narrative anchor that keeps the film from taking off into another world. You're bound to have a preferred couple watching The Holiday, and for me, the insights and the consistent charm of both Winslet and Black's characters was an instant winner for me.With all that in mind, The Holiday works as a very lovable piece of entertainment, and furthers Nancy Meyers' status as one of the smartest female directors working in the business today. Her careful craft when it comes to assembling a romantic comedy is shown with every character in the film, and rather than cluttering Holiday with useless caricatures or sticking to a basic love quartet, she surprises on multiple levels, effectively giving most audience members more than they expected.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Possibly The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"And I've seen a lot of stinkers. The opening dialogue is so horrible, that I would have turned it off in the first five or ten minutes. But my wife wanted to see more of it so I didn't. From the ridiculously overdone premise to the even more ridiculously predictable conclusion, this movie just bit it. I can't think of any other way to put it. Cameron Diaz made me wonder why she ever got recognition for her acting. Let's just say this is not ""Something About Mary."" And Kate Winslett made me hold my breath at the possibility of her yelling out the name ""JACK' at one point or another in the movie.I usually don't beat up movies this way. I usually find something redeeming about them. But in this case, I can't come up with any reason to make this film, let alone watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fun,"This movie sets the standard for house swap movies which have been popping up one or two every year on TV movies. Of course a lot of that is a first rate cast and quality in pretty much all aspects.The story has a predictable outcome and not really any surprises, but it's still a great story. The Arthur sub-plot makes it a little more than purely a rom/com giving the movie something sentimental. There is also plenty to laugh at.The leads in the two couples all have chemistry with their opposites. Joe Black and Cameron Diaz lend some of their usual craziness and even Kate Winslet gets into that a bit. Winslet manages to make Iris both pathetic and endearing. The two little girls are totally adorable.The movie is pretty ""clean"" even though the implied repeated shagging by Amanda and Graham probably means that the movie won't show up on the Hallmark channel at least for a few years yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fine Piece Of Romantic Candy,"The Holiday is one of those rare films that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy on a cold or rainy day, it has everything good acting, a fantastic cast and an all around good plot. The chemistry between Cameron Diaz & Jude Law was electric and utterly amazing, this has to be one of the best films of 2006.What happens when two women who've never met , had serious men trouble and find themselves alone at Christmas? The question is answered in Nancy Meyer's latest film. In Surrey, England Iris Simpkins, (Winslet a beautiful yet dowdy journalist at the Telegraph is crushed when former fling and fellow employee Jasper (Sewell) gets engaged to the girl he cheated on her with. Across the world in Los Angeles Amanda Woods (Diaz the owner of a film trailer editing company throws out her latest partner Ethan (Burns) for having an affair with a receptionist. These two women meet online at a home exchange program and agree to switch homes for a period of two weeks. While in their new surroundings Amanda meets and is immediately attracted to Iris's older and charming brother Graham (Law).Iris however still hurt by Jasper's news begins a friendship with Arthur Abbott (Wallach) a forgotten Hollywood screen writer and mends her heart when meeting Miles (Black) a film composer. The budding relationship between Amanda & Graham is a little complicated because he's a single father of two girls but Amanda likes the girls and her leaving soon makes it harder. When Miles' girlfriend Maggie (Sossamon) is seeing another man he realizes that the woman of his dreams has been right in front of him and slowly the sparks begin to fly.This story about romantic complications and happy endings has been done before but it works well enough with the right amount of formula.

Holiday from hell,"My toes have just about uncurled enough to free me to diss this over-sentimental piece of tosh. There's a fine art, I believe, in concocting a classic Christmas movie, but the best of them - ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""The Bishop's Wife"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"" etc, all manage it by being natural and unforced, showing real people in real situations, but their lives overtaken in one way or another by that unclassifiable Christmas spirit.The so-called fare on show here is however so calculated and lacking in good humour (in every sense of the phrase) that what's left is an overwrought, overplayed, overdone piece of contrived hokum.Quite how an ordinary member of the public is meant to relate to high-flying movie-trailer producer Cameron Diaz in her all mod cons dream house, replete with swimming pool and electric curtains, or publishing executive Jude Law as a grieving widower, Jack Black as a cuckolded movie soundtrack composer or even the most downbeat character, Kate Winslet as a lovelorn journalist but still somehow lives in a picturesque cottage in Surrey, is beyond me. And if the answer to that question is meant to be the persuasive talents of the actors on show, then that's another miss as far as I'm concerned. Diaz gets to wig out as per usual to a rock track (likewise Winslet) and how she can't cry anymore, Law gets to gush stuff and nonsense about his doting kids, Winslet builds up an unbelievable with a decrepit sardonic old Hollywood screenwriter and Black tags after a younger model playing him for a fool, in between composing saccharine music for the big screen. Cue Hans Zimmer's completely bland muzak, which seems to get turned on and up whenever A BIG SCENE arises.Cringe-worthy scene follows cringe-worthy scene as all ends happily ever after with the final images of the happy couples partying down with as much phony conviction as they can muster.Really, I could go on and on, but this is about as cynical and hokey as Hollywood gets in going after the big Christmas buck. There are a host of wonderful Christmas movies out there and not just the Golden Age classics I mentioned at the outset - Bill Murray's ""Scrooged"" for one. I haven't seen such a bad film in such a long time and can only recommend that if you decide to watch it, imbibe in a whole lot of Christmas spirits beforehand. Unfortunately, being teetotal, I had no such release and suffered accordingly!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday,"The Holiday is the perfect movie to watch after you just finish a relationship, because it gives hope to men and women that there is a special someone for them. The movie is about two women trying to get over their last relationship and to do so they switching houses for the holidays. During the switch the two girls find the meaning of real love. In Iris's (Kate Winslet) case she was still in love with her ex that had left her for another woman, sometimes as women we tend to hold on to things that make us feel happy for moments but at the same times makes very unhappy. While Iris is in California she finds a new friend, a 90 year old man who advices her that by holding on to a friendship with her ex and that now takes advantage of her feeling towards him for his own benefit, is only hurting her. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) in the other side of the world finds a Graham (Jude Law) a man who has trouble showing who he really is; she discovers that is her problem too, and in the short time they spend together they find a way to be happy with themselves . Iris finds Miles (Jack Black), who is going trough something very similar to what she went through and helps him to solve it, and at the end get together.This movie I would recommend to anyone because of the way it explains how people can suffer from love but also cures. They director gives it a comedy twist which makes the movie very easy to watch and follow the stories and lets the audience wanting to know what is going to happen next. The cast is very good because it makes the audience that they are really going through love ache and that they get over it.

It's not the flat, pale, one dimensional, off the peg performances, or even the blatantly sexist underlying assumption that every woman needs a man to be complete. It's just that it's really not funny. Not at all. Watching Jack Black and Kate Winslet ad libbing nonsense word lyrics to one of Black's character's musical compositions, one can't help but hope against hope that they both turn out to have some rare and incurable form of cancer that kills them both before the credits roll.

Do yourself a favour....go see it.,"I find it extremely difficult to comprehend how anyone can watch an engineered piece of seasonal fantasy such as this, then dash to their nearest PC and delight in penning a negative comment.

Despite all the evidence before their eyes, they refuse to just accept the probable and search for a microbe of inconsistency upon which to proffer the improbable.Is this movie predictable? Of course it is. Is this movie a little contrived? You bet. Are some performances stronger than others? As always, yes. Does it represent English/U.S. reality? Not a chance. Would Kate Winslett ever consider getting it on with Jack Black? I seriously doubt it. Is Cameron Diaz's smile widely annoying? Oh yes. Is this movie a classy piece of seasonal escapism that makes you want to hug the nearest bad guy? Yes it is.Despite the many minor flaws (if that is the right word) this movie achieves what it set out to do, which is to provide a thick slice of non-challenging, non-threatening Christmas feel-good fare.

"Three Out of Four Stars Charm in an Overlong, Formulaic Comedy That Gets It Right Half the Time","After about 45 minutes of overdone laborious set-up, at least half of this overlong, dual-track 2006 romantic comedy takes flight, while the other half remains stubbornly contrived. More problems occur when three of the four principals show an affinity for screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers' brand of breezy but manipulative farce, while the fourth seems like he doesn't belong in the movie at all. A calculated throwback to golden-era Hollywood in more ways than one, the stacked-deck premise is simple enough - two women, Amanda in LA and Iris in England, both unlucky in love, decide impulsively to switch houses during the Christmas holiday with the intent of celebrating their emancipation from men bad for them.Amanda's side of the story is the more pleasurable of the two because ironically, it doesn't veer too much from formula. At first, Cameron Diaz's performance as Amanda seems heavily exaggerated, but once she meets Jude Law, very Grant-like (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) as Iris' smooth-talking brother Graham, she settles down as he is the epitome of the Sensitive Man for reasons that become clear soon enough. Probably because the actors are such striking people, their chemistry is palpable and unforced, as their characters pretend not to fall in love when it is obvious they are. Iris' LA adventure does not fare as well. Although Kate Winslet is dependably winning as Iris, her natural vibrancy and beauty seem at odds with her role as a doormat to an ex-boyfriend who keeps stringing her along.The stateside romance is also more convoluted as it involves her almost-instant friendship with an aged Hollywood screenwriter who refuses to be the subject of an industry tribute. It's nice to see 91-year old Eli Wallach play the curmudgeonly writer with old-world charm and a wry sense of humor, but the subplot feels forced as an excuse to provide a more direct connection to the Hollywood film classics. Even worse, Jack Black is completely out of his element as Miles, a sardonic film composer already in a shaky relationship with an actress. That Iris and Miles get together seems more like an afterthought since there is zero chemistry between Winslet and Black. The resulting imbalance between the two story lines adds to the interminable feel of the movie's 136-minute running time.Even though there are a handful of funny sight gags (mostly spotlighting Diaz) and a clever three-way phone conversation with Iris at the center, the film is burdened by its leisurely pacing and Meyers' indulgent approach to the material. Thanks to Jon Hutman's picture-postcard sets, especially of the English countryside, and Hans Zimmer's appropriately romantic score, it certainly feels like the Hollywood confection that she was trying to replicate. The 2007 DVD has a robust commentary track courtesy of Meyers and several of her crew like Zimmer, Hutman and editor Joe Hutshing but featuring none of the stars. There is also an eighteen-minute making-of featurette, pretty standard, along with a number of previews for current and upcoming theatrical releases like ""Spider-Man 3"".",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Quality Romantic Drama Entertainment,"5 January 2007. Except for two moderate miscues, this romantic drama entertainment is a dazzling display of natural portrayals of banter between romancing couples. The emotional relationships on screen are refreshing, lively, and revealing for their depth of realism and delight. Except for Jack Black's usual character performance that is beginning to become almost stale (missing a great opportunity to play against type) and a rather typical ending, this movie is a solid credit to romance pictures in lifting the level of performance and true dialogue in this genre. A great movie for the holiday season. Cameron Diaz continues to perform well as an under-rated and overlooked actress along with her co-stars (Kate Winslet and Jude Law) all doing well (if only Jack Black could expand his range).

On top of that it is sooo long. If it was an hour shorter it may have been acceptable, but its epic length left me hating every second of this lazy, flabby, manipulative 'comedy'.All of the actors have done infinitely better work, especially a extremely subdued Jack Black, see School of Rock, There's Something About Mary, or Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind instead.As for The Holiday, watch the trailer, look at the poster, it tells you all you need to know, there is nothing at all to be gained from watching the film.Be warned.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"oh, so poor!","This movie was bad, very bad. I would rather eat my own toe with peanut butter, than watch Holiday again. I was forced to purchase a ticket by my current flat mates, strongly against my own will as i had the strong desire to go see happy feet but they slammed me with a wet flannel! The movie was predictable and at sometimes extremely sexists to the male sex, who are constantly betrayed as the enemy of modern society and in one scene as Sheep. The movie reminds me of Bridget jones but filmed in Dagenham possibly Rayleigh. This movie could have been largely improved by the use of class A drugs. Bridjet Jones but worse, is like Bridget Jones gone wrong. The and penguins. I am extremely ashamed of myself for giving into peer pressure and parting money for this filth ridden garbage.

The Holiday is a unique and worthwhile holiday romantic comedy that I strongly recommend,"My wife and I caught The Holiday (2006) in theaters last night. The plot revolves around two recently single women seeking a vacation to reset their lives. They discover an app for home swaps and decide to exchange houses, embarking on a journey to kickstart their new lives, and surprisingly, it exceeds their expectations.Written and directed by Nancy Meyers (It's Complicated), the film stars Kate Winslet (Titanic), Cameron Diaz (The Mask), Jude Law (Sherlock Holmes), Jack Black (Nacho Libre), and Rufus Sewell (Dark City).The storyline is clever, featuring great settings, unique characters with interesting backstories, and entertaining circumstances. The cast is well-chosen, although Jack Black feels a bit out of place. The rest of the cast is excellent. The film's attire is top-notch, and everyone's outfits are particularly noteworthy. The movie delves into relatable emotions and mental hurdles as characters navigate important life decisions, creating realistic situations with a magical ending.In conclusion, The Holiday is a unique and worthwhile holiday romantic comedy that I strongly recommend. I would give it a score of 7/10 and suggest watching it at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Holiday - is a lovely romantic comedy,"My opinion---The Holiday, is a lovely romantic comedy by Nancy Meyers ""What Women Want and The New Trainee"" among other things, she loves romantic cinema and this is reflected in the quality of her films, proof almost all her films are focused on The subject with happiness, and The Holiday is in this vein, romantic, a nice little story and every time she has chosen very good actors as in this film, with two super duos: Cameron Díaz / Jude Law and Kate Winslet / Jack Black; I can say that I found Cameron Diaz perfect for me one of his best role as far as Jack Black he has an on-screen presence always noticed, I love this actor. The soundtrack of this great music master of movies that is Hans Zimmer is also very pleasant. In the end this film is very well done and the romances are beautiful, a film where you do not stress, a film to discover because it is very good in its kind.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A modern classic,"Love this movie! We've watched it most every year since first seeing it in the movie theater.

Personal challenges and growth, and romance ensues. I've heard a good film described as one with ""three good scenes and no bad ones""; I look forward to every scene in this film, and every performance is good from the four leads (Jack Black is a great bit of unconventional casting the works) to all the supporting roles. Great settings, music, and dialogue. The world these characters inhabit is an affluent one (like in so many other films), though that works here, too.

I need a holiday from this crap!,"I've had more romantically comical poops than The Holiday.Where to begin? Jack Black is NOT a romantic leading man. Whatever happened to the days when he'd act like a maniac, jumpin' around and setting stuff on fire? Where is the Jack Black who would give you a wedgie while eating ice cream cake? Or the Black who climbs up flag poles to urinate? Kate Winslet is no help as the air-breathing damsel. Where's Robert Hegyes when you need him?And what about the writing? Can we get something with just a smidgen of originality, Nancy Meyers? I don't know, when I went and saw this movie I was hoping for the sort of comical romp reminiscent of The Crotch Chronicles. They could have livened this clunker up with Bull the bailiff from Night Court. What'choo talking' bout, Ivan French?In any event, applaud Nancy Meyers for trying. She failed miserably at whatever she was trying to do. I gots the hives. Kudos to Rufus Sewell, who is great in the role of Jasper. They should cast him as Jim Varney in the Ernest biopic.Overall, I do not recommend The Holiday.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two messed up women switch homes for the holidays....and find love.,"Iris (Kate Winslet) and Amanda (Cameron Diaz) are both screwed up women. Iris has been in love with a guy who obviously doesn't love her....yet she pathetically keeps waiting and waiting for him. But after giving him a Christmas gift, he springs a surprise on her...he's about to marry someone else. Amanda has been in a relationship for some time and her boyfriend lives with her. However, she expects rejection and has done as much as she can to sabotage the relationship...and he finally leaves. Now both women are facing the prospect of being alone over the holidays and they both have a crazy idea...to switch houses with someone somewhere else around the world. Through a website, Amanda and Iris meet and switch homes...with Amanda going to a quite small town cottage in England and Iris going to a fancy and expensive Hollywood area mansion. Can they manage to have a good time in each other's homes AND manage to find someone to love?This is an enjoyable film...just don't follow these women's advice on how to find happiness. It only works out like this in movies! But, if you ignore this, the film is charming and the male leads (Jack Black and Jude Law) are also terrific. Overall, an underrated romance....about two REALLY screwy women.By the way, one of the best things about the movie is Eli Wallach and the subplot involving his character. It's utterly charming and is alone reason to see the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Festive Classic,"Despite the Holiday not been an over the top traditional Christmas film, it is my favourite film to watch each festive season. A romantic comedy with four likeable leads combined with a charming plot, what can go wrong? The answer: Not Much! I have a few minor flaws with the film but that is primarily down to my personal preferences, I don't personally enjoy the story lines connected with Iris (Kate Winslet) as much as the others. Her relationship with Jasper Bloom for example seems very unusual and he is extremely unlikable, but i guess that may be the point. My main plot issue however is the relationship Iris has with Arthur which I don't find my self getting invested in.On the other hand the relationship with Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Graham (Jude Law) is definitely the stand out of the film, seeing their relationship grow is both believable and engaging. Seeing Jack Black in a more serious role is also a nice change and his character is also very charming and likeable.With a few small changes The Holiday could be a 10/10 but as it stands its still a very re-watchable and underrated Christmas film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Right movie, right time its a win for me","The Holiday caught me in the right mood, right time and I loved it. Fully embracing my inner chick-flick I savoured the romance, the gorgeous scenery, the hugely entertaining supporting cast and even the wardrobe -Cameron Diaz wears some great coats here. Why I noticed this I'm not sure, I don't usually, it might have been the wine. Anyways the movie is also pretty funny, and while somewhat predictable I still found myself all caught up in the assorted story lines.This is along the lines of 'Love Actually' or 'Brigitte Jones Diary', with an ensemble cast telling the story of an American (Cameron Diaz) and a Brit (Kate Winslet) who swap houses after their love lives go awry and they decide they need a change of scenery. Diaz finds herself in an idyllic British cottage but quite out of element in the snow and solitude and wants to leave almost immediately, until she meets and hooks up with the absolutely charming (yet mysterious) Jude Law. Law is gorgeous both in character and looks here, he's hard not to fall for.Meanwhile Winslet is living it up in sunny LA where she hits it off with an elderly neighbour played by Eli Wallach -honestly this may have been my favourite storyline going. She also meets Jack Black who was a bit of a surprise in the romantic leading man role but he plays it straight for the most part and it works. The story focus more on Diaz and Law than Kate and Jack and yes it gets all wrapped up quick and tidy for the HEA, but its also totally enjoyable and even a bit magical if you can catch this in the right mood. 12/25",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is my Christmas movie now,"I watched this movie several years ago and this month I got a free trial for Shomi which is a video streaming service like Netflix. As soon as I saw The Holiday was there I wanted to watch it. I didn't remember much, the only thing I remember that was very romantic. I don't really like romantic movies and I don't know how I got to watch it in the first place, but I really liked it. After having watched it the second time, I decided this was going to be my Christmas movie, the movie I will watch every Christmas :)Then I decided to read on IMDb what people thought of it hoping to find at least 7.5 rating for it and was disappointed by negative reviews. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a very nice movie that makes me happy, I watched it second time and it had the same effect as years ago, it leaves with a very warm feeling. Acting is good, I love the music in the movie, how the plot evolves, I love the dialogues - it's almost perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Scroodilly Doodilly Doo!""","The Holiday (2006) -I really liked this film. I had previously watched a made for TV film called 'Trading Christmas' (2010) that was very similar and enjoyed that, but I'd been reluctant to watch this one, despite being released earlier, feeling that the big stars might outshine the story and I'd never really been a Kate Winslet or Jack Black fan.However, when I finally did get to this one I found it incredibly entertaining and full of great moments, jokes and romantic loveliness, all wrapped up in a big Christmas bow.I also found Jack Black, playing the role of Miles, quite charming and more than a little bit amusing, which was a nice surprise. I particularly enjoyed his descriptions and quirky renditions of the greatest film soundtracks.Kate on the other hand, I have only recently come to appreciate in films like 'Steve Jobs' (2015), 'The Dressmaker' (2015) and the 'Divergent' (2014-5) series (It was obviously a good year for her) and I still found her a bit awkward in this film as Iris. Almost as awkward as the weird dance that she did with her onscreen brother Jude Law right at the end of the film. Look out for it, it's proper cringe.Jude, on another hand entirely, was absolutely adorable though and it was hard not to fall head over heels in love with his character Graham (Gram if you're American) for having the whole package (Except perhaps dancing abilities). He could turn up and threaten to p!ss on my doorstep whenever he wanted.I enjoyed the relationships that developed between them all, but the connection I appreciated the most was the one that Iris formed with her house-swap-mates neighbour, Arthur. A performance superbly delivered by Eli Wallach, mostly because Eli will always be a legend and was the epitome of the dear old man in this film, but with an extra interest about him too.One of the other bits I liked was the narration that went with Cameron Diaz' ups and downs throughout the film. As the character Amanda she played a film trailer producer, so that fun element really worked for her specifically and added a touch of something different too.My only criticism would be that the characters in this one weren't people that work at the local supermarket or fast food restaurant, none of them had ever even seen a job centre and had never really struggled much in life, although they had of course all seen their share of losses and break ups. It's a typical thing in a lot of these British films, especially the Richard Curtis ones and alike 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' (1994), 'Love Actually' (2003), 'Bridget Jones' (2001) and so on. And it is regularly a feature with the made for TV specials too.I found it a little bit hard to feel sorry for Jude with his nice house, great job, Etc, when my monthly payments from the government don't really cover the cost of food and the job centre can't or won't help me develop my career to actually become one of these successful people, but I may have digressed a tad.The film also features some kids who were a bit like artificial sweeteners, full of saccharine and they might have rotted your teeth or given you cancer if you had too much contact with them, but in a lot of ways they were very cute too.It was a film that showed what we all hope will happen when we swap our houses or use Airbnb, but I certainly have never been lucky enough to experience. However, this film always gives me hope that it might happen one day and that's what made it great.879.79/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dull,"""The Holiday"" has a few likable moments, but overall, the dialogue is lame, aspects of the plot are cliché, and the female characters (mainly Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz) often fit the stereotype that women are batty, overemotional, neurotic, and somewhat silly. (Why do filmmakers think that women jump up and down and squeal with delight whenever something thrilling happens? I've met few adult females who act like that.)In addition, ""The Holiday"" focuses on wealthy people who can go off on a vacation with no notice and seemingly without batting an eye at the cost. I realize that such people do exist (although I doubt all their homes exhibit the tidy perfection of the ones in the movie), but I'd prefer to watch a movie about regular people. (In the rom com category, a good example is ""While You Were Sleeping."")""The Holiday"" also moves too slowly. It's so dull that I began to fall asleep while watching it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

It has a really good turning point regarding one of the characters and I loved it! I like the way the movie shows us two worlds that seem to be totally different, such as London and LA, and how in the end they seem to be pretty much alike when it comes to personal relations. Kate Winslet makes a great performance, as well as Cameron Diaz, and Jack Black gives a new dimension to his career with a not so funny but more deep role instead.

A banal confection devoid of interest or merit,"This is a movie of such unremitting awfulness that the only reason for writing a review is to warn others not to waste more than two hours of their lives by watching it. A cast list which includes Jude Law, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet promises much more than this travesty even begins to deliver. Their performances are wooden  nothing they can do can rescue a dire script and confused direction. It wasn't a low budget film  stars of this fame don't come cheap and nor does location shooting in Los Angeles as well as England. But every cent of this budget was wasted on a film that has to rate as one of the greatest turkeys of all time.There is one (just one) positive thing to say and that is that there is a delightful cameo by Eli Wallach as Arthur. An actor as experienced as him must have known that he was in a movie of no merit - but he had the presence of mind, and the presence, to act his far younger fellow actors off the set.The roots of this farrago lie are the genre of Richard Curtis - but in case you wondered whether writer/director Nancy Meyers has one percent of Cutis's way with words or ability to create a plot then the answer is clearly no. There are Curtisesque moments but whereas the love affairs in his films (Four Weddings, Notting Hill and Love Actually) are improbable they mostly become believable. The love affairs in The Holiday are as synthetic as the ill chosen soundtrack and the humdrum locations. Kate Winslet is too old to do Bridget Jones and Cameron Diaz needs to learn to whimper and emote less if she is ever to be convincing. The best line in the film is when a little girl calls her a ""Barbie"".When you think how all the money used up on ""The Holiday"" could have been more wisely spent on half a dozen art house films that might make you think - if not make you weep. This is Hollywood at its absolute worst  a banal confection devoid of interest or merit  in the good old days it wouldn't even be a decent B movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Extraordinarily Pleasurable Experience,"Here's a movie that could have gone two ways  it could have been a Hollywood let's-cash-in-promise-big-deliver-small chick flick, with mediocre writing and everything flat to the formula. Few so-called chick flicks in the past years have delivered a quality movie-going experience, so the fear of this being another one of those was prevalent.Happily, the movie actually delivers! The movie is deftly written, both plot and dialogue-wise by Nancy Meyers (writer/director of ""Something's Gotta Give"" - the 2003 Diane Keaton/Jack Nicholson pic). It avoids clichés, putting a fresh, human, and quite a tender spin to the relationships; few of the relationships are simple, and there are little surprises everywhere along the road. The script also has nice nods to movies and leading ladies of the Hollywood Golden Era, and subtle visual and verbal homages to heroines of the past. Keep an eye out in the beginning of the pic, when Iris crosses the same bridge across the Thames as Bridget Jones did; delish little nod.Nancy Meyers also directed, and her direction is deft. The superb actors are handled lightly; Meyers obviously could recognize their strengths and how to best feature and bring the actors to their top form. Kate Winslet, an actor whom I like more each time I see her, gives a very honest performance, acting-wise; no gimmicks, no cheap tricks; her scenes are wonderful because you don't see the gears. Eli Wallach, as an aged screenwriter, also has a multifaceted performance. Jude Law is surprisingly scrumptious, and Jack Black plays a nice-guy straight-man well.(caveat: there are two scenes of actors doing the ""it's a Hollywood movie, so we have to have people dance when they're in a house alone""  a prevalent curse since ""Risky Business"").The movie is an extraordinarily pleasurable experience.

A Holiday Treat,"Normally, holiday/ Christmas films are enough to make audience members puke. However, this film is a charming delight in the holiday season.Kate Winslet is absolutely adorable as the relate-able Iris, a victim of unrequited love, which she describes as the worst possible position in the game of love. After spending three years in love with a man who cheated on her, then continued to use her, she takes a vacation in Los Angeles to get away from the now engaged London native. She is an absolute sweetheart, genuine and flawed but with the most well-meaning heart. She befriends an elderly screenwriter, who is perhaps one of the best characters in the film. She also meets Jack Black, another person who is used to being used. Although Jack Black is fun as usual as film composer Miles, it is really Iris's journey that lights up the film. You will clap and scream with her as she begins to find her strength and dances in celebration.On the other side, Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a wealthy business owner from Los Angeles who can't seem to commit to a relationship. After her live-in boyfriend cheats on her, she decides to take a break from men in Iris's little cottage near London. Of course, she cannot escape the other sex as she soon meets up with Iris's older brother, Graham (Jude Law). Although it seems there may be some substance to the relationship that forms between the two ""complicated"" characters, especially when Amanda find's out a sensitive secret of Graham's, their romance still comes off a bit shallow and uninteresting. You may root for their connection, but Amanda's character is bland and goes through little change besides returning to the world of carbs and chocolates. Jude Law is adorable, but his dream-character is a little too good looking, too sensitive and too honest to be true.So half of the movie is absolutely wonderful. And if you are looking for something to light up your spirits like those dazzling lights on a Christmas tree, this is definitely the best film out there for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cameron Diaz couldn't even save this movie.The movie is about two careerminded women who book vacations in each others' homes. They soon get involved in the others' lives, mainly through men and romantic partners.It's not too good. I would say watchable but loses interest pretty early on. Once Jude Law comes in, run. And also Jack Black sucks here too. Winslet and Diaz are good.3 stars",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Emotional,funny,interesting!","I have just yesterday seen The Holiday!Its fantastic!!Its a brilliant scenario which can move you and simultaneously make you laugh..If you are emotional you should definitely watch this movie!! i surely recommend it to every romantic single as well as to every beloved couple.. Cameron Diaz is a complete sex bomb!Jude Law plays a most emotional and sweet guy,Kate Winslet makes an excellent appearance and Jack Black is as funny as always!if you are lonely at Christmas time you can actually have fun watching what desperate women can do when feeling lonely!!!Oh and by the way,i love Britain!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I enjoyed the movie!,"My girlfriends decided we go to see this 'chick flick' yesterday. I was not expecting much because I had heard a review on a morning news show the day before that did not give it a good review. I chose to remain silent and just went to see the movie.Well, what a great movie! Oscar worthy? No. Best movie I've ever seen in my life? No. But I enjoyed the whole feel of the movie and didn't even realize it was as long as it was (over 2 hrs). I especially enjoyed Jude Law's character. I think the entire cast did a great job.I'm learning to ignore professional reviews. I enjoyed the movie and have recommended my sisters see it too.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great feel good comedy for everyone.,"I won't say anything about the movie specifics so that I don't give anything away. But I think that Jack Black was amazing, he was funny and serious and played the role beautifully. Both girls did a good job although Cameron's acting wasn't GREAT at first. I love Kate Winslet so I thought she was amazing as always. Now Jude Law......I hate HATE Jude Law, I think he is a pig, he is rude and he hates women. In all the movies he has been in he plays a player, and he is a player in real life. BUT! He was AMAZING! He played his character PERFECTLY and really sold the viewer on it. I totally saw him in a different light in this movie and loved his character. So all in all I LOVED this movie, I have seen it at the theater twice already and I would love to see it again. Not only is a ""girlie"" movie but it is very funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated movie...,"Great cast and good reviews was the reasons for me to try this movie. What a disappointment.Story is weak, but you kind of expect that in romantic comedy.First hour is simply awful, long scenes, long monologues, boring, unwatchable... We wouldn't miss a thing if they told same story in 10 minutes. Other half of movie is a bit better, but not much.I love Cameron Diaz, but her acting in this movie... She had better roles. All of them.Jack Black is totally unconvincing, man has ""serial killer"" look even when he laughs (especially when he laughs!!). Who in his right mind would cast him in romantic comedy???And regarding comedy, I didn't see much (any) of that. For me the only funny thing, and only thing worth watching in this 140minutes long disaster, was 10 seconds long Dustin Hoffman's cameo.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jude does it again.,"Jude has this quality about him that just knocks me over; you want him to succeed in whatever he does...ie., Cold Mountain & Love Actually. The writer is actually the one who should get the credit but Jude delivers the lines that a woman would want to hear but may not even know it.....this was an ultimately hot movie for the modern single but older females! All the characters are very current in how they love, learn & hesitate to love again. Jack Black & Kate Winslett were even very likable, which is usually hard for me with them both. Cameron was her usual funny, quirky self. Seems like she's playing this girl in all her movies just at different stages of her life but she did great at this same 'ole/same 'ole role. Bottom line, I Loved it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome!!,"This movie is a must see! Cameron Diaz, and Kate Winslet played excellent leading roles. Neither actor has been in the spotlight so I was kind of expecting it to be lame. But it wasn't at all!!The actors really just liven the movie and make it perfect for any romance/comedy/heartfelt mood that you want to be put in. Jack Black cracks me up..he really adds the comedy to it. Jude Law is a character I have never seen before, but he did a great job. This may not mean too much, but I am the type of person that never cares much about movies. This is the first movie that has ever had me feeling that I MUST have it as soon as It comes onto video. Actually the only other movie that has done that was Titanic..and we all know how much of a huge hit that one was. I will definitely be going back to theaters to see this one. MUST SEE~ A++++++",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply Adorable!,"I went and saw this movie last night with a friend, and I absolutely loved it. It was funny, sad, made you wanna go ""Awww!!"" and all things that go with that. I sat through that whole thing going ""Aww!!"" and ""How cute!!"" I was absolutely just in love with this movie. The cast was SO great together and I loved seeing them all together as well. I think Jack Black playing a semi-serious role was awesome! I loved Kate Winslet since I have seen Titanic and Cameron Diaz since The Sweetest Thing. This was just an amazingly put together film and I give it ten stars or whatever it is they get. I definitely want to own this movie when it comes out to buy. I could watch it",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Boring, cheesy, awful","I was a bit hungover so thought I'd give this a try. Even after obliterating my brain cells with copious amounts of alcohol last night, I still couldn't enjoy this film. Struggled through 40 minutes of it then turned it off in favour of watching paint dry. This film is baaaaad",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
touching and inspiring,"This is a great way to start out the holidays. With a happy and touched spirit you will leave the theater better than when you arrived. This is a story about life and its unexpected surprises that can change your entire life. It has two opposite, two perfect scenarios that piece together and make a beautiful story. This movie goes with the saying. ""when god closes a door he opens a window."" I would definitely go see this movie again and will be purchasing it as soon as it arrives on the shelves in blockbuster. I love how opposite and completely different both of these characters are on the screen. The chemistry between Jude Law and Cameron Diaz is just perfect. Jack black was absolutely hilarious and Kate Winslet is downright surprising.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
But for Cameron Diaz's performance ...,"I've just seen this film earlier tonight and thoroughly enjoyed it! Eli Wallach should be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Diaz might have gotten away with this ""too often over-the-top"" performance ... were it not for the brilliant work of Kate Winslet, who (unfortunately) mops the screen with Ms. Diaz. Jude Law proves that he is, truly, not ""just another pretty face"" and Jack Black (for the most part) does his best work here. The cinematographer earns high praise, too ... great care is taken with many production details. There is also a very fine performance by a relatively unknown actress in a small role early in the film; watch for the work done by this talented woman, who plays Winslet's good friend from her office, during the office holiday party scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lacking Gumption,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Nancy Meyers has always written her stories from purely a female perspective and because of this, she has had a very successful box office career in film (""Something's Gotta Give"", ""Father of the Bride"", ""Baby Boom"" ""Private Benjamin""). What is always lacking in her stories is any type of balance between the genders. ""The Holiday"" lags behind even the other films listed because here we are not even shown women with ""gumption"" (an ongoing gag in the film).The formula here is two women, Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, who are both successful professionals, but a mess in their personal lives. Perfect strangers, they agree to a two week house switch (L.A. and England) to escape their own lives. Yada, Yada, Yada, they find themselves and the love of their lives. Who would have guessed? Meyers basically castrates the Jude Law character (Diaz' love interest). He is as close to a woman as any non-trans-gendered man can get. Then for some unknown reason she casts physical comedian Jack Black as Winslet's dream boat. Then she evidently directed him to ""act like Jack Black on valium"". He tries to be funny, but mostly he just looks like a lame Jack Black impersonator. Not much to say about Cameron Diaz other than she is just plain awful here. There has to be more to acting than flashing your blue eyes and flipping your silky blonde hair. Her scenes with Jude Law are excruciating to watch for any self-respecting MAN ... and should be the same way for any woman.Kate Winslet was just phenomenal in this years' ""Little Children"". It showed she is as good as any actress working today. That makes her part in this even more painful; however, I will say her scenes with Eli Wallach are what keep the film from being a total flop. Winslet has this aura of goodness and she comes across very sincere. The great Eli Wallach has a sparkle in his eye and steals every scene he is in. What a pleasure to watch a true pro at his best.Having just seen Almodovar's ""Volver"", it provided a terrific contrast between filmmakers who write about women. Almodovar has true insight into strong women and insecure women, while Meyers just writes about women as if they are characters in romance novels. Evidently that is the difference between art and box office power.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A real winter charmer!,"Unbelievably, The Holiday is the only great romantic comedy this year since The Last Holiday, which came out almost a year ago. I did not think one could top it, The Break-Up was not a technical romcom, though it was good. When I saw the trailer for The Holiday, then the poster, and then found out who wrote and directed this movie was the excellent Nancy Meyers, I just knew, never had any doubt, I was going to love this movie. The reviews did worry me and one of my most trusted critics, Richard Roeper did not enjoy it, but I do not always follow the critics so my expectations were still quite high. The cast also had me hooked, I love Kate Winslet, but having Jack Black in a romantic comedy looking prim and proper and not acting silly and wild, was very intriguing, I wanted just to know how he felt in this role. One of my favorite, very favorite movies ever is Something's Gotta Give, so you can see were my high expectations came from, I am a huge fan of Meyers because she writes and directs such great romantic comedies.The Holiday did not let me down one bit. When I was reading or listening to some of the reviews for the movie, the negative ones in particular talked about how formulaic the movie is. While watching, I have to agree it is a formulaic movie, and some instances are not very original which did have me worried, because most movies that are formulaic can't overcome that and end up being stuck in a ""just another romcom, like the rest of them"" zone, or they were just okay movies, and I didn't want a just okay movie. Now to give it credit, the film is not all formulaic, but when it is, boy is it ever. Now you're asking yourself, if it is formulaic, why are you giving it such a great grade. It is because of the cast and the way in which the movie was presented, both are such great strengths in the movie. The acting is not anything Oscar worthy but it so full of life, love and joy that you cannot help but be won over by these wonderful characters.This by far has to be my favorite role for Jack Black, or second favorite comparing to him in School of Rock. He is not his wacky self, or him being wild and spastic, which his hardcore fans may not love, so go see Tenacious D if you are looking for the typical Jack, but here we have a completely different person. He is relaxed, he is full of joy and heart and he is just cool. He also has never looked better in a movie, very put together and looks very nice besides the stunningly beautiful and extra talented Kate Winslet who is just so relaxed and effortless in her role, you just love her automatically. Cameron Diaz, I am not the biggest fan of her in real life, but she is very good in this movie, in the beginning she is really awkward and bad, but she grows on you through out and you get a hold of her character and you end up knowing her like a friend. Jude Law is the typical woman's man, and he just stands there and looks good but his story, which well if you've seen it then you know it is really quite a turn, and not so generic or clichéd and I really, really admired it because it got to me.The movie is also really, really excellently shot in both the U.K and L.A. It shows both of them really well, and England looks like a dream during Christmas time, also the house they used or cottage which is Kate's is very nice, and cozy. That is why I loved this movie, two separate stories with their own similarities, but entirely different because of the characters, who bring these heartfelt stories to life. This is a very girlie romcom and I am surprised I liked it so much, for the reason that I am a guy and I am not into the mushy romcoms that often. Though I have to admit this gets to you, it makes you cheer, it makes you laugh aloud and it makes you cry, it just makes you feel damn happy at the end, it has such a great and cheerful ending. It is sappy and it is somewhat formulaic, but it works so incredibly well and I really cherished this movie. This is the movie of the holiday season along with The Pursuit of Happiness & Charlotte's Web. It will make your holiday I swear, you must run out and see it.Bottom Line: Cheerful, sappy, funny, and extremely charming, the Holiday is a winter charmer.Review by Jordan Appugliesi, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cup of hot chocolate in a cold winter,"I remembered that one of my friends told me that she doesn't like to watch Xmas movies on Xmas Eve. She probably will change her mind after watch this one.

The Holiday is the perfect gift for the movie-goer.,"Both Iris (Kate Winslet) and Amanda (Cameron Diaz) have let's just say ""unfortunate"" luck with men. In hopes of escaping their lives for even just a little while, these two women switch homes for the holidays. Iris lives in London, England while Amanda can be found in Los Angeles, USA. They both meet great men (Jude Law and Jack Black) who change their mind about men all together and give them a glimmer of happiness. What ensues is a brilliantly written story. The script is intelligent and witty. It is hilarious. A heartwarming movie just in time for the holidays. A must-see for anyone who would like to have a good time. Perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pure Fantasy and Fluff,"I can understand why someone would like this film, but for me it is the antithesis of good. I would rather watch Battlefield Earth. Never have I ever seen a movie that made me want to murder myself (yes, I've seen Requiem for a Dream).I can't stand these characters. What is Jack Black doing in this film? I think it's great that he's not typecast; however, his character is awkward and creepy. He has an underlying energy that just doesn't work with the material. Maybe if he were a serial killer, then this character would be believable. I didn't expect anything good from Cameron Diaz and my expectations were met. The End. Kate Winslet being in this film upsets me because I like and respect her as an actress. The only thing I remember about her character is that she is dorky or antisocial  or something like that. I guess she did a good job, but in the end it doesn't really matter. All of these characters are whiny and self-centered. Overall, I don't care about their problems because they're not presented as real problems.I hate that this movie references other movies to validate itself. Maybe it didn't happen that often, but did enough to annoy me. It didn't even accomplish this in clever funny ways; they simply say ""(Insert name of film) is good."" Well then why am I watching this film? I think I'll watch the good movie.For me, this film didn't properly handle the material it presents. The two main characters switch houses and both fall in love with men they otherwise would never meet because of the extreme distance. I didn't feel that there were any consequences for these people. Of course it's a comedy and I don't expect everything to be depressing, but I would have liked to have seen more a bit more conflict. I've been in this situation before; Skype sex is not all it's cracked up to be.Don't take me too seriously. I have talked to many people who have enjoyed this film and there is a good chance that you will too. It's not going to change your life, but at least it's uplifting. For whatever reason, this movie managed to push all of my bad buttons.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Holiday - very Christmassy and a great cast,"The casting director for the holiday must be very happy with themselves as 'the holiday' has a cast that has the widest demographic appeal. No matter your age or gender you'll find someone from the four main stars to watch. The smart move was adding Jack Black to the cast because it could have been written-off by the male population as a 'chick flick'.For parts of the film you have to suspend some realities but aside from this the storyline is both interesting and not too sickly sweet.'The holiday' is an unchallenging, easy-to-watch, romantic comedy and I would recommend to most people. Like red wine, I'd suggest this would be best to watch at home on a cold winters night.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great feel good movie!,"I'm not into mooshy chick flicks, I find them predictable and so, so frustrating and very boring. But the Holiday was extremely different, it wasn't complicated or tedious, it was just a nice movie. I was in the middle of exams when I watched it and it was the perfect remedy for a bit of the old stress. The acting I thought was great, Kate Winslet did a perfect job of her character and Jude Law was surprisingly good as well, even Cameran Diaz was great (a bit of a shock as well) and Jack Black was once again a very satisfying character.If you like movies like Love Actually, Notting Hill or My Best Friends Wedding then this is just for you.Don't think about it too hard though and you will really enjoy it.Extremely satisfying feel good movie of the year.Two thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
