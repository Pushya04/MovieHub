Wickedly awesome - One of the best,"Up until now, I was convinced that from the 4th book onwards, Harry Potter-books had become too complex to make into film: Goblet of Fire was a sore disappointment. Order of the Phoenix left many Potterheads wanting more, even if it wasn't a bad film per se (personally I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I felt they left out too much). Half-blood Prince -while visually stunning- did not capture the brilliance of the book. With ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", I think the makers have finally succeeded in crafting a movie that was both fun to watch for casual viewers while also catering to the needs of the hard-core fans who know the books by heart. The decision to split the movie into two parts may be judged as a financial one by some, but I'm convinced it was the only possible way to make this work. The movie was cut off at the perfect time as well, having the viewers yearn for more without being too abrupt.I don't want to give away anything, so I'll just say this: Hats of to you, David Yates. One can only hope the second installment will continue in the same vein...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dark and thrilling, this prelude packs genuine suspense, heart and the occasional exhilarating action to deliver an engrossing magical spectacle","A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate instalment of Harry Potter. ""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise.Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal.There are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a dizzyingly exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie.Indeed, naysayers who think David Yates doesn't know how to stage thrilling action sequences should think again, as he demonstrates amply that he is just as capable when it comes to staging them. He also displays an uncanny knack for milking suspense out of scenes- in particular, Harry, Hermoine and Ron's daring raid on the Ministry of Magic and their subsequent visit to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and home to Bathilda Bagshot, a magician and dear friend to Dumbledore. These brim with nail-biting tension, and Yates plays them out nicely to set your pulse racing at the end.The crux of this film however lies in the relationships between Harry, Hermoine and Ron as they set off in the middle of the film across the bleak English countryside on their quest to discover the means to destroy the Horcruxes. On the run from Voldemort, the trio find the immensity of their journey taking a toll on them. Harry and Ron's friendship begins to fray as Ron grows suspect of Hermoine's affections for Harry. Meanwhile, Harry can barely conceal his frustration with getting no headway and starts losing his temper at Ron.Infused with a profound sense of isolation and loss, this middle stretch in the film may be tedious for some impatient viewers, but fans will be rewarded with probably the richest depiction of the relationships between the characters since the first two movies. One scene where Harry and Hermoine suddenly decide to dance together to the tune of Nick Cave's The Children playing on the radio is lyrical in its depiction of their desperate attempt to find levity in a world that affords none. Yes, their friendship strong and deep since the beginning will be tested, and Yates delivers an emotional payoff towards the end of the film that is truly poignant.Thanks to the decision to split the final book into two films, Yates doesn't hurry through these scenes. Instead, he allows the audience to experience the frustration, jealousy and uncertainty of his characters, and allows for Radcliffe, Watson and Grint to display some fine acting with the minimalest distraction from any visual effects. The additional time also turns out to be a blessing for fans and audiences, allowing them the opportunity to see their favourite supporting characters back on screen- most prominently of course Dobby the elf who returns to give the movie a touching finale.Amidst the gloom, screenwriter Steve Kloves again provides for rare welcome moments of levity. Harry's escort mission is aided by magical decoys of Harry, one of them wearing a bra. To get to the Ministry of Magic, one needs to flush oneself down a toilet bowl. These occasional sparks of humour enliven a film that is otherwise ominous and menacing. Kloves however fumbles slightly with the lengthy expository, and those who have not read the book will find themselves struggling to catch up with the significance of certain characters (e.g. Sirius' brother, Regulus Arcturus Black) and certain events (e.g. Bathilda turning into a slithering serpent).Still Kloves never had an enviable task to begin with, and Yates- at his most confident here- guides the proceedings along admirably, unfolding them briskly at the start, then settling in for a deliberately measured pace and finally picking up speed for as much as a climax as this first- parter can have. His assuredness also shows in his artistic choices, especially a wayang-kulit-like animated sequence telling the story of the Deathly Hallows.Though we know better than to expect the grand showdown between Harry and Voldemort by the end of the film, there is still a distinct sense that what we have seen so far is only a build-up for something bigger and far more astounding. But even as a prelude, this seventh film is notable in its own right, a tense and thrilling experience darker, scarier and more mature than any of its predecessors",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A grown-up movie that fits a grown-up Potter,"After having seen HP6, I honestly didn't have great expectations in this one. I guessed it would be darker and scarier, as every HP movie has been darker and scarier than its predecessor. But HP6 was such a patchwork of scenes that didn't give you the feeling of a coherent work - I was afraid the even more complex story line of HP7 would make an even less coherent movie. However, I must say it was definitely a wise decision to split the 7th book into 2 movies. HP7 can take time to explain and introduce all the characters that are necessary to the plot.I love the way Voldemort and the Death Eaters are portrayed in this movie. They are no longer just anonymous caped figures. You can see them interacting with each other, discussing and well... being human. Well, I'm always a big fan of the blurring of these clearcut good/evil categories in Fantasy.As the book is split into 2 parts, all of a sudden, there's also time for little embellishments I hadn't realized I had missed in the earlier movies! For example, I loved the scene so much where the feather floated through the air when the fairy tale of the Three Brothers was being told. Also the drawing style that was used during the story was really amazing. This HP movie was the first of all that finally gave me the same feeling as Lord of the Rings did: Boy, this is not just some guys slavishly adapting a book into a movie, but they're actually autonomous artists and they have ideas of their own! And I don't mean they changed the whole plot (I wouldn't like that)! But (mostly visually) they did more than just bring across what's in the book.This also expresses itself in the decision not to include the childish Harry Potter musical theme (at least I didn't hear it, correct me if I'm wrong) from the first movie that sounds like ""Wow, everything's so magical here!"" That tune was fine for the first movie, but as Harry got older and the movies got darker, it kind of felt like they had to force this theme into every movie several times even though it didn't really fit any more. Now the soundtrack, too, has finally grown up. And I loved it! Last but not least, the acting was brilliant! The tense atmosphere between Harry, Ron and Hermione really came across. Also with all the doppelg√§nger scenes, you always still saw from their movements and behaviour which character was which though they were in disguise in a different body.All in all, as the title says, this is a excellent grown-up movie and I can recommend it to everyone - except kids! If you have little kids, please don't take them. This movie has far too many scary scenes and little comic relief! Plus, the plot is quit complex including lots and lots of minor characters. It's really no longer a movie targeted at kids, even though it's still labelled ""Harry Potter"".",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Well, the fans asked for it, and they got it","Ever since the release of the first Harry Potter movie in 2001, I've wondered how a TV miniseries of the books would have fared. The movies so far have had difficulties showing enough of the books' events within a reasonable time slot to keep the story flowing. They've all had to omit significant plot points, which has not only disappointed the more literal-minded fans but risked the integrity of the story. This was most painfully evident in the fifth movie, ""Order of the Phoenix,"" which awkwardly attempted to fit the longest Potter book into just 2 hours and 15 minutes of film. The result was a movie that felt choppy and barely coherent, almost dreamlike. The two best films up to now--the third and the sixth--worked in part because they took the most risks, often departing substantially from the narrative of the books, to the consternation of many fans. I was not one of the fans complaining, because I figured that as long as it wasn't a miniseries, the best approach was to interpret the story rather than present the events exactly as they appeared in the books.Dividing the seventh book into two movies has given a taste of what a miniseries might have been like. ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is a more faithful adaptation than any of the previous films. This surprised me a little, because the portion of Book Seven it covers is actually longer than the entirety of some of the earlier books. (As I was rereading it a few months ago, I correctly guessed where they'd end Part 1--it's at an important turning point in the story that occurs close to the two-thirds mark.) Most of the film's sequences are exactly as I had envisioned them, and sometimes better than I had envisioned them. I especially liked its approach to the Riddle-Hermione scene, to the matter of protective enchantments around their camp (which is handled with a nice dose of spookiness), and to a spell that distorts a character's face. Apart from the oversimplification of a few plot details here and there, any flaws in the story come straight from the book. The two-and-half-hour movie drags at some points, but then so did the book, particularly in the forest scenes. The plot concerns Voldemort's takeover of the wizarding world and pursuit of Harry, who goes into hiding with Ron and Hermione but repeatedly endangers them and himself in his daunting efforts to find and destroy a set of objects that keep Voldemort immortal, aided only by a few enigmatic clues Dumbledore has left him.It is not a very accessible film for non-fans. People who haven't read or seen any of the previous installments will probably be lost. It never once pauses to explain the Harry Potter universe or anything about the background to these tumultuous events, not even a prologue like the one that began the third of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films. The good news is that it doesn't condescend to the audience. The bad news is that if you don't know or can't remember things like what a horcrux is or what happens when you point a wand at someone and say ""Obliviate,"" you might have trouble following the story.As a fan, however, I loved it. It's just well-filmed, and I had notably fewer complaints about acting and special effects than I had for the previous movies. The CGI is relatively unobtrusive, and there aren't too many fake-looking moments. (The house-elves look especially good this time.) Ralph Fiennes finally appears to have settled into the role of Voldemort, after having delivered somewhat phoned-in performances previously. The kids, who get to dominate more scenes than in any of the other films, when their presence was counterbalanced by a plethora of seasoned British performers who are mostly absent here, have really grown into their roles. They were well-cast from the start and always had a certain raw talent, but early in the series they possessed some of the amateur qualities common to young actors. They have become increasingly proficient as the series has progressed (which I suspect was what the studio intended when it eschewed the tradition of casting older actors in child roles). Here they display the kind of camaraderie that can only be developed gradually, after having acted together in several films, and it makes the scenes that deal with their relationship feel natural and unforced.I actually look forward to seeing the movie again at some point, just so I can sit back and take in more of the details. I think I didn't appreciate it enough the first time, distracted as I was by my knowledge of what happens in the book and the lack of any significant divergence in the film's depiction. There is not a lot in this film that will surprise fans; the enjoyment comes from seeing how vividly it is all brought to life.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A strong beginning to a grand finale. The best film of the franchise so far.,"It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one, if they haven't read the books already.With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years (and films) progress. Part I of the ""Deathly Hallows"" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody.I won't waste time trying to talk about the performances, because they are all great and powerful in their own way. Never mind that many of the cast members are very talented veteran British actors (try getting John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, Jason Isaacs and Bill Nighy in the same film again) - the three young actors who we have come to love and care for following the first film a decade ago, basically carry the franchise on their shoulders, and this film is no exception. Radcliffe looks handsome, Grint looks gruff, and Watson looks gorgeous. They've grown into fine young people.Screenwriter Steve Kloves doesn't forget to add the mood and gloom to the story as it slowly unfolds, but then again he adds some light humor to the film when it needs it. Bonus points for making this not only a visual spectacle, but also a character-driven ensemble; there's some complex characterization here. Also there's some action which aren't seen on screen, but mentioned by the characters. It's OK, because it's necessary for the brisk pacing, and it's not really that important anyways. Besides, the human mind can imagine these images far more powerfully.There are many themes in this film. Sacrifice, determination, (obviously) friendship, and above all - acceptance. As the films progressed the films started to gain an increasingly dark momentum - signaling that all hope may be lost. But in the end, will good triumph over evil? Like the film, real life isn't so sure. Also, the fact that the actors and crew are moving on after a decade of making these films - it's also another way of acceptance - the films have ended, they're moving on for the better of their lives/careers. It's real life, and I wish all these promising young actors brilliant lives and careers ahead of them.""Hallows: Part I"" is many parts thrilling, as there are quite a number of intense action sequences. Many of them, of course, are done with well-rendered visual effects, and in this one they just blend in at a natural level without being too jarring. However, the action sequences are perfectly blended in with the gripping, dramatic moments. They don't feel heavy handed and it's beautiful to look at. The animated sequence about the origins of the Deathly Hallows is an absolute masterclass and jaw-droppingly beautiful to both watch and listen. If separated by itself it can win an Oscar for best animated short.The crew also get their due here. David Yates has gotten a firm grip on the film's direction since directing the fifth and sixth films years ago. The cinematography is stunning and exquisite, and it gives off a certain moody hue to the film. The editing is also crisp, it's not choppy when it doesn't need to be. Alexandre Desplat's score really makes a difference, it literally puts you into the world with its beautiful, harmonious, and emotional tones.In short, I would have to say that this film is the best ""Harry Potter: film yet in all honesty. I grew up with the series, and as per the actors, it will be an emotional goodbye. But rest assured, the finale will be grand.One more thing. This interpretation of the novel is the best one yet. The novel is done justice, something not seen since the first three films. It's something for both the fans and novel-readers alike, as there are some pieces only book readers can discover while watching the film. It's definitely a huge improvement over ""Half-Blood Prince""'s adaptation, which for me is the worst Potter film.Harry Potter is a phenomenon. But, like all things, it most come to an end eventually. This is the beginning of the end, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Overall rating: 75/100P.S.:Eat your hearts out, Twi-hards.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
no longer just for kids; a dark adult-fantasy movie with a couple of lulls,"As Harry and Ron and Hermoine and everyone else has grown up, so have the audiences with the Potter franchise. So it should make some sense that by the time the seventh book has come around that it's coming down to the wire: the big showdown between Harry and the Man-We-Don't-Speak- His-Name, oh, whatever, Voldemort. It's usually that the mid-point movie (i.e. Empire Strikes Back) is the darkest one, but there was a quasi-dark ending to Half-Blood Prince, so it makes more sense that the filmmakers take Rowling's Deathly Hallows and turn it into what it should be: a ripping good apocalypse yarn.I kid a little, but it is a movie with a lot of black contours and desolation, as the trio might be walking through the British version of The Road minus some of the gray-scale photography. That, and the main 'plot' being that Harry has to find the horcruxes, which are items that could be used by Voldemort for very evil purposes. But then the next problem comes as how to destroy them? It's this section of the film, after a very entertaining section where the three go in disguise as full-grown-ups (a funny and intense scene in the Ministry of Magic), that it gets into a rhythm that is not what one would expect in a big- budget holiday blockbuster. A lot of it is sitting around contemplating, waiting, trying to figure things out, and if the audience gets impatient it's not due to the filmmaker's making it bungled but because the characters are having trouble figuring it out too, and we feel for them.Talking with my wife about the books in relation to the movies, I'm told that book seven is meant to be a character piece for a large part of it when they're in the woods (indeed it's something like a hundred pages of these woods scenes with the three, or sometimes two, of them frustrated in figuring out the symbols and suspense of running from the gestapo- like figures of the Dark Lord). But is Rowling as good at characters as she is at clever plots and intricate details of magic? Yes and no. Yes in that she makes good characters that we want to be around (for the most part, sometimes Ron gets on ones nerves), and no in that they are at best two dimensional figures, even with Harry, and there's only so much character to explore. But there are instances where one can excuse the tedium of some of these woods scenes. A moment where Harry and Hermoine have a levity pause and dance to music could be seen as extraneousness, but when it has the music of Nick Cave signing sad blues, why carp?David Yates' direction has found after a few of these movies- Order of the Phoenix still the best of his efforts but not far ahead of this one- and he has a classical style as far as big-budget high-action-adventure movies go in Hollywood. He can let an actor's rhythm speak for itself, and he has a really wonderful scene for a whole mess of top-tier British talent (i.e. Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter et all) in the opening scene at Voldermort's castle. When it's exciting such as a fast-paced chase in the sky, it's exciting, and when it needs to slow down there's still attention to be paid to what's going down. Only a few points that a non-book reader such as myself such as a wedding scene for a minor character from movies past and a few points of reference for a couple of items or characters get lost on me.This is the kind of production that has great attributes and only a couple of damning liabilities, though the former outweighs the latter. There's a sequence where the story of the Deathly Hallows- how the three men who made deals with death for items and things- is told with a unique animation style that has silhouettes and figures that look like a Tim Burton special. It's one of the most breathtaking passages in any Potter movie, sophisticated to the point of impressing any serious fan of fable-storytelling. But the downsides... well, again, some of the pacing in those woods scenes are less than great. But more than that is a kind of curious aspect to the climax, which without spoiling much involves a character who we've only seen in one other Potter movie (I leave this non-spoiler for those who haven't read the books - those that do know what I mean already), and it's a tragic fate for the character. It's a fine moment of drama, but it lacks the punch that was likely there in the book as it's a character who is barely in the film itself and will need some memory-digging for the character's significance before.But as far as movies where artistic integrity takes place over dumb-loud action and is able to weave visual fx with the practical side of sets and costumes and things with the CGI is very commendable. It's no wonder that Guillermo del-Toro came close to directing this movie, as it appeals to a sensibility that reads the fantastical and supernatural as part of the world, even if one can't see it quite at first. Oh, and the other downside I almost neglected... it's the first part of a two-part finale. It's like getting a half slice of a BIG epic movie, so it's still big, but half-big. But as far as half-slice epics go, it's one of the best in the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A big improvement in the series!,"In my mind, the Deathly Hallows Part 1 captured the feeling of exactly what the Harry Potter movies should have been all along: gritty, emotional, and cinematic. I haven't been a huge fan of any of the HP movies to date, but I was pleased with the Deathly Hallows because it took a big step up in maturity from the ""children's fantasy"" genre and focused on themes very central to the seventh book: hopelessness and desperation.After the death of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the magical world falls into disarray as Voldemort gains power over the Ministry of Magic and hunts tirelessly after his mortal enemy and our continuing protagonist, Harry Potter. While keeping a low cover, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine decide to track down and destroy Voldemort's soul contained in hidden ""horcruxes"" but have difficulties deciding what to do and where to start.The Deathly Hallows very successfully portrays the despair-filled journey of the wizarding trio. With dark undertones running through the cinematography, Part 1 of the Harry Potter finale is the film that deals more with the emotional stagnation of the characters and spends less time with action scenes and major plot points. Since Rowling's seventh book is separated into two movies, Part 1 boasts a much slower pace than earlier HP films and is not so focused on cramming as many subplots and side-stories from the book as possible into the movie's runtime, which tends to clutter up the storyline and make the whole thing feel rushed.But where the slow pacing makes this film stand out in the series, it also may be its downfall. The Deathly Hallows continually feeds us a feeling of desolation as Harry, Ron and Hermoine fail to discover a way to destroy the horcruxes; they seem to be making no progress towards defeating the Dark Lord, but as an effect the movie seems to be making no progress towards an ending. Storyline lags intensely towards the middle of the film and is dragged out until the conclusion (which ends abruptly). You'll be left in your seats feeling like this is going nowhere- but that's the point: Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are getting nowhere. So I liked this movie because the pace was slow, but I also didn't like this movie because the pace was slow. See what I'm getting at? Aside from that, I can't complain much. Performances were fine, effects were impressive, and best of all, nothing dastardly was done to J.K. Rowling's story.The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a nice improvement and a fine addition to the Harry Potter series and should serve as a solid emotional base for Part 2 to take off with next year. If you've enjoyed the HP movies so far, this should be a satisfying experience at least. If not, let the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 redeem your faith in the series. 7/10P.S. Keep on the lookout for the scene about the deathly hallows story. It has some of the most beautiful and artistic animation I have ever seen in a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"This is not a run of the mill series, but something which has been intricately planned for from almost the very beginning. With the last few films crafting the level of suspense into a crescendo, where each film augments the impending doom and gloom culminating in the finale seen in The Half Blood Prince, things get a lot worst here from the start, where The Deathly Hallows begins with a grim reminder from the Minister of Magic, before we see Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his ghastly lieutenants plot to take over both realms Muggle or not in quite Fascist terms.Yes you read that right, and what I thought was quite the brilliant stroke of genius to transmit that level of fear and dread into the Potter world through something quite familiar in our world, where there's a takeover of ministries and the installation of past villains who are puppets of the regime, the continued discrimination and probable extermination of the ordinary, non magical Muggles and even the half-breeds against those who are of pure magical blood, and a curious scene where a disguised Potter head inside the undergrounds of the Ministry only to see propaganda being created by the masses in creepy, clockwork like fashion.Everything is doom and gloom with copious amounts of shades, shadows, black and grey (save for Hermione's red dress in one scene), where our heroic trio are quite clueless without their guardian headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) always ready to pull some strings from behind the scenes. His absence is largely felt, and they are left mostly to their own devices and smarts to try and figure out a way to get to the remaining Horcruxes and to destroy them. They become the hunted with little allies to rely on, where betrayal seem the norm, almost from within their own circle of trust as well where a major subplot continues to dwell on the suggested romantic/platonic dynamics between Hermione with Harry and Ron, the former sharing a curious dance sequence while on the run, and the latter, well having his worst fear confront his lack of courage to tell Hermione just how he feels for her, well, from how many films ago.So the verdict is whether The Deathly Hallows warranted two films. My answer is a resounding, definite yes, because there's so much going on in the story, of the relationships and friendships forged over the years, of the closure both good and bad that has to come to the myriad of characters introduced (J.K. Rowling doesn't show a lot of mercy by the way), and not to mention the inherent quest that Harry, Ron and Hermione chose to embark on that has gone beyond just the survival of Harry Potter, and what's more, introduces to us what those Deathly Hallows actually are, which goes just beyond the destruction of the Horcuxes. Danger lurks at every corner and the narrative spins at breakneck speed, harrowing most times with the frequent close shaves the rookies encounter against their enemies who are growing more powerful by the minute.While the previous films have boasted special effects extravaganzas be it little things to pepper the scene or large battles between wizards and witches, this is kept surprisingly muted in the film since it's swaying on one end of the spectrum with Evil gaining an upper hand, and most of the effects not already something seen before in the earlier Potter films. But what ultimately leads this film into being the more powerful one, is the strength of the story and how it leads you along the way, building anticipation as we root for positive outcomes as much as possible, with slight comedy punctuating appropriate moments to lift the spirits.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all share that perfect camaraderie that's been built over the years, it's no wonder that they add that convincing depth and natural realism to their friendship, with an audience that has largely grew up with them as well. There's no ensemble cast like the one assembled for the Potter franchise, though most of them - Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Bill Nighy, Tom Felton and a long list more - come and go too frequent and too soon, but one hopes the evil Death Eaters do get their spotlight by the time the second installment rolls over.Chris Columbus may have begun the film franchise and made it a large welcome for the young (especially) and old to embrace J.K Rowling's magical world, but I am of the opinion that David Yates inherited the franchise at the right point from The Order of the Phoenix where things required a consistent hand rather than a rotating director's chair, and developed the franchise into what it is today in quite unassuming terms. Credit also has to go to Steve Kloves who has adapted from Rowling's books (save for the point where Yates came onboard), knowing what best to adapt into the film, and what to leave behind, steering clear of the more cutesy tales and plunging us headlong into Voldemort's return and ascension to power.You know that this will end in a cliffhanger, and what a cliffhanger it is, whetting your appetite to devour Part 2 as soon as it's released, just so to witness how the film franchise of our generation will fittingly conclude. I can't wait, and I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of fans around the world cannot wait for the next too.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
totalitarianism takes over in the wizarding world,"If you've read all the Harry Potter books, then you should know that, as the series went on, they essentially became an allegory for totalitarianism. Certainly one can see that in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"". Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson reprise their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively. The three are now having to live almost in secret due to the almost fascistic takeover of the wizarding world by Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) minions. In fact, while the three are undercover in the office building, the factory looks like something out of Nazi Germany or Stalin's USSR: the employees robotically help to publish material which pushes a fear of the ""other"" (in this case Muggles, or non-wizards). Harry, Ron and Hermione are like the French Resistance, one might say.Anyway, it's a good thing that they broke the final book into two movies. So far, they're doing a really good job not only bringing the magic to the screen, but also warning of the dangers that totalitarian entities - represented here by the Death Eaters - pose. I recommend it.Tom Felton, Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Julie Walters reprise their roles from the previous movies, with new additions Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fairly loyal to the book,"I just got home from watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I will try not to give any spoilers, but I thought it was one of the best movies yet. I thought moreover that it was fairly loyal to the book for once, as far as it was possible. I thought the tension build up was very good throughout the movie, I liked seeing the characters being slightly more matured. There are some new kind of 'special effects' in the movie, which was kind of weird to me at first, but I guess it fitted the story.

But let's have Daniel Radcliff take off his shirt so they won't know they've been suckered."" Even if you're read the book and watched the other movies, the plot is incomprehensible.

"Just Part 1, Yet Excellent Enough on its Own Merits","The last book in the Harry Potter saga has been split into two parts. At first, maybe people would think it is to squeeze some more financial mileage out of the series. On the other hand, having watched this installment, there is simply too much complex storytelling involved in this book to cram it into only one two and half hour movie.This Part 1 is already a very full two and half hours. The drama begins even before the opening credits roll. The special effects have reached a new high point with the trick of using polyjuice potion to create multiple Harry's. The frenetic escape of Harry in Hagrid's motor sidecar is an achievement in action editing. The trio's penetration of the Ministry of Magic to get the locket horcrux is very exciting and tension-filled.Momentum dips a bit in the midsection as our trio scour the English wilderness for a way to destroy the horcrux. This prolonged section, which some may find boring, dealt more with the personal relationships loyalty of the three friends as challenges are thrown their way. The segment is marked by the hard-to-watch bloodlust of Bellatrix Lestrange and the nobility of Dobby. Watch out too for a most unexpected dance scene which will surely make you smile, if not actually chuckle!In the third section, we learn what the ""deathly hallows"" are referred to in the title as our trio learns it from Xenophilius Lovegood. But the main highlight here is a most amazing animated short featurette called ""The Tale of Three Brothers"" as narrated by Hermione. This Part 1 ends very well with a sky-splitting final cliffhanger sequence.Its been repeatedly mentioned how the main actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have all grown up in front of our eyes as this movie series unfolded. Rupert and Emma are both taller than Daniel already! Acting-wise, everyone had likewise improved very much. They all even show some skin here. Yes, even Hermione! The support from the esteemed gallery of British actors and actresses serve the film very well indeed. We saw everyone from all the previous films it seems, except for Maggie Smith.The direction of David Yates is excellent as he did in the last two films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves got just the proper mix of action, drama and humor needed to make the saga work on screen. This may just be a set-up installment, however, it stands very strong on its own merits. As the last scene faded to black, the audience will definitely develop the resolve to watch out for the concluding part to be released next summer, and witness the epic Battle of Hogwarts.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Dark, Amazing and Wicked Beginning of the End","Almost a decade has passed since Harry first encountered Hogwarts. The long anticipated battle between Harry and Voldemort is drawing near. Hogwarts has become no more safe haven. The Ministry has set Harry as a fugitive. The beginning of the end has begun.First, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is the seventh film in the Harry Potter series based on the first half of the book. It is as usual dark in a David-Yates- Style. In its whole 146-minute run, ""Deathly Hallows"" follows Harry, Hermione and Ron who are on the run from the MInistry of Magic now controlled by the bald-looking, dangerous, evil Voldemort as well as trying to locate and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes as explained in ""Half-Blood Prince"".""Deathly Hallows"" will introduce several new characters and they include Xenophilius Lovegood and Rufus Scrmigeour. Xenophilius Lovegood is undoubtedly Luna Lovegood's father. While Rufus Scrmigeour is the Minister until the Death Eaters swarm in the Minister. ""Deathly Hallows"" also sees the return of our beloved characters such as Dobby and Kreacher, the house elves.""Deathly Hallows"" will not only introduce new characters but also new locations and they include the Malfoy Manor, where the Malfoys live. We will also see Harry, Ron and Hermione in the mortal world rather than the magical world for around half of the book such as Tottenham Court Road.A note for Harry Potter fans, you will not see Harry, Hermione and Ron in Hogwarts anymore. There will be no Quidditch games, Fred and George's shop, love potion problems or even their friends although Neville and Luna appear in small roles. So, ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is really dark than the previous films and there will be no happy moments. But, the movie will still have some jokes, funny ones to cheer up scenes which are too heart-breaking.The movie will also see some emotional scenes that will show growth in the characters especially Ron. The relationship between Hermione and Ron would be a little bit threatened due to the quest and of course, a bit of Harry.The performances by the actors and actresses actually match the Oscar standards I would say. Emma Watson shows growth in her acting and seemed confident than ever. Rupert Grint showed some growth in his acting too by the emotional scenes given. Daniel Radcliffe seemed even more confident but was a bit less in depth compared to the other two. Overall, the movie consists of remarkable acting performances. But, I would say the one who performed best was as always from the fifth film, Helena Bonham Carter or known as the wicked Bellatrix Lestrange. The acting was totally perfect not to mention the remarkable acting contribution from Imelda Staunton or better known as Dolores Umbridge.Exciting and thrilling, I really enjoyed the film. It was dark, brilliant and perfect. Although a bit slow-paced, I still really enjoyed the film. I don't think it will disappoint any one even its book's fans. Even though the scenes were re-arranged while some excluded, it was still acceptable and as a reader of the book, I really appreciated the changes. So, book fans of the series, you wouldn't be too disappointed with the movie as the movie was loyal enough to the book. Also, the film ends with a horrifying scene related to Voldemort and it makes you have the creeps. But, that all ends in Part 2, doesn't it?Thank you David Yates for creating a very dark and amazing film. Can't wait for Part 2!Prince AJB's Score: 10/10Thanks for reading my review on ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"". Hope it's useful to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst and Longest of the Series,"Worst of the Harry Potter series. The biggest problem to me seems that they wanted to save money on effects and actors by spending endless amount of time shooting outdoor forest fly-by scenes instead of including side plots and more special effects. The movie has about 30 minutes of outdoor scenes which could be completely removed. Also, there's a scene where Harry and Hermione dance that is supposed to be poignant, but I found it endless and pointless. I can't remember the last time I saw a non-musical movie which included a complete song. Usually they are shortened to show the highlights and move the story along, but not Deathly Hallows. I'll definitely not be too worried about buying the extended DVD! I'd actually pay extra for a better edited version.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
*A Dark Journey into the Heart of Magic*,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" masterfully sets the stage for the epic conclusion of the beloved saga. This film is not merely a bridge to the grand finale; it is a haunting exploration of friendship, sacrifice, and the moral dilemmas that accompany the battle between good and evil.From the very first frame, we are thrust into a world that feels more mature and weighty, reflecting the turbulent journey Harry, Hermione, and Ron are embarking on. The cinematography is visually arresting, capturing the grim ambiance of a wizarding world under threat. The emotive score weaves its way through the film, enhancing the somber themes and elevating emotional moments such as the hauntingly beautiful sequence at the Malfoy Manor.The performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint showcase a profound depth that showcases their characters' growth over the series. In this installment, their vulnerability is palpable, forcing them to confront their fears and the reality of loss. The chemistry among the trio shines, reminding viewers of the power of their bond amidst chaos.One of the film's standout elements is the portrayal of the Deathly Hallows themselves-presented not just as objects of power, but as symbols of choice and consequence, challenging the notion of what it truly means to be a hero. The story unfolds with a sense of urgency and a touch of melancholy, as we witness our beloved characters grappling with the weight of destiny and the inevitable cost of the impending war.Director David Yates skillfully balances moments of tension with fleeting glimmers of hope, allowing the audience to breathe through their despair. The pacing feels both deliberate and urgent, drawing us deeper into a narrative that builds suspense while remaining faithful to the source material.In ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"" we find themes of loyalty and rebellion interwoven with breathtaking visuals and a gripping storyline. It's a film that demands reflection-a powerful reminder that magic, in its purest form, lies not just in spells and potions, but in the choices we make when faced with adversity. As the first half of the series finale, this film is a poignant reminder that the end is not merely an ending but an opportunity for growth, resilience, and the unwavering strength of the human spirit.""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is a unique cinematic gem that leaves an imprint on the heart, beckoning us to reflect on the finer intricacies of love, loss, and the courage it takes to stand against darkness. It is a brilliant prelude that prepares the audience for the riveting conclusion to a saga that has shaped a generation.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It Doesn't Exactly Cast a Spell,"""Harry! Hermione! Ron!""I joked with some friends on the way to the theater that the preceding utterances would likely sum up the bulk of the dialogue in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. You see, with the exception of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the feature films that have sought to transform J.K. Rowling's vision of witchcraft and wizardry into a viable cinematic franchise have been‚Äîin my estimation‚Äîdry, predictable, and not all that engaging. Here, where we experience ""the beginning of the end,"" it's clear that director David Yates was able to harness some of the energy and urgency that fueled his previous offering. ""Some,"" of course, is the key word. Though the movie is book-ended by some admirably crafted action sequences that effectively immerse us in the far-flung world of wands, potions and evil lords, the middle sags, as Langston Hughes would say, ""like a heavy load.""Our protagonists' interactions have become increasingly complex as they've aged, and that's pushed to the next level in Deathly Hallows. No longer are Harry and company holding hands and exchanging superficial banter with those of the opposite sex: here, we see our hero exude confidence (and, perhaps, maturity) as he goes straight for a kiss right from the get-go. In fact, sexual tension courses through nearly every scene of the production. There's even an odd occurrence where we witness the feigned lustful encounter of some familiar characters via a mysterious vapor.Given their age, this isn't all that surprising, and it ultimately adds some believability to the maturation unfolding before us. On the flip side, this also means that we're exposed to a number of drawn-out sequences that seem more like forced characterization rather than anything truly genuine.And this is where the problems begin for Deathly Hallows. After a grand opening, we're forced to endure an hour (or so) of watching moody teenagers meander through the wilderness. They're searching for horcruxes‚Äîthese objects are the key to defeating Voldemort (I think)‚Äîand the location and purpose of each one is shrouded in mystery (surprise!).Naturally, it takes a lot of interviewing and pondering for the necessary revelations to take place, but they eventually do, and we're treated to a third act that's vastly more entertaining than anything that comes before.A few other notes: hints of Lord of the Rings abound, especially when a horcrux on a chain acts as a burden for each of our protagonists. Just as we've seen with the ""one ring"" in Middle Earth, this item brings out the worst in its bearer. And, as one of my students noted in a recent essay submission, there are some blatant comparisons made between Lord Voldemort to Adolf Hitler (and subsequently Nazi Germany). I don't necessarily mind this, but anyone familiar with popular culture or world history might find the preaching of Rowling a little heavy-handed.As stated in my review of Half-Blood Prince, I have not read any of the novels. I'm told that much of what we see in Deathly Hallows is important to further fleshing out our heroic trio, and I'm willing to chalk up what I can only describe as ""tedium"" to screenwriter Steve Kloves desire to remain faithful to the source material.But the question remains: for this to be the start of a slam-bang finish, couldn't something have been done to make it a little more¬Ö I don't know¬Ö magical?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
SLOW BUT GOOD.,"A lot slower paced than the others, which isn't a flaw. The acting and action is great. It is good to see some change within the characters but it felt like just another setup movie that leads into the big finale.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A tease, as expected. Also quite good, as expected.","I was prepared to be disappointed with this movie, but I resolved to see it anyway. I'm a completeist‚ÄîI've read all seven Harry Potter books, and I plan to see all eight Harry Potter movies. I steeled myself: ""Just get through it‚Äîthe final one will be GREAT."" Well, I'm kind of disappointed that I wasn't disappointed. After all, the final book in the series is definitely not one of my favorites, and I knew the almost total absence of Snape, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts would certainly diminish this film. What we're left with is Harry, Hermione, and Ron on the run for almost the entire film, with prolonged cameos by heretofore minor characters. But what this set-up does (and more effectively than the book does, I might argue) is foreground the relationship among these characters and how it has evolved throughout the series. There is nothing childish about their complex entanglements with each other, and the intensity of their performances (especially Rupert Grint's) is very impressive. The film is, by necessity, incomplete‚Äîthe conclusion is more like a dramatic pause. And yes, the entire thing is one huge tease‚Äîbut it's the best kind of tease, because you know there'll be a great payoff well worth the wait¬Öeven if it is seven months away.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A tragic, beautiful movie with tremendous poignancy.","Never before have I felt so immensely satisfied with a Harry Potter movie.The opening sequence may be one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking moments in the series. It is absolutely gut-wrenching to see how much Voldemort (menacingly played by Ralph Fiennes) has taken over and what has to be done to protect the ones we love. I've seen the movie three times (more than any Potter movie); and this particular moment never fails to move me.The acting is absolutely spectacular in this movie. I'm so glad the trio stepped up their game because the movie would have collapsed had they not been up to the challenge. Emma was absolutely phenomenal; I was really quite impressed with her performance. Nuanced, poignant, and deeply affecting. She has come a very long way, and I'm grateful that she stepped up her game. Rupert was great. You could always tell in the past movies that he had potential, and it was certainly shown in this one. We get to see a very different side of Ron. Daniel gave a good performance, but he was the weakest of the three.Sure enough, we get to the middle, which has been criticized by some. To me, a lot of the past movies in the series failed to capture a lot of the emotional resonance that were in the books. With Deathly Hallows 1, during the middle sequence, we are rewarded with some of the most beautiful, touching, and poignant moments in the series that define our heroes. These moments either made everyone in the theater giddy with happiness, or sad due to the losses. Deathly Hallows 1, above all else, is a coming-of-age tale, as our heroes that we have come to know and love change and develop into adults. A magnificent and highly moving evolution that was, unfortunately, sometimes sorely missing in the previous outings. Deathly Hallows 1 proves why we fell in love with witches and wizards, and it's because they're just like us, dealing with the same internal conflicts we all have gone or are going through.The action sequences are excellent, and Yates has proved to be very apt at creating suspense. A lot of people jumped at one particular scene in the movie.The cinematography (filmed by Eduardo Serra) is absolutely gorgeous and stunning to look at. I was in awe at the breathtaking beauty of England's countryside. Fortunately, not once did the very impressive special effects overwhelm a scene, which was very comforting. The production design is absolutely staggering, and Alexandre Desplat's haunting score blends in with the movie perfectly ('Obliviate' is one of the best tracks in the series).Yates and Kloves have captured the essence of Rowling's very dark story with grace and potency, creating a movie that is extremely faithful to the source material both thematically and in content. This is by far the most satisfying movie in the series, and easily the most mature. I personally cannot see how any fan could be disappointed in it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointed,"I love everything about harry potter. All the movies and the books. Except for this movie. But that's okay because this movie wasn't really a Harry Potter movie. It just had the same actors and storyline.There was no magical feeling in this movie. All the magic was GONE.The soundtrack was okay. It would have been a great soundtrack if this movie wasn't part of a franchise, but as a Harry Potter movie it failed completely to incorporate the magic that John Williams so well added in his score. Also, this sounds too much like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (change it up a bit Alexandre Desplat). No inclusion of the Hedwig's theme, whats up with that!? Maybe they played it once at the beginning really lightly so you can't hear it since everyone's cheering when the movie's starting anyway.The adaptation of the book was overall pretty good but I felt like it rushed through some things. I was kind of disappointed that they didn't put in Harry's birthday scene, Kreacher's story, more from Rita Skeeter's book, and more from the Dursley's departure scene. Although somehow they did find the time to add some completely ridiculous and awkward scenes such as the dance between Harry and Hermione (which the entire theater was laughing at) and the kiss between Harry and Hermione (which the entire theater was screaming at). It felt like David Yates was trying to make the audience think that Harry and Hermione have a thing, when they Don't at all. Also, what happened to all the careful planning for the break in at the Ministry and Kreacher's home cooked meal that was waiting for them :(Special effects were okay and the comedy bit was fine too. Cinematography was a little bit too overdone and the animation of Dobby was pretty bad. It didn't look bad it was just too different from the 2nd movie. I mean he looked fine in the 2nd movie, why change him??Oh also, what was going on in that Deathly Hallows/3 brothers scene. That was just so inappropriate and totally not harry potterish.Overall, I was disappointed and it just wasn't a Harry Potter movie for me. I was excited to see how this movie could be nominated for some Academy Awards, but truthfully after seeing it I don't think they really deserve in the nomination. Maybe, cinematography if voters like the overdone excessive look or maybe one of those technical Oscars.Second part should be better, hopefully. As long as David Yates doesn't suck the magic out of that one too.(Just saw it again. Much better. I still mean what I said above but not as strongly)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The-Film-That-Should-Not-Have-Been-Made,"Since we first heard of WBs decision to break the last book of the HP series into two books, we've all been asking ""is this required to give full treatment to the Harry Potter universe wrap-up, or is it just a ploy to make the studios more money?"" After seeing HP/DH Pt I, I have to say ""it's the latter"".I say this because it's a very weak movie.It is slow. It is ponderous. It is blandly written, blandly acted, muddily filmed, badly directed. It has no heart, no soul, it's just a collected series of vignettes and action sequences strung together by lots of wandering around. This is a phoned-in movie, you can see that the filmmakers have simply stopped caring but do it anyway because they know people will buy it. Or perhaps it's like a parent who has read the same book to their 4-year-old 87 times and has had just about enough of it, but still reads it again.Purists will probably like this film because it does contain more ""canon"" than prior films. But this film ALSO explains why you can't film a book beat-for-beat, it ends up bland and lifeless. The screenwriter did not do a good film-to-book translation this time, it seems like he just shoved the manuscript into screenplay software and called it a day. All the various episodes and incidents are simply chained together without much to tie them in. There's very little emotional reason to move this story along from point to point, things just sort of move. This is a lot like JKRs writing itself, she always found some little hunk of trivia to shove the plot along rather than developing a story that grows organically. It should have been the screenwriters job to find the emotional cores of the story, focus on those, and craft a screenplay accordingly. But he didn't. This is like recipe cooking instead of culinary artistry.The primary actors (the three heroes) didn't help matters much. Either through choices of their own or through poor direction, they woodenly carry on, showing very little emotional range, even during the various argument scenes. And AGAIN they're playing broody, angsty teenagers. OK, OK, we've seen that in the last three movies. Can we move along now, please???? These actors are not pushing themselves and are not being pushed. Again, they're phoning it in, just like everyone else phoned it in. I hope they at least made barrels of cash for the effort.And where are the rest of this stellar cast? There is some enjoyable stuff from Brendan Gleeson and Imelda Staunton, and Helena Bonham Carter has a far-too-short, intensely creepy scene with Emma Watson, but the rest are absent or nearly so. Alan Rickman only has a cameo, and basically everyone else acts as nothing but window dressing. Even Bonnie Wright, playing Harry's love interest, is given nothing more than a single scene, where in the book she's constantly in his head. Part of the appeal of the HP movies is the richness given by the myriad of characters, but here they're just set pieces. I'm not even a fan of Ralph Fiennes work in this film, he was better in earlier ones. They should have cut back-and-forth between actions elsewhere in the world rather than making us watch the Three Amigos lost in the woods for hours on end.Then there's the cinematography. Somewhere down the line, someone said ""this is a dark film"". And that's how it's filmed: dark. Has a perpetual eclipse hit the Hogwarts world? Ugh, it's downright putrid to watch. Guys, ""dark"" is a DESCRIPTION OF THE FEELING OF THE MOVIE, not a literal description of the visuals. You can have moods and tension and ""darkness"" in broad, sunny daylight. filmmakers have done this all the time for decades. Watch the ending of ""Se7en"", filmed on a bright, sunny day in California scrubland, yet is one of the creepiest, nastiest scenes ever captured on film. Dark doesn't mean drab.What I see in HP/DH Pt. 1 is a full retreat into complacency, pattern, style, and motif that these producers have used for the past two films. They have taken no risks, are making no statements, are doing nothing more than mass-producing HP movies for our consumption. They are phoning it in. The HP franchise has officially become stale and lifeless.Sadly, they'll make millions making it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another absolutely brilliant Harry Potter movie!,"Deathly Hallows Part 1 was darker and more thrilling than the others and the acting once again was brilliant. Voldemort and the Death Eaters are more involved in this movie which makes it even more darker and thrilling. I think that this movie is one of the best HP movies made because of the drama type storyline eg. Horcruxes, being on the run etc. The music in the movie is slightly different too, for example right at the beginning of the movie when the Warner Brothers logo appears, the music is low and feels more intense.Overall, an excellent movie and a fantastic lead up to Part 2 (which should be epic!!!)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Where's the Magic?,"Let me start by stating that I'm a huge fan of the books and have enjoyed the movie franchise that followed as a whole. But there are a couple of things that irked me while watching the new addition to the series.First let me advise anyone who's going to see this movie to watch 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' first, since the story is a direct follow-up of the previous film. We are approaching the final hour in which Harry Potter, the boy who lived, is going to face He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named in a battle to the death. Before he can face Voldemort, Harry must destroy the remaining Horcruxes, pieces of Voldemort's soul that make him immortal. The script itself follows the book quite closely, but it lacks structure. The feeling is as if the movie is just a mash-up of scenes with the same characters without any connection between them. And Kloves (the screenwriter) had to close all the loose ends he had created over the years which feels quite forced, introducing new characters that were supposed to appear in previous movies and so on.Also, the direction seemed confused and clumsy, borrowing heavily from other movies (Metropolis, Bourne series, Lord of the Rings as an example). This movie had lost its magic. The wands in this movie could have be easily replaced with guns. The shaky cam adds nothing but confusion and the score is somber and un-heroic, it's not memorable as the timeless tune from the earlier movies.There were a couple of good sides to the movie as well. It's nice to see how much the actors have matured and honed their acting skills. Rupert Grint is worth to mention as the best actor of the trio, simultaneously being funny, dim witted, brooding and heroic. The SFX are top notch, it's too bad that it has to deal with the bluish grayish cinematography that dulls every shot. The chemistry between the actors and characters is apparent on the screen and they're a couple of scenes that adds depth to their relationship.Overall, the movie falls short with the botched script and the inconsistent direction, but it is saved by the actors, beautiful sets and locations and the SFX. If you're a fan, you won't miss it anyway, and if you're a casual viewer, I advise to watch the previous movie first and not expect too much. 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
FINALLY! Yates gets it!,"Having been a huge Harry Potter fan for the past 10 years (I finished the 2nd book just before the 1st film came out), my relationship with the films has been rather rocky. The first two, I thought, captured the whimsical essence of the first two books. The third managed to make itself the director's own without taking away from the original novel. From ""Goblet of Fire"" on, however, the HP films began to go downhill. And once David Yates signed on, I began to lose faith in the art of adaptations.The 5th, 6th, and 7th Harry Potter books are my top 3 favourites in the series (not in that order, mind you), and after the butchered story & characters that made up ""Order of the Phoenix"", I wanted to die. Yates had taken the book and made it his own, all right... but not in a good way. He turned ""OotP"" into a self-indulgent montage of Harry's angst. He cut all the important back-story and information in ""Half-Blood Prince"", and turned it into a romantic comedy with magic. The man simply didn't understand that, in order to make an adaption good, one must first and foremost please the FANS.But, hallelujah, with ""Deathly Hallows"", the man finally got it! Capturing the grit and dark tone of the novel without focusing on the angst as he did in Movie 5, Yates' latest film has managed to stay (thankfully) close to the book. Obviously, some things were cut - but considering that most of the novel's first half consists of strategies, flashbacks, and repetitive hiding out, this really isn't an issue. And taking into consideration how much Yates had to throw in last-minute due to their absence in the other films (Mundungus Fletcher, Bill & Fleur's relationship and wedding, additional Horcrux information, etc.), the 2-and-a-half hours they had were put to extremely good use.My beefs were petty, few, and far between. First among them is the already infamous dancing scene between Harry and Hermione. It irritated me at the same time that it entertained me, only because it was pointless and only served to give pathetic hope to a ship that will never sail (seriously, all the directors seem to be Harry/Hermione shippers). My second irritation actually has a name - and that name is Bonnie Wright. Ginny never quite did it for me in the books, but at least she had a personality; Wright plays the snarky spark-plug like so much dead wood. As a result, we care just as much about her (and her relationship with Harry) as we would any random extra. Luckily, she doesn't have that much screen time in Part 1.All technical things aside, when you get right down to it, I'm just relieved. Relieved that David Yates finally gets it - with something as widely-loved as the Harry Potter franchise, one cannot screw around. The director of an adaption has an obligation to the fans of the original work - and Yates has FINALLY acknowledged that obligation in ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"".

"Delightful, in general-but lacking a little je ne sais quoi","Just got back from a midnight preview of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.In general, I thought it was an alright film- just not quite up to Harry Potter standard or my expectations, either. From the trailer one would expect lots of action; don't get me wrong, there IS action-rather abundantly too, but it feels like they crammed all the edge-of-the- seat, get-your-heart-racing scenes into the trailer, so I didn't feel like there was anything especially surprising about the film. Everything that was anything was in the trailer.That said, it does stay rather true to the book, certain scenes are almost translated word-to- image on the screen! I suppose certain fans would say 'Bravo, Yates!', but I beg to differ. Because the scenes were so similar, I knew exactly what was coming next and it filled me with a sense of dread, and I couldn't smile, much less laugh, along with the rest of the cinema-goers. (There was a certain scene where this was particularly apparent, but I shan't spoil the fun.) Thus I felt the film lacked the element of surprise; there were few, if at all, new and refreshing interpretations of the seventh book. I do realize it's difficult to interpret a book (especially one as complicated as Harry Potter), but after all- this is Harry Potter, not some half-rate film, so it would have been very nice if the film had been a little more creative while still staying true to the book.Also, another notable mention would be that many people in the cinema expressed tremendous disgruntlement 'What? It's ending here?' 'What a cliff-hanger!' 'How CAN they stop here' when the movie ended (quite abruptly, in my opinion) with Voldemort. In fact, it felt almost like that scene was deliberately crafted and pushed forward simply to mark the ending of the 'first part', which further added to my personal feelings that the seventh film should have been a mega 4 hour marathon with a no-stops-allowed and no-holds-barred kind of pace. Perhaps this is why the film didn't leave me trembling with tremulous emotion or anything particularly thought-provoking to think about. It just felt like another Harry Potter film- acceptable for the first couple but not quite for the last. (However, I acknowledge that they had to end SOMEWHERE, given that they split the movie into half. Though if they made the decision to separate the parts, the least they could was to make well sure that the ending was satisfactory and not quite nonsensical, in my opinion. Or else keep it as one. Difficult leaps build up immense anticipation-and they didn't quite live up to mine.)Hats off to you, J.K Rowling; Yates- not bad, but definitely lacking mystique-wise. One has to wonder, has David Yates and the screenwriters lost their steam?P.S In fact, one would say, the film lacked that spark of 'magic' (pun intended) that the books have in abundance, and unexpected turns of events (which the film conveys too blatantly and in a slightly in-your-face style, in my opinion) are what makes Harry Potter one of the most ingenious series ever written in our time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It wasn't Hogwarts we were attached to, it was the people inside, or Deathly Hallows wouldn't be so unspeakably brilliant!","The most potent of the established rhythmic norms surrounding the previous six Harry Potter films was the inclusion of a stirring occurrence at the beginning to get things going, a more sedate and steadily-paced poignant build-up in the middle and a very rewarding climax at the end. This winning format also applies to the series as a whole: Philosopher's Stone serves as an introduction, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire push the saga along with great gusto, Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince reflect the escalating tensions and finally the two Deathly Hallows films bring things to a stunningly satisfying riveting conclusion. Fans have followed the series as the characters, the films, the books, the iconic actors and they themselves have matured bit by wondrous bit, and now they deserve a final stupendous culmination.For those who have never read a word of J.K Rowling's writings, the first half of Voldemort's villainous endeavour to secure a total domination over the wizarding world and its often courageous but mostly desperate opposing struggle to his power is powerfully conveyed. Those familiar with the story will be impressed by the wonderful performances given by the always-dependable cast, as well as the very pleasing depiction of all of the key exciting and engaging events. For the entire audience, there are plenty of thrilling moments that masterfully manipulate the senses, most notably Nagini's truly terrifying leap at the camera after Voldemort's kills one of his helpless victims and says ""dinner."" Swathed in a sinister sense of genuine danger, fearful secrets, conflicting emotions, intoxicating adrenalin and occasional effective comic relief, it is a must-see contemporary masterpiece that children can actually see.Directed by David Yates, the best of the Harry Potter directors, it of course stars that lovable trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as well as the brilliant Ralph Fiennes, with Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter making memorable appearances.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True Harry Potter fans will be let down after watching Deathly Hallows Part 1,"I am thoroughly disappointed after seeing this installment of the movie. After reading every book multiple times and seeing them portrayed on the big screen I've been fairly happy with the way the directors/producers have instilled the quality of J.K's writing style.However, after seeing the 'Deathly Hallows Part 1' I am very disappointed the way they left out such large amounts of information and action that was included in the books. The earlier movies did a good job holding their parts of the book series, but the Deathly Hallows seems to have been slashed into bits and pieces and has not meant my standards whatsoever when it comes to including the magic of the writing from the book itself.There are many parts of the book that were missing in just this first half of the last installment of the movies; the second part I'm afraid is going to end up being just the same way.There was plenty of good graphics and the sequencing was decent, but as I said there was just too much missing for me to enjoy the movie. Parts were ruined by rushing through details that would ultimately help explain the story line/plot much better - some parts were just skipped completely.Now I understand that the books are very long and are hard to portray into a movie, and there is an acceptable amount of loss of quality from paper to the big screen, but that fine line was crossed (at least in my eyes) and completely ruined this movie for me.I still would suggest watching the movie. For those of you who haven't read the books, you will enjoy the movie much more than I did, but even those who haven't read the books will notice there is something missing from the plot.I will be waiting for part 2 to make a final decision on the last installment of the movie series, but as of right now I stand disappointed.I rated the movie a 6 out of 10 since the story was still there (but lax) and the characters were played out decently (but had much room to grow). I would have given this movie a much higher rating if it were to have grabbed my attention more often rather than skim over such large parts of the book - even those small things, which make the books so good, were missing. Without the smaller segments included in the movie it just feels like something much different from the book, and for those of us who truly are looking for a great portrayal of the book on the big screen this just wasn't enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uuuuum...,"Well, 6.5 actually. The parts that felt like normal movie speed were excellent, but there were just so many other parts that felt like absolute slo-mo, borderline painful! It was so clear that the guys who made the flick were reeeeealy stretching it thin so it turns into two movies. Hey, double the product, double the cash-cow. Unfortunately really, as they could have easily made it a 3-hour movie at normal plot speed and called it a day, and saved us all some $ and more importantly pain and time. But, that said, do check it out, as 60% of it is quite good, and since you have no other choice but to see the whole thing if you want to see the good parts - and it also shows us how juicy part 2 will be, as I imagine its speed will be much much faster. It would have to be! Enjoy, but be ready for the slo-mo.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Long and Drug Out,I guess I expected a lot more from this film - it's long and drug out way to long on unnecessary scenes like the wedding for example. I realize this is a two part film but to drag out the first film with a bunch of filler scenes really bored me.I never thought I would dislike a Harry Potter film - but this one does not interest me. The first films were fun - this one is simply boring to me.5/10.,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More art house than mainstream blockbuster. A brilliant film thats essential viewing for fans,"Coming from a person who has not read the books I really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and cannot wait for part 2. The previous film while it had its flaws was able to continue progressing the film at a steady pace. I only wished that the last film had more of a climax and since this one has split up one book into two films, I was fearing that this would leave me disappointed but it didn't!This film is clearly no longer made for children and the story has reached that point where newcomers will be completely lost and will need to start at the beginning in order to catch up. I know this sounds similar to last three films but this one is different. I think it is safe to say that this requires the viewer to be able to remember what Harry, Ron and Hermione have been through otherwise you will find it difficult to connect with characters.The reason for this is that it is more of an art film than a traditional blockbuster action film, which is great because of how it is not afraid to step outside of the box. There are scenes which had me wondering how much further the filmmakers could go before the age rating would have to go up. The overall effect of this makes the film a refreshing experience and it is good to see that the film is aiming specifically at fans and no longer concentrates on trying to attract new audiences.Having said that, the film does include several breathtaking action sequences that will keep you in suspense, such as a furious chase through a forest and a fight scene in a house, which I will not spoil for you. However the action in this film is not as frequent as it once was in previous films of the series, therefore expect lots of scenes involving talking but this is not a bad thing, which leads me onto the characters.Since I have not read the book, scenes that were taken out providing extra background details did not bother me but for those who have, might feel bothered by this since it has been split into two films. With a running time of over 2 hours (it felt less) and less time spent on action, the film is able to concentrate on its characters. The acting is great and while some characters get more screen time than others, everyone performs to their strengths.What earned the last film an Oscar nomination was its cinematography and it continues to amaze here. Setting the atmosphere perfectly for each scene, it is clear that the Harry Potter series would not be the same without it. The direction is also brilliant, bringing something new to the Harry Potter series each time.Darker in atmosphere, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 should not be missed. The slight change in tone will not be for everyone but it does allow for the actors to shine and for the story to be given the credit it deserves. While it may not cover everything from the book, its long running time makes for a satisfying viewing experience leaving you eager for Part 2.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most depressing Harry Potter film,"Whilst I think they did the right thing in splitting Deathly Hallows into two movies, Part I was just unfortunate that it got the worse half. Like all Harry Potter movies, the story makes sense, there are little to no plot holes, it has great acting and a great story. As it is the first half of a book, the story is quite slow and dragged on compared to other HP movies and for that reason it suffers. The other thing that lets it down is by this point is that both one of the best HP characters Sirius and Dumbledore are dead, the absence of these two truly entertaining characters lets the film down a bit.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Good Start For A Film That Will End a Series,"I haven't felt a sadness like this since Star Wars Episode 3 and Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King came out, ending the much beloved Star Wars Franchise (movie-wise) and The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.With the first part of the last film of the Harry Potter Franchise, the end is indeed coming.In the Deathly Hallow Pt.1, Harry and his friends, leave the safety and comfort Of Hogwarts, to the dangers of the outside world, in order to destroy Horcruxes, items that contain the soul of the enemy Lord Voldermort.Visually, Director David Yates has been consistent (in his Harry Potter Movies) in his use of ""dark"" tints, a trend first used in the Harry Potter films by Alfonso Cuaron, in order to ""signify"" the change of tone from the childishness of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, to the darkness of Prisoner Of Azkaband. And a fair warning, this is not the same harry potter as HP 1. What differs, is Yate's uses of the hand held camera, or what I call the ""Jason-Bourne"" camera. The result is some gritty scenes, that are quite enjoyable, especially when magic is casted.One Huge Difference Is the use of fantastic scenery, something that is a welcome change from the dull castle-like Hogwarts. One must congratulate JK Rowling for making Harry go out of Hogwarts in the books, the scenery is really breathtaking.Acting wise, the three main actors have done a commendable job, with Emma showcasing a side that is different from the usual seen in the past movies. The same can be said about Rupert Grint. I still have some problems with Daniel Radcliffe, while he is a decent actor, I do feel he lacks a good presence, and some lines do come out as awkward. This can also be due to his lack of experience.I do have some main gripes about the film.One of them, but this is probably due to the books, is the Huge Cast. With fantastic talent such as Helena Bonham Carter,Imelda Staunton, the always excellent Alan Rickman and the reliable Bill Nighy, they just don't get enough screen time, and when they do appear, it is usually for a few seconds. For example, Alan Rickman and Clemence Poesy only has a few minutes of screen time. This can also annoy some fans who have an affinity with some characters, i for one enjoy both Snape and Lupin, both are hardly in the movie.For Harry Potter Purists, some might recognise the cuts and modifications Yates has done in the movie. As a reader myself, the cuts of some scenes that I consider important gets really annoying (Whether scenes such as Snape's background and Dumbledoor's history are going to be shown in part 2 is left to be seen).Yates has also included some ""funny"" moments, while some work, I feel some come out as awkward and just plain weird. Furthermore, the ""ending"" of part 1, didn't come out well. While it makes many people painfully wait for next year, it does give a feeling that the movie is randomly cut there, the effect makes it feel ""complete"" in a way.Overall Deathly Hallow part 1 is a good start for the last film of the harry potter film series. While it does have some annoyances, it does it's job of giving a sense of ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More Powerfully Effective Than Memory Told Me,"Though it can't avoid an element of place-setting as the over-long book is split over two films, this is less drawn out than I remember. The camping scenes are needlessly long, but the wartime, almost apocalyptic atmosphere is brilliantly constructed; the dread hanging over the central characters and ever-encroaching darkness is palpable; I found the litany of names of missing wizards on the radio especially effective. The influence of Tolkein is strong here also in terms of plot, themes and world-building.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Darkest N Longest potter movie till date... more story and less magic makes it little unnecessary stretched but seems like Deadly Hallows part 2 will be full o magical Action.,"HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1 ( B ) Deadly Hallows is the darkest and longest potter movie till date. On one side it was nice to see every aspect was covered with minute details but on the other side it got little stretched and boring. This time again, it was more story and less magic. At one point I thought I'm watching Lord of the Rings rather than Harry potter as the last scenery seems just like it! The graphics used in telling the story of Three Deadly Hallows was truly fantastic, I was just lost in beauty of those graphics. Excellent Job! Daniel Redcliff, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint did a fantastic mature job as actors. Overall, deadly hallow was an almost a perfect part 1 towards the ending of our Beloved Harry Potter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Half of a masterpiece,"There is a pervading sense of doom in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I. A dark pall is cast over the entire production; even the opening Warner Brother's logo begins to crackle and rust. Harry and his chums encounter their most trying hardships and are forced to face numerous deaths. For a children's fantasy, the first leg of the final chapter shaped up to be fairly dark, and that's hardly a fault. This is the path that all of the other Potter films have led up to, lending the doom a sense of importance. The doom must be there to make the ultimate ending worthwhile.Yet for all the death and destruction, Deathly Hallows never shies away from moments of touching levity. The film allows the major players moments of tender interaction and light comedy. The fact that these bits actually succeed is a testament to the greatly improved abilities of the three principle actors. Director David Yates has broken from the typical Potter tradition of stately, big budget directorial technique and has thrown in splashes of a more kinetic style with a few well-placed, subtle moments of hand-held photography that make Deathly Hallows seem fresher than a few of its predecessors.Another first: a completely animated sequence. It is an audacious move and it pays dividends. The sequence (detailing the story of the titular Deathly Hallows) is among the finest moments the series has to offer. It is a frightening and beautiful mixture of shadow-play and stop-motion.One of the film's major assets is its rouge's gallery of uniformly detestable villains. I can think of few characters or actors that can generate the vitriolic response I have when seeing Imelda Staunton in the role of Dolores Umbridge. Joining her are the usual suspects: Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius and Draco Malfoy. These baddies add a real sense of purpose to the proceedings; evil seems to emanate from their very cores.Yet, to the film's key strength is its acknowledgment of the previous chapters. I felt twinges of melancholy while watching Harry look at his old bedroom below the stairs of the house on Privet Drive, and that speaks to the series' successful attempts at fleshing out the inner lives of these characters and this world. For a major blockbuster, this is a fairly emotional ride.Deathly Hollows, however, is not without imperfections. The tail end of the second act is a bit saggy, and some of the character behaviors seem contrived. I'm looking at you, Ron Weasley. Also, the film seems to be in a state of perpetual build up to part two. As such, I cannot adequately comment on where I'd place it in relation to the other films. But, as it stands, Deathly Hallows is poised to become the crowning jewel of an already distinguished series of films.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It could have been so much more!,"I usually dislike movies based upon books, but the first six Harry Potter movies were a very pleasant change and stuck as closely to the books as could be squeezed into a few hours of screen time. Unfortunately, HP7 is the exception to that. When I read the book, I mentioned to my husband I had no idea how they would cover everything in one movie and was pleased to hear they split it in two, but this movie was a huge disappointment. Everything that made the book a real conclusion to the story was skipped in favor of shaky-cam dramatics that jumped from scene to scene, leaving the important and symbolic portions on the cutting room floor.The actors did a great job and have proved themselves as professionals, and the special effects are brilliant. From the heroes to the villains, every one of them played their parts to perfection. I can't say enough good things about the casting and acting throughout the series, and that continues in HP7. The special effects made me see the fantastic world in visual form. Each of those things have been top-notch in the former stories and continued in this one.What's the problem, then? Everything important in the book was abandoned. The book started with a scene between Harry and the Dursleys much like all the previous ones. It really highlighted the end of innocence for the two cousins in a farewell with Dudley that was shamefully left out of the film. I think that one scene could have framed the transition in far less screen time than the released nonsense, and the movie went downhill from there. Fans of brainless action flicks will probably adore this film since that's the style adopted, but the symbolism and dark wonder characterized in the real story was entirely absent in the film.The filming style was nauseating in many places, and in one particular scene towards the end, a girl in the row behind us muttered that she couldn't watch the shaky camera shots any longer or she would be sick. My husband commented it was like someone took a snippet from Blair Witch Project and flung it in the middle of this movie. Truly disappointing.I don't know why so much creative license was taken in this version when the previous movies stuck pretty closely to the books. This could have been so much better, particularly since there are two films to cover what was admittedly a lot of important information in the books. Unfortunately, the editing and cinematography fell flat on its face.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
One way... One fate... One hero,"Wow this was way better then I had remembered. It's the beginning of the end and it's done so well. Part 1 films are usually really bad, filled with an abundance of exposition, and lacking any enjoyment, but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 manages simultaneously to setup the epic conclusion to the saga and to tell a great emotional ""road trip"" type film that feels fresh in the likes of the franchise so far.My main love for this film is how of everything that has happened the story is mainly about the trio. I mean every film is about them, but here it shows the emotion and heart wrenching destruction and rebuilding of their friendship. It continues the story all while telling a dark tale of life changing events that lead the characters to fully mature and to face the challenges that are in front of them.The trio gives their best performance here with such enthusiasm and charismatic ways that make their friendship feel even stronger. The way they destroy and rebuild their friends feels so real and feels like a breath of fresh air. The scene in which Harry and Ron fight is one of the best of the series and throughout the entire series you knew they would remain friends but here you don't know and it gives a tense of fright. Also the scene in which Harry and Hermione dance in the tent despite everything that's happening and everything that could happen shows how strong they've grown and manages to be one of the best parts of the entire film series.David Yates has returned and seems to be the director the series was looking for and with Deathly Hallows: Part 1 he continues to be excellent had having a good looking film and films expertly well. Along side the technical aspect of cinematography, the film manages to be one the franchises best looking films to date. The film inspresses with Alexandre Desplat's score that brings a warmth and his own special sound that compliments the magical world phenomenally. It's soars in its beauty of filmmaking as David Yates pulls everything together in a bundle of joy and darkness.Managing to be almost two hours and thirty minutes, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 flows very well and doesn't seem dull or have boring moments. With some slower less action scenes it's hard to do that and this film does it exceptionally well. But the set pieces don't go to waste as the film also has some great action and one hell-of an ending. With an exceptional character driven story, that has great performances, a good story, and a well directed film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 manages to lay the ground for an epic conclusion and be an entertaining film all around.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit below my expectations,"Watching the trailer before going to cinema I had high expectations from this movie. Looked at the beginning like it was going to be something really exciting. However, while in the cinema, at some points I started to yawn although it was 12noon! Their acting is good, Hermione became now a pretty lady and I was happy to see that she developed her acting skills. Overall it wasn't boring, the movie had good action, some romance, a bit of thrill but still did not raise the bar as everyone was expecting and moreover it was kind of predictable for me. HP fans are encouraged to watch it but if you are looking for an excellent movie you might be disappointed. 7/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"On target, but unremarkable","I was a little confused at the onset. I didn't know what to expect, but Yates does not hold much favor in my mind; so that said I will refrain from bashing on him. The story continues, but in a much more honest, sincere measure.I felt the acting was much more polished, the emotional content much improved and the bond between the three primary characters solid in so many more ways than portrayed in earlier movies. You could feel that after a decade of working together, growing together, almost living together that their profession in acting has also grown similarly. I found my experience being drawn in to their drama, their pain and their bonding to all that they are connected. After a while you really didn't care who they chose to play what in this movie, but there were enough returning cast to put you back in that comfort zone that the Potter legacy will hold on to for generations to come.I got to hand it to them: They kept the group together for over 10 years. That alone is an amazing accomplishment.I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't a hugely over involved CGI epic. It had its moments, and it was obvious at the first sight of Dobbie that life characteristics in a computer generated character have made them a bit more believable rather than just cartoonish. I didn't actually agree with the choice for Lovegood, it seems that a portly, stout or even fat person would have been more suited for this role, but again it was acceptable.Again, much of this first part was acceptable, but not great. Some reviewer said this was a great prolonged trailer. I agree in many senses of that. There was a lot that could have happened in a shorter time. I felt the dialog, action, sequences were deliberately retarded to stretch and get as much out of this as possible. I'm not trying to be mean. I found the movie kept me engaged in a positive way. But when you can count 10 seconds between responsive dialog, I felt the stretch. The tragedy scenes were much better. The younger guy sitting in the seat next to me was balling his eyes out at the death of Dobbie (though it could have been to impress the pretty lady he was sitting next to.... OOH! Low Blow!). Yeah, I got misty eyed at a couple of spots. The handling of the finding of the sword and the reunion was exceptionally well conceived and filmed. The thing is, the film got most of the right things in at the right time with an acceptable amount of scenes cut out. Overall, people that groan and moan about this one are too calloused. On the other hand, those who praise it as a top notch film have probably been so used to being disappointed with Yates' productions that this one was his defining moment. It probably was, but that is not saying much.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Dark,Picking up Where The sixth one have left off this one was very dark but it was lot of fun i liked it,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's one of the 'worst' in the series because of its slow pace.,"The cast can't pass for teenagers anymore (though they've been pushing it for a while now, and to say that's the least believable part of the series is a testament to its stellar world building) so it's lucky that the 'school-kid' aspect of the story is the least prevalent so far, with the action taking place entirely outside of Hogwarts. 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)' starts off strong but comes screeching to a halt right after an enthralling sneaky section set inside the ministry of magic, stopping for around an hour with almost nothing happening in terms of plot or character, and it's this section that drags the film down to be perhaps the least successful in the series, tied only with the first. That's not to say its bad, though - far from it. It's just a different beast with a slower pace and something different to offer. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A refreshingly surreal and dark blockbuster. Plenty of money has been thrown at this film, but it retains a sense of identity that is unmistakably British","It will be no surprise to anyone that the latest instalment of Harry Potter is ""darker than the one before it"", but I certainly wasn't expecting such a pitch-black blend of melancholy, depression and horror- with a bit of sex thrown in. What the hell happened? One minute Potter is a scrawny little dork, getting into trouble in the enchanted school of Hogwarts, the next he's covered in the blood of his friends, a look of quiet acceptance on his face, as he prepares to die. I haven't been paying the utmost attention to the series, but I have at least seen every film once. If you haven't, don't even bother watching The Deathly Hollows, because no attempt will be made to bring you up to speed with the story so far. Instead you'll spend the entire film wondering why so many famous and much loved British actors keep popping up with just a handful of lines of dialogue between them. It is a curious thing, but ultimately good, that so much time is spent with the film's heroic trio while people like John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Jason Isaacs and so, so many more (basically all the British actors) are left to hover around in the background, largely left out of focus.There is a tangle of different plots that keeps the narrative going forwards, but they are of such simple design that the ideas never really bog you down. It's more a case of ""find the MacGuffin"" which is actually a refreshing change from the complicated relationships of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who all hate each other now apparently. The story itself is relatively linear; Harry and the team must find and destroy some pieces of evil Lord Voldemort's soul, which have been hidden away in keepsakes and scattered about (though usually found in locations that were important to the dark lord). There's also the Deathly Hallows themselves, which are explained in a rather lovely animation sequence, as three magical devices that, when combined, can defeat death itself.Voldemort obviously wants to get his mittens on these Deathly Hallows, while the heroic trio are more concerned with finding a means to destroy an unbreakable locket, which contains a piece of his aforementioned soul. It's simple stuff, but allows for plenty of emoting on the kid's side, as the burden of their quest becomes too much to bear. Cracks begin to appear in their relationship, especially between Harry and Ron, while Hermione actually holds the gang together- although, it's fair to say, she is the source of most of the trouble. Indeed, this new instalment has a lot of sexual undertones- and at one point throws subtlety completely out of the window, when Hermione becomes a cold, hard dominatrix- possibly channelling Galadriel's temptation of the one Ring. Speaking of which, the new Harry Potter, like the majority of the previous instalments, borrows heavily from Tolkien lore, most notably with the corrupting power of Voldemort's locket, which the trio take turns in carrying round their necks. The locket is one of the primary contributing factors to the cracks in the trio's friendship, ratcheting up the tension and the melancholy in equal measure. While the film is host to many a famous face, the young stars; Radcliffe, Grint and Watson do an admirable job, their acting lending the fantasy a healthy injection of realism.The kids are so normal, that at times they seem at odds with the overly camp, theatrical actors that prance around having immense fun with their limited roles. It is worth noting, however, that despite the apparently sombre look of the film, the spiky humour is consistent throughout, and there is an ample amount of surrealism that gives this film a particular shine. The infiltration of the Ministry of Magic is a stand out moment; equal parts disturbing and bizarrely humorous, drawing on great films like Terry Gilliam's Brazil for inspiration. Another wonderful scene is Harry and Hermione's trip to see Bathilda Bagshot, which is scarier than most of the horror film's out at the moment.All in all, the film is dark, but funnier than the previous chapter's in the series. There are plenty of flaws, particularly if you find yourself unconvinced by the film's protagonists, who carry the story on their shoulders. There are plenty of clich√©'s, and the moments you wish would last longer are hurried along to make way for more scene's of Harry sitting around looking tired. However, the overall feel of the film, the darkness that must come before the light, is pretty powerful. If you allow yourself to be invested in the story and the characters, rather than approaching it with snooty cynicism, you will probably find yourself going along for the ride.Children of a certain age may not understand a lot of what's going on, and will likely be terrified during the scary moments, which are often quite horrific, but chances are the people who have invested in this film have already grown up with the previous six instalments. If you are unfamiliar with the story so far, go back and watch the other films, or at least read the synopses on Wikipedia.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a good movie, there's plenty of exciting set pieces, sharp wit throughout and lots of time to develop the characters in interesting ways. Just remember that it is actually darker than you're expecting it .",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm very pleased with this movie,"I have to say, I honestly thought this movie was going to be a mess. After the Half-Blood Prince, I didn't expect ANTHING from this movie, the adaptation from the 6th book to the screen has to be worst one I've ever seen in my entire life, I was truly disappointed, as I haven't been a fan of HP movies since probably the 2nd one. But I truly have to say that this movie blew my mind. Every essential, detailed part of the book is seen on the film, and it's perfectly introduced for the second part of it. I had honestly forgot how it felt like to compare things I've read from HP to what I was seeing on the screen, but I did this through the entire film. The movie is dark, which is contrasted by funny moments, is deep,is truly a flawless adaptation from the book and I couldn't be more pleased about it. I will recommend this movie to all HP fans and also to the people who haven't read the books because it is a great movie, and the actors are perfectly chosen and do an amazing job.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"David Yates finally ""gets"" Harry Potter in the beginning of the final chapter.","I don't know how other film lovers and Harry Potter fans feel but I for one have had mixed experiences with these films. The first two films were good, the third and fourth were the best in the series, the fifth was a disaster, and the sixth was OK. The beloved wizard named ""Harry Potter"" has definitely had a bumpy road in his transition from novel to screen in my opinion. With that being said, the end is near folks and part one of the final chapter of ""Harry Potter"" has arrived in theaters. That's right for those of you living under a rock, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" is in theaters now. I was a bit leery seeing the film after how disappointed I have been since David Yates took over the franchise but like any dedicated fan boy, I walked into the theater hoping for the best.""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" is the beginning of the end of one of the most popular and beloved book/film franchises in history. In the seventh entry in the film series, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) along with his two best friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Rupert Grint have to fight time and evil as they discover that the three of them have to track down and destroy the missing Horcruxes. Along the way, the three friends learn about the dark secrets of Dumbledore as well as the three most powerful objects in the wizarding world known as the Deathly Hallows. Suspense ensues..As I said above, I am a pretty loyal fan to the franchise as I have seen all the films and read the books. I enjoyed the film franchise a lot until David Yates took over as director. When I attended the midnight showing of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" I was extremely disappointed. I knew going into the film that they left the franchise in the hands of an amateur filmmaker and the end result was not a good experience at all. When I saw the sixth film, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was being made my Yates, I actually cringed. I had a slightly better experience with the sixth film although I still felt Yates really didn't really give the book much justice. The whole ending of the film was just terrible and wasn't even remotely dramatic. Yates destroyed a huge moment in the ""Harry Potter"" legacy with that ending.Now moving on to the seventh film, David Yates actually made ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" into one one the best films in the franchise. Let me tell you that I was shocked to come out of the film saying wow this is a great entry in the franchise but it truly was. Yates must have really studied the last book when he made the film. Yates added some stuff to the film that was not in the book and was unnecessary but as a whole the film was very loyal to the book. Yates finally captured the magic that is ""Harry Potter."" I guess the old saying, third times the charm, applies to this film.Yates direction was perfectly timed and placed, unlike the previous two entry the film didn't suffer from any real boring spots. This one was shot much better and the pace was on the ball. Yates captured the actors and actually made them seem mature and realistic without coming off as forced. In the previous entries, I remember laughing at Harry when he started yelling but in this film he was more convincing and that's due to the better direction by Yates.At this point, I think its unnecessary to comment on the acting in the film because all the same characters have been playing the same roles. I will say that all of the actors in the film have definitely matured in their roles. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have these roles down to near perfection at this point. I liked how good Grint was in the film. His acting skills have definitely improved as the franchise went on. All the acting is solid in this one. I can't even complain about that!In the end, would I classify ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" the best film in the franchise? No, because I still feel ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" holds that honor. It's is however, the second best film in the franchise and ""HPATDHP2"" does have the potential to being the best film in the franchise. My faith in Harry Potter has been restored and that says a lot considering I was ready to toss the towel in on the franchise, if this film wasn't good but Yates restored my faith. This was a great film even if your not a Harry Potter fan. The pacing, the acting, the story, and the suspense is all very well done with this entry. I think HP fans will be in love with the film and it is not surprise to me that this is the biggest money making film in the franchise. If you haven't already, get to the local theater and check this entry out as you wont be disappointed! MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" is a solid 8 out of 10. A terrific beginning to the end of one of the most beloved book and film series in history!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Camping with Wizards,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" (2010) is like that one classmate who always promises to show up to group meetings but only turns up for the final presentation. And when they do, they're surprisingly well-prepared (if a bit disheveled). This film, the penultimate in the wizarding series, feels like it's been brewing a Polyjuice Potion for far too long and ended up with a concoction that's equal parts thrilling and frustratingly slow.The first half feels like the trio got lost on the way to Hogwarts and ended up on a camping trip in Mordor. We see Harry, Ron, and Hermione embark on a gloomy, Horcrux-hunting quest, which is basically the magical equivalent of trying to find your phone charger in the dark. The tension between them is more palpable than a fresh batch of Every Flavour Beans (and not nearly as fun). Meanwhile, Voldemort is out there playing extreme makeover with the wizarding world, but we're stuck watching magical tent dynamics and Ron's mood swings.But then, just when you're about to give up and switch to re-reading the books, the film hits its stride. The action sequences are as well-crafted as a Nimbus 2000, with visual effects that make you forgive the earlier sluggishness. The animation sequence of 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' is a stunning piece of storytelling, and honestly, I wouldn't mind a whole film just like that. In the end, ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" sets up the finale beautifully, even if it takes its sweet time getting there. It's like a Quidditch match that's a bit too long but has a fantastic Snitch catch at the end. Three and a half stars for delivering the magic, albeit at the pace of a flobberworm.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow pacing allows for more depth,"This film is a nice break from the hectic pacing of the last ones. Ever since the third film, when 2 1/2 hours became much too short for an adequate adaptation of the books, the movies have been rather loveless attempts to squeeze just enough information into the limited time to allow for a superficial understanding of the main story lines. This one, on the other hand, takes its times, which is its greatest strength, and stays rather close to the book. On multiple occasions I was really surprised when another detail that wasn't strictly necessary to the main plot was graciously allowed its space.This is a very good adaptation that makes me wish they had started making two-part movies out of the books earlier. And since it already covers about 3/4 of the book, I am looking forward to a similarly (or even more?) detailed second part.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doesn't fit in with the earlier films,"Just watched this week and i'm not impressed with the film story direction. The series started out great as an all family can watch films but now this has been dropped for a miserable, depressing, drab direction which doesn't fit in at all with the other earlier films. I don't know what JKR is thinking when writing but maybe she was in a dark mood herself and took it out on Harry Potter? This needed the old spark of Harry Potter film magic but its too late now! How anyone would want to watch this film again is a mystery. JKR will hopefully take a break from writing and think about letting other authors write Harry Potter stories about Harry's earlier times at magic school which would be good to see?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The darkest Harry Potter yet: bring on part 2!,"Opening with a rusty looking version of the Warner Bros. logo, an ominous warning, Harry and Ron look to the distance with worry and Hermione erases her parents memories of her. It is clear that we are getting a very different type of Harry Potter. Director David Yates sets out to show a gloomy, bleak world where war and repression are about to inflict the Wizard world.Picking up where ""The Half-Blood Prince"" left off, Dumbledore has been murdered and there is no one left to stop Voldermort. The new Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), states the gravity of the situation. Harry was given a mission by Dumbledore to find Voldermort's remaining Horcruxes (pieces of his soul), but has no idea what they are hiding in, how to find them and how to destroy them. When Voldermort launches a successful coup against the Ministry of Magic, Harry, Ron and Hermione have to go on the run when they are declared public enemies.Yates had already shown that he could make a dark ""Harry Potter"" film when he made ""Order of the Phoenix,"" but with ""The Deathly Hallows"" he takes it to another level. Like with ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""The Half-Blood Prince,"" he was able to change his style of direction yet again. The repression of the new Ministry of Magic was brought to life, looking and feeling very much like the Ministry of Truth in 1984, with a little bit of Brazil for good measure. There are wonderful little details to windowless environment, the costumes of the wizard enforcers and the 1940s-style propaganda posters. The animated short of ""The Tale of the Three Brothers"" (whose director was given free reign by Yates) was very Tim Burton like: so dark, visually stunning and flowing beautifully with the rest of the film.Yates delivers on the action front yet again, excellent chases from when the Death Eaters chase the Order of the Phoenix in the skies above London and seeing that real people get hurt, the chase in the Ministry and the scenes in the woods. Helena Bonham Carter was finally allowed to let loose and Bellatrix Lestrange is turned into a truly scary character -- we get to see some of the horrors she is able to inflict.Because of the dark, slow and sombre direction at times there are some effective horror moments and there is a permanent sense of tension and terror. Yates slows the film down long enough to unveil the mystery and quest and show how the characters we know handle their mission. The House Elf Kreacher (Simon McBurney) was made into a nastier little creature with bitterness in his voice who had been taught a hateful ideology. A great of example of all this bleakness is that John Williams' soft signature tune is no longer used in the film.Senses that were only mentioned in the book are actually shown in the film, following the old screen writing maxim ""show don't tell"" and having much more of an impact for the audience. Yates and Steve Kloves attempt to show the wider picture of the conflict and the ideology of the wizardening world, showing the Death Eaters as being akin to Nazis and Stalinists. But it is not all doom and gloom and there is still plenty of humour and lighter moments, most of it being visual and some funny lines via Dobby and various Weasleys This time round the main three actors have to stand alone with little support from the adults. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have all grown as actors over the years. All three give fine performances, Watson giving her strongest performance in the series and Grint showing more range then just as the comical sidekick. Radcliffe has already proved himself the best actor of the trio and his performance was natural as in the previous films. There is a large number of cameos in the film from actors who have been in the previous films and its great to see the previous film referenced like this. Imelda Staunton returns, being deliciously evil and sickly-sweet as Dolores Umbridge, and Rhys Ifans gives a surprisingly understated performances as Xenophilius Lovegood.""The Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is one of the strongest entries in the Harry Potter series but there are some faults preventing it from topping the list. When the main three characters are on the road, it is sometimes too slow and some scenes could have been cut or shortened: the film itself is about 10 to 15 minutes too long. Also a problem from the book is that the Horcrux is pretty much lifted from The Lord of the Rings, acting as a corrupt force on anyone who touches it. But all this is minor as the film will satisfy and delight fans of both the books and the films.I personally really looking forward to the concluding part to the series with what should be an epic finale.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Step Up From the Previous Film,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)*** (out of 4)After the death of Dumbledore, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself on the run as everyone tries to protect him from Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and along the way learns who the Deathly Hallows were.I really wasn't a fan of the previous film but this one here turned out to be much better. As I've said in all my reviews up to this point, I haven't read a single story in the series so I'm basically just watching the movies without the benefit of comparing them to anything. Whereas I thought the previous film was somewhat boring a long-winded, that certainly wasn't the case here and I ended up finding this one to be one of the best of the series.What I liked most about this one is that there seemed to be a lot more emotion as the various characters are face some sort of battle against one another. There was a lot of inner fighting among the characters and I must admit that I was shocked to see how much I was caught up in the drama. There were a lot of scenes where Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were in some sort of drama and the actors perfectly sold it. In fact, to me Watson clearly stole the film here and managed to turn in her best performance.Visually the film is quite impressive, although the special effects certainly aren't as in-your-face as the previous film. Technically speaking the movie is impressive with some great cinematography, a nice rousing score and of course there are some very good performances. The beginning and ending are certainly well done and get your ready for what is to follow.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The penultimate carefully told tale,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) is the penultimate film in the series, and once again directed convincingly by David Yates. After the death of Professor Dumbledore, circumstances are darker than ever, and so is this film.I actually really like how Dealthy Hallows is divided into two parts, as these are clearly the most slow-paced of all of the films. Part 1 is concerned with horcruxes, and the atmosphere created throughout the film is brilliantly ominous and intricate.One of my favourite films in the series, as Yates is very focused and simultaneously careful and patient in delivering us this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The great elements of each Potter film in one,"The first movie had an amazing expansive world to set its story in. The problem was, it focused more on the building OF the world than the story IN the world.The second movie also had this problem, although to a significantly lesser degree. Here, the story is minimally interrupted by building up the world its set in and, although the world is interesting and expansive, it served more as a distraction from the story.The third movie mastered this. The amazing and expansive world is there to help the story, rather than the story being there to help it. The fourth movie also understood this.But each movie introduced some subtle concept into the mythos. Each concept from each movie is present as a brilliantly used device to tell the story of this film, part of why it is the best one. The first two films had this, but instead of being there to tell the story, it was just there. Here, it actually is there in a way that helps the narrative of the story along, like the books. The amazing mythos isn't distracting, like in the first two films, but isn't ignored almost completely for the sake of the story like in the middle films.If Harry Potter is the master of death, this film is truly, the master of storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A perfect quiet before the storm,"You'd be forgiven for questioning whether this was a Potter movie after all. No Maggie Smith, no floating candles, no Quidditch - we never even set foot inside Hogwarts. But believe me - we get a Potter movie like you've never seen.Most of the visual magic takes place in the first act, as we're treated to a batch of Polyjuice Potion, a Wizard wedding and a rather spectacular chase sequence on a flying motorbike. But for the main chunk of the film, Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is a character study, plain and simple. Supported by beautiful landscapes and top-notch cinematography, the film focuses almost exclusively on our three heroes as they travel far and wide in their search for an answer to what is turning into a full-scale war.Deathly Hallows goes to places not previously explored, particularly given the franchise's lighter beginnings under the guidance of Chris Columbus, as we now tackle heavy issues of racism, ethnic cleansing, slavery and Rowling's magical interpretation of Nazism. The style and atmosphere is reminiscent of post-apocalyptic fiction and cosy-catastrophe concepts worthy of H.G. Wells or John Wyndham. The icing on the cake would be Ben Hibon's superbly animated ""Tale of the Three Brothers"", one of the finest sequences in the entire franchise. As if that weren't enough, we also get perfectly timed blends of horror, romance and, finally, tragedy.Aside from a few niggling points that only a reader of the book could complain about - maybe Harry's farewell to the Dursleys was too rushed - the film is a wonderfully atmospheric prelude, a tight interpretation of its source material, and a perfect quiet before the storm.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
trend toward complete screen black out,"OK - they want to convey dark foreboding, and an air of mystery -- but Jeez -- staring at a black screen for half the movie, just doesn't do it for me. Give us a break and hire some electricians, spend some money on lights and power, and let us SEE JUST WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPENING, not just poorly lit photography. The first four films were enjoyable, but the last few were just not as good. Even after obtaining the dvds, and re-running scenes over and over to try and see just what was going on, these blacked out segments were not worth the effort. Couple that with the other annoying Hollywood technique of using jiggly hand-held cameras, and this last installment becomes a candidate for scrapping and re-shooting.

Solidly entertaining despite feeling a bit like it's in a holding pattern but helped by the very dark tone to this penultimate film,"Voldemort's power is increasing and has taken control of Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic. Those standing against him have fled to regroup in a safer place albeit at great personal risk to themselves in their attempts to protect Harry. When Harry decides to find the rest of the Horcruxes to be able to defeat him, his friends agree to join him. However as darkness grows in the world at large, the trio find themselves facing impossible odds as they discover that Voldemort is pursuing three powerful objects of legend in the world of magic.It took quite a few films but once the series moved away from the introductory stages and got darker, I have started to enjoy them a lot more. OK, I'm not into the story so much that I'm frantic for the final film to come but I am finding the dark tone and content to be much more engaging and satisfying than the more colourful opening films. So I come to the penultimate in the series ‚Äì although it is the final book split into two parts, which is the better decision since this film runs a bit too long while only covering half of it! HP7a wastes no time in getting dark as we open with several scenes of danger and it sets the tone for the rest of the film where there are many sequences and events that will challenge younger viewers. As an adult (of sorts) I enjoyed this and found that it made the danger more real within the film and thus engaged me more. It needed to do this because there are longer sections of the film where the main characters are hiding out and the drama is between them; these didn't work as well for me because I have less of myself invested in them as people, however they are well interspersed with action so that it never really feels like it is sagging too much.Of course sagging (or rather, lack of conclusion) is a bit of a problem in the film because it is only half of it. The ending in particular does provide a cliff hanger but it doesn't manage to overcome the feeling that, like the lead three, we're waiting for something to happen for a lot of the film rather than actually having a lot happen. It does still work though and I mostly enjoyed it; it helps a lot that the film looks great and that the special effects work to assist the dark content. The cast are reasonably good although some of the dialogue in the character driven scenes I did find a little clunky. The lead three have grown into the parts and mostly they avoid melodrama when there is tension between them. The support cast are generally strong and made up of essentially every living British actor doing small turns to good effect.Harry Potter 7a is not a brilliant film by any means and it does struggle with the fact that it is waiting for the conclusion rather than being the conclusion. However it does provide frequent dark sections and action which keep it lively but have the downside of risking frightening away younger viewers. This dark tone does really make it for me as the film engaged me by just how bleak it was in terms of content and cinematography and, while it is understandably not as good as I would have liked, I did enjoy it and I am now looking forward to a conclusion that can keep this dark, adult tone but also bring everything to a close.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is the magic of Harry Potter finally fading...?,"Having rather enjoyed the films to date I went to the screening with an expectation of magic and wonder¬Ö I left with a feeling of disenchantment and disillusionmentAs an adult watching; the movie opens well enough with dramatic and visually exciting scenes leading into an involving if a little chaotic storyline, however as the movie continues it does begin to drag, the lack of screen time for the adult actors is a shame as many of the younger cast seem to have had enough of being a part of this franchise and are now just running through the motions, the one saving grace to this is Rupert Grint who is funny and engaging as Ron, Harry's ever present best friend, and delivers some of the best lines of the film with wit and charisma.For a child watching I would say that it might be a little confusing as to what was happening and then eventually, when no explanation comes, would be a little boring topped off by too scary towards the end (some children had to leave during the showing I was in).As I am sure many of you will already know, there are many significant scenes that have been omitted from the book but I honestly don't feel that this in itself is a problem. I get the feeling that they were thinking about the upcoming final 2 part instalment the whole time they were making this film and with that in mind I look forward to bigger and better things. Regardless I'm sure fans will flock to see it and will no doubt come away hungry for more. So has Harry Potter lost it's magic, probably not but maybe some of its charm.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Brilliant. Best Harry Potter movie of the Franchise, yet.","I went to this movie with high expectations. I had read reviews saying that the movie can be divided into 3 parts where the middle one is kinda boring. So I went in hoping that wasn't true and I was not disappointed. The whole movie just works - and it follows the book so closely, I couldn't help but be happy throughout. If you're an avid Harry Potter book lover who has been terribly disappointed by the way the movies only use the crux of the books, then this movie is for you. It literally starts almost the same way book 7 starts: ""The two men appeared out of nowhere.."" And it progresses in a way that's almost the exact same way it goes in the book except for a few things they removed to help in the progression of the story and some things they added to make the viewer understand what's going on. A friend of mine went in with me having not watched any Harry Potter movie. And after the question or two of ""what is a horecrux"" and ""who's this"" she got into the movie and now can't wait for part 2. This is the best one in the Harry Potter franchise so far. I give it a 10 because I love Harry and because this is one of my favorite movies this year. You should definitely go watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Saved the Best Part for Last,"But unfortunately, that also means that we are, sadly, reaching the end of a great series. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the bullseye of what's going to go down between good and evil in the wizarding world.Things are getting worse in the world of witches and wizards, thanks to Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, including the now-hesitant Malfoys and the borderline insane Bellatrix Lestrange. Voldy wants Harry Potter and wants to kill him personally, and if you've seen and read Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, then you'll know why. The movie is a large, 2 1/2 hour cat-and-mouse game as Harry and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, travel around the country, searching for Voldemort's treasured Horcruxes (his weights for immortality) and destroy them for good, leading Harry closer and closer to taking down Voldemort as a mortal man.The movie is like the flesh and blood of the book. The actors have portrayed nearly every bits of the book very well. You see the proof clearly that Harry, Ron and Hermione aren't at Hogwarts anymore. They don't know who to trust and what's safe anymore.The only minor flaws are that (MINOR SPOILER, but I will be light with it) there are scenes they place such as Harry's visions of Voldemort at his angriest that don't seem to be clear for those who haven't read the book. You only receive a few spats from Voldemort and his livid face before Harry wakes up. The other minor flaw is that they didn't fully explain R.A.B., which I won't go into detail for the sake of keeping the secret of the movie.Besides these two little mistakes, the movie is amazing to watch, and if you're a fan of the book, then 2 1/2 hours will go back as quickly as it did for me. You'll feel horror, sorrow, and even anger as you watch Harry and his friends cast the ultimate spell.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""an adequate cliffhanger for the ending of a phenomenon""","9 years ago the world was first introduced to the courageous trio of companions whom audiences of all ages have embraced. The series has faced the challenges of adolescence, friendship, rivalry & most significantly death. The Final installment of the Harry Potter films ""The Deathly Hallows"" is presented in two parts and primarily deals with love & death which is quite strongly emphasised throughout the story.The film begins with the urgency of protecting Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) from the almost indestructible Lord Voldermort portrayed by two time Academy Award Nominated* (Ralph Fiennes) who has completed his ascension to power by taking over Hogwarts with his death eaters by his side. After a threatful and rather upsetting escape from an attack, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) continue the work of the late Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) in destroying the remaining Horcruxes which embody the the torn soul of the evil Lord Voldermort. The sacrifice Harry's friends have made in accompanying him on this mission begins to toll on the friendship they once so closely shared, as Ron questions the faith Harry has for Dumbledore due to the lack of guidance and information to pursue. Along the way frantically racing against time whilst the Dark Lord continues to gain power by the day, Harry discovers the existence of the three most powerful objects in the wizarding world known as the ""Deathly Hallows"", which he now understands is the focus behind Voldemort's intentions. To possess the ""Deathly Hallows"" would create the master of death himself, so the lives of the loved ones dearest to them relies on the decisions they now make.Without the reading of the books or more particularly if you are approaching this film without seeing the previous titles in the series it will be extremely hard to comprehend what's going on. There are dozens of names and references that without having a Potter encyclopedia by your side will mind boggle you. The flowing of the film is also questionable, although it is only Part One and our questions may be answered in Part two.On a positive note Eduardo Serra's Cinematography should be praised as it's finest the series has seen; particularly the forest sequences and underwater shots in which a climatic sequence between Harry and the destruction of a horcrux takes place. Alexandre Desplat does a fantastic job scoring the film giving it an all new feel to the music world John Williams created for us early in the series, nothing needs to be said about the visual effects which are always visually pleasing. There are no doubts in the acting of our three heroes as Daniel Radcliffe especially has proved himself as a true leading young man. As always fans will be disappointed in the lack of screen time from the unbelievable supporting cast the series has seen; Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman to name a few and newcomers to the set of Potter Bill Nighy along with Rhys Ifans, although what little time they do have they use to their advantage, my favourite being Alan Rickman as ""Severus Snape"" who casting was sublime.The splitting of the films is an adequate cliffhanger for the ending of a phenomenon and will surely leave the viewer eagerly anticipating Part Two which opens July 2011.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I'd say yes, in the better parts, it had something wise and melancholy going for it, rather like the book, but it was lost all too easily to the infrequent action sequences which neither impress nor lend any forward motion, aside from a particular part of the Bagshot/Nagini sequence making the audience jump a couple feet, and all without Voldemort. Meh.Alterations to the plot were generally as bad as they've been in the past, but the Lovegood house was so very poorly done, it rates special mention. It well and truly sucked. (I wondered if there had been some technical difficulties with the editing, it was so bad.) Most of the emotional scenes are strangely unmoving. Hermione's torture becomes something weirdly camp - Tim Burtonish, if you will - with no power to unsettle. The much anticipated horcrux destruction scene lacks any sort of nuance at all, so much so that Ron's resigned remark at the end of it falls as flat as a bassoon. Hermione looked like an airbrushed NY fashion house mascot, and Harry looked like plastic, with some silvery gloss smudged on. It was hokey, and I felt embarrassed watching it.There were other bothersome things (the list could go on) - the whole imprisonment scene was horrid, rushed and thoughtless, and the basement itself looked like they were in some half-finished suburban ground floor, only thing missing was a couch, a TV and some paneling. Olivander looked far healthier than he did in the first film, Luna was an afterthought, Wormtail was apparently lulled to sleep by general uneventfulness, and Dobby looked like a wax figure moved by strings. Bellatrix was about as scary as The Count from Sesame Street, the snatchers behaved like the three stooges, and the confrontation at the end had all the movement drained from it, arranged instead like a lazy, half-hearted family portrait, just so they could end it with a hokey special effect that didn't work - the knife turning to jelly or something in the whirlwind of apparation. Dobby's death was atrociously handled, Luna spoke far too soon, and the burial was filmed in the blandest possible way.The story was told in a linear way, and the camera work was too, which resulted in a very one dimensional film. The burial scene, for example, could have had a shot threw the window, with Hermione on the couch, Ron beside her, and Harry in the background or something - it would have taken no more time, but it would have filled the world better. Anything to vary the 1, 2, 3 of the telling.The Story of the Three Brothers animation was very cool, and strange as it may seem to say it, Emma Watson's acting is almost the best thing about the film.I liked the arty parts, but everything else is trash.The film needed a new director and a new writer. I fear for part two very much now.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stunning, Dark, and a Great Epic Film","We have invested nearly a decade, getting to know each of the main characters in this series, and with each book/movie, their personalities and the intense relationship that binds the main protagonists have grown darker and more powerful. In the first installment, we learned that the lives of Voldemort and Potter were linked and the bond might never be severed, even after death. The tone of the books was light and served as an introduction to the magical universe we've grown to love. Seven books later, the universe is crumbling, as Voldemort gains momentum and is getting closer to his prey.From its superb prologue to its magical closing image, this film shows us how masterpieces are created. We are now witnesses to the perfect marriage of good, old fashioned movie making, a time when solid story telling and characterization were the basis of great cinema and eventual classics; with the help of technology and sophisticated camera work, the latest chapter in Harry's story is definitely the most meditative, deep, and dark. Its director has taken chances taking us in a ride which shows the soul of the three protagonists. Giving sure and heartfelt performances, Rupert, Emma, and Daniel have matured into leading actors, fully able to communicate what lies deep inside their characters' souls. The mid section of this movie moves at a very leisured pace, offering us more than a peek into how close Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are, and what they each mean to each other, and consequently us. The gorgeous photography allows us to experience their loneliness, their devotion, their integrity, and how desperation threatens to overcome and destroy them.The magic remains at the core of the film, but it shows in a very different way. Yes, there are displays of the epic battle to come, as we witness the principals prepare themselves for the final chapter, but it is the subtlety of each characterization, and how each performer beautifully demonstrates the powerful writing and how well they understand their roles. Although, this is the young heroes' showcase, everyone gets a chance to shine, and at times it is a a matter of combining the perfect line with the right camera angle.There are hints of what the resolution might be, connections to the past, and they are all elegantly displayed. The flashbacks are kept to a minimum, but each link is effectively shown, with the masterful work of Sierra and Desplat, as they create a mood, revive a theme, and enhance the perfect direction and flawless work of each performer. Two moments stand out among the fantastic work in ""Hallows"": A visit to the cemetery where Harry's parents are buried is a perfect mix of anxiety, sadness, and the power of love. The ending to this chapter is also brilliant as the film offers a most revealing perspective into the dark side.The film will hopefully increase the appreciation of the cinematic relevance and craftsmanship that remains the strength of the Potter films. Maybe the inclusion of darker themes and touches will earn this epic film the recognition it truly deserves. Here is a movie that explores nightmares of the real kind. Its nature is magical but the pain is real, and unlike a recent film that relied too much on the technical and the relatively incomprehensible exercise of the power of the mind, this one doesn't forget that heart and mind do go together, with matching levels. There are several moments that will haunt the audience, as we realize that we read, see, and revisit this universe because ultimately we care about this fictional trio and their respective adventures and relationships. Hermoine's beautiful mind and soul would be worthless without her connection to Harry's courage and Ron's passions, and as someone once asked in another one of those fictional worlds asked: ""Do you believe?"", we can't help but say, ""I believe, I believe."" This is the best film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The boy who live... is still living,"The journey of Harry Potter finally come to the end. The three friends Harry, Hermoine and Ron once were kids and now they are young wizard and witch.The part 1 of the final chapter of HP7 did a good job in explaining what happened, what is happening and what will happen. The pace of the entire 146mins film catches the audience although some scenes might be a little dull (maybe there's no Ron silliness). Editing is fair and directing from David Yates seems familiar but in HP7 he gave us more surprise. This time the shots and the setting is beautifully done.Some revision might helps before stepping in the cinema because HP7 part 1 doesn't really show too much of flashback of the previous chapter. Characters from previous chapter share quite a big role here and some just get Charm till death so quick until we wont realize he/she's gone..Daniel, Emma and Rupert's acting, what can i say.. This 3 kids deserve to get the fame and the spotlight. Besides this 3 obviously is the main character in the film, other supporting actor/actresses also bring the character from the book to film and reality.Conclusion, if you'd follow HP for the past few year please don't miss the final chapter. It's emotional, it brings memory back. We'd watched Harry from a baby and HP7 is the film which you will see the last battle between Harry and You-Know-Who.hint: There will be more to watch in HP7 part 2, I swear.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rootless,"One has to face it; it's not that hard to carry a franchise like this. The books are best-sellers, and teenagers are among some of the resistant hardcore fans for whatever pop phenomena they choose to embrace. The books hit a sweet corner of contemporary souls: the lack of magic in the way they conduct their lives, driven by a vision of the world that has been excluding the power of mysticism, true mysticism, born from the most basic connections between humans and their environment, humans and themselves. The books revolve around bits of old mythologies, and deliver them with a fashionable package, filled with visual and metaphorical elements that ring a bell in our western collective consciousness. Phoenixes, wands, potions, spells...But i only care for the series because they were made into films, these books don't appeal to me, the films may appeal. And the main option in the building of the 8 (which after all will be 9) films that translate the books was that they would evolve like their main characters, which were at the beginning children. So we started as children's films, evolved to adolescent ""highschool"" films, and know the films have been mapped onto a kind of a hybrid genre, oscillating between the detective story and the action film. This 8th installment falls on this category, as the previous one had. I guess the last one will get closer to the ""return of the king"": epic and visceral.Apart from that evolution of the films, in some of them we have cinematic concepts that get explored, with more or less success. This is where things get interesting to me. The 3rd film was the best to me: it dealt with an coupling of time and space (that the story of the book supported) and cleverly relied on one of the best explorers of space (through camera) we have today to direct it. So we have the deepest shots in the series, the best Hogwarts, the most magic environment of the series. The Half-blood prince relied on similar principles, but instead of exploring the space, the architecture was cleverly staged, it depended on point of view, framing and mise-en-sc√©ne. It was clever and the best film of the series post- Columbus.This gets us here, to this film, which represents a radical shift in what has been done before. Again, the story provides the clues for the visual materialization of the film: our main characters are stranded, wandering between multiple worlds, multiple realities, all of them devoid of human elements to anchor the action: snow, woods, rocks. So the rug is pulled on us, and the relatively frantic rhythm of the movie has to do with us failing to anchor our eyes on the expected sets that do Not show: we don't get to see Hogwarts. That may have been a somewhat risky decision, but i believe that at this moment, the fans only want to see the illustration on-screen of the facts they know will happen, so these guys can almost literally do anything they want.Again, as in the previous film, i appreciated the visual hint: linear time, but rootless sets. But the sets are just not interesting enough, and the effect fades with the multiplication of sets.My opinion: 3/5Http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not bad, one of the worst in the series though","With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years progress. Part I of the ""Deathly Hallows"" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody. Acting was superb like in every other film, probably because of the strong, British cast that has dominated the franchise over the years. The main 3 were again excellent and carry the film on their shoulders. Despite the good performances i found the characters in this film, not particularly enthralling and quite melodramatic at times. Yates' direction in Order of the Phoenix and again in this one is a bit off in my opinion and the tone was all over the place. The film is like a roller coaster, with giddy high points, either in the action or the tone, but there are also many low points with nothing in the middle. I respect and understand the decision to make this movie in the first place, trying to fit both part 1 and 2 in the same movie would be a catastrophe in many ways. That being said, it was very bland and boring at times, the beginning and end were pretty good but the middle of the film was just amateurish. The whole plot line with Ron is aggravating and completely out of character and the very little subplots it had were rushed and under-developed. Another complaint i had was the lack of chronological storytelling, scenes and acts could be easily switched without much change and the film felt disconnected. Overall, i think this film was still good and can see why people like it, but nothing compared to other movies in the series.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A little close to the book then the 6th,"Finally my review for the last installment of Harry Potter well part one anyway. First I would like to say how glad I am they released this movie in two parts. I personally think they should have done that with every book after the third if they did they would have been able to make it much closer to the book and therefore and much better and complete movie like this one was. The acting was the best yet out of all the movies and the story is getting very intense also it seems the writing has improved drastically with the dialouge and screenplay.This movie is about Harry, Ron and Hermoine who instead of going to Hogwarts for their last year decide to finish Dumbledores work and go on the hunt for the horcuxes so they can kill Voldemort.This movie was probably my favorite one. It is definitely the most intense and with the most adult content and don't get me wrong there is still tons of stuff left out from the book but I personally think this one is a better adaptation then the 6th installment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A mature Harry Potter for a mature audience.,"I saw this at the Sydney premiere and was highly impressed, Yates has done a terrific job here after the let downs of the last two films.Now I've just read some reviews and there are many complaints about it being too long, action-less and boring. I must protest. One of the brilliant things about splitting the story into two films is to give each the time to fill out more than just non-stop action.The acting here is much better than previously, with much of the story conveyed without the cramped, emotionless, talk-too-fast dialog of the other films. the characters are given the time to be still, to fill the emotional space around them and create a strong sense of the lost and crumbling world they are feeling their lonely way through. The three mains especially give fulfilling and nuanced performances, backed up by a strong show elsewhere.Whilst everyone has their own tastes in films, I think some people need to let the films grow out of action-film-for-young-teen land and turn into the young adult drama the books ended up becoming.This is a highly entertaining watch, but - somewhat redundant of this post - everyone who's seen the other films will watch this one even if it was horrible, and I can't see many people starting with this one even if it's brilliant. Harry Potter is coming to a fitting and spectacular close - but only for those that have been with him along.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I confess myself disappointed,"I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, both the movies, and the books, and I'm afraid that this one didn't shine, it was merely adequate.First, there are many themes that continue through the books, and they weren't followed in the movie. Normally, I would say that this is just somebody being picky, but I was let down. Each book starts with a scene with the Dursleys, and although I was moderately disappointed with the absence of Dumbledore's lecture to the Dursleys at the beginning of the Half Blood Prince, I was OK with it. But to eliminate Dudley's farewell to Harry to me was scandalous! I knew it would be in the special features of the DVD, however, it was poorly acted, poorly directed, and looked like an afterthought. It was a conclusion to a main subplot and it's absence did not go unnoticed.I was unhappy in general with the adaptation to film, and the directing. The scene on Privet drive when all of the order and friends come to take Harry for example. The dialogue seems unnatural and awkward, as well when Harry tries to sneak away from the burrow and Ron catches him, when Harry was speaking to Elphias Doge. In my opinion, somebody on set should have told Daniel Radcliffe to stop flashing his left hand every time he wanted to look serious.And finally, there were too many things that weren't taken care of in a proper order, and instead needed to be thrown in haphazardly. For example, Bill mentioning being bitten by Grayback, Ron spurting out, ""Did you say you needed a wand? I got one!"". And it would only have taken a second longer for Harry and Ron to have their text dialogue after Ron returned (when Ron says""Dumbledore knew I'd leave"", to which Harry says ""He knew you'd want to come back""). I feel like that was an unnecessary change that takes from character development.And I was very disappointed when Mundungus Flecher just looked down at an old newspaper and pointed out Delores Umbridge. It was so poorly done. He could have said anything there, ""Short woman, dressed in pink, with this sickening little giggle"".But nothing disappointed me more than Dobby's death scene. It was too quick. He died, Luna closed his eyes, then Harry blurts out how he wants to bury him.The whole thing just seemed too rushed, as if they didn't take the time to ensure that the writing was complete, and the scenes were filmed properly.As well, as much as I love Bill Nighy, I feel like Scrimgeour should have been played by Peter Mullan. Just saying. Personally, I thing Bill Nighy should have played Olivander, and John Hurt should have played Xenophilius Lovegood.I still enjoy the movie though. I just hope that I get the sense of conclusion that I want out of the second part.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Epic Finale That Harry Potter Yearned To Become, Now Follows The Epic Journey That Lord of The Rings Had","Harry Potter personally has been an enjoyable series of films to date, however it lacked the epic scale and plot that up to the fifth film The Order of The Phoenix finally corrected. The fifth and sixth films of the series finally hit gold with the epic scale that brought back memories of The Lord of The Rings or the Star Wars prequel films. In part one of the final film, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione face off against the dark lord himself in a race to turn back the tide he has brought with him consuming the land.In this finale, the scale of things has been lifted and no longer do we have a child like world that the first few films incorporated. From the start of this film, you know it has come a long way and matured into something more deeper and epic. No longer do our characters have a safety net to save them, at the final moment of the film and nor is there a quick fix present for them. Instead we have soul searching, character development and confessions being made that set the groundwork for part two.Harry, Hermione and Ron have matured and grown into the characters we waited for them to become. Battle hardened, scarred warriors that have their flaws, but also their strengths that they will need to use against their enemies. This is also a film that will hit fans of the franchise hard, with many characters falling at the hands of the dark lord and will surely be missed.The budget has also been raised for these two final instalments, and its obviously with the scale of locations, effects and plot-driven events. I feel that The Deathly Hallows has reached the epic level of Lord of The Rings, and even Star Wars. I think that the studio and director finally caught onto the success of The Half-Blood Prince with its dark theme and story, following on with the dark lord now taking over every foundation of the Wizarding world, our heroes are desperate, and at times turn on one another out of fear and desperation.You feel these characters have grown and can now survive on their own, as they have to and have no one there to help them. This is a great start to the finale, and I cannot wait for the final part and hope the dark theme and epic scale continue.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delusions of Grandeur,"Whenever a Harry Potter book is converted into a movie (the name is enough to cast the magical spell on you even if you've not read any of Potter Books), the fans always have apprehensions. Read more to know why! As Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger prepare for their final showdown with Lord Voldemort and his brood of baddies ‚Äì which is stretched out to two chapters for the big screen ‚Äì we're thrust into an overcast world of fear, isolation and constant tent pitching in ""The Deathly Hallows.""The first thing the viewer does is to compare the movie with the book. The novel fan expects every chapter of the book in a detailed manner in the movie. And if, by this late date, you're not well-acquainted with Harry, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Voldemort, the late Dumbledore or even horcruxes, you're out of luck. Deathly Hallows drops viewers into the bleak proceedings straight away.Lord Voldemort's death eaters are on a march. Major characters in the series are killed off, and there's not a moment to mourn. The war between the good wizards and those evil wizards and traitors in the service of Voldemort has begun. In no time, Harry, Ron and Hermione are on their own, away from Hogwarts and any safety older wizards may be able to give them. Seeing all this, Harry decides to break away from his protection. He sets out with Hermione and Ron on a mission to find the rest of the horcruxes and ultimately destroy them.The visuals are grandeur. The trio has performed well. They have matured over the period of time and the maturity in their acting is clearly visible. Ralph Fiennes as the Dark Lord is awesome. His cold expressions are terrifying. But, there is one problem with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Long stretches of the movie are set in this or that remote landscape. The audience (especially who are not familiar with the novel) gets no idea of what is happening in the movie many a times. They could only make guesses!Direction is good. Cinematography is awesome. Effects are outstanding. Acting is terrific. Editing is poor. Very poor. So is Screenplay writing. The writers could easily have done a much better job. The movie has a very little to offer in two hours and twenty-six minutes. Undoubtedly, The Goblet of Fire was the best among all.To conclude, I would just go for it( to those who haven't read the book) to enjoy the last part of the series and the visuals!My Rating: 6/10Thanks & Regards",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best Harry Potter movie yet,"Surprisingly, this is more intense and action-packed than the previous movies. The previous movie, the half-blooded prince has literally no action, only some mild struggle of magic battles. The deadly Hallows is better than the last in terms of action and intensity. From start to the credit rolling, I had to hold my breath during the intense 2 hours and 26 minutes as I have not read the books; not knowing what could happen next. With the realistic acting, the high level of intensity is achieved.The story: It starts off darkly with Voldemort displaying his cruelty without hesitation. And from that scene, you know you will be absorbed into the now dark and bleak world of Hogwart. Harry Potter and his friends are the run and nearly every where they stop for a rest or go into hiding, troubles find them. And that are the parts where David Yates proves that he can create some hectic action scenes. Though the action scenes are brief but they are intense like the first action scene where Harry had a narrow escape. The action scene in the forest is intense though frenetic. The story may drag a little in the middle but it has a purpose; to understand the trio's emotions more. The acting is good. The intensity between Daniel, Emma and Rupert is good and believable. The other characters' suspicious looks and capable of doing anything also make this intense. The special effects are breath-taking. Music score is also epic; the music matches the movie right and at the right time.Overall: Is it the best Harry Potter movie? I can't say as the final movie is not out until next year. But this is definitely the best Potter movie so far as I feel that it balances the right amount of action and drama and intensity. I was left disappointed after watching the half-blooded prince but this is good follow-up where I didn't actually feel disappointed. One of the better blockbuster movie this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
10 Years In the Making,"Ten years ago, we were introduced to a young boy who had extraordinary magical powers and his destiny was to destroy the one thing he feared the most - death. In 2001, The Sorcerer's Stone (Philosopher's Stone) showed us what true friendship meant. In 2002, The Chamber of Secrets showed us courage and bravery. In 2004, The Prisoner of Azkaban showed us it takes faith to trust. In 2005, The Goblet of Fire showed us, not only skill, but a test of power. In 2007, The Order of the Phoenix showed us to open our minds and to ""not to tell lies."" In 2009, The Half-Blood Prince showed us not linger too much on the past.But in 2010 & 2011, a due to the finish will determine to have the ultimate power - the power of love. Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows - Part 1 will leave a mark, not a physical mark, but a mark of urgency, a mark that is not seen - a mark to feel, a mark of love. I loved this movie. I have to say a very BIG THANK YOU to the one person who poured blood, sweat & tears into every word written on the pages of magic - J.K. Rowling. Thank you for giving us 10 wonderful years of magic.I give this movie a mere perfect score of 100 - for everything from the special effects to the incredible to the incredible artistry to the breathtaking scenery. The 3 stars - Dan, Rupert & Emma - we will miss you and we look forward to upcoming projects from you.This movie met every expectation that I had from reading the book.

A huge disappointment.,"Recently I have been watching the entire series for the first time and I have to say I enjoyed all the previous films. The 6th one though left a strange feeling that Rowling was running out of ideas and much of the good stuff was substituted with typical romance. I hoped something was stored for the final story but nope, a big disappointment here. The film feels like a really bad soap opera you are wishing to finally end but can't turn off because you are too much invested into the story. There is almost nothing to keep you entertained, the dialogues are especially lacking and there are lots of them. At the end I even started losing my sympathies towards the three heroes watching them running away from a mere gang of bandits (all of whom got disarmed by a single witch later) and even failing to do that. I mean come on, you are going to kill the almighty Voldemort and can't even stand up against those? And the elf being killed was the final nail in the film's coffin, so predictable and so cheap.If you value your time, just read the plot on the internet and move on.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quiet and boring in places.,"This seventh of the Harry Potter books transferred to the big screen continued the darker and more grown up phase of the development of the story. Unfotunately Harry Potter has been on the go for so long now with such long breaks between film instalments of the book that there is a feeling that it is being deliberately spun out just to keep the revenue stream for as long as possible. Harry Potter was unique and wonderful when it first appeared but I feel it is past its sell by date and remembering how it all started is a dim and distant memory. This episode has nothing to do with Hogworts School, the young (actually not so young now) wizards have left school and are seeking to destroy things called horcruxes which will in turn destroy the power of the dark lord Voldemort. This episode in the long epic story sees the final book being split into two parts, so we'll have to wait yet another year for the concluding part! There were long boring parts in which very little happened - the silent parts in a busy auditorium resulted in hearing all the distracting sounds of sweet papers rustling, people talking and other distractions which normal film sound tracks would have masked. Cannot help but feel the movie makers are deliberately spinning this out and much of this episode could easily have been condensed without losing the plot. Having said that it did contain much of the HP wizardry and the unique JK Rowling formula that has created the Harry Potter phenomenon over the last decade. I think it should really have run its course by now however.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Darker, dramatic and more palpable ""Potter"" film is a true epic","My how time flies. Not only have we watched three young actors and their respective characters grow up over the course of 10 years before our very eyes, but also the tonal shift from light to dark in the ""Harry Potter"" movies has been unusually drastic. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1‚Ä≥ is a true epic ‚Äî a dark and brooding journey with a tone remarkably akin to ""The Lord of the Rings."" Director David Yates has taken a film series which was once a fanciful, light-hearted rendering of author J.K. Rowling's imagination and made it feel real and especially dangerous. I suppose you could say it's not your older sibling's ""Harry Potter.""The dark turn of the films was inevitable given the content of the books, but Yates has realized it in such a way that these last couple of films have felt completely different from their predecessors. Rowling's tone, in spite of more prolific deaths, has not changed nearly as much. This time around there's lots of blood, characters are dying left and right and the stuff that supplements the main plot, instead of being fluffy and magical, is decidedly dramatic.Although Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is still the courageous and impulsive one, Hermione (Emma Watson) is still the smart and prepared one and Ron (Rupert Grint) is still the oblivious one, the dialogue is adult and the moments they share are complex. The three friends must survive on their own in this film as they search for the horcruxes (objects infused with parts of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul) and are on the run from the Death Eaters, the dark wizards and witches who have seized the Ministry of Magic and have begun a reign of terror. Considering these once-child stars were initially cast on looks and being able to play their type, they continue to prove themselves as venerable adults in ""Hallows.""This maturity is reflected in the writing of screenwriter Steve Kloves (who adapted every book but ""Order of the Phoenix""). He provides many tender and dramatic moments between the friends, not all of which were written by J.K. Rowling, trusting them to handle the deeper material. Given the flexibility of a two-film final chapter, Kloves could also resort more to cutting corners than entire sections of the book. Devout fans will notice much of the exposition regarding Albus Dumbledore's ""mysterious"" past including that involving the wizard Gridelwald has been axed or turned into easter eggs. That's it as far as significant omissions, and it was the right choice on account of a lack of visual storytelling opportunities, even though Harry's growing resentment of/loss of faith in Dumbledore never becomes part of the story as it does so intriguingly in the book.Yates' patience also improves the series in ""Hallows."" There's a build up to the events and some lengthier shots that have a lasting impact. It feels more like a dramatic motion picture than a squeeze-it-in adaptation. The film could have easily hopped from scene to scene with action at every turn, but Yates takes his time. The scene in Godric's Hollow, for example, when Harry and Hermione follow the old Bathilda Bagshot to her house only to find she's not quite who they think she is evolves slowly and culminates in a tense sequence lasting much shorter. Succinctly put, the cinematic quality of the films has continued to improve as it has done ever since Yates took over. What used to be the emphasis in the plot-driven scenes (action and visual effects) has changed.""Deathly Hallows"" is not forgiving of those who aren't already familiar with the Harry Potter universe, but at the same time, this darker tone, higher proportion of drama and much more cinematic feel should improve the overall entertainment factor for those hoping to get something out of the ""Hallows"" despite never reading the books or barely remembering the previous entries.With the PG-13 rating back on, ""Deathly Hallows"" feel real and the action is palpable. The casting of fighting spells back and forth in battle do some collateral damage for once. The sound and VFX teams deserve major credit for upping that factor to a new level. For once, magical realism has an application to the Potter world: Instead of calling attention to pretty visual effects, Yates and crew make them feel naturally part of the action, which keeps our focus on the characters. CGI in films has also improved over the 10 years of ""Potter"" movies and as such, Yates sees no compelling need to highlight them more than usual and ""Hallows"" is better for it.Maybe most importantly, ""Hallows Pt. 1‚Ä≥ sets us up for a dramatic, exciting and cathartic finale to the most impressive movie franchise ever made. Yates, Kloves and the entire cast and crew have really upped the stakes with their work on this film and it shows. I have no ounce of doubt that Part 2 will be an incredible send-off for this series given the effort and creativity put into Part 1. If you're a fan who has forgotten how close you've actually become to these characters, ""Deathly Hallows"" will surely remind you.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only one more to go,"It is hard to rate and review these movies after awhile. There are so many and some I loved while others I didn't. One thing is that every new movie there is something different they try and it either wins or fails. This movie had both. The win was focusing on the main characters more as grown ups than as kids and it really worked. I felt like I was watching more of an adult fantasy type movie. The fail was the use of action scenes. They tried the whole, ""shaking the camera"" to add special effect and more of the real to the action shots. This really took away from the film and even started giving me a headache. I am glad it was not in 3D because I probably would of passed out. The cast was still great and Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson blossom with each movie. The rest of the characters are fun to watch as always and a joy to see act. This film is darker than most of the other movies and did have some more passion towards characters too. So I did enjoy how it was filmed, but not the shaking camera. One more Harry Potter to go and it is over. Hopefully it will end and it will be a good end to a great series and everyone can focus on something new.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deathly Loss of Innocence,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the Chosen One, and his best friend Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) huddle together in the snow covered forest her Muggle parents took her as a young child. Hermione confides that these woods are as she remembered, but ""We have changed"". Much has changed in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"". Gone are the days of innocence and the wonder of youth in the pursuit of true magic. ""Deathly Hallows"" veers dour and menacing. The Dark Lord Voldemort (charismatic evil Ralph Fiennes) declares, ""I shall be the one to kill Harry Potter!"" In this dark envisioning of J.K. Rowling's final book: It is now ""time to put away childish things"". David Yates expertly directs this, and the concluding Part 2, as he did in the previous 2 movies. ""Deathly Hallows"" is more craft than art.We have all witnessed the journey of Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) through the last 10 years and 6 books. Our children have grown up literally before our eyes. Director Yates is craftsman-like in his creation beholding to Steve Kloves's screenplay laden with precision. I have not read the Rowling's books. My bud Chuck told me that this movie is very loyal to the book‚Äîmaybe painfully so. Although Yates's creation is sturdy and captivating, he is not creating art. The score by Alexandre Desplat elicits the gravity and significance of the story. Yates and Kloves's narrative is by the numbers, lacking an edge or sense of foreboding danger. Yates fails to leverage the most enticing dynamic of all: Whom does Hermione truly love? Ron? Harry? Singer Sting once said the most interesting love songs are about ""I love you. You love someone else."" This also seems to be a glaring void.Our young transforming heroes must risk all to protect avatar Harry, and check Voldemort from possessing the triad of the Deathly Hallows; thus making him ""master of death"". ""Harry Potter"" has always embodied love and humanity. The narrative is ambitious in making palatable the vast amount of source material, and converging upon the eternal battle of good against evil. However, we don't get much insight into Harry, Ron, and Hermione‚Äîcharacters we have all grown to love. Granted this is not the concluding act of this saga.This is too bad, given that all have evolved into wonderful actors. Particularly, Emma Watson displays a self-aware loss of innocence and lonely sadness as Hermione. She is the emotional anchor as Harry expands into the hero he is fated. Daniel Radcliffe is both commanding and vulnerable as Harry. He nuances Harry's fear of his own darkness. He must reconcile whether he is savior or merciless avenger. Voldemort killed his parents, and in twisted way defined Harry. Harry suffers the guilt of being powerless to stop Severus Snape (strong Alan Rickman) from killing his mentor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Radcliffe holds his own with the powerful Fiennes. Surprisingly, Harry does not say anything memorable as the emerging hero at this juncture. Grint as Ron tires of being Harry's sidekick. Grint does his best to elevate Ron beyond the angst ridden teen finding his path and embracing true love, possibly with Hermione.In ""Deathly Hallows"" our heroes leave the security of Hogwarts behind, and venture into the chaotic and unforgiving world. Lead by Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and ""Mad Eye"" Moody the young wizards and witches risk their lives to protect Harry from Voldemort and his minions, until Harry turns 17 years old. A malevolent conspiracy is brewing. Lord Voldemort has vanquished vestiges of his soul into vessels called Horcruxes, ensuring his immortality. Hermione uncovers Voldemort scheme, and determines that they must destroy all the Horcruxes. In the balance is Voldemort's emergence as omniscient master of death and vanquisher of the Chosen One‚ÄîHarry. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" has striking action and visuals; however, it is deathly slow for the first half. The movie redeems itself toward the end.However, this may be more the calm before the storm and the concluding chapter. The ""Deathly Hallows"" is calculated and sturdy, but lacks a sense of wonder and magic that made the series classic. Perhaps, Part 2 risks and challenges all.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Can any fiction be better than Harry Potter?,"Harry Potter is back. And is back with a bang. The days are done when we used to watch movies for its storyline and action kind of crap. Its more about the feel of it now. WB takes us to another mind wobbling journey of Howards School. (though this time the story plays more outside). Harry Potter has grown tall. Harmaine is fantastic. Ron is awesome. Well you always expect a HP movie to be awesome. But let me tell you ,this one is mind blasting. The addition of 3D to harry potter is a ""go wow"" thing! The movie is just perfect. The only minus factor being you can't resist yourself to wait for the part2. Go Watch it if u have not seen yet..... AND GO WOW!!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No emotion, disappointing film","I've heard a lot of people say that reviewing the newest Harry Potter movie is a pointless exercise. By now, people have made up their minds regarding the film series. If they are on-board, then they'll see it regardless, and if they don't like it, they aren't going to make an exception for the newest one. That's fair enough, but it's not a sentiment I necessarily agree with.I don't think that has to be correct, because Deathly Hallows Part 1 has convinced me it is not. I think it actually could turn people off the series. That's not to say that it is a terrible film, but all of the charm that the previous films had seem to have been lost with this one. There is also the worrying thought that since Part 1 and Part 2 were shot back-to-back, the second film will have the same flaws.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the first of two films based on JK. Rowling's seventh Harry Potter book. It, once again, stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. That's about all the actors who ""star"" in the film, as none of the secondary actors are given much chance to enhance or establish their characters.This ends up being the first problem with the film. None of the secondary cast members get their fair share of screen time. Take, for example, Alan Rickman as Severous Snape. He's a character that was incredibly interesting in the first few films, and pivotal in the last one. Here, he gets maybe two scenes over the course of the film, none of which are that important. This is true for all of the other secondary characters as well. They show up, disappear for a while, and then reappear for another scene. That's all we get from them, and it doesn't allow any time to get any insight into their character that we hadn't already been shown.While you are expected to have watched the previous six films in order to get a feel for the characters, it almost feels like you could have skipped them and still have gotten a good idea of what is happening. Not being in that situation myself, I cannot be sure, but the film did seem to be a bit too direct in an attempt to fill the audience in on what happened previously. Certain plot points continue to be hammered home, multiple times, and it makes you feel like the film doesn't think you are smart enough to remember them.Without involving the secondary characters, the film turns out to consist mostly of Harry, Ron and Hermione, one of which ends up being absent for a large chunk of time, searching around various locations for the remaining Horcruxes. Since Hogwarts has now been taken over, they can't go back there, so they instead decide to ditch their final year of classes and go on an adventure. The Hogwarts setting is actually what made a lot of the previous movies interesting for me, meaning this change was not a good one in my mind. Yes, I am well aware that this also happens in the book, and can't be omitted, but making it happen for almost all of the entire two and a half hours the film plays for is not welcome.This also means that the film does get kind of boring. The secondary characters made the previous films more interesting, but since most of them are absent from this one, we can only focus on our three leads. These are characters who, after this film, I have grown to dislike. I didn't before, because there would always be side-sessions with other characters dispersed between long sequences with the primary cast. Here, we don't get that, and I began to grow tired of Harry, Ron and Hermione.The worst part about it is the fact that the film does attempt to have some emotional moments. Sadly, they almost all fall flat on their face. There is one scene, right near the end that was sad, but the rest of the time, I was sitting there questioning why they even bothered to try to stir emotions. There were also attempts at humour throughout, none of which worked in lightening the mood, and only served to remind me that when the film tries to change the mood, it fails.The best part about the film was the visual effects. From transforming characters into multiple Harry Potters, to the house elves, to the spells used, you can tell that a lot of effort was put into the visuals. The film looks nice all around, and it does take you to various locations. At least you'll have some nice scenery to look at.I'm still not sure whether or not I can dissuade Harry Potter fans from going to see Deathly Hallows Part 1, but I hope that they will take this review as a caution. This is perhaps the weakest film of the series, and it fails to bring any depth to any character that isn't named Harry, Ron, or Hermione. The scenery and visuals are great, but the secondary characters are pushed aside for ones that end up getting on your nerves. I do fear, however, for Part 2, as they were shot back-to-back. Hopefully they will rectify them in the editing process, or even go back and re-shoot some scenes before release. Either way, I was let down by Part 1.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rate 10/10,"A note for Harry Potter fans, you will not see Harry, Hermione and Ron in Hogwarts anymore. There will be no Quidditch games, Fred and George's shop, love potion problems or even their friends although Neville and Luna appear in small roles. So, ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is really dark than the previous films and there will be no happy moments. But, the movie will still have some jokes, funny ones to cheer up scenes which are too heart-breaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The seventh installment, the appetiser.","As the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the ""Horcruxes"" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.So this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.New additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!Tension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A stunning, exciting and fast journey","Coming from a huge Potter fan, this film is one of my all time favourites.For me, I felt that this film was a correction on what all of the other films partly missed, I felt there was enough drama, horror and surely, action. The film has beautiful locations and mind-blowing special effects that keep the series still yearning for more (which the second part shall reveal).I felt the acting was perfect, I wish there was more of Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman, but I'm sure they shall both shine in the latter part.I cannot hope but wish that Part 2 is bigger, better and more epic than Part 1, which is just possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As the end draws near...,"""The Ministry of Magic has fallen. The Minister is dead. They are coming.""Even if you weren't familiar with the book that it's based on, you could tell from the very first few minutes of Deathly Hallows that we're speeding toward the final confrontation. The bleak, subdued settings, and the overall dark tone of the visuals and story portray a world in which Voldemort's victory is almost complete, and there is little comfort or hope to be found for our heroes and their allies. Death and danger constantly surround Harry, Hermione, and Ron, as they seek to complete the difficult task that they've been left by a mentor who can no longer guide them. They must stand alone, but the stresses of such an impossible journey makes even depending on each other harder than it's ever been before.The final Harry Potter book was a good one, but it isn't my favorite. Which is why this movie isn't my favorite of the series, either, despite the fact that I think David Yates did a phenomenal job of adapting it to the screen. The decision to make two full-length films from the final book was of course the correct one, as there's simple too much that would have had to have been left out or glossed over with a single film. There still had to be some things left on the cutting room floor, of course, but the absence of these minor scenes don't hurt the movie more than they have in previous installments. The way some events have been streamlined or altered is actually for the better, in my opinion.Now the wait begins for Part 2, and it's not made any easier with the knowledge of how well-executed Part 1 is. This was a movie of smart choices by the filmmakers, from the use of a hand-held camera to give the ""on-the-run"" plot a gritty, realistic intensity, to the way the story ends at the perfect point. Harry Potter is going out with a bang - as he deserves. The best compliment I can give Deathly Hallows Part 1 is that when it ended, I was a little disappointed that the movie was already over. Even after 2+ hours, I wanted to sit and continue on to the second part right then. Fans won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Slow moving, but the Performances are Strong and the Anticipation is Evident,","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's very enjoyable as it builds up our anticipation and excitement for the final film, as we follow Harry, Ron and Hermione journey to destroy the Horcruxes, with many great twists throughout. I did have a problem with the slow moving plot, it lingers on certain points for far too long, we watch a lot of camping and scenes that are basically only people talking, it was good for character development but there does come a time when we start to crave adventure. The cast is fantastic as usual, with everyone seeming to mature and grow just as much as their characters have, Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are given a lot more here in regards to acting that they ever have previously, delivering emotional performances that are at times heart breaking, they have been through a lot together, but we can feel that this the toughest moment in their friendship. Though it may be slow, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is still an exciting movie that will have fans anticipating part 2, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure of fantasy film.Harry, Ron and Hermione begin their journey to destroy the Horcruxes, thus destroying Voldemort's immortality, but many unexpected events disturb their quest.Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pretty Good, Enjoyable for all.","Saw a screening last night, I thought it was good. It has a few laugh out loud moments. There's also a few boring moments where nothing seems to be happening just to build tension I guess.I think the filmmakers intended that the viewers had all read the book recently. I had only read it once, when it first came out, and apparently had forgotten a lot, so there were many parts where I wasn't quite sure what happened or was happening...Also a few bits seem unrealistic.

Bleakest But Most Mature Harry Potter Film Yet!,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the total opposite of what the Sorcerer's Stone was. The young leads are more mature in this film and the film is by far the most dreary and bleakest thanks to great cinematography by Eduardo Serra. The decision to turn Deathly Hallows into two parts is a very wise one.Harry, Ron, and Hermione returns in the seventh installment of the very popular Harry Potter franchise. They head out to hunt down the Horcruxes in order to destroy Voldemort. But while they do that, they must deal with dark forces chasing them, fear for loved ones, and above all each other.Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson deliver their most mature performances yet. As the series progressed, they have increasingly gotten better. One thing I always liked about the Potter films is the large supporting cast and how they manage to be effective. Once again, they were very effective in this film.Overall, this is David Yate's best Harry Potter film to date. The story is constructed well thanks to a tight screenplay by Steve Kloves. This film also tends to be emotional at times especially the beginning scene and several of the final scenes. There are also some welcome character returns from previous installments. All in all, this may be the best Harry Potter film yet. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Overall a good movie, despite the wait for the 2nd installment","As most of the people have, I just returned from the theater and am writing my review. Now lets start out with what I thought was good about the film: 1.The acting is much better than previous movies, especially Emma Watson 2. This movie captures all major details of the book, only leaving very minor things out and changing a few 3.The movie is good at capturing your attention and definitely does not seem as long as the 140 minutes it runs 4. There isn't really anything that inappropriate in this movie, it is only PG-13 because of violence (which isn't even that bad) so you could bring your children if you wished 5. The action scenes are well done. Although sometimes they can be difficult to follow, they still include the suspense you want them to in order to elevate what happens next. And if you cant follow them...it's a book and movie that is largely based on action, why would you be watching it then? 6. Even if you're not the most die-hard Harry Potter fan, you should be able to follow along quite well without even having read the books. (Although I have read all of them, that part is coming from my numerous friends who also saw it) 7. It is difficult to make a movie based off of a book, because people always complain that people who haven't read the book can't follow along, or that people who have see that they've left out details, but with the plot of J.K Rowling combined with the directing of Yates, it works out nicely.And, since every movie has them, the negatives. There aren't too many, and most of these are just minor things, but here they are anyway 1. This movie is long. As I said earlier it is appropriate for most audiences, but younger children,who are generally easier distracted, may get bored despite how interesting the movie is 2. Not really a complaint about the movie itself, but it is sold out almost everywhere, so you may not get to pick your seats. Now I can handle a movie from anywhere in the theater, but if you sit near the front row it may be quite painful to look straight up for 2 hours. And since it is such a large screen you may miss some of the action if you sit too close. But, as I said, this doesn't have anything to do with the actual movie 3. Now a lot of people complained about this and obviously I am going to also. The end is pretty good, they added some extra action to make it more exciting, but no matter how good the ending of a movie is, I doubt you can capture that suspense in your audience for 8 months. And the ending didn't really seem to excite me much, If you've read the book, then you know what is coming and it won't be as exciting.4. Which leads me to my next complaint. Of course I have this one. 8 months? You have to wait that long for part two to come out? By that time most people will have forgotten a lot of what happened in the movie (especially if you didn't read the book) and you will probably have to watch it again on a DVD. Now technically 8 months isn't tooo long to wait, we've waited longer for sequels to movies just as popular, but if it is another part of the movie instead of a separate movie, that is kind of long. But I guess I would rather watch a movie that you had to wait for which is fully complete and good, than a movie that is 3 and a half hours long and so cramped that half of what happens in the book is left out. And this is the last book, so not exactly the time to be leaving out details.Moral of the story? Despite my complaints and the wait, a good movie. Should entertain you for a good 2 hours, and no really major flaws. And besides, complaining about how long part 2 is going to take to come out doesn't have to actually do anything with part 1. So if you want to go see J.K Rowling's great novel in the form of a film, go to the theater...that is if it isn't sold out yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Do people really like this film?! It was so utterly boring!,"After I'd seen the sixt Potter movie, I thought they would improve on the pace in this (part 1) seventh movie. But boy, was I wrong. I was so bored after the very well done beginning of the movie. Voldemort's meeting and the motorcycle chase were very exciting, but then it started again just like in part six...the very very slow scenes about how Harry thinks he's so alone and he and his friends don't know what to do...blablabla. Really, I have to see the second part of the seventh book, just because I have to know how it all ends, but the director is giving me a really hard time. I like the wonderous world of Harry Potter, but not like this. Personally, I think the fourth part was by far the most exciting of the Potter movies. OK, now let's sum up what I liked about this seventh movie: -The beginning (Voldemort's meeting and motorcycle chase) -The overall look of the movie (sets, lighting, etc.) -The Deadly Hallows story sequence -The casting. Helena Bonham Carter is one of my favorite actresses Now, things that I didn't like: -The pace...ow my goodness. And I thought Gone with the Wind was slow or for instance Dr. Zhivago or Signs. -Ron thinking Harry has the hots for Hermione and fighting about it. Jeez...this was so forced. I mean, Harry already knew in the 5th and certainly in the 6th movie that Ron liked Hermione and Harry already had it going with Ginny. This was so stupid and boring. -How many items do they actually need to kill Voldemort. 7 Horcruxes that can be destroyed by a sword and than you also have the 3 Deadly Hallows. My goodness...in a computer game OK...but in a movie?! -When it became clear the neckless was making people angry I wanted to shout: ""Cast the ring into the fires of Mount Doom!"" Damn, this was such a rip-off of Lord of the Rings. -And yeah, there we have it again...all those damn unoriginal references to WW2. As Basil Fawlty would say: ""Don't mention the war!"" -There were so many moments in this movie that it seemed like the story progressed simply by chance. -The introduction of Dobby again and his utterly useless and overemotional death. He dies and the movie tries to make us feel so sad because he was such a lovable and important character...NOT! Maybe in the books, but when you've only seen the movies like I have, Dobby's not really a character that I established an emotional band with during the last six movies. -The movie took itself too serious, but that's probably what the tone of the book is too. A little more wonder and innocence would have been nice. The humor was so scarce. As The Joker said in The Dark Knight: ""Why so serious?!""All in all I just have two words for this movie...too bad! :(",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

the best harry potter movie ever,I though to tell you the truth i though i wouldn't like it... But that changed when i saw the first fifteen minutes of it.. I can't wait to see the second part of it... I loved All the characters and who played them.. I loved wherever it was filmed.. Harry is always the best person in it and his family can sometimes be mean.. I think Hermoine is the best person for the characters because she has a good sense of humor.. I loved Ron and his brothers and how they grew up a lot from the other harry potters.. i like Rons parents a lot and how they are smart and nice to their children.. Dobby is one of the best and awesome elf. I like helen Carter and the person she played she played a good part. Daniel Ratcliff is always the best at harry potter and the way he plays harry potter is always good. I want to see it on DVD to see the special effects to see how they made Voldermort.. I am definitely going to see the second part.. Just to see it and see if its as good as the one i just saw.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deadly Pacing,"I suppose it was inevitable. As J. K. Rowling became a phenomenon her books got less and less editing though they needed it more and more. With the cynical, money-grubbing decision to make two films out of the last book a similar thing has happened. The triangular friendship and love of Ron, Hermione and Harry provides the personal, human tension of the over-all story but we all know that it can't be resolved until the last chapter/reel. The consequence is this movie bloated with empty calories to deprive us of the price of a ticket bought more to say we've seen the whole epic rather than because we've been truly entertained. We get a few loose ends tied up and a brilliant animated sequence telling the back story of the Deathly Hallows. Unfortunately more of the movie than any narrative line can stand consists of the three young people wandering the English countryside to no particular purpose except to pad out the space between opening and closing credits. At best the film is an over-long trailer for the final installment. Poor Harry and his friends haven't been this badly served since the series wisely, thankfully jettisoned director Chris Columbus and his attempts to drag the series down into the hell of Home Alone with witches. The best I can say of this film is that someday, in order to sell more copies of the series, someone may re-cut the films and combine Deathly Hallows Parts I & II into something like a watchable film. I have no confidence in that, however. The fashion is to add scenes that were left on the cutting room floor and, usually, should have made it to the cutting room incinerator. I am a father of the children of the Harry Potter generation and thus once removed from Potter-mania. Still I also have a deep affection for Daniel Radcliffe's and his Harry, Emma Watson and her Hermione and Rupert Grint and his Ron. I have watched them grow as I watched my daughters grow. Thus it's partly out of fatherly affection that I dislike this installment as a great disservice to three young actors who have worked hard and deserved better.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

It All Ends Here,"Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction--the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. (Warner Bros. Pictures)As the WB logo appeared deteriorating before my very eyes, I knew things have changed since the first HP film. Each succeeding HP film has gotten progressively darker as the series is coming to its end. HP7, the first part of the last film, doesn't change the pattern. It's a dark film, literally and figuratively. The film shows blood as if it were nothing and even the cinematography has gone shaky-cam style in some action scenes. However, being part of the last film and all, HP7 doesn't have a lot of action as one might have thought. It's arguably the slowest moving HP film to date and that's equally its main strength and downfall.Having the pace slow down quite a bit hurts the film for the most obvious reason: It meanders, especially in the second act. I actually felt like looking at my watch, which never happened to me before in the previous films. However, the film is still filled with a lot of information. Non-readers will find themselves overwhelmed by the information hurdled at them and even I, who have read the books, felt confused in parts of the film. Ironically, most of the series' best moments are in this film. That's because the slow pace allows for a lot of intimate scenes between the three young actors, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint.These three actors have grown with each passing film and it shows here. I think Watson and Grint were really at the top of their games in this film. Radcliffe, while the weakest, is good too but not as good as the other two. While I'll take intimate scenes between them over action any day, there were just some scenes that were really tedious. Still, that didn't ruin the film for me. It just bothered me. The other cast members don't appear in the film as much, but it's appropriate considering the three main actors are isolated from society. Like the previous HP films, the cinematography and production are gorgeous and the score by newcomer Alexandre Desplat brings in a fresh voice to the franchise.As a fan, I would say this is the most disappointing HP film to date, although that's no way to say the film is bad. It's a good film, but a very flawed one at that mainly due to it's slow pacing. The three actors are as great as ever and the film ends at the perfect point for part two. If you're a HP fan, there's no doubt you'll enjoy this.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Spellbinding - worth it in IMAX, too","Harry Potter's penultimate film journey is an immediate smash, judiciously mixing mythology, romance, teenage lifestyles, lowbrow comedy, adult themes, and nonstop action into a blizzard of entertainment that really could be conjured up only by a wizard who kicked butt in his or her O.W.L. exam. This first-half-of-the-last-book movie is exceptional and suffers only from a weird shift in tone near the middle of the film.If you have never read a Harry Potter book, this is not the movie for you to watch. Please don't watch it. You'll spend most of the movie muttering to whomever is closest, asking who these characters are and what are they doing and why are they flushing themselves down toilets (the better to get into the Ministry, my dear), and so on. Face it; you're quite the Muggle and will have no chance of comprehending this movie.For the rest of you... Well, even if you haven't read the seventh (and final) book, you should be able to follow along. I'll try hard not to spoil anything for you, but some things from the earlier books may creep in, so beware.The movie begins a few days before Harry's 17th birthday, and the Dudley family is leaving their home out of concern for their own safety. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is to be escorted to The Burrow and live with the Weasely family until the school year begins, but he and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have another plan: to find the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which the evil Lord Voldemort has spliced parts of his soul (self preservation, you see).For the first time in the series, the school of Hogwarts doesn't make an appearance. Harry and his pals, under the indirect order of Albus Dumbeldore, need to find these objects before Voldemort gains any more strength; the Dark Lord, of course, is making great headway into running things anyway, what with his Death Eaters and his infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.As with the rest of the books and movies, there are dual plots. There's the obvious line of the search for the remaining Horcruxes, and there's the subtle look at the way the trio is growing up, wary of their feelings for one another. One of the more remarkable aspects of J. K. Rowling's books is that she tries to accurately depict the lives of average teenagers - even if the teenagers themselves aren't average at all. So here, we see Ron and Hermione grudgingly accepting how much each means to the other, which leads to confusing and conflicting feelings on their parts as well. All normal for teenagers, and all well done.A word of caution, if you haven't read the book: good people die. Don't ask me who; I can't tell you. But it's the last book in the series, and there are a lot of secondary and tertiary characters - surely not all of them would be expected to make it, right? Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing their roles for almost a full decade now, and their chemistry is palpable on screen. As usual, they are surrounded by a solid British cast, including Brendan Gleeson (Mad-Eye Moody), David Thewlis (Remus Lupin), Bill Nighy (Rufus Scrimgeour), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). Each plays his or her part with all expected prowess, but rising above all of them is Mrs. Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the nefarious Bellatrix Lestrange with a maniacal glee that borders on pure insanity. Her eye alone has depth.Here's the only part of the entire movie that just didn't work for me. There is a long stretch in which our heroes search valiantly for the Horcruxes, and during that time there's a bit of a disagreement, causing one of them to leave the other two. Afterwards, the way the remaining two behave - in one scene - almost justifies the anger of their departed friend, thus shifting the tone a little bit. This isn't in the book at all, and I found it a bit worrisome. Why muddy the waters? It's complicated enough for the characters without more drama for the sake of drama.The Deathly Hallows, by the way, are magical artifacts, and one of the big questions in the book is whether the three should search for these mythical Hallows or continue to look for the Horcruxes. Doesn't matter much, as they are all intertwined.Eduardo Serra's cinematography is breathtaking, particularly the first battle scene after Harry leaves the Dudley's house and the battles in the forest and at stately Malfoy Manor. Serra replaced Bruno Delbonnel, who reportedly was afraid he'd begin to repeat himself. But no matter, because the film by no means has a different look or feel than the previous entries (except that the subject matter is even darker, of course).If you have read the seventh book, you might wonder how this movie ends; where's a good stopping point? Again, I won't reveal that here, but when you see the movie you'll probably agree that it ends appropriately. I mean, this isn't like Back to the Future II, which was cynically used just to set up III; this is a standalone movie that's really supposed to be in conjunction with a companion movie anyway.As a fan of the Harry Potter books and subsequent movies, I feel that the seventh movie is as outstanding as I expected it would be. Aside from the one strange tonal shift - which is quickly shifted back - there's really very little wrong with this movie, and most people should find it very enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Darker than ever,"Darkness is descending on the world after the death of Dumbledore. Death eaters are everywhere and growing in power. Harry is on the run. He, Hermione, and Ron must find and destroy all the Hocruxes. All the while they must avoid being captured by Voldemort's forces.We are truly descending into darkness. The forces of good are on the run. The three friends are on their own. It was alway going to be this way. All the previous films have been leading up to this.What this movie needs is continuous danger and action. We need the three to be on the run. However for large sections in the middle, they are hiding rather than running. It's not as visually and cinematically exciting. While I understand that changing the story would be unacceptable. It may be better to add the other character's adventures to spice things up. Overall, I like the dark moody tone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Period Drama Slow,"I won't go into the story as there is too damn much to go through and anyone watching this film that has not watched the first 6 is wasting their time anyway.So the first part of the final part is basically the first half of the book. Director David Yates I believe has done a fine job so far, however he must have taken the job of directing the final part of the story on the basis he does as he is told by splitting it in 2 and basically filming the book.What I have liked about the films so far is that they have branched out and cut all the excess fat from the novels and were entertaining. I believe the first two Harry Potters are the weakest of the movies as they simply filmed the whole book. I'm afraid this has what has happened with Deathly Hallows - its a long, long slow boring movie. Almost a period drama in its solemn and serious face.I saw it in the cinema and instantly disliked it - my brother has now bought the blu ray so I gave it another chance and I'm afraid its still as slow and dull as I remember. Important moments like the death of hedwig are simply passed off and the story moves on without a moments tension, drama or emotion. It just feels like it doesn't get out of first gear, the movie is in a trance - you wait for something, anything interesting to happen and it just doesn't.The big mistake was splitting it in two and filming everything that was in the book. If I want all that I'll read it again I don't have to sit through 2 and a half hours of people walking about in a forest and field to get to the end.As I watch the series of Harry Potters now on blu ray this will be the film I get to and think urrghh i have to sit through this to get to the very end. I find that really annoying as so far all the movies are entertaining. Even the first two which I think are quite weak are at least entertaining, Deathly Hallows is not, its very serious, very stoic and very very dull.Having said that the production values and acting are all very good as usual but its just a shame they had to drain every last drop out of the cash cow and almost ruin the series.Well I'm boring myself now so I'll switch off.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I like it!,"At first, I wasn't sure what to think when I heard they were splitting the adaptation into two parts. I mean, who could forget those seemingly never-ending camping scenes from the first half of Deathly Hallows? But after giving it another go, I've really come to see the richness of the story.What really grabs me is how the characters grapple with these enormous expectations weighing them down. And their friendship? It's seriously put to the test through it all but somehow manages to stick it out.I mean, we're talking about everything from pulling off daring heists in government buildings to literally carrying around a piece of Voldemort's soul. And don't even get me started on those surreal moments, like seeing your pals appear as ghostly forms making out while you're wrestling with a sword you found in a random puddle.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is what we have been waiting for,"The Harry Potter series has inspired generations. I grew up with the books and the movies. As I grew, the characters, both fictional and actual actors grew with me. This instillation of the Harry Potter movie series is what I have been waiting for. The growth of the series and the actors is at its most mature and impressive in this movie. The acting has transformed from children playing character to actors transforming into a role. The growth of the performance is extremely astounding and the newest movie will leave any Harry Potter lover satisfied, but even those who are not Harry Potter inclined will be impressed. The way the movie balances the heavy content with humor is so adept and creates the perfect cinematic experience. I am so impressed and excited about the accomplishments of this series.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Didn't live up to expectations,"I missed out on seeing this at the cinemas, and although the experience would have been undeniably better if I had seen it there first as opposed to from my living room sofa, I'm kind of glad that I didn't bother. I have read the books and seen the other films countless times, and even the later, darker ones are still enchanting and heart-warming. This one, however left me completely cold. Most of the film is flat and dull, with none of the charm and detail of the book and as much as I usually love the actors, I didn't feel any connection to the characters. After all the hype and success of the other films, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I was a big disappointment. I can only hope that Part II makes up for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is an absolute gem and a must see,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) is a movie I recently watched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Harry trying to rebound from Lord Voldemort apparently grabbing the upper hand. He hears the story of three children gaining unique powers in a conversation with death and what they receive in the deal being left behind. He looks to seek out these items to help gain an advantage against Lord Voldemort; unfortunately for him, Voldemort is looking for them too.This movie is directed by David Yates (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) and stars Daniel Radcliffe (Horns), Emma Watson (Beauty and the Beast), Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest),
Alan Rickman (Die Hard), Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd) and Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardner).The use of magic in this always does such a great job of capturing the imagination. I liked how it was used initially to hide whom and where Harry Potter was. There's also has some awesome dragons like I've never seen. Dobby was a stud in this and less annoying than the previous movies. The push and pull of good versus evil has a Star Wars feel to it where at times you feel there's no hope for good. The back story of the brothers versus death was fascinating and the ending is brilliant setting up a cant wait finale.Overall this is an absolute gem and a must see. I would score this a strong 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

think of it differently,"This film is not a typical harry potter film, it's very different and more grown up. unlike the past 6 films which follow a similar plot structure, harry doesn't end up going to hogwarts for another school year.

But it stands alone as a great dark thrilling adventure film. Don't compare it to the past films, watch it and enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
scriptwriting vs direction,"A good film basically is composed of certain variables. The main ones , arguably are : Script , Direction and Acting .I haven't read Harry Potter books ( maybe the two first ones a few years back) , but as a human being , my instincts suggest that all the books are fairly of equal good writing and storytelling.Story = Script : All Harry Potter films have more or less equally good script. ( the screenplay writer's work merely affects the actual story-script , written by J.K Rowling) Plus based on the fact that the main cast is the same , and the supporting cast of all films , although a bit different , clearly wasn't the attribute that resulted in the film's quality.The attribute, that in the Harry Potter film franchise mostly affected the film's result is ( and cant be no other ) the direction.The casted directors in all harry potter films are : Chris Columbus , Alfonso Cuaron , Mike Newell, and David Yates.Out of those four directors , the best ones are : Alfonso Cuaron , Mike Newell ( check their filmography for proof).The best Harry Potter films are the films directed by those two directors. The Prisoner of Azkaban and The goblet of fire.Chris Columbus comes third best , and least skilled comes David Yates.Ironically he is the one that was assigned to direct more Harry Potter films than all of the other directors . He directed the 5th , 6th , 7th part one , 7th part two ( coming).The worst director the franchise ever hired , directs 4/8 of harry potter films. (The 6th one was the worst , totally neutral film , no impressions at all ) Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows is not a bad film . i give it a 7/10. What i am trying to state, is that if Alfonso Cuaron ( the best out of the four ) or Mike Newells had directed it, the result would have been much better ; it would have been a solid 8/10 ( i bet it would).An example of David Yates mediocre direction is that in this 7th film , it was as if he didn't want to face "" a hard to shoot- scene"" .The moving building , that appears first in the prisoner of Azkaban ( where a building appears in the middle of two other ones) , the part where the building slowly appears isn't shown on screen. we see two buildings , then the scene is cut , and then we jump the the scene where the third building is already there. As if he was bored to properly direct the film.Mediocre direction + Good script + good acting = 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Intense chapter in the series that sets the stage for the epic finale,"The seventh installment of the Harry Potter series, Deathly Hallows: Part 1, is a darker and more intense chapter in the series that sets the stage for the epic finale. The movie starts off strong with the death of Mad-Eye Moody and the injury to George Weasley during the escape from Privet Drive, immediately pulling you into the chaos and danger of the story.The production quality in this film is outstanding. From the visuals of the Ministry of Magic to the haunting landscapes of their journey, every scene is beautifully crafted. One of the standout sequences is the animated tale of the Deathly Hallows narrated by Hermione. The unique animation style used here adds a fresh visual element that sets this moment apart from anything else in the series. The direction by David Yates is sharp, with a steady balance of action, suspense, and emotional depth, making the slower moments feel just as engaging as the high-energy scenes.A particularly emotional moment in the film is Dobby, delivering a heartfelt moment that left a lasting impact. It's one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the series.The appearance of the silver doe in the forest is another pivotal and mysterious moment. While the film doesn't fully explain its significance, it's a beautifully shot scene that keeps you intrigued and wondering about its meaning. This is a great example of how the film leaves some things open-ended to build anticipation for the conclusion.Overall, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 does an excellent job of diving into the darker, more mature tone of the story while maintaining the magic and wonder of the wizarding world. It's a visually stunning and well-directed film that stands out as one of the most atmospheric and intense entries in the series. The emotional weight and gripping story make it a truly memorable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Seeing an in depth focus on the characters and Harry's descent toward helplessness and doubt towards Dumbledore's intentions and his own intentions for the greater good of the whole wizarding world.This is a movie that reeled me in as a fan, seeing the emotions written in every page of the book brought to life by Steve Kloves' mastery and David Yates' artistry. By the final scene, they leave you unfulfilled (as a predisposed part 1 should) but a with joy nonetheless. One more thing: The Tale of the Three Brothers was great animation, great story telling, and wonderful by itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So boring it hurts my eyes!!!!!!,"Well how do we start?This film contains great values, such as the photography and... the photography... nothing else.This film moves by slow hard taking and non exciting steps. All that happens is you see the main protagonists suffer and wander around for nearly 3 hours!!!! I know fans are expecting a dignifying adaptation to the best selling book, however translating the book to script phrase by phrase was too much.The film falls for other several stuff, starting with the performances, they really don't improve at all and all we get is the same wooden, stiff expressions we've seen since 2001. Then we get the script treatment, it's just a translation from the book! The story is not meant to be two separate films but a 6-hour-long feature (even Peter Jackson handled himself to give each part of LOTR trilogy its own climax). However this joke of a film doesn't care for the development of the argument or anything else. Without part 2 it's nothing but a boring sequence of scenes with no goal at all.I really expected a much more fun film, however this one kicks the bucket. By some hard, well planned edition job they could have saved ourselves more than an hour of boringness (and even one film maybe).All in all, this film is proof that a darker sequel or a faithfully written book adaptation not necessarily give as a result a good movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
David Yates finally nailed it!,"At last the World of Harry Potter comes to real life. You never found this world of Wizards and Witches, the world of J.K. Rowling, as alive as in this movie.

Between all threats, all evil there is a lot of love and humor and the Harry Potter-stuff finally becomes the awesome adventure it always could have been. The great thing about it is, that this great adventure, this thrilling story, this wondrous and fantastic world is carried by real characters and the movie takes it's time for them. There is real drama going on.I don't know how it to watch The Deathly Hallows without knowing the books or movies before it, but I know, that this movie-part was just absolutely satisfying for me.

"""These are dark times, there is no denying""","I've always had a bit of a beef with ""Deathly Hallows,"" the final novel in J.K. Rowling's lucrative franchise. My main issue is that nothing much happened (or, perhaps more accurately, nothing happened that the discerning reader couldn't spot from 100 pages away). Kill off a marginal character here, throw in a Christ allegory there. And don't get me started on that epilogue! Even so, I approached Part 1 of the final cinematic chapter with a mind uncluttered by prejudice or preconception. I've always thought the reins should have been passed onto a new director for each film, but David Yates at least redeemed himself for the rushed 'Order of the Phoenix (2007)' with 'Half Blood Prince (2009),' which chose its tone and then stuck to it.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)' predictably suffers the pitfalls of its source material: namely, that nothing much happened in the first 400 pages of the novel. Because of this, the film feels more like a prologue than a chapter. Yates does an excellent job at establishing the mood, but then fails to do anything with it. Harry broods for a while, Ron gets angry for no apparent reason, Harry briefly dances to a dubiously out-of-place Nick Cave song, and then returns to his brooding. There's an episodic structure to the narrative, but each episode fails to give any overriding sense of achievement (invariably ending with Death Eaters suddenly bursting onto the scene). And why, for that matter, does Yates insist on constantly trying to surprise us? We know the bloody snake is coming back one more time. I don't like waiting around for obvious shock tactics!But good news there is: the actors are all terrific. The three leads can now carry a movie pretty much by themselves, the services of such veterans as Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, and David Thewlis reduced to a mere sidebar. In the absence of Hogwarts, the locations are beautifully chosen, so secluded and serene that it's difficult to believe that the Fourth Reich is breaking out in the wizarding world. So I've been complaining a lot, but overall I enjoyed the film. Aside from a few amateurish flourishes that got my goat, 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is an enjoyable viewing experience, and I await the final installment - without bated breath, but I await it nevertheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Darker With Less Action,"It's the beginning of the end. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a major departure from the previous films. This movie is a lot darker, more violent, and thankfully, scarier than most horror films out nowadays. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are finally seventeen. They are now ready to take Dumbledore's mission to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, which hold his soul. As the trio tries to hunt down all of the Horcruxes, they mature and discover just how much they've grown emotionally and romantically. The numerous scares work thanks to the wonderful visuals, musical score, and cinematography. Like the other Harry Potter films, there are few action scenes, but when present, they are well-choreographed and completely engaging. The characters are further developed, revealing new relationships as well as some intriguing secrets. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson deliver their best performances yet. Each one of them gets their moment to shine and prove why they deserve to have great careers after this franchise ends. The director and screenwriter were terrific in making this film more mature then its predecessors, but several flaws place it below the best of the films (the 3rd, 5th, and 6th in my opinion). Too many awkward scenes are present, and the usual touches of humor are placed in the most inappropriate moments of the film. The plot as a whole will feel tricky and confusing at various points throughout the film because far too much is happening at once. Additionally, the pacing feels a little off. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a solid but uneven penultimate entry to the deservedly popular franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Whole New Level.,"'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' exceeds all expectations, every Harry Potter movie keeps on getting better and better and this film is the current gem of the franchise. It also conveys a very important message at its heart, especially about fascism. We are reminded of all those years ago of when another dastardly figure had quite similar ideas to 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named'. From the very first gravely words spoken by Bill Nighy: ""These are dark times, there's no denying"", we know that we are in for a 'treat'.Brilliantly directed by David Yates (who has had the honour of directing the franchise since 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix') 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is the beginning of the end of an epic adventure and it satisfies its audience with drama, action and some incredibly moving scenes (especially the final act). This 'Harry Potter' is nothing like the previous films, it is darker, more serious and there is the worrying phenomenon of sexual maturity for Harry, Ron and Hermione. The professional use of CGI and breathtakingly beautiful scenes also add to the greatness of the film, I just loved the way that they designed the Malfoy Manor. All of these factors make the whole film an exhilarating ride.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all brilliant, it is amazing to see how much they have grown up and how their acting skills have flourished over the years, they have grown from children to young adults ‚Äì they carry the series with their professional acting. Other famous faces (who are mostly very talented veteran British actors) must not be forgotten, such as Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Brendan Gleeson, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Rhys Ifans, Jason Isaacs, David Thewlis, Julie Walters and many more who have had the honour of appearing in this iconic franchise.However, a special mention must go to the screenwriter: Steve Kloves, who adds a lot of gloom at various points but then surprises us with light humour, which is effectively crafted in a way that it doesn't really distract the viewer from what the grim reality of the situations that Harry, Ron and Hermione are in. Kloves sure knows how to adapt a book into a film and he hasn't made a single mistake with 'Deathly Hallows Pt. 1'.What I was most pleased about 'Deathly Hallows Pt. 1' was the fact that it wasn't in 3D ‚Äì for this format would have entirely ruined the film for me because like some other films which were originally supposed to be in 2D but had 3D incorporated to it in the post-production stage, it would have lowered the brightness and clarity. It is a shame that part. 2 will be in 3D and I fear that it will suffer in brightness and clarity, but let's hope that the traditional Warner Brothers will decide to change their mind like they did with part. 1.4 ¬Ω out of 5 (exceptional) ‚Äì The best Harry Potter to date, and I am sure that this statement will change when part. 2 is released.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Superb and Stunning Chapter,"The Harry Potter series is one of the most faithful I have ever seen, and each film brings something new. Whenever a new film comes out, there is always a certain criticism that a book fan will mention because of certain information or details left out of the film adaptation. Being the final book in the famous wizard series, this would always be the hardest book to adapt, so I was very relieved when it was announced that it would be split into two parts. Some might see this as an attempt to cash in money, but I honestly do not believe it was for that reason. The filmmakers care about this story, and being the finale, they care about adding in character development before the big action-packed finale. So after seeing Part 1, I have the obligation not just to judge it as a film adaptation but also as a film.The opening of the film is perfect for the type of tone it is trying to set. Showing us each of the home lives of the three leads and just how difficult the future will be is a hard fact to behold. The action scenes in the film are pretty impressive, but not overly done and they do not take you out of the real story. David Yates and Steve Kloves have set Part 1 as a character film with action in it, not the other way around. And so it is with the rest of the film. Last Year's Half-Blood Prince proved to me that Yates was the best director that this series ever had. He understands mood and the challenges that the three leads are going through. Part 1 is able to capitalize on that.Each new Harry Potter film is deemed as 'darker' than the previous, and that may be true, but it is not just about how sinister things on screen appear to be. The magical world is at a time where danger lurks around everywhere. We certainly are able to see this on screen, but the real power and the real confrontation as to just how dangerous the world is right now is brought by the quiet moments in the film. Many have said that the middle section of the film, when the three leads begin their camp out, is what weakens the pace. I was surprised by how much this was not true when I watched it. If anything, this section is much needed. It is also powerful because the three leads are able to hold their own very well. Over the years, they have matured and grown as actors, and at this point no one else could do what they are doing. There are certain scenes in the film that, while definitely subtle, are completely powerful and strengthen the characters and express the way they are feeling in a sense of loss. An example is the dance scene between Harry and Hermione, which I thought was perfectly acted by both, especially Watson.Emma Watson has been the most inconsistent throughout the series. She was good as a little kid in the first two, good as a growing teen in the 3rd film, over-dramatic in Goblet of Fire, OK in Order of the Phoenix, and it wasn't until Half-Blood Prince when you could see she was really starting to shine. Well, here she does. While Radcliffe and Grint are very good, there is something electrifying about Watson. People have raved a lot about her performance, and while at times one is cautious not to overpraise a performance, she deserves it. She does not have scenes where in script it would seem as if she has to do something incredible. This is what makes her stand-out in this film. Starting from her first scene in the film, in a very sad and tragic scene in her home, we see her pain and her sadness over to what she has to do. She only has two words that she speaks in this scene, but her facial expressions say it all. She conveys the same powerful subtle expressions throughout the film. There is also another scene involving her and Helena Bonham Carter that she has been praised about, and this was a disappointment. Not that Watson wasn't great, because she certainly was, much more than what was probably required from her, but the scene only lingered on her for short seconds and then it cut away. We could hear Watson's incredible suffering, but I just wish it could have lingered more on her, to feel even more of what she and others like her really have to go through. Watson is incredibly effective and subtle in this film, and for the first time, she gave the best performance in a Harry Potter film, a feat that none of the three leads have ever achieved.A real stand-out of the last HP film, Half Blood Prince, was the cinematography, and while I am not sure whether Part 1 was better shot than that one, it was still pretty impressive. Of course, that is no surprise. The music score also stood-out for me. While it is true that it is not as loud, or even as recurring, as the scores of the last Harry Potter films as in it is not present in a lot of the film, it was still effective. I really hope it gets some nominations. Ultimately, the film was everything I could hope for, and not any major flaws really appeared. The ending I also thought was a good way to end Part 1, contrary to the opinions of most. This was a very effective, carefully paced, and superb beginning to the end.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best one so far,"I have made a point of watching the movies, in order of course, and to say I have been disappointed is an understatement.Now I love fantasy movies and still think The Lord of the Rings Trilogy has yet to be bettered. I have found the HP franchise not good enough given the hype that surrounds them. That said I really quite enjoyed this first part of the final film - Daniel, Rupert and even Emma were so much better in this than the earlier films. The only other one I liked was The Order of the Phoenix even though it was about half an hour too long. The Deathly Hallows Pt 1 is a much more grown up movie and is the better for it. I would say it is even genuinely scary in parts. Daniel Radcliffe in particular is maturing as an actor and has had a difficult job carrying so many movies - if he had been no good then the whole thing would not have worked.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"Due to how the writer chose to end Part One, I was not so interested in seeing Part Two ... I did not return to the theater for the final episode of the Harry Potter series of film. Basically, if the writer would have been writing the story of Bambi, she would have killed off Flower, the skunk ... for which ceased my interest in anything she might do in the future. I sincerely hope that others share my opinion of the way this particular film ended! Basically, it pi$$ed me off big time ... and the DVD's are stored away, never to be watched again! Basically, you don't have a slave set free just to die an unheroic death! You don't kill off this character at all ... it just isn't done! Especially when the character becomes so cherished by one and all, including the audience! To kill off that character is nothing short of being nasty and wicked to the audience! As you can see ... it really played a number on my head, to the point that I would never trust this author again.Second mistake ... which has to do with the cutting of the film, and not the writer. A scene was removed from the movie that should not have been! At the beginning, when Harry's Uncle, Aunt, and the brat are escaping by moving away ... the kid was suppose to approach Harry and basically make amends for all that he did to Harry ... the scene was cut, and it should not have been! The reason it should not have been is that the scene reinforced the fact that we need not be as our parents are ... we can be better! Cutting that out was a huge mistake! Well, there you have it ... I found this movie to be a huge disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quite good,"While the producers decided to cut the film based on the last Harry Potter novel into two parts as to maximize the revenue they could extract from the franchise, which has become the most lucrative film franchise of the last decades, the films that they made based on these two halves were quite good. They certainly weren't great films, unlike the Lord of the Rings, which was a truly great masterpiece of fantasy novel adapted into film. These Harry Potter films were competent but not masterpieces in any way shape of form.There was also the problem of the main actors being a bit too old to portrait teenagers and thus it shows that they had to shave every half an hour and put some makeup over the shade of the beard.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit slow for such a good story,As they split the book into a 2 parter movie set-up it seems they could have developed this a good bit more than they actually did. The first part gets a bit lost and wander-y. And the second part overdoes the action to the point of headache inducement for some and irritation or distraction for some. There was such great material to work with....,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Random Series of Forests,"Completely lacking in imagination, storytelling, and cinematography, this is the worst I have seen in the series.Aside from the first 15 and last 15 minutes, The Hallows is the most boring and badly presented to date. I understand character development and a sub story was going on during this portion, but it is so blatantly spoon fed and boring it was borderline offensive. Characters should be developed by following them through a story, not by stopping (or slowing) the story to develop the character!As for audience appeal I can say only this: being a PG-13 movie with such dark and sexual overtones the dialog and presentation feels aimed at the intellect of a 6 year old audience.Further, the way that characters just hop in and out of scenes, unannounced, and unexplained ruined most every major action sequence for me.The three main characters can't ever figure anything out on their own or spot obvious traps. They just dumbly wander from dangerous situation to the next while trying not to unravel simple clues. They are constantly bailed out by random characters showing up at just the right random time and place. I didn't read this book, but I have read a few, and the author seems to describe the situations and traps as subtle and tricky. The director failed at this concept completely.They should not have split this into two movies, and I honestly hope, when I watch part 2 at home, the director pulls his production team, editing, and writing together for something that makes sense and serves to fill more then just time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent... but may cause drowsiness.,"Although the story is spread out across 2 films, significant changes have been made to give the film better flow. These rewrites are much appreciated and stay as true as they can to the books, however these efforts are undercut by some really shoddy editing and some questionable calls from the director.This Harry Potter sequel is the most classically British, meaning most of the dialog has been replaced by meaningful looks held for far too long. One can't help but wonder why some scenes drag on forever while other bits were cut out entirely. There were a few points in the movie where I asked myself, ""Where did that come from? How did they get there?"" Of course I can figure it out and fill in the blanks with my own imagination, but HP-DH1 forces you to do it so often, the audience deserves an IMDb credit.Visually, this film is very well done. It's clear Harry Potter was intended for 3D, but the missing technology isn't missed at all. The graphics and effects are great, even without the glasses. While there are a few very typical 3D shots, like panning across computer generated landscapes and things jumping at the camera, it avoids being distracting and even enhances the scenes in some cases.The books get darker as Harry gets older and The Deathly Hallows Part I matches the intensity readers are expecting. There are moments of levity (and laughably ridiculous moments of bad acting and trying too hard), but for the most part the film maintains its serious tone throughout. Most of the Harry Potter films have felt like really long trailers for the next movie, but surprisingly Part I of II stands on it's own in a way the other films have not (except maybe the first one). You know a second part is coming, but a clear line has been drawn in the story and they're careful not to indicate TOO much.Overall, The Deathly Hallows Part I is one of the better Harry Potter movies and fans of the book will surely love how this story is told on film. Be warned, however- may cause drowsiness. Kids could have a hard time getting through the whole thing with their eyes open.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good film,"Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows Part 1 is part of the epic finale of the 2001 franchise about a boy who happens to be a wizard. This time around and Voldermort(Ralph Fiennes)wants Harry Potter dead and so there is deadly hallows lurking around. Its up to Harry,Ron and Hermoine to destroy them once and for all and get rid of this necklace that makes a user jealous(as Ron gets jealous of Harry and Hermoine bonding). Overall the effects are very good and the acting is decent. This was the film(well franchise I should say) that introduced me to Emma Watson. She will always be Hermoine Granger no matter what other film she is in(Beauty & The Beast was very good btw).Overall if you are a fan of the franchise I say check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
GREAT Movie,"I was thoroughly excited at a new film despite the fact that the last 3 instalments of the series were, at best, disappointments. Potter fans want Potter films of the book. The apparent Hollywood imperative of making movies somewhat different from the books has pervaded the last attempts at adaptation of J.K. Rowlings masterpieces. The last one was mostly a love story between Ron and Hermione, which was, at best, a sideline of the books. Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that most books, if truly transferred to film, would likely result in exceedingly long movies, movies such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" managed it quite nicely. It is clear that there are going to be things left out. But one would imagine that writers and directors would be somewhat more careful in the surgery than they had been with ""Goblet of Fire"", ""Half-Blood Prince"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"". I walked into the theatre with anticipation. I walked out satisfied. The reality is that they did have to cut things out. There likely could have been a few more minutes added to keep some of the cuts in, though I suppose that everyone will have their own ideas as to what should have been put back. But the most important aspects of the story and books remained in the movie. There were lots of smiles, lots of laughs and lots of jumps too. The villains were villainous, the heroes heroic. Harry Potter fans will know precisely what is going on. Those who have not read the books may be confused or unable to follow what is happening or why. But, as a Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed it immensely. It was, in my view, far better than several of the previous instalments and is at least as good as the first two movies directed by Tim Burton. When J.K. Rowling says ""he got it"" when talking about the directors interpretation, I can finally think that she isn't just supporting the studio who has added to her fortune.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly  Disappointing!,"I went to watch this movie in the cinemas the first day it came out, and i was very much looking forward to it. Sadly i was a little bit disappointed by the outcome. I thought the film dragged on a bit too much and it didn't really engage me as much as the previous films. I think the camping with Harry,Ron and Hermione went on for too long. Although there was some good action in it. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's a bad movie however it certainly was one of the weaker ones. The acting was very good and it was another dark movie. The ending of part 1 i found very weak and not thought out, They could of ended it a lot better, I felt the film was a little bit rushed and not very accurate.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, evil and magic. The seventh part.","How would you not want to, but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - The most awaited film premieres in 2010. Beginning were only waiting for the true film fans, and the usual audience had no idea that he would soon find himself in the fascinating world of dreams. Shrek's waited all this and would like the final, but even the most devoted fans wanted to see exactly Potter. And Harry was one competitor in this unequal war, but the Twilight that time had a crowd of anti-fans, and, frankly, the film failed. Oh yeah, by the way half of all those special women not so long ago fanatic from the boy in the glasses, hence the conclusion: all waiting for Potter. To laugh, to surprise, to pass the evening to see half-naked Radcliffe. In general, the reasons are many - the movie alone. And this movie before you.The entire saga of a simple boy started perfectly with children's books and stories. There was no drama, at least it was not so noticeable. If Harry and was sad that only parents, but the universal problem not his concern. Anyone he did not like, but no one, and not hated. But he grew up and grew older. It is true that Harry himself to younger actors playing his role and gives here is not a game, a trivial features of male face. By the way, and Hermione something prettier from film to film. And Ron and all the boy-bull. Overgrown, unshaven. But it's not in it, and that the final part would have to show us the drama. And all this was going.Titled book shows us the real drama. It had everything: from human relations to the great battles outlined. And a thorough study of Nutra characters and love heroes. And anyway, there was a lot of things are mixed, but it's not about the book and the movie, which is sounding name - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Idea to divide the book into two parts, liking a lot. And it is not surprising, since previous screening was blamed for their dissimilarity with the original text. But here, we got what we wanted, though the book was not divided evenly. The second part promises mere unbridled epic and beautiful effect, but now everything is on the first part.Of the plot do not want to say, because those 20-plus chapters transferred appallingly-apocryphal. Yes, the reason of all - desire for money. It is no secret that the drama Yates did just action. There is no dramatic images of the main characters, and quarrels as if from scratch. Love line Hermione and Ron all of a sudden disappeared and never appeared. Frequent displeasure Dumbledore gave way to dry a pair of similar phrases that have only a trivial sense, like: ""Oh, how it's bad that we did not say anything."" About Rita Skitter and its articles of speech is not at all, but in fact they forced to question the clean white mag. Many times povycherkival quite ugly. For example, a conversation Dudley and Harry in the book truly makes you think, but here it is not at all. The Ministry of Magic at a wedding in the beginning of the story, talk about stick and krestrazha, uncertainty about the pop Harry Deathly Hallows, and finally, loving languor of Jeannie - it is all or none, or shown ugly-honest. No drama at all, but all show reduced fine words and disaffected persons heroes.Well they showed their faces? Not to say that much, but Ron does not look at the age of eighteen and believe in what he became so evil simply can not, because in the book, this process took, if not half of the book, the couple heads for sure. Blame the actors in it, but do not even pulled the film. Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes - two real genius. That they should praise and love. They did this picture of a beautiful and vibrant, thanks to its superb, amazing game. Another good Bill Nighy in the image of Rufus Scrimgeour, but very sorry that it so early was killed.The entire film is like the only one - then, as the plot. It looks good and looks stylistically-perfect. Dark colors, dark music. Echoes of humor almost everywhere, but laughter can bring only seven Potters In all other important points erased and nothing but a dance tent, a separate thank you very much. It was excellent, to the point and most importantly - moving to madness.Yes, as a film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - not the best option, but as just a film - excellent beautiful, bright sight. Partly, of course, is not all clear, and those who read the book (I, incidentally, one of them) are likely to watch this movie out of curiosity and rejoice for the fact that the saga will end is not so. I recommend watching, not reading books, and walked seven films in a row. The effect is guaranteed. But fans of this wonderful story about a simple guy with a funny round glasses I wish only that the wait is not as long, and that Yates will consist of 10-15 chapters present a feast of visual, stylistic and conceptual ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a bore,"I'm not a Harry Potter fan and I've never read the books, but I have seen all the movies up to now and have been following the unfolding plot. Bear in mind, this is a review of the movie, not the book.I saw two movies this week, the low budget ""Monsters"" and the big budget Harry Potter sequel, and I'm not sure which one bored me the most. I think I spent more time looking at my watch with Harry Potter. The middle part where they jumped all over the place & spent nights in their tent could have been greatly shortened. The information I needed to carry me into the finale could have been covered in 15 minutes. This did not need to be a two part movie. This was clearly just dragging it out into two episodes for profit purposes.This was also a very dark & violent movie. Lots of blood, lots of killing. I don't have children, but if I did, I wouldn't let them see this movie.Seeing the current rating of 8.3 at this writing, obviously there are two versions of this movie out and my theater was playing the bad version.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical Cinematic Masterpiece,"I lost the perception that I was sitting in a chair in a theater, riveted to the screen. 10 out of 10. A rarity...in which state of the art special effects are actually complemented with solid effortless acting. No wonder...the cream of unmatched British thespians are in control of this franchise, which in any other case would have simply been a sterile FX romp. What a once in a lifetime opportunity for the film industry to pull of a success like this. It doesn't matter if the screenplay leaves out significant parts of the original book. The film stands firmly on its own merit. And what a feather in Warner's cap to have this one in its vaults. What creativity and film magic. It makes me want to drop everything and go to film school. There has been nothing remotely like this film. A masterpiece right out of the blue...like magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Didn't like it much...and here's why.,"Disclaimers: First off, I haven't read the books and don't plan to either. So, yes I may point out things that may have made more sense if I had. But, like Ebert, I like to review the movie as a single entity, by itself.Secondly, I can answer some of my own question by saying ""Yes, this is a prequel to the main, movie, which will be Part 2."" That offers some conciliation but not too much, no.Overall the movie was boring. Long and boring (please see disclaimer #2). Acting has gotten a little better so has the script. There were a couple of ""action"" moments but alas not enough to carry the movie.Another gripe I had was because of their accents, MOST of the names (places and people) they were saying were completely unintelligible.

Dark atmosphere better than others.,"I think it is much better than the other Harry Potter films and reflects the events better. I found the second episode slower and less complete. It didn't make much of an impact. The course of the first episode was more interesting. It has a dark atmosphere and it's obvious that the characters fit their roles very well. It's one of those movies that is extremely long, but it doesn't get boring because the story is lively. It goes beyond being just a production for children. Excitement and action contribute to this. There has never been a Harry Potter movie this emotionally charged until this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Acting, special-effects and crucially the storyline were all probably better than ever.

'No, really?', I thought. 'Why not try meandering some more.""There is some spectacle, but it was entirely meaningless to me as a humble muggle-hugger, but I'm sure it will be good for the fans.I'm assured that it is quite faithful to the book which also meandered and, if you enjoyed the book, you will probably enjoy the film.That said.

I never thought it could still get this much better! Best in the series and my favorite of all times,"As it is obvious from reading my review title, i am a huge Harry Potter fan and i have been since its inception. I have loved all the books and all of the films (yes, i have, but there's no doubt i like some more than others)and have gotten impressed with how good the films became in Yates hands (i loved Newell, but Yates is my top choice right up cuaron). The fifth one was amazing even with all the material that had to be cut, and Half Blood Prince turned out my favorite film not only in the series but in the whole world (and i do watch a lot of good films, but nothing can beat my love for HP).Taking all that into consideration and also considering that my favorite book was Deathly Hallows and that i've been waiting on every HP fan page for the last year and a half, this film: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 completely exceeded perfectly my expectations and topped them by a million times. There was not a minute of the film i did not love seriously, and i just cant get over the shock of the film.There are uncountable reasons why this film quickly became my favorite. First of, i think that splitting the last book in two parts was the best idea EVER, and i actually think we all win, and furthermore, we all won. The filmmakers will make much more money and all the fans all over the world will be much happier and much less disappointed with the films because they would be able to include much more from the grand and epic finale. And i think I'm not the only one when i say that that's exactly what happened. It is my favorite film not only because it's incredibly true to the first half of the book, but because it was done perfectly well in my opinion. Im definitely going to see it 3 or 4 times more because it was really amazing, so that's where the filmmakers win. But i want to make clear that it is impossible that the filmmakers made such a nice film if they didn't care of the fans, so not only do they care of the cash but of the fans as well, which is an honor. I loved from the beginning to end. So if you have sticked with my review, you can see that i LOVED the film like few other things, and believe it or not, it wasn't just only because i am a huge potter fan, but because the film was incredibly done: the cinematography was superb (congratulations Eduardo Serra, you nailed the landscapes and the whole angles throughout the film, bravo), the editing was pretty good (even though i know your hate for mark day), the score was pretty nice fitting (i still prefer hooper's HBP and Williams POA, but it is my third favorite and it was incredible. Desplat you did great, and if it is true you are already on board for part 2, I'm very happy, even though i cant deny i would have loved Williams), the visual effects were perhaps the best in the series (and i believe this time they can get the Oscar for that), the acting from the trio is undoubtedly THE BEST IN THE SERIES, they totally stepped up their game and just acted amazingly throughout the film; the adult cast was amazing as usual, and i loved Ralph's performance more than before, and i loved Rhys ifans and the guy who play mundungus, and Toby Jones, and however briefly snape, and Helena and pretty much everyone, but i want to congratulate hugely to Rupert and Emma (especially Rupert who was also hilarious) for their amazing performance... The sets were great (nicely done Stuart Craig), the costumes, make up, SCRIPT (congratulations Kloves) were incredible, but most of all i want to congratulate Yates, who gave a more than superb directing, not only being hugely HUGELY faithful to the book, but making the story flow in an amazing way. I simply cant imagine any other director doing these last films, and I'm happy as hell you are doing them. So as you can see, both fan review and movie review, i loved the movie, and i have no doubt is one of my favorites in the world (again, i watch tons of good film, but HP is unbeatable for me). I know this review is hugely long but it is because i loved the film and i cant stop saying so. I actually thought it would be hard to top Half blood prince, but hell it did.... Yates just keeps getting better and better. So once again, thank you filmmakers (especially Yates) for making this perfect film for me and i guess for may others out there. But thank you JK Rowling for creating such a master book in which they could make this awesome film. I recommend it with all my heart and my passion of films. The non readers will love it for how amazingly paced it is and the story, and the readers believe me that you wont be disappointed AT ALL with the film and it might become your favorite. I know it is a huge shot, but i can see this film getting a good shot with technical awards at the Oscars, and maybe a nom for best film. 10/10. Just a perfect film. And needless to say how excited i am for part 2, and how devastating it will be when it is all over.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Real movie for fans is to see for 45 times! No impression! Moments of movie were exciting, filled with music but as a whole movie I'd say it was boring! Harry Potter wasn't supposed to be boring! All the books are masterpiece written like once in a while! And not to mention differences between book and movie. It's normal to see abnormalities, but so many? Like I was watching whole new story!

"Worth Watching - Best only to ""Sorceror's Stone""","As the film progressed, the storyline got better. However, just like the last few Potter films, the beginning seems abrupt as if the viewer just jumped into the middle of a scene without proper introduction. Granted, I have not read any of the novels with the exception of the first, however, I shouldn't have to have read the books to have a clear beginning, should I? My main complaint about the Harry Potter films in general is the lack of good character development of the emotions between Harry and Hermoine. Each of the characters seems disconnected from one another, particularly the three main ones. This is totally unacceptable. Characterization can make or break a film. The feelings the characters have toward one another must be depicted and fully explored. I realize I haven't addressed much about the plot but the editing, sound, and scene development are all superb. I look forward to the final installment. The franchise will be missed, indeed. One final comment: there are aspects of dialog not heard that are shown in closed captions. I highly recommend viewing this film with closed captions turned on.

Not only has it been my favorite Harry Potter movie and was able to surpass HBP (which I thought was very hard), but it has been my favorite movie of all time. Like all harry potter movies have been, but this one was just¬Ö. Incredible.As you can see, I'm a huge fan of the movies, but let me point out I'm a bigger fan of the books, and Deathly Hallows was my favorite by far. So I guess that it didn't come as a surprise that this movie was my favorite.But let's clear something: a huge fan I may be, but I'm not a crazy fan who'll just put 10 to every hp movie, regardless of what's in it. I like movies in general, all sorts (yes, I've seen the godfather and a lot of others critically praised movies, so I have references).Now, DH1. Before I begin, I'm gonna have to admit that it took a second viewing for me to fully appreciate it. And even though that, I could tell the movie was amazing and that I'd really liked it. But in my second viewing I just admired everything. And that's what's gonna happen every time I watch it again.First of, the acting was top-notch this time, better than ever. The older cast, as usual, was incredible, but it is of the trio I'm talking about right now. Even though OOTP and HBP had showed us that these guys had supreme talent, it is in this one that we see they're excellent actors. Dan Radcliffe makes every scene his own, and makes us laugh and gasp and cry if he wants to. His transmission of emotion when a certain character dies is breathtaking. Emma Watson steps up her game incredibly, and we can see that the exaggeration of the eyebrows is way in the past. It is one specific torture scene that shows she's grown into an incredible actress. And well¬Ö Rupert Grint. He steals every scene he's in, and we can finally see another side of Ron, a scary in a good way side. There is a certain fighting scene or a locket scene in which he is just perfect. And Toby Jones as Dobby is totally worth mentioning.I think it's time to say that this is the best adaptation yet. I can separate book from movie, because they're different mediums. But in DH1, it's like you didn't even have to. Attention to detail was impressive, and almost every part of the books was there. Did there had to be cuts and additions? Yes. But the final project was so epic that, even though in the first viewing I noticed some changes, in the second viewing I just forgot about it. So (as usual, I might add, but better than ever) I congratulate Steve Kloves for his script. It was incredible, and I think there'll hardly be disappointments this time from book purists. The only thing was Dumbledore's past, but that's like another book, and a couple of scenes which I'm happy with now.The visual effects were top-notch. Every single scene that needed them handled them perfectly, and I'm proud to say that, even though there was a lot of action in the movie, the visuals were there to help the story, not to replace it. It was amazing: the house elves were admirable, the seven potters was just perfect, so was Bathilda (and terrifying, by the way), the locket scene, Malfoy manor, and so much more. Tim Burke and his crew did an amazing work, and if the Oscars have some credibility by now, it should totally win or at least get a nomination.The score was amazing. In my first viewing I was kind of disappointed, but I know better now. It had to be discrete, not very loud, and had to capture the tension of the movie at all times. It achieved that and more. Even though Hooper's HBP and William's SS remain my favorite, Desplat worthily made it to my top 3. All I can say is that I can't wait to hear his score for the final hp movie.The cinematography was amazing by Eduardo Serra, showing us very beautiful landscapes and still making us see the tension. As Delbonnel didn't win, he should.Stuart Craig did just amazing as production designer, everything was so detailed and like the book. I have to admit I imagined a lot of the sets just like that in the book. He deserves a nomination too, and, in my opinion, he deserves to finally win.Yet my biggest congratulations go to David Yates, his direction was as best as ever, improving the actors, enhancing the visuals, camera and score and costume and everything, and keeping a great pace with laughs, sobs and gasps. I totally disagree with the critic's opinion about slow tent scenes because, actually, the movie is so great that you feel they were 20 minutes. Yates captured the feel of the book perfectly. IMO, it's lucky that we have him, and I just can't wait to see how he ends the series, because I know it'll be brilliant just as he has done in OOTP, more in HBP and definitely in DH1. And well, how could this movie have gone wrong with such and amazing cast, crew¬Ö and most of all, story. Jo Rowling gave us the best book ever, and its first half adaptation lived to its expectation. So it's all thanks to Jo, who by the way, made a terrific producer too.So I can't wait to watch it again, and I can't wait (sad as it may be) to see the last movie. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter & The World's Longest Camping Trip,"You can't really critique these films. They are more than films. They are visual translations of a cultural phenomenon. They just can't be judged on their cinematic merit alone. I haven't read the books and have no desire to. I have, however, seen all the films. In this (half) film I missed some of my favorite profs from previous outings, especially Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon (who is seen but hardly figures). The villains are really the juice of this final chapter, with Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, and Alan Rickman chewing the scenery in grand style. At one point I wanted to dub this film ""Harry Potter and the World's Longest Camping Trip"". Enough with the teen angst already. Although the impromptu dance sequence between Harry and Hermione is perhaps the film's one touch of humanity - giving the duo a rare moment to be kids, and not muggledom and magic's 'last great hope'. Dobby, too, is in rare form, with his CG denouement played out to perfection. But greed got the better of the studio and led them to stretch a single novel into two films. I would have preferred it had they left on a high note and let us experience Harry's last stand in one fell swoop, but the fans won't mind - like the film itself, it just prolongs the inevitable ending of a cultural icon.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Both a Triumph and a Failure in Some Ways...,"This is not a film propelled by its plot. Plot, specifically, is its central weakness.Probably its greatest strength is the cinematography. Its a visually gorgeous film in every way possible. The house elves look better than they ever have, the weird inky trails the Death Eaters leave as they fly is even better looking than in any previous film.And, of course, the characters, as should be, are the focus. It is hard to write an entirely fair critique having read the books, but the characters continue to reveal their complexities and their weaknesses. All around, they continue to gain depth.But, to delve into this film's weaker point, one must look at it as a standalone film, which is what it tries to be, and succeeds on some levels, but fails on others.Unfortunately, it very much feels like the first half of a story. There is no resolution, which is not problematic in itself, except for the fact that a good deal of the film feels stalled in the woods. This is by far the slowest of the films, and the least spectacular in the literal sense of the word. The magic is not gone, nor is the humor, which, honestly, is handled very well considering the dark overtones. However, we spend a good deal of the film hanging out, aimlessly, in the woods.Aimlessness is exactly the problem, and its a frustration that is supposed to be shared between the characters and the audience, but it wavers quite dangerously over a line called ""tedium."" And some of the film does begin to feel tedious, as if we're only stuck in certain scenes because that's what has to happen on screen in order to get to the next thing. I noticed a certain relief in my theater when something funny happened, as if everyone was thinking, ""Alright, something finally happened."" Like they were a little too eager to laugh, and needed something, anything, to keep their attention on the screen.Of course, this seems nitpicky, but considering that the story here is meant to garner interest, and to increase the tension, and that it gets a little tiresome before the end credits roll, something is clearly not working as it should.Yet, considering that this is practically spot-on with the first half of the book, it's hard not to have sympathy for the production team. Whatever problems the book had, so too does the movie have, and for fans that is going to seem great, but the movie still does not move in an entirely satisfactory way.This is to be fairly expected, and for someone unfamiliar with the story, I imagine it must leave one waiting tensely for the next installment.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I Recommend It,"Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, Now You See Me 2), Hermione (Emma Watson, Beauty and the Beast) and Ron (Rupert Grint, Driving Lessons) return to go out on their last adventure to stop the dark lord, Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, The Grand Budapest Hotel), which leads them to destroy the remaining Horcruxes while being on the run from the magical community. The First part of the Deathly Hallows movies works beautifully as a normal movie while being a fine addition to the Harry Potter movie series, though the movie changes the tone of the series dramatically as if the Goblet of Fire didn't do that enough. The movie does cram a lot into its running time, end in a cliffhanger and rely upon coincidences quite a bit but still manages to be a good movie because of the amazing acting and writing, making it a highly recommended movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thus far my favorite Harry Potter adaptation,"I haven't always been kind to the film adaptations of the Harry Potter books because they always seemed to be missing something. J.K. Rowling created a world on the page that was robust and alive, populated by dozens of interesting characters and wondrous things to behold. The movies, mainly after the second installment seemed to miss the point. They always felt like Cliff Notes summaries. That's a complaint I've had with this series for about the last four installments. Yet, here we are at the end and at last they've gotten it absolutely right. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is the beginning of the end, the top half of a two-part finale that concludes in July. This is the best installment of the series, in my opinion, and the truest to Rowling's vision. Harry's destiny has been looming all along through some admittedly tiresome fore-bearings and now those portents of doom finally come to a head.This film finds Harry being hunted by the evil Voldemort and his Death Eaters who know that the moment the lad turns 18, his protection spell will be lifted and he will be fair game. Some of Harry's professor's attempt to help him escape when an ambush is sprung that sends Harry, Ron and Hermione on the lam. The trio's flight from Voldemort, and the now-corrupt Ministry of Magic, makes up the bulk of the movie as they try and obtain the horcruxes, objects that contain various pieces of the dark lord's blackened soul.They set off across the English countryside never fully aware of who they can trust. The scenes outdoors (there are no scenes at Hogwarts) leave time for a surprising amount of character development especially in the now strained relationship between Harry and Ron. Outwardly, Ron is worried that Harry is endangering in his family - inside, he fears that Harry is winning Hermione's heart. What comes of that conflict is something that has been missing from his series all along: these three young actors that we've watched grow up since childhood - Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - are finally given room to act. Their performances are compelling. They are angry, frustrated, tired, hungry and scared out of their wits. They play each note just right. Grint plays Ron with an undercurrent of bitterness. Watson began her performance as a bookworm but has now become the logic center. Radcliff maintains his performance with a perfect heir of dread and melancholy.Those performances are the foreground of a movie that is beautifully produced. Director David Yates and his cinematographer Eduardo Serra (who shot Blood Diamond and Unbreakable) match the story's grim tone by keeping the skies eternally overcast and the landscape fore-bidding and lonely at the same time. This film, unlike previous installments, has a heavy tone that owes more to The Lord of the Rings. This time they aren't content with just a press stamp copy of the books. They really make the story come alive especially in moments when we think the trio is safe but then the trap is sprung. There are visual tricks here that I didn't expect, most delight is a breathtaking, and oddly beautiful, animated sequence told in shadow as Hermione reads the story of The Deathly Hallows.There is a sense of melancholy that sets in with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I and not all of it has to do with Harry's fate. In a way, we sense the closing of an era. These are characters that we have come to love, that we've watched grow up and now they head into their final battle and their destiny. We know that Part II will focus mainly on tying up loose ends (I hope it will be more than that) but if the bottom half of this finale is as compelling as the top, we're in for a very wonderful send-off.***1/2 (of four)",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Read it before you watch it!,"Saw the first show along with my wife who never read any of the Potter series but was infected with my enthusiasm for the first day's show. Throughout the movie I could not stop thinking how she would be feeling as it is impossible to appreciate any scene if you have not read the books. There is where LOTR triumphs.The movie itself was well made but fails to deliver every time you are expecting a great scene (for those who read the book). Only the 2 min anime sequence is worthy of a mention. Otherwise it feels a bit stretched and the best part of the Potter book is now left for the sequel. In summary, consider it as a 2.5 hour long teaser for the movie coming June 2011",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Finally I care,"I've never cared for Harry Potter even after seeing all of the other films at the cinema but in this one I actually cared about the characters. I loved the slow-paced mystery/adventure road movie style and it's great character development. Finally the acting was properly believable, not that they weren't good before. All of them, Daniel, Rupert and Emma are the best actors for the roles but in this one they finally shined.Most people will say this is their favourite because of it being the latest one, but this is my favourite because I actually cared for the characters.I loved the directing in this film, sound effects and editing. If I was part of the BAFTAs or Academy Awards or Golden Globes then I would nominated this for Best Picture.Like it says on here the film is ""emotionally satisfying"". And it is.

sucks,"This doesn't make me want to see part II. It just drags on forever, very slow. At least an hour of this should have been left on the editing room floor. By far the worst of the series so far. I need 10 lines to be able to submit this, so let me just say, save your money. There is nothing about this one that needs to be seen in a theater. There was two and a half hours of my life I wish I had back! Not a good movie. Moves along like watching paint dry.

Slow Good but Greedy Move,"Another Harry Potter movie which is definitely much better than the book! No offence to Ms. Rowling but her writing since the Goblet of Fire, lost its heat. The Deathly Hallows is a movie which should not have had another part. Its a money move by the producers which makes an otherwise good movie into a waste of time. The gore factor has been increased with also in increased dark-nature to the movie line. The movie's first half seemed like it was there just to fill in the 146 minutes of Runtime and it was horrendously boring. If this wasn't a money train people would've easily made the movie into 1 part. The acting as usual is beyond sucky, with no expressions other than 0.o by all the actors except for Ralph Fiennes. One time watch in your Cinema hall. I wouldn't recommend the 3D version as the normal one gives one a headache as itself. Fanboys need to look at the movie without bias.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter Review,"I just got home from the official worldwide premier of the new Harry Potter movie. Overall the movie was great it had a good flow to it, you become attached to the characters and the mystical world they live in, the story has a lot of excitement to it and there is always something interesting going on. I have read all the Harry Potter books and this interpretation of the 7th and final book is very accurate and does not leave out any major detail,I know that a lot of people are upset that Warner Bros. decided to make this final book into two separate movies but maybe its better this way, it allows the viewers to get the most detail of what happens in the book, and it allows the filmmakers to express the most detail of the final chapter of the Harry Potter series.Overall I really enjoyed the movie, it has a runtime of about 145mins but I went into the theatre and it felt like the movie was about 20min long. I would encourage anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter series to not hesitate, and go watch this movie and not wait until it finally releases on DVD. Overall rating 9/10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Like a Good Wine, Harry Potter Gets Better with Age","The unique thing about the Harry Potter is that unlike most movies things it has had a chance to evolve. Very rarely will you see Hollywood take such great pains to maintain such a momentum as it has with this series. Perhaps because HP is just so huge, and the novels just so perfect, that to get it wrong would be crime against nature. Because of this we get characters and a story that grows up with us, from the awkward but pleasant freshman years, through Cuaron's dark, coming-of-age masterpiece, and on to this solid penultimate chapterPart 1 of Deathly Hallows is not perfect. It has the same flaws any other movie adapted from a book does--too much material and two little time to include it all. Thankfully the decision to split the last book in half paid off because the pacing doesn't seem nearly as rushed as the others. David Yates, who has had time to hone his Potter craftsmanship, has taken the best of the series' drama, fear, suspense, and humor and fashioned it into something very enjoyable. But with this one the stakes are so high and impending doom so pervasive, that it becomes obvious that you aren't watching a children's fantasy anymore. The kids have to safe, whimsical Hogwarts to return to. Instead they are lost out in the open world amongst unsympathetic Muggles and a wizarding world that has become completely treacherous.Aiding this gritty realism is the closer attention paid to the psyche of Potter trinity (Harry, Ron, and Hermione). After a chaotic, violent first half-hour Harry, Ron, and Hermione go into lonely exile where they are confronted with possibly the scariest monster we've seen in HP thus far: powerlessness and hopelessness. Frustrated and powerless, the trio spends weeks walking in the English wilderness, listening for their loved ones' names as the radio reports the newly-murdered. At the same time the heroes are forced to confront the weaknesses of their very friendship, so much more poignantly laid bare in wasteland than it was amongst the hormonal chatter of the teens back at Hogwarts.This is not to say that the other characters do not shine with nuance and charisma in the limited screen time they are given. Newbies Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour and Peter Mullen as the Death Eater Yaxley are particularly efficient with their few minutes, not to mention Potter alum Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge.But despite having the same magic of the other films, Deathly Hallows Part I is where the series finally matures.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Was Based on the Book???,"It seems as if the screenwriter and director read a quick summary of DH1 and then filled in stunts and big backgrounds. Why bother changing 75% of a book that was 100% great? The excuse that it is impossible to fit the book exactly into the film because of time restraints etc is crap. In this film, as in the 6 before, they filmmakers have added scenes (and therefore film minutes) that weren't even in the book.Why change it so much? What film bit was better than the book bits it replaced? Many of my favorite scenes and lines are either missing completely or turned on there head and barely recognizable.After seeing this version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 I wish I had a time turner. Or even better, had been bit with a memory spell so that I could forget morons had tried to turn any of the Harry Potter books into movies in the first place.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A bit bland, but that's because all the action is in Part II","*possible spoilers*I first want to say that splitting the final movie into 2 parts was a stroke of genius, because it reduces the likelihood of the plot being completely butchered, which is what happened with all of the HP movies except the first two. As anyone who has read Deathly Hallows knows, much of the beginning involves the trio on the lam, hiding out in the woods, and doing a whole lot of nothing. Fortunately, DH part 1 doesn't deviate too much from the book, save for a completely unnecessary just-friends dance scene between Harry and Hermione. The scene in Godric's Hollow is creepy and nerve-wracking, just like in the book, although not quite as wonderfully terrifying as the cave scene in HBP. The scene in Malfoy Manor is also quite exciting, although again, the meat and potatoes of DH will be in Part 2. The acting in DH part 1 is wonderfully done, with no real exceptions. Helen Botham Carter is back as the deliciously evil Bellatrix Lestrange and Ralph Finnes once again captures his iconic role as Voldemort just right. Dobby (forgot who the voice actor was) really shines in this movie, and Imelda Staunton is back for a brief reprise of arguably the most despicable fictional character of all time; Dolores Umbridge. Overall, yes this movie suffers from a serious lack of action, but that's because that's how it is in the book. So no real complaints on my part.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Maybe They Should Have Done All The Later Movies Like This,"After about ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" (movie #3), I felt that the movies based on books 4-6 really just didn't do the novels their true justice (especially the ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" films). By that point, the books were long past the simpler tales of ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"", and as a result they inevitably glossed over so many key parts of the series. Fortunately, the movie producers realized that such an approach just would not work for the magnitude of the final Potter installment, and thus the project was split in half. The best choice that could have possibly been made, IMHO.For a basic plot summary, ""Deathly Hallows 1"" sees Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) searching for Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) remaining Horcruxes. While the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts fall pretty much completely under Death Eater control, the trio learn about the Deathly Hallows and the endgame for Voldemort's master plan begins to take shape.There is no lag in this film whatsoever. It starts off with a bang and never looks back (just like the book). Yet, it is not just an ""action extravaganza"" like I perceived ""Order of the Phoenix"" to be. It is also filled with nuanced character performances, humor, and a sense of gravitas (provided by director David Yates) that makes the whole experience very well-rounded.Until recently, I really wasn't a fan of the ""part one"", ""part two"" concept of filmmaking. However, after seeing the success of this film (and the more recent ""Hobbit"" trilogy), I now am wondering if perhaps this is the way that books should be parlayed into movies all the time. A film like this allows for many more of J.K. Rowling's little nuances to show up instead of things feeling rushed and glossing over a good many plot points. Had, for example, ""Order of the Phoenix"" been done this way, I think I would have liked it a great deal more.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overrated as hell,"**Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 (2010)**Rating: (7/10)""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"" effectively sets the stage for the series' climactic conclusion, with Harry, Hermione, and Ron on the run as they seek to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. The film's darker tone and sense of urgency are well-executed, and the performances are strong, particularly in the quieter, more introspective moments. However, its pacing can be slow, with significant stretches dedicated to character development and plot exposition. While it builds tension and anticipation for the final installment, some viewers might find it less satisfying as a standalone film due to its focus on setup rather than resolution.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Highest Praise,"Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is both at once the darkest and brightest star in the franchise's constellation of film adaptations. It is darkest in its detailed depiction of Harry's hero saga during his most horrible days, and brightest in story, acting and poignancy.In this faithful adaptation of the first half of J.K. Rowling's penultimate novel of the boy wizard who lived, an evil shadow has fallen across the United Kingdom as Lord Voldemort grows in power and control. Evil lurks around every corner and there is no time for birthdays, weddings and other happy occasions. This is a time for mourning the fallen, and retreating for cover until a champion rises to lead the good and brave to victory. This is also a time where young love must bloom in a freezing cold winter and deep friendships provide the only warmth and relief.It is in this bleakness where we see, more clearly than ever, the heart of Harry James Potter and the loyalty of his friends Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have never been better in their roles, and there is an epiphany where the audience realizes that its emotional investment in these actors and films has yielded a reward greater than it could possibly have imagined.This is the true triumph of these Harry Potter films -- that they payoff in some proportion to how their original written source material paid off for readers. Rarely do films ever approach a climax equal to an extraordinary literary experience.The film production is handsome as it gives the audience the great gift of panoramic vistas of England's windswept moors, rugged forests, and overcast shores that are inserted between suspenseful action sequences in London coffee shops, muggle filled streets and inside the Ministry of Magic.Having read the books many times, I know how everything will end, but I now know, having seen the first part on film, that when Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part 2 runs its last reel this summer, that I will relive all of the giddiness, glory, sadness and sorrow that I felt when I finished the last Harry Potter book.That is the highest praise I can give any film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I think the next movie is going to be awesome for sure but this one was kind of boring to me and it also ruined the movie a bit that I watched it opening night and there were so many annoying kids screaming and wearing annoying costumes, trying to say the lines at the same time as the characters on the screen, etc, why do that?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The beginning of the end: a dark, powerful Harry Potter","We've finally arrived at the first part of the epic conclusion to the Harry Potter saga. And this Part 1 of ""Deathly Hallows"" is possibly my favorite movie in the entire franchise - though, as a fan of both the books and the movies, it's really hard to choose.If in ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince,"" we already saw a tense, dangerous, and dark atmosphere, ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" fully plunges the saga into an even more intense tone that we hadn't seen before. Just take a look at the first few minutes of the film: a ""rusty"" Warner Bros. Logo, a Minister of Magic warning the wizarding world about the dangers they face, and Hermione Granger reading in the newspaper about Muggle families being murdered and abducted. And that's not all. The scene that follows the logo makes it clear that this chapter is definitely not for kids, as we see Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters plotting Harry Potter's ultimate demise - not to mention the cold and cruel murder of a defenseless woman.Steve Kloves delivers his best work in the franchise when it comes to the characters. The screenplay effectively captures the suspicion and fear of the protagonists, putting them under immense pressure and pushing them to their limits. The anxiety created by the silent moments and the characters' irritated and borderline-crazy behavior is super effective in showing how this world and situation can break even the sanest person. The dialogue, which dominates the film (understandably, given the plot), is effective and meaningful in both the simpler and more complex scenes - for example, I'm especially fond of the moment Harry and Hermione talk by the river in Dean's Forest, right after a near-deadly attack.David Yates does an outstanding job in ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"" both by portraying the exhaustion of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and by skillfully diving deeper into the political themes. Hermione's reaction to seeing the monument at the Ministry of Magic that places Muggles ""in their rightful place"" is a powerful moment. Moreover, it's impressive how, in that same sequence, the director illustrates a ""government"" that tries to offer security while subtly and directly threatening its people - and the oppression becomes especially clear when Ron listens to the radio, particularly during an IMPECCABLE scene where we hear the names of missing witches and wizards while watching the heroes' tiring journey.Eduardo Serra's cinematography highlights the dark atmosphere with a blackened and gray tone that is still captivating. Stuart Craig also does a beautiful and notable job with production design to bring this darker mood to life through unique settings (especially the Ministry of Magic, Sirius Black's house, and Malfoy Manor, since much of the narrative takes place in open and outdoor areas).The special effects also deserve recognition (especially Yates' vision of the magical world, which dares to create elements that don't exist in Rowling's books, and that I personally really like). At first, the Dobby in ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" seemed stranger to me compared to ""Chamber of Secrets,"" where he looked more realistic. But now I've come to accept it.As for the performances, I always praise Daniel Radcliffe's work as Harry Potter. He perfectly conveys and handles the dramatic weight of the title character's journey - the scenes where he appears more frustrated always feel very convincing. Rupert Grint, for the first time, has the opportunity to explore a different side of Ron Weasley, mixing his usual comedic moments with a character on the verge of cracking under the pressure. Emma Watson also shines by delving deeper into Hermione's inner conflicts - with her relationship with her parents as a key thread.Wrapping up with an incredibly sad and dramatic scene, plus an effective and thrilling cliffhanger, ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is a character study and an incredible start to the conclusion of an outstanding and intelligent franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The film maintains a sense of urgency and tension throughout its duration. Yates deepen the drama, and rely on some impressive technique, creating great action scenes","David Yates returns to the command of the adaptation of this final book of the wizard with the mark on the forehead. In a clear evolution, Yates led the Order of the Phoenix praised and held an even better job in Half-Blood Prince, which has accredited an unquestionable way for this last adventure. With a book of nearly 600 pages to adapt and to be by far the most detailed, producers David Heyman and David Baron decided that not to suppress important parts to the narrative, the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows would be split into two films. They were shot simultaneously, with the first part being released on November 19, 2010 and the second on July 15, 2011.The screenwriter Steve Kloves - who wrote all the film adaptations, except Order of the Phoenix - to be informed of the division into two movies made an excellent start to the end. In Deathly Hallows there are no subplots unnecessary and absolutely everything is extremely important for the final conclusion. Kloves has no hurry to develop in nearly two and a half hours Projection everything that matters in the work of JK Rowling. Kloves inserts many scenes of reflection of the characters and passages of conversation between them further strengthen their relationship over the months that get together that difficult journey.The first part is slower, supported on runways and in the long run for months found by the protagonists, while the second focuses on the action, the great final battle, having a climate more apocalyptic. According to author JK Rowling revealed itself, more than any other book in the series, the last volume is a continuation of the unfinished stories in book six. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is one of the longer books in the entire series and in it there are several references to other books and films in the series, including character doing and saying goodbye to revisit places that were part of other years of Harry's life, so the ideal is that those who watch this film has read the books or seen the movies, otherwise the view will be severely degraded.Following the notorious technical evolution of the series, The Deathly Hallows has the best effects of the series. It is important to point that this is the only movie that Industrial Light & Magic did not participate in the visual effects. The effects, Oscar nominated and BAFTA are faultless. From the aerial, as the first appearance of Snape in Voldemort's headquarters, or scenes like the scene of the Seven Potter (Daniel Radcliffe that had to do about 90 takes for this one scene); battles and escape the streets skies and tunnels of London, recreating even better elves Kreacher and Dobby, the effects of the horcrux shortly before his detsrui√ß√£o by Ron and the capture of the trio that is brought to the home of great fights Malfoy in the headquarters. The art direction Oscar nominated once again made by Stuart Craig, is divine. No Hogwarts present this first, the challenge was to create various scenarios and achieve many other outdoor locations for filming. The scenes outside of Malfoy Manor, for example, were filmed at Hardwick Hall, one of the most luxurious villas of Queen Elizabeth. Moreover, we have the sets forests and cliffs where the trio takes refuge, the wedding venue of Bill and Fleur, a redesign of the abandoned headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix and the expansion of various scenarios of the Ministry of Magic, alleys and streets of London the Lovegood house. Some details are subtle but make the difference in a great job, for example, to bring the office of Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as dark as the rest of the Ministry, but still exhibiting many of the decorative objects that were in his room Hogwarts. The BAFTA nominated makeup, costumes and flawless once again Jany Temime also deserve applause.The film would be the first in the series to be released in 3D, but had its release format canceled a few weeks before the official debut. David Yates continues the tense tax on their previous work on the franchise, without forgetting to extract the best performances from the cast. No sooner has the film begins and we are faced with an engaging and exciting scene with Hermione and her parents. Shortly after we see Harry, after saying goodbye Dursley, revisits his room under the stairs before leaving the place once, in another striking scene. Ahead production, Harry pulls Hermione to dance when she was sad about the departure of Ron. A scene delicate, sensitive in that the characters in a full demonstration of friendship fzendo them go from total sadness to happiness and ends again with sadness about the fact that they could not escape.
Another decision that Yates became a differential count was the choice of ""The Tale of the Three Brothers"" in animated form. A very well done animation tells the story fully, keeping the colors in the same climate of production. Also highlighted the option to tell ""The Tale of the Three Brothers"", in which is explained the origin of such relics of death, through an animation. The development was sensational, keeping the gloomy mood of the production. It looked like an animation made by Tim Burton by graphics and scene lighting.Yates has the wisdom to assert the other films. In Deathly Hallows we have the distinct feeling that everything seen so far in preparing for the grand finale. All spells that the characters learned and were little used, now flow as the need will arise. We also see the importance of the training of Dumbledore's Army in The Order of the Phoenix. The leading trio spends the entire movie running away and taking refuge in various locations. Hermione, for example, begins the film completely erasing the memory of the parents to protect them, and spends the entire movie plagued by these memories, knowing they will probably never see them, and if they do, they do not recognize. Ron is one that is no longer comic relief to begin to face their own fears, and now is listening to a radio, to see if your parents or siblings are well. Harry spends all his time with the responsibility of having to go after the Horcruxes because Voldemort knows quea death depends on it. Still have to live with revelations of his mentor Dumbledore, and even back to the place where he was born to face the facts of her past. The quality of the interpretation of the trio is clear. Are required to maintain the tension and fear in every scene and face your fears.Since Hogwarts is not present, this is the only movie that has the presence of Maggie Smith and David Bradley as Professor McGonagall and as Mr. Filch, respectively. Alan Rickman (Snape), David Thewlis (Lupin) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) lose space appearing in a few scenes. John Hurt was the actor with the greatest range of appearance between films, appearing as Mr. Ollivander in Sorcerer's Stone (2001) and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 (2010). Ralph Fieenes arises imposing as Lord Voldemort and in the first few scenes already shown their distaste for those who are not pure blood and demonstrates his power to others. Helena Bonham Carter shines as Bellatrix Lestrange and Tom Felton appears in some scenes very much like Draco Malfoy. Bill Nighy incorporates a Ministry of Magic verging on caricature, but not enough to compromise.David Yates, as well as deepen the drama, and rely on some impressive technique, know how to create great action scenes as the entire sequence involving the three invading the Ministry of Magic, the pursuit of the kidnappers to the trio in the woods, and parts with suspense and terror, as the home of Bathilda Bagshot or the final climax in the house of Malfoy who are faced with Bellatrix and others. Until torture scenes (which were minimized in the final edit to suit the age rating of the film) were shown. Yates and Kloves further distance themselves from all the rules of other films and books, to not atrelarem the issue of time. Christmas, for example, is represented in the scenes in Godric's Hollow, but not him or the arrival of other seasons ranging guiding events, which always culminated with the end of the mysteries and adventures near the last day of school year. The film maintains a sense of urgency and tension throughout its duration. Yates knows move the camera with instability to put the viewer in the scene, uses transitions satisfactory angles higher leaving the characters smaller and more vulnerable, and in outdoor locations, plans air contemplative deserts on land, virtually untouched by man, further increase the feeling of loneliness and the air that post-apocalyptic world threatened by Voldemort.The Deathly Hallows Part I is bold, interesting but not works as an independent film. Many of the points raised here will only be answered even in the second half. But in order to draw attention and make sure that the series will have an end as deserved is reached.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Surprisingly entertaining, considering nothing really happens","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a surprisingly entertaining movie, considering nothing really happens in the story. It's intense and dramatic and, at times, humorous. However, I don't know if it will hold up as well during subsequent viewings and it can't really stand on its own.

The best Harry Potter ever...are you kidding?,"My first attempt in watching this movie I fell asleep. The second attempt was more successful as I managed to stay awake. But what on earth did I just see. The first three HP movies were mysterious and magical. And as Harry matured he became stronger and skilled. After the third movie the Harry we see on the screen is nothing but a plot device. He is nowhere near as impressive and no match at all for any bad guy,in a believable way that is. So I haven't read the books,something tells me I do need to do that. But I should not read the books to make sense of it all. I judge solely on what I see on the screen. Why would the Dark Lord be so afraid of Harry Potter. Not once an explanation is given for it which I believe the books do (somebody told me). It really is beyond me that people can call this the best Harry Potter movie ever. Excuse me? Was there actually a plot? The scenes that were interesting were over before I could get into it. Please give this a miss. It is a waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A necessary and fitting buildup to the grand conclusion,"Walking out of the screening, one of my friends remarked that he hated this Harry Potter film, stating it is the ""worst"" in the series. I disagree, but understand exactly why he thinks this way. As anyone who has read the book knows, a large part of the seventh book is buildup towards the definite battle that awaits. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is just buildup.If you have read the book, you will enjoy this film as it is faithful to the spirit of the book; if you know Harry simply through the films, you might be disappointed. For it is filmed with camping in deserted locations, forests, and other odd locations to escape from Voldermort's grasp. This is really why some critics absolutely hate this film as they can not fathom the amount of buildup this film does. However, if they want to criticise anyone, they should critique Rowling as this is a faithful adaption of her book.Radcliffe and Grint are great as always, but the welcome surprise is Emma Watson whose acting has gotten better and better, and she reaches a new peak. She balances each relationship very decisively , putting different emotional layers in treating Harry and Ron. In addition, the landscapes are as gorgeous as ever, and the special effects have become surprisingly better-especially Voldermort's snake which sent chills through my spine. The emotion the film induces does something that the book never did for me. It takes it out of this magical world, and into the real world, and makes the evil present in Harry's World seem like the fear many people battling evil might have felt in Germany, during the 1930's and forties. Hermione's attempt to save her parents from the hands of evil give us another view in this world which almost mirrors us in terms of what these people go through to wipe this evil horror.The deathly Hallows may be a boring film for those unfamiliar with the book, but for the readers of this tale it is the most faithfully done adaptation. Sure, the film does not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Starts off strong, but becomes a pointless breather","There are aspects of Part 1 that I liked. But most of it was a drag that left me feeling the energy and magic was sucked out of the finale of this beloved series.David Yates' time was done. He's good with nuance, and subtly. But his touch is only dampening the vibe of the Harry Potter lore.There's a solid movie here that takes time for it to sink in. The early stuff was A+ entertainment. But everything in the forest felt dragged out and should've been trimmed.Overall, it's not my favourite of the HP lore, it's probably next to last. I watch it on a sick day or whenever I'm bored, it fits that mood.But it doesn't set up Part 2 with the excitement it needed to.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
somthng,"Before the movie, we talked about how much more fun the Harry Potter franchise would be as a TV show, because that means that each season could be dedicated to a book and use anywhere from 12 hours to 17 hours to tell the story of each book. And some subplots could get their own episodes, like the various love affairs. This would have the benefit of resolving that storyline while isolating it from the darker happenings, and avoiding groaningly awful situations¬Ö On a TV show, you can have entire episodes that only minimally advance the main plot, but fill in the necessary color and resolve subplots. There's so many things that are half-explored that could, on a TV show, get an entire episode or two all to themselves.Also noted is the following observation: Movies, even those that run nearly 3 hours long, are more like short stories than novels, and TV shows, with the space for digression and intricate plots twists, are more like novels. But in a perverse irony, movies and TV shows have the reverse prestige of short stories and novels, and so the temptation is to take higher prestige novels and turn them into movies. I have no doubt that this was the logic of turning ""Harry Potter"" into movies instead of TV shows. TV seemed too cheap for the series, especially back when they were first selling the story to Hollywood. But in the years since, prestige TV projects like ""The Wire"" and yes, even ""Lost"" have changed the equation considerably. A lot of TV shows are hands-down better than a lot of movies now, especially since the taboo against having intricate plot lines that make it hard to enter the story halfway in have been lifted. Though you probably wouldn't have that problem with ""Harry Potter"", which makes it even more appealing as a TV series. Viewers could enter at any time they'd like, and grasp the basic idea that Voldemort was bad and he's coming back, which would be enough of a hook to get them to stay and piece together the rest.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just Brilliant and Very Moving!,"I loved it! It was spectacularly well directed. I haven't read the book yet(so I can't find anything wrong with the movie)but this story is very powerfully told from the movie. This movie will make you cry at some parts in the movie and make you laugh and smile. You may not ever forget this movie. From the beginning to the end the movie gets you hooked. It takes it's sweetly time in the beginning at first but the movie is worth watching. The Deathly Hallows (Part 1) is probably the best thrilling and moving film so far out of the Harry Potter series.I have to say I felt every emotion Hermione felt in the movie by Emma Watson's performance. She has really grown as a actress. Emma has really shown that she's got some amazing acting chops.Throughout the movie I felt really sorry for Harry. He's been through a lot. Daniel Radcliffe does amazingly good at playing Harry.I loved Rupert Grint's performance in this movie. He shines bright and you never forget the scenes he's in.Again I loved it. It's epic. All the actors were just brilliant in this movie, very convincing. Praises to all the people who worked on this film and of course to J.K.

The 1st part reflects the quality and awesomeness of the second part,"First of all, let me say that no movie deserves exact 10 or exact 1. I personally rate from 2 to 9 in IMDb and in my mind. Now lets talk about Harry Potter. As the film begins you know from the first minutes that you are going to see a different, mature and dark movie. As it progresses and it comes to the end you realize that every expectation has fully delivered and maybe exceeded. Well, all i'm saying is that this movie has it all, comedy, action, adventure, drama, fantasy, suspense, mystery and even a bit romance. What else can the audience ask for? And also (for me at least) this part reflects the quality and the awesomeness of the second part. I hope and i believe that the second part will be this good or maybe even better, why not? So all Harry Potter fans (and not only) prepare for the biggest movie event of this year, cause this is going to be sooo amazing and memorable!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Disappointing Disjointed Movie,"11 December 2010. This beginning of the end for the Harry Potter series is a disappointment and apparently without the book the movie is unable to stand alone as a movie and instead becomes a disjointed, disconnected series of movie scenes that initially begins with fusion between a TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991) action thriller and a junior version of BRAZIL (1985) and a retro-stylistic, parody version of the cold war, totalitarianism. The rest of the movies eventually almost becomes more like an expensive video game as Harry and company get to survive to the next level in a series of disconnected, random levels. Throughout there are logic gaps, omitted scenes that avoided much needed character, plot development. The purported transformation from magical children entertainment into a darker fantastic juvenile action thriller merges too close the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy which in many ways remains a fantasy classic and by comparison pales in J.R.R. Tolkien writings.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 Review,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a film directed by David Yates. Since this was the second last instalment, my anticipation for this one was sky high. And after watching the film, I can say that that film exceeded all my expectations.Plot: Harry, Ron and Hermione team up to destroy the secret to his immortality - Horcruxes.Story and direction: This film started the trend of the last part being split up to two films. But I can say without doubt that none have achieved the level of greatness that this film achieved. As I have stressed in the previous instalments, the character work in this film is just like no other film series. The makers know what the audience expects and just taps on to that. From the very first scene you know that the stakes are real and the setting itself made me worry for the safety of the characters. We have some amazing action sequences in the film which are very beautifully shot and nicely edited. The film mostly takes place between the 3 main characters of the film. And it never feels boring just to watch them doing what they are great at. Alexandre Desplat's score is just amazing. The sets and camera work for the film is beautiful. The VFX is the best the series has to offer. Some characters do suffer consequences and you do feel sad for them. The film does end in a cliffhanger but that will not disappoint as it is known the film will continue.Performances: Daniel Radcliffe was great as Harry Potter. The emotional depth this character has is deep and you feel for him. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is just great. For the first time in the series, I felt the emotional side of this character. Rupert Grint successfully portrays a different side of Ronald Weasley. This film does introduce Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour. The role is small but good enough to leave an impression. Also introduced here is Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood. I did feel the role was good but a bit unnecessary.Favorite Scene: It would be a scene when Harry decides to cheer Hermione when she is sad by having a small dance with her. This scene showed the maturity and understanding these characters have for each other. I came to know from somewhere that this scene was nowhere in the book. So it is a big pat on the makers' back for innovating something new and presenting us in a good way.Verdict: For a second last film in a franchise, this film does justice. It sets up scenes for what is about to come and makes us ready for some consequences that might not just be in our favour. Thanks again to David Yates, Steve Kloves and the entire team of Harry Potter for bringing us a franchise that knows how to treat a particular story with respect. I can't just wait for the final instalment.I am going with a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not impressed.!!,"Has a bunch of flaws. Probably not the best potter movie.!! Not as magical & graphical as the first.. Not a movie i would recommend first time potter movie watchers, The fans will watch it anyway....:-) Personally i feel, The movie needs to be edited a lot.. people expect some flashy spells and wizardry on the screen.. Not the trio hanging out in forests and scenic locations.!! Nope..'prisoner of azkaban' still remains my favorite... I speculate a better part 2 though.!! As to conclude and to add a few more lines, for the site won't let my review be less than ten linesXD..6 stars for the movie..it would have been more if harry made his eyebrows a bit thin..",,Anonymous,Fantasy

An almost perfect adaptation,"This movie was AMAZING!!! I've got to see it again immediately!! Off the top of my head, my favorite scenes were: Anything with Emma Watson in it. She was amazing in this movie. I was blown away by her performance. I loved the part when she obliviates her parents memories, and when she's face to face with Scabior on the other side of the protective charm, her performance when she's being tortured by Bellatrix is so real that I was genuinely worried about her. It hurt my heart to hear her crying and screaming like that. Poor Hermione.The locket scene. What a steamy kiss. I also loved the part when Harry is following the Silver Doe...it was exactly like the book! The H/Hr dance was so sweet! Dan looked really sexy in that scene! The opening Malfoy Manor scene and the Godric's Hollow sequence scared the CRAP out of me. I wasn't expecting them to really faithfully adapt those sequences. When Hermione goes into the room with all of those flies and there's blood all over the walls...OMG! :shock: I also loved all the R/Hr moments. This film really took their relationship to a deeper, more adult level. It was so great to see it take that step from the teenage love relationship they had before.Another scene that I loved was the ministry of magic scene. It was perfectly adapted from the book. Just how I pictured it. I love how it was suspenseful yet funny at the same time.And last, but not least..the Three Brothers scene was amazing!! I wasn't expecting to see that beautiful piece of animation in the film. I was completely sucked in and Hermione told the story beautifully. I thought it was really smart of the filmmakers to tell the story that way instead of using real actors or just showing Hermione reading it. Great job! So, yeah...I loved the whole movie. There were a couple of things I wish had been included like Luna's room and Krum at the wedding and more of Dumbledore's backstory, but it's hard to judge since we still have a whole other half of movie to look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another strong entry to the series!,"Likes: The 3 main actors did some of their best work, they have really grown over the years and fleshed out these characters to an impressive degree. They provide the most emotional scenes of the HP films. The direction is great, providing the most realistic of the films and a great layer of dread and suspense over everything. The few moments of comic relief are effectively subtle, I enjoyed the lack of silliness and slapstick gags. The beginning with Hermoine making her parents forget her was well done and powerful. The ""heist"" section was fun and interesting. The Voldemort dinner was effectively chilling. Great stuff all around in the scene where they finally destroy the horcrux. Hot evil Hermoine is hot. The action chase in the opening was great. I liked the multiple Harry's and the humor that provided, and the visuals were cool during the flight on the motorcycle. Really awesome camera work and cinematography, providing visuals that furthered the sense of them being all alone in their quest. By not having to rush things the audience gets a much better feel for the frustrating setting for our heroes. In the brief time he is on screen, Alan Rickman once again makes Snape one of the most engaging characters in the series. This film is up their with the best produced entries, quite a feat considering it goes up against the magnificent Prisoner of Azkaban. While I wouldn't say it's the best technically made film, it's probably second best. I've enjoyed seeing the series get darker and more atmospheric as it goes. For the first time there is actual realistic danger towards the characters, which adds a lot. This is one film that carries great emotion weight, giving it the necessary feel to make the audience care leading into the climactic events.Dislikes: Although some important events took place, not quite enough happens plot wise for my tastes. Definitely not enough Snape! Missed seeing a lot of the other characters, many of whom were given brief cameos in the beginning and never seen again. Dobby's death was fairly cheesy and failed to make me care that much. Perhaps it was due to not reading the books, but since Dobby hadn't been seen since Chamber of Secrets it seemed convenient to bring him back just to save them and get killed off. It wasn't bad, I just didn't really care. Although the character development was necessary and appreciated, there was a few scenes that dragged a bit as I itched to get the plot moving again. (I will say this beats the film feeling rushed, as we felt in Goblet of Fire). The dark nature of the film unfortunately means there is much less of the fun, adventurous feeling some of the other entries provide, which means while this one is totally necessary for the series as a whole, it wouldn't be my first choice to pop in and watch over and over. A few of the characters come in without so much as an introduction and it wasn't made clear why they were important. They just get introduced, and either turn into a bad guy or exit. I still have no clue what the deal is with the shard of glass, and am unsure whether I am supposed to know. (if it is important to not know, and it will be revealed in the next film, please avoid spoiling it for me). Also, there is the expected effect of the ending feeling anti-climactic. It just sneaks up and provides a stopping point to lead into the next film. Just when it was getting good, right?Overall: This is easily one of the strongest entries in the Harry Potter series, providing fantastic atmosphere and emotional weight. While I would still rate The Prisoner of Azkaban and the under-rated Half-Blood Prince ahead of it, it is definitely above the rest of the installments. Deathly Hallows part 1 continues the tradition of solid films and its flaws probably couldn't have been avoided due to the nature of it being mostly set-up. That being said, this is about as good as it could have been and makes me more than eager to see the conclusion next July. I support the decision to split the final film into two parts because it allowed us to see these characters grow so much more without having to rush the plot more. And that evil Hermoine needs to make another appearance!Final score 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A dark and intense prelude to the final battle,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"" released in 2010, is the penultimate film in the beloved Harry Potter series. Directed by David Yates, this installment shifts the narrative from the familiar setting of Hogwarts to a perilous journey across the wizarding world.As Voldemort's power grows, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run, tasked with locating and destroying Horcruxes to weaken the Dark Lord. The film captures the sense of desperation and danger that surrounds the trio, portraying their struggles and the strain on their friendship as they face relentless threats.The cinematography is dark and atmospheric, reflecting the escalating tension and the oppressive threat of Voldemort's regime. The performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are compelling, showcasing their characters' growth and resilience.While some viewers might find the pacing slower compared to previous films, ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" effectively sets the stage for the epic conclusion. It's a gripping and emotional journey that deepens the characters and raises the stakes, making it a crucial chapter in the Harry Potter saga.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly impressed,"I love the books. I like the films. They're watchable at best. Philosophers Stone and Chamber Of Secrets were faithful though lacked any particular style and fell in with most generic early noughties fantasy films. Prisoner Of Azkaban took a more stylistic approach and managed to capture a medieval look. The Goblet Of fire (the first of the big ones) in my opinion was utter shambles. The acting was inferior to the others, the style seemed to attempt to copy its predecessor with little success and the comedy was forced, staged and unfunny. Order Of the Pheonix tried to cram a lot of story into a short space of time. Clever ideas and directorial sharpness kept it from falling the way Goblet had. Though Yates had much to celebrate with Order of the Pheonix, Halfblood prince seemed to skim the book leaving gaping holes in a pretty simplistic plot. The romance between Potter and Ginny Weasley was hopelessly unengaging and both actors lacked any chemistry.This film is probably the most faithful to the books. The books narrative is the final installment is written like it should be translated to film, so the cross over shouldn't have been as hard as the others. Being in two halves was definitely the correct approach though the end of this film annoyed me some what. I know the ending, but I am now desperate to see the next one. To me thats job well done to director David Yates, his third of four Potter films. The action is well timed, the horror is just enough to make adult feel a slight amount of dredd, and may only give kids nightmare for a day or two, which in opinion is a good thing. The ""adult"" cast once again tower over the teens, but with less screen time for the ""adults"" the teens are not dwarfed like in previous installments. The film though grim and gritty, is beautifully shot cinematography is superb once again and the special effects are amazing to say the least.I was really not holding out much hope for Deathly Hallows part 1, but I was pleasantly surprised. Virtually anyone who has watched the others will go see this one, but rest assured to those that are let down by the films as I have been time after time, this one could well be the best outing. Bring on part 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enough to leave you yearning for more.....,"Harry Potter, who doesn't know the name Haryy Potter? Truth be told the powers that be could throw out any old garbage film and we the helpless fans would jump upon it and go in our thousands. Thankfully that hasn't happened.The Deathly Hollows is a fine novel, one every fan should read and the film part 1 is true to the book and every fan will like it. It stars off with the brilliant "" 7 Harry's "" scene which is fantastic and from there it moves swiftly to the wedding and familiar faces are plentiful. We get to meet all the old favourites Mad Eye,The Weasleys,Lumpkin,Hermoine,Hagrid and of course Harry then we see the warm Weasley families home and all is OK, alas our blood thirst is quenched.But the problem is after the start the film hits a dead end. We are left with the three main characters in isolation and not much else is going on. This is part of the story and necessary but to be blunt it is a little boring. However the last 30 minutes bring the tale back to life and do more than enough to excite the audience. The film as you all know is a little darker and perhaps more suitable for the 12+ age group.All in all this is a decent film and is more than enough to keep the Potter Heads out there happy. You cant help but be hungry for more and it is set up perfectly for an epic finally which Im sure we will get.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's like everyone forgot this series was supposed to be fun,"And so here it is finally. After nine years watching the prepubescent speccy wizard grow into a chiselled speccy wizard, the long, long climax is here. Kicking off what has become a fad in novel adaptations aimed mainly at screaming teenage girls (Twilight, The Hunger Games), Deathly Hallows splits the final novel into two 120-plus films. Whether this is to avoid condensing a mammoth, multi-character into one rushed, incoherent stand-alone movie, or to take full advantage of a multi- billion franchise that is soon to finally end, is up for debate (although a sneaky feeling tells me it's the latter). What is for certain is that a huge, dragging chunk of Part 1 could have easily been wavered. It's like director David Yates forgot that this series is supposed to be fun.This time around, there's no Hogwarts, and there's almost nothing recognisable about the franchise whatsoever. Beginning with an exciting broomstick battle over London which sees surviving members of the Order don Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) face in an attempt to elude the lurking Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), things soon turn gloomy as Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are forced to go solo in the countryside in search of the Dark Lord's remaining Horcruxes. If that word perplexes you at this point of the series, you may as well leave early, as quite rightly, the film has no time for catch-up.With the novel going into much-needed detail in terms of character, background and plot (such is the benefit of literature), the decision to split the film into two parts means Part 1 can breathe easy and take it's time before the final smackdown at Hogwarts in Part 2. This means we spend more time with the three leads as the weight of possible doom lingers heavy on their backs. The absence of the usual stellar adult ensemble is damaging, as Radcliffe, Grint and Watson struggle to hold the film on their own, given their limited acting ability and their character's lack of any real dimension. Grint is easily the best of the three, but Ron is shackled with a jealousy sub-plot (again) which means he gets to mope a lot and storm off.Yates is the safe choice at this point to end the series. He lacks the cuddly obviousness of Chris Columbus and the more visionary efforts of Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell, and apart from a nice little animated sequence near the middle, the film just goes through the motions. There's a nice little dance number, but it's the only recognisable touch from the director. ""These are dark times, there's no denying it,"" warns Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), the new minister of magic, in the film's opening scene. Dark and grainy times they are, and oddly joyless, Part 1 feels like an extended advertisement for the real end, Part 2, squeezing it's dedicated fans for all they're worth.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely magical.,"I've been a fan of the Harry Potter series since I first saw the very first movie in the cinemas. I've loved every single movie, some more than others. I went to the cinema with high expectations, and I certainly wasn't disappointed.This movie has impressed me with the stunning effects, the great acting, the amazing dialog, the emotions, everything. I think they've really managed to catch the feel of hopelessness in this movie, and I'm really happy about that.During this movie I laughed, cried, jumped in shock and sat on the edge of my seat. It's absolutely fantastic, and I cannot stress that enough.I strongly recommend this being watched by everyone who has a bit of magic at their hearts, but of course watch the other 7 movies first!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Progression of the Humanity,This movie has some faults but maturation of the subject matter and its treatment make this better than many other sequel films.

Trade Hallow against Horcrux,"I haven't read any Potter books and I do not know how it will all end (the last book has been out for awhile). But I do know that the movies have grown up, as have the fans of the movies. The last book has been filmed as two parts and part one has been released in 2010, while the last episode will come out in 2011. And I might have to re-evaluate this one after watching the end.The end. This will be a sad day for many people. Especially the cinema chains will loose one of the most profitable movie series they had. And they did not even release this movie in 3-D as it was announced. Though it might be better that they didn't. Plus the movie would not have really been that much better with the effect. It is dark as it is (mood and lighting wise) and the 3-D would have made it even more so (which would have been a bad thing).The ending to this one, was carefully chosen and the movie was flowing at a nice speed. I never felt, like I was watching a very long picture. Now, where is the other movie, to see where it is heading.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter Review,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" follows our heroes Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as they set out to find the seven objects, known as Horcruxes in the film, that will evidently destroy the evil Voldermort. It is a extremely difficult task since not only are they hidden in unknown places, but also the knowledge on how to destroy them is unknown too. There is also one more person who faces an extremely difficult task too, director David Yates. Can he possibly make a Potter movie that not only takes place out of the familiar Hogwarts and is much more dramatic still lovable to J.K. Rowling's fans? David Yates has surpassed Christopher Columbus in terms of handling the reigns with the popular series. Columbus up until now was the only one who directed more than one Potter film. The third film (Azakaban) was directed by Alfanso Cauron and the fourth (Goblet) was directed by Mike Newell. Yates, then came in and handled the fifth (Order), sixth (Half-Blood Prince), and finally this film, that has been split into two parts. The reasoning being because nothing is being cut out of the this time around. Fans rejoiced when they found out they would be getting a five hour conclusion to their beloved series. Yates has said to have brought out the maturity in the series that it needed. Under his eye, the films definitely have more of an adult feel to them. Signs of the change were present the second ""Order of Phoenix"" started with Potter's evil cousin, Dudley, finally got what was coming to him. Even before Dudley came face to face with one of the most feared inhabitants of the wizarding world, you could sense something terrible was bound to happen. Yates perfectly nailed the sense of dreariness through the flushed out colors and perfectly placed camera angles. Then in ""The Half Blood Prince"" he created a very sympathetic character out of Horace Slughorn, with the help of Jim Broadbeant. Here, he keeps the same gift for creating dread and despair. One of the first scenes in the film, a poor ex-teacher at Hogwarts, hangs in the air while Voldermort's crew discusses their next move. We know, as does she, it is just a matter of time before she bites the dust. It is detail like this that make these films establish the dark tone that Yates is going for.Before I make the poor guy seem like a one-dimensional director, I will point out some of the other strong points that he possesses as a director. There are some scenes of thrilling action and creativity that are just a sight to see. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione, must infiltrate the Ministry of Magic, they drink the physical form changing Poly Juice Potion, to turn into awkward adults. This scene is a joy to watch because it is adventurous and quite comical. Another scene is when Hermione tells a wizard fairy tale. I won't go into detail about it, but it shows how much these films have taken an identity of their own. An identity that we will only get to enjoy for only 150 minutes more.Grade= B",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dumbledore is turning in his grave,"Dull and slow. Someone obviously realised that the money train was going to finish soon and so to cash in they split the final book into two films. They then discover that there isn't actually enough material to fill the first so have lots of sitting around on mountains - very dark, moody and ultimately annoying. Other 'fillers' include some dancing in a tent, some more sitting around on a mountain and some sitting around in a forest (to break things up). And lets not forget something to do with a mad old woman who turns into a snake - don't know what that was about or what it added to the story. Lots of people say that it's ""building up for the finale"" or ""setting the scene for part 2"". If that's the case then my advice would be to just save your money and wait for part 2, as nothing really happens in this film. Unless, of course, you like to watch people sitting around on mountains.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The HP movie that completely exceeded my expectations.,"I must be completely hones with you guys: when I saw this movie announced in the ""Opening this week"" box, I was not really touched, even tho I'm a HP fan. I disagree with most of the positive reviews from the third movie onwards, the actions, plot and history in those films were changed in a negative wave, resulting in a personal disappointment. They were not bad but something was clearly missing...However after reading several positive reviews from this movie, a movie from my favorite book from the series, I gave it a chance... and this time, I was not disappointed: David Yates does his very best in this dark thriller with the help of some outstanding performances from Watson(Hermione), Radcliffe(Harry), Fiennes(Voldemort) and Carter(Bellatrix).The movie develops slowly thanks from being divided in 2 parts, something that the prequels could have used (specially HP6). You enter in a cold adult world, where all character are a lot more serious. The dark mood of this film catchs you right from the start.I think that most of the changes and cuts from the book here were really smart, plus dialogs are well executed. Something that will really blow you(r eyes) will be the effects... they are stunning. The definition and effort put in every single graphic is visible, I will learn the names from the special effects team, they did an awesome work.Also, I will point that Yates can make some really emotional scenes, like Dumbledore's last scene in HP6, the last scene of this film touches you deep in your heart.In the end, we really can't judge this movie as a one, we must see his sequel. The changes Yates made as Wormtails surviving may affect the following picture... a picture I will wait very excited.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
three letters to put this movie on the list of the best movies in 2010 ( OMG ),"I was luckily able to catch a screening a few weeks ago here in Egypt.As an avid lover of harry potter, I felt warner bros could never reach those heights again.I was wrong.the deathly hallows part 1 story will probably seem peculiar at first but if you read the book you will find it amazingly breathtaking storyline and i'm sure that when part 2 comes out it will make part 1 as the hit movie of 2010.the best of the movie is :- * the Amazing visual effects.* the Amazing story.* and the song that harry and Hermione danced on was a wonderful song.* Hilarious comedy.* Breath taking action.* Heart.All those combined equal something special. Today's movies like to blow you away with gimmicks, deathly hallows is different. Each movie shows soul and deathly hallows definitely has it.I can't wait until part 2 comes out so I can see it in 3d, I'm bringing everybody.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Brilliant film, but left me unsatisfied","I've never been a massive fan of the Harry Potter series until recently and I only ever read about 2 or 3 of the books; so I'm not a die hard fan of the series, but i do enjoy the films a lot. I only recently finished watching the half blood prince too, so i wasn't sitting in a dark corner biting my nails waiting for this to come out, so i had no hype to disappoint me. I did however hear a lot about this film, after all, it was the first part in an epic grand finale and they definitely saved the best till last.The film was brilliant - don't get me wrong - it was full of tension and edge of your seat excitement, but throughout the film I was constantly apprehensive. I was waiting for a massive moment that was going to shock the audience - something totally unexpected - I mean, after all, this is the final piece in a massive film series. So whilst I was waiting for something to happen, nothing really did. There was some bits that I'm sure hardcore fans would tell me otherwise and who probably cried in some of those scenes, but as a regular fan; nothing really major. Overall: fantastic film, but I feel there wasn't enough major moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not A Children's Story,"Earlier this week, I reread ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" to refresh my memory before seeing the movie. A woman who sat next to me in the bookstore caf√© asked a few questions about the book, noting, among other things, what a remarkable phenomenon the series had become. I offered my opinion that the author, J.K. Rowling, could hardly have predicted the immense success of her creation; that, when she started writing, her only objective was to write a children's story, and that is how you must always view the books, no matter how dark they become. However, the movies are certainly not bound by that.At its heart, the Harry Potter books are and will always be children's books. The characters, unlike the fully-fleshed out characters in more ""adult"" series, tend to be more elemental. I wouldn't call them two-dimensional, but every character represents something in the series. Voldemort is the purest evil, while Ron and Hermione are Harry's loyal companions. Harry, of course, is our fearless hero, and Dumbledore is the ever-present mentor and guardian. That is, until we reach Book Seven. Everything about Harry's life and beliefs is challenged in this chapter of the series. His relationship with Dumbledore, who died at the end of Book Six and can no longer guide or protect him, is brought into question as new information about the old wizard's life surfaces after his death. As Harry seeks the means to destroy Voldemort, he becomes increasingly aware that Dumbledore left him with precious fews clues on how to do so.At his side, of course, are Ron and Hermione who refuse to let him travel alone when half the wizarding world is looking for him, for one reason or another. After six years of friendship and shared danger, their trust in Harry hardly needs explanation. However, as the enormity of the task becomes ever more clear to them, dissension eats away at that trust, and the fact that they're all merely teenagers, albeit magicians, makes the mission that much more difficult. So much has been sacrificed on everyone's part, including family, that Harry is reluctant to ask or even accept any more sacrifices; and yet, even more will be required of all of them before the tale is complete.I've always preferred the movies to the books. As compelling as Rowling's writing is, it is still intended primarily for children, and it shows. I don't mean that in a derogatory way; but elemental characters such as the brainy Hermione, the bumbling Hagrid, and the loony Luna need more to make them truly enjoyable. At times, they do break out of their ""roles"", and that is when they truly shine. Rowling does her best to give the readers a window into the characters' souls, to feel the weight of the burdens they carry. She certainly pulls no punches with Harry, barely allowing him a moment of triumph or celebration before adding another tragedy or burden to his lot.The movies, on the other hand, add a bit more realism to the struggle. It's not just the ""picture says a thousand words"" element. It's the little touches, the slight changes in dialogue from page to screen, that make the characters less elemental and more human. The pruning of a scene or editing of exposition here and there eases the rhythm and allows the viewer to go with the flow. The soundtrack itself does a fantastic job of bringing the story to life (keep your ears open for Nick Cave's ""O Children"", which adds a particular bittersweetness to one compelling scene).There is so much that changes in this seventh installment that, after a few early scenes have ended, you can hardly recognize the series. There are familiar faces, of course, and the main element remains: the fact that Harry Potter must defeat Lord Voldemort himself or die trying. This is only the first part of Book Seven, of course; the second half will wait until next summer. Expect everything to change again.(Originally appeared as ""Not A Children's Story"" at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2010/11/not-a-childrens-story/ )",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too stretched,The end is near and now the power of Voldemort can clearly be traced out. This installments majorly focuses on the climax which is near. Henceforth the sole attention is paid to the action sequences. What I believe is that the movie is stretched without any reason just to produce another installment. Nothing much important happens in this part and the major part is left for the last installment. All the questions which were aroused in Half Blood Prince are majorly left unanswered. This is a let down again and the producers now are greedy for another one clearly. The romantic relationships are more focused without any importance just to cover up the running time. Therefore its really slow paced making you yawn at certain places. I would rather rate it 6.5. Its the weakest of all.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really disappointed,"In the first few books/movies, the story was light, funny, had good side story lines but carried a level of surprise and a hint of dark mystery. In the last couple of books/movies, the story line has taken a change to a more serious and dark quality. The acting is less than desirable and the villain is overly complicated making it a bit annoying to the point of unbelievability. Deathly Hollow's part I is a waste of money and time. If this was the first movie of the series, I don't think it would make it to the box office. If the Harry Potter team doesn't 'bring it' in the last part, it will ruin a great storyline.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a 2010/2011 two-part epic fantasy film directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and based on the novel of the same name by J.

Best so far,"Wow... how ISN'T this movie amazing? Having grown up (and continuing to grow up) with the series, I can firmly say that this film is the BEST! It is by far the closet to the book! There are many small details and scenes that only a true Harry Potter fan would be able to recognize. I am very glad that the producers decided to split the Deathly Hallows in half... this is obviously needed to really capture the magic of the novel. Not only is this movie accurate, but as a film, it is pretty stunning! The cinematography is simply marvelous! The acting is superb! Being a teenager, I feel as if the characters have grown with me... the film series has grown perfectly with its generation, which gives many viewers that much of a greater experience! I laughed hysterically, I watched in horror, and I cried (all of which I did while reading the book). Cannot wait for Part II, and once again be THAT kid that goes into the theater dressed up not like Harry Potter, but a true Hufflepuff, specifically Ernie McMillan.

"Dark, creepy, threatening",The dark storyline & style continue. Voldemort's Death Eaters gain the upper hand as they try to find and kill Harry Potter.The story picks up where the 'Half Blood Prince' left off with a fast pace and a good level of suspense.

Couldn't describe how well the movie transcribed the book,"To say the least, David Yates and his staff have nearly perfected the art of filmography transcription. Although every nook and cranny could not be filled as with a book, the motion picture does an excellent job of capturing the fear, angst, passion, and depression that are so very easily displayed in the novel. The Actors have all matured wonderfully and it really shows that they are trying to earn their way legitimately as actors in the world. No longer able to ride the role of a child or adolescent, the 3 are sent off on their own as adults, completely responsible and alone. The film captured each character's... character really quite well. What we witnessed in the theater were by what seemed by all senses, real emotion. There is little more a director, producer, actor, and most importantly a fan could ask for. Thankyou David Yates, can't wait for part 2",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sitting on the fence,"The latest installment of the Harry Potter series has many good elements including cinematography and humorous moments but it feels as though the balance is off and often it can be seen as bland, boring, or out of place. There needs to be a balance on all sides and I found myself questioning whether or not it could be achieved.I would like to begin with the review by talking about the acting. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), and Rupert Grint (Ronald Weasley) have matured in front of the audience over the years. That, however, does not mean that they are exempt from criticism. At certain times they do give it their all and you can almost feel the passion that they are exerting. The next scene can be entirely different in that they seem like they want little to do with the film and are acting only so that they can move on. The marvel of cinema is that you are supposed to allow yourself to believe that these people are not actors; they are the characters that they portray. This is the first film that has fallen below the standards. In their defense though an actor is only as good as the script he is working with, leading me into the quality of the writing.While not taken verbatim from the book there are a number of scenes that play out almost entirely like the original story. I understand that writers and directors add their personal artistic liberties and this is a movie that can do it well despite having to change details due to the errors of previous movies. I have heard other reviewers saying that this film is very close to the book. I can debate that as there were a decent number of elements/encounters/details that were completely overlooked. They did have the common sense to point out the inconsistencies on occasion (partially breaking the fourth wall). Still, the timing and pacing of the script felt either really rushed or too slow and/or unnecessary.Next is the music. Unfortunately there is not much to say about it. This film seems to rely on the lack of music as a means to heighten tension or awkward feelings. While this technique has been used in other films successfully in the past Harry Potter has always been a series that uses a grand musical score to evoke emotions. This one, not so much.Overall I am sitting on the fence for this film. The one suggestion I have is that if you are a Harry Potter fan then it is worth watching at least once. If you are a fan of the book, be warned that you should keep an open mind to the changes that have been made. It may make the difference between loving it or hating it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stayed true to the book than the others in series...,There are two kinds of people watching the movie...people who read the book and people who haven't...I've read the book and noticed the movie being close to the actual story than all the other movies in the series...Both people who have read the book and the ones who haven't can enjoy this one...The movie is slow paced...as was the first half of the book...performances were better...the graphics and settings were as good as expected...the movie does end abruptly but it has to be kept in mind that it is a two part series. The darker tone sets the mood for the story...

Frustrating uneven entry,Rating6/10This second last installment is frustrating for its pacing issues. After an excellent opening skirmish the movie's pace slackens.

Harry Potter and the Series That Just Shouldn't End,"Seriously, I'm glad that the second part to this is a few months away because I'd hate to see this series end. As the film reflects back to previous events in the earlier installments, I myself reflected back at where I was in my life during each movie. The very first installment, I was practically fresh out of high school. And now here I am, witnessing the first part of the final installment. I've come a long way.Those who have read the book would know that Deathly Hallows follows it quite well. There are subtle differences, but none that would distract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Therefore, if you are one of those people who were disappointed at how butchered the previous movies were to the books, then you shouldn't have a problem with this one.To those who don't know, this film is about Harry, Ron, and Hermoine setting out to find the horcruxes that must be destroyed in order to defeat Voldemort. They don't really know where the horcruxes are, or how to destroy them. Meanwhile, Voldemort's minions are searching for them and the people that they care about are in mortal danger.The reason why I consider this one being the best one so far (although I really loved the first Harry Potter) is its brisk pace. In previous installments, there always seem to be this lag time. These lag times usually entail something being introduced to the characters that is vital to later in the film. This resulted in slowing the films' pace. It didn't really happen here. There were some slow parts, but something would pick up the speed and usually kept the audience laughing. There's a scene where Harry and Hermoine were distraught, and Harry danced with her like an idiot. It helped lighten the mood and also brought interest to the scene.There's a lot of action in this one, and the performances were unbelievable. I heard a lot of praise for Helena Bonham Carter as Belatrix. She did a wonderful job and a lot creepier this time around. The three leads: Harry, Ron and Hermoine all did a superb acting job this time around because their chemistry was on the mark. Also, there's an animation sequence in the film, which, at first, I thought was out of place because never had there been an animation sequence in a Harry Potter film before. It was awesome.I also welcome back Doby. What took him so long to come back?The only negative thing I could say about it and it's very minor is how the film ended. It just left you wanting more. But it is the first part and we would just have to wait on what will happen in the conclusion on the second part.J.K. Rowling is probably writing a new Harry Potter as we speak.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You won't be disappointed...,"I highly recommend this movie. If you've seen the prior installments of the series, you're in for a real treat--this is the best of the lot. The acting is superb, the pacing just right, the cinematography beautiful and dramatic, the settings gorgeous. As always, one can't expect the movie to slavishly follow the book; sticklers for details and favorite scenes may be disappointed. But the essence of the story in character development, in tone, and in the great themes of the series are all captured quite well.Exciting, engaging, somber and humorous, well done! And someone in our group had not read the stories and seen only one of the prior movies and followed along quite well...

The Brilliant Beginning of the Epic End...,"Three years ago, the world held its collective breath as it flipped through the pages of the the final installment of JK Rowling's epic 7-part series, seeking the satiation for a curiosity that had all but consumed them absolutely for years-who would live? who would die? and what would become of the survivors? Thousands of theories and counter-theories later, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows revealed the answers at long last (some of which had already been predicted); but it wasn't just the resolution of sub-plots and character arcs and the solving of long-standing magical mysteries that gripped the reader, but above all the sheer epic scale and scope of this saga within a saga that spanned virtually the entirety of the fantastic realm spawned by Rowling. Needless to say, while the novel positively GLOWED with cinematic potential, adapting an epic such as this does present unprecedented challenges...even more so when one takes into account the Harry Potter film series predilection for liberally eliminating significant plot elements from the novels in hopes of condensing the stories for accommodation in a 2-3 hour time span. Now, the same clearly couldn't be done with the Deathly Hallows-the minutest elements were of paramount importance to the overall plot and couldn't be safely done away with without running the risk of completely butchering Rowling's story. To this end, the film-makers wisely decided to split the book into two films...And after a long wait Part I is finally here and it certainly surpasses expectations (then again, it is pretty much EXPECTED that an HP film WILL 'surpass expectations'...) The very first aspect of this film that strikes you is that it sends a message. A very strong message that the wizarding world has changed-for the worse. The trademark WB logo we see at the start of the film is shown to be rusting...in stark contrast to the glowing WB of old; much like the circumstances of the characters have taken a turn for the worst. Death Eaters are perpetually swirling about in the skies, waiting to attack members of the Order of the Pheonix when the slightest opportunity presents itself...Voldemort has taken control of the Ministry, using its official authority and power to hunt down dissidents to his fascist regime of pure-blood supremacy...and Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced out of the sanctuary of their homes, on the run in the wilderness, with barely a clue as to how they are to accomplish the crucial task their deceased mentor Albus Dumbledore left them-finding and destroying the Horcruxes (fragments of Voldemort's soul) that anchor the Dark Lord to life.Understandably, this film boasts not only of a darker tone but a radically different direction from its predecessors-no longer are the legendary trio of teenage wizards students...they are now fugitives from the 'evil empire', soldiers in a war they are ever so close to losing. Freed from the confines of Hogwarts, director David Yates seizes the opportunity to place the protagonists against the backdrop of a number of breathtaking scenic locations and in a number of situations (expertly crafted by Rowling) which provide a wealth of variety as opposed to the schoolyard atmosphere of previous installments-at one point we see Harry, Ron and Hermione on a Mission Impossible-style mission-breaking into the Ministry of Magic in order to steal a locket that might just be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes; later we catch them in an intensely blink-and-you-miss-it fast-paced chase through a forest; to say nothing of the chaotic duel in the claustrophobic confines Malfoy Manor towards the end. Truly, the action scenes are a class apart but another area where this film shines is character development-from being the boy wizard perpetually looking to Dumbledore for guidance, Harry is now the man calling the shots in this perilous quest to destroy Voldemort; and even his trusted 'sidekicks' Ron and Hermione are beginning to question their participation in his mission. Ron's violent emotional outburst in the middle of the film, Hermione's despair and wistfulness for a simpler past and Harry's eternal self-doubt and frustration leave as indelible an imprint on the viewer's mind as much as any of the magnificent displays of magic (courtesy of some truly revolutionary SFX) does-Ron near mental-breakdown after being psychologically tortured by a fragment of Voldemort's soul is the most emotionally powerful sequence in the film, as is the Harry-Hermione 'dance scene', a rare moment of light-heartedness in an otherwise grim story which exemplifies in many ways the deep love the two characters share, even in the absence of any romantic involvement.If there is one shortcoming in this film, it is that scarcely enough focus is given to the titular 'Deathly Hallows' in the film (save for a truly fantastic animation sequence explaining the legend behind them) as opposed to the novel-though no doubt they will be addressed in Part II given the crucial part they are to play at the end of the story. Dumbledore's backstory with the Dark wizard Gellert Grindlewald, the discovery of which has a debilitating impact on Harry's morale in the book, is likewise also sidelined, though perhaps that can be forgiven, given the time constraints.Despite these minor issues, the film does end up pretty well, which is to say, it ends badly for our characters who, having barely escaped with their lives (for what may well be the umpteenth time) watch one of their oldest friends die-to say nothing of Voldemort having reached the very pinnacle of his magical power in the very last scene...well, as those who have read the book know, things are only going to get worse before they even start remotely looking better for our heroes and undoubtedly Part I has left the audiences restless for the next (and final) installment that chronicles the (inevitable) triumph of good over evil in the wizarding world.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Much build-up, yet not enough thrill","I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.It is Harry's supposedly 7th year at school, but he chooses not to return to Hogwarts. Instead, he vows to set out to find and destroy all the Horcruxes, with his friends, Ron and Hermione. As the trio searches, they come across the existence of the Deathly Hallows- the 3 most powerful objects in the Wizarding World.I will be honest. When this first came out last year, I was expecting something big. But instead, I found myself getting bored. I found that I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought that I would. I found myself missing the fun that the previous films had. Where was the friendly banter between students? Where were the Quidditch games? In ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"", there is none of that. I guess I can't blame them. It's all serious now. Voldemort's growing stronger by the minute and everyone's getting ready.This movie wasn't all bad. But I found that, although it was a lengthy film, nothing ever really happened. All the good stuff took place in the first and last 10 minutes of the movie. What happened in between? I can't even remember. What a disappointment.It's sad knowing that the series is coming to an end. I just hope that ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" will deliver and give the series the BANG! it deserves to go out with. This film just consisted of pure build-up. Just development, development and more development. Not that that wasn't bad, but where was the action and thrill? I hope that the last film will redeem the series. The franchise really needs a brilliant ending.Viewed on: July 14, 2011",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best out of the lot,"First of all the movie was the most awesome of the big novels. I mean the director always has to change screenplay for big novels because of their sheer size. The Potter fans who only watch the movies and never read the novels will find every movie awesome but for the ones who read the novels and come to watch the movies, they will always be a tad bit disappointed. This one was not that. David Yates had the tough task of making a movie out of a book which for us fans holds a special place in heart. He did a great job of it and hope something good from the second movies as well. There are one or two disappointments but overall very spine chilling and enjoyable especially the dangerous scene where Hermione is left to fend off against a group of pure blood supremacists. The scene where Dobby dies was as emotional in the movie as in real life, but the burial was a bit incomplete. The actors have grown in stature as their characters too. Emma Watson did very well in her emotional scenes and the guys were good too. For me the best movie out of the lot. Waiting for the DVD's to come out now.The only thing that remains to be seen is how the second part turns up.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very good, but... well, it's not the book.","I can't help being very strongly biased about this film; I am a huge fan of J. K. Rowling's original work. I felt so excited about my favourite story coming to the big screen that, as a true fan (in all the worst senses of the word), my judgement is impaired in two ways: I am both over-enthusiastic and extremely difficult to satisfy.Let's be fair: it is a good movie, ""good"" meaning entertaining. You don't want to loose a second of it, and it really feels like a quarter of the actual runtime - but that might also just be my ""over-enthusastic"" side. The fact that I had watched all of the other Harry Potter films half a dozen times each in preparation for this one, and also that I knew the Deathly Hallows book almost by heart, made me enjoy immensely this opus, whether it'd be only out of ""newness"".But, and maybe I am being less subjective here after all, it is not a film of great quality - nor were we to expect one. The idea of splitting the last HP in two is convenient (""Convenient? More like awesome!""), but this leaves the first part fairly empty in comparison to, say, the other HP films. Moreover, it has to try to compensate for all of the (plot)holes the other films had left it with. Those who haven't read the book would therefore find a lot of continuity mistakes that are difficult to forgive. Although most of the story is well-elaborated, suspenseful and imaginative, the lines are so much reduced to basics that you can't help the feeling that the screenplay must have been revised and rewritten a lot. Yet, we get a few extremely enjoyable moments - some funny, some sweet - every now and then.As for the acting, well, we're only sorry to see so little of Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and company. But the main trio's acting skills have improved again, and although I still wouldn't hire them if I were to make a movie, I have to admit that they do their job all right (at least, as far as Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are concerned...). Very funny, also, to recognize their manners and mimics in the three older characters they are supposed to be impersonating.All in all: it's not the book, but it's still magic :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing to remember,"I watched this movie like a year ago, and had no interest to re-watch it, so this review is totally based on my already faded memory. Don't get me wrong, my memory faded not because I have problems remembering thing, but because this movie has nothing much to remember.To start, this Part 1 is totally different from the previous 6 Harry Potter movies. There is no Hogwarts, no Quidditch, no funny lessons. The film is set with very dark tone and theme, with visuals full of fear and loathing, doom and gloom. No more guidance from Dumbledore, no more protection from the adult wizards, it's the story of our three kids out on the streets, by themselves, trying to find and destroy something called ""Horcruxes"". Most of the time what they do is wandering in the forest, arguing, being jealous of each other, and our poor Harry sometimes hold his head in pain because of the Dark Lord Voldemort. The supporting cast did great, as usual, but too bad, the Trio takes most of the screen time and I can't get enough of my favorite evil side Snape by Alan Rickman and Bellatrix by Helena Bonham Carter.Being Part 1 of 2, it goes without saying that there is very little closure come the film's finale, which despite being long-overdue within the lengthy 146-minute runtime, arrives with no climax. To be honest, there's still a lot of fun to be had, such as a gripping infiltration in to Ministry of Magic and a terrifying confrontation with Voldemort's pet-snake Nagini, and a fairy tale about the Deathly Hallows, but overall, it does not come close to expectation.For more reviews, please visit: http://voicemotion.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not as good as the originals,"It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one, if they haven't read the books already.With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years (and films) progress. Part I of the ""Deathly Hallows"" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody.I won't waste time trying to talk about the performances, because they are all great and powerful in their own way. Never mind that many of the cast members are very talented veteran British actors (try getting John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, Jason Isaacs and Bill Nighy in the same film again) - the three young actors who we have come to love and care for following the first film a decade ago, basically carry the franchise on their shoulders, and this film is no exception. Radcliffe looks handsome, Grint looks gruff, and Watson looks gorgeous. They've grown into fine young people.Screenwriter Steve Kloves doesn't forget to add the mood and gloom to the story as it slowly unfolds, but then again he adds some light humor to the film when it needs it. Bonus points for making this not only a visual spectacle, but also a character-driven ensemble; there's some complex characterization here. Also there's some action which aren't seen on screen, but mentioned by the characters. It's OK, because it's necessary for the brisk pacing, and it's not really that important anyways. Besides, the human mind can imagine these images far more powerfully.There are many themes in this film. Sacrifice, determination, (obviously) friendship, and above all - acceptance. As the films progressed the films started to gain an increasingly dark momentum - signaling that all hope may be lost. But in the end, will good triumph over evil? Like the film, real life isn't so sure. Also, the fact that the actors and crew are moving on after a decade of making these films - it's also another way of acceptance - the films have ended, they're moving on for the better of their lives/careers. It's real life, and I wish all these promising young actors brilliant lives and careers ahead of them.""Hallows: Part I"" is many parts thrilling, as there are quite a number of intense action sequences. Many of them, of course, are done with well-rendered visual effects, and in this one they just blend in at a natural level without being too jarring. However, the action sequences are perfectly blended in with the gripping, dramatic moments. They don't feel heavy handed and it's beautiful to look at. The animated sequence about the origins of the Deathly Hallows is an absolute masterclass and jaw-droopingly beautiful to both watch and listen. If separated by itself it can win an Oscar for best animated short.The crew also get their due here. David Yates has gotten a firm grip on the film's direction since directing the fifth and sixth films years ago. The cinematography is stunning and exquisite, and it gives off a certain moody hue to the film. The editing is also crisp, it's not choppy when it doesn't need to be. Alexandre Desplat's score really makes a difference, it literally puts you into the world with its beautiful, harmonious, and emotional tones.In short, I would have to say that this film is the best ""Harry Potter: film yet in all honesty. I grew up with the series, and as per the actors, it will be an emotional goodbye. But rest assured, the finale will be grand.One more thing. This interpretation of the novel is the best one yet. The novel is done justice, something not seen since the first three films. It's something for both the fans and novel-readers alike, as there are some pieces only book readers can discover while watching the film. It's definitely a huge improvement over ""Half-Blood Prince""'s adaptation, which for me is the worst Potter film.Harry Potter is a phenomenon. But, like all things, it most come to an end eventually. This is the beginning of the end, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Overall rating: 75/100",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring,"I'm glad I am not the only one that thought this was the most boring - and worst of the Harry Potter franchise. That is dragged out over two hours made it worse. The three main characters had lost their spark and almost looked bored and tired themselves. There were some very dark undertones about death and had this been around when my kids were young, I would have hesitated to let them see this. Mind you I think they would have given up after the first half hour.I guess there must have been budget constraints as there only fleeting appearances of the usual characters other than Harry and his friends and very little 'magic' and absolutely no fun.The only redeeming element for me was seeing some scenery that I had been to in real life.Very disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter,"Yes - it's here. In fact it has been here for some time. So I guess I'm late but I don't give a .... well you got it. So Harry Potter and the deathly hallows. Cool name by the way. So let's start with the plot. I mean the screenplay because we all know that the book is as awesome as hell. The screenplay is ... well not so good. I mean it's not bad either but it could of been so much better. They deleted scenes which would take couple of minutes but would add so much. And there's nothing bad about a long movie(yeah we all remember LOTR don't we?). So yeah that's that also they for some unknown reason change some lines. Like when Ron gets all angry and is about to go he says ""I sow you to the other night"" wheres in the book he said ""I got it you choose him"". I mean JK knew what she was doing and her lines would always be better than those of the dude who rote screenplay. OK, now that we're over with that - effects, yes of cause special. I've got to admit - there pretty cool. Of cause it's no Dark Knight nor Inception though it's understandable since Nolan wasn't around (dan it). Acting. It was pretty good. Rupert Green rules as always. Atmosphere is not as good as in the book but whatever. So all in all it's a good adaptation and you've got to cheek it out. You know you would anyway it's a bloody HP we're talking about.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Viewers And Fans Of This Series Would Have Been Feeling DEATHLY Knowing That This Is The Beginning Of The End Of The Series,"This film and storyline instalment might be the beginning of the end of the series, but it could have been better.

Viewers and fans clearly were able to see that the cast and crew really pushed themselves to keep the whole storyline of the series connected.I felt that some parts were missing. This particular storyline could have been taken up another level. I felt that some parts in this film and storyline instalment were unnecessary.

"It was good, but left me with a similar feeling that i get when i finish my appetizer","Last year, i finally gave into watching Harry Potter. Up until then, i never read any of the books, nor i have seen any of the movies. So being somewhat of a movie buff, i did both. I want to see what this obsession is all about. What drives these fans to go absolutely crazy. So after reading all the books, and watching all the movies up until this point, i must say.....it's just okay. I don't hate them, but i don't love them. To me, they just fall right in the middle. To this day, i will never understand those damn ""Twlight"" movies, but i can understand how someone will become engrossed by these fantasy tales. They're no Lord of the Rings or Star Wars.....but they still do a decent job of keeping my interest.In this review, i will not compare everything to the book, because this is a movie review, not a book report. But i will say one quick thing just to get it out of the way....this movie follows the book better than the rest, i mean, duh....it's split in two parts, how could it not be? But all those questions of ""Woah they left that out?"" will hardly be raised for all you book lovers out there.Now, as far the movie.....i will say that i enjoyed it. At times, it did seem to drag on. In fact, it was very relative to the first hour of ""The Two Towers""......yes, that is both a good and bad thing. It's good because you really begin to accept the characters on a more personal level......it's bad because they keep doing the same damn thing for over an hour.However the main concern of this picture is it's title....Part 1. The feeling you get after you watch this movie is somewhat relative to eating a couple of dinner roles before your main course is served. I mean sure the roles are delicious, but your just biting time until your juicy steak arrives. And the problem is, it never comes. Don't get me wrong, you leave the theater feeling very satisfied. But on a long enough time line, nobody is going say you know what guys, let's watch Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, because thats the best......no no, your just going to skip to the next one, because it has the big payoff that your looking for.Bottom Line.....it will have those die-hard fanatics clawing even harder at the walls, but it will have the rest of us saying ""Um, so do we get both movies for the same ticket?"". All i can say is, it's a great setup, and all it's doing is making the finale' even more grand. But in comparing this to the others, i still like ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring don't waste your time with this or the 2nd!,"Completely lacking in imagination, storytelling, and cinematography, this is the worst I have seen in the series.Aside from the first 15 and last 15 minutes, The Hallows is the most boring and badly presented to date. I understand character development and a sub story was going on during this portion, but it is so blatantly spoon fed and boring it was borderline offensive. Characters should be developed by following them through a story, not by stopping (or slowing) the story to develop the character! As for audience appeal I can say only this: being a PG-13 movie with such dark and sexual overtones the dialog and presentation feels aimed at the intellect of a 6 year old audience.Further, the way that characters just hop in and out of scenes, unannounced, and unexplained ruined most every major action sequence for me.The three main characters can't ever figure anything out on their own or spot obvious traps. They just dumbly wander from dangerous situation to the next while trying not to unravel simple clues. They are constantly bailed out by random characters showing up at just the right random time and place. I didn't read this book, but I have read a few, and the author seems to describe the situations and traps as subtle and tricky. The director failed at this concept completely.They should not have split this into two movies, and I honestly hope, when I watch part 2 at home, the director pulls his production team, editing, and writing together for something that makes sense and serves to fill more then just time. This movie was terrible and a waste of time!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A nice respite,"It's ironic that many have hailed this movie as boring, a waste of time, and a shameless moneymaker, when I actually enjoyed it for two of those reasons. In the recently dramatic Hogwarts years, with beloved characters dropping like flies, isn't it nice to be able to catch your breath and watch two teenagers wander around in the forest without anything bad happening to them? And really, who cares that you spent an extra seven dollars at the movie theaters-which was the ticket price in 2010-since you got to see characters you grew up with in a world you immersed yourself in the past nine years up on the big screen? It doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me, and since the movies preceding and following Part One are so heavy, a respite is welcome.In this movie, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson decide to leave school and pursue the destruction of the great villain destroying all the good in the wizarding world. They're on the lookout for several magical objects that house part of Ralph Fiennes's power, but since the final book got split into two movies, it's a fair assumption that they don't accomplish their goal in this one. For most of the movie, the trio wanders around near the ocean, by the forest, and in their friends' houses. If that sounds incredibly boring, have no fear. Rupert becomes enormously moody and jealous, and he leaves their party of three. Dan and Emma continue to wander around by themselves, and as they're in very close quarters, they bond. Plenty of fans include their spontaneous dance as one of their favorite moments of the entire franchise. It's sweet, casual, and their chemistry lights up the screen like fireflies.The movie isn't completely without drama, tears, or violence. After all, the teenagers are trying to save the wizarding world and take down an incredibly powerful and evil bad guy with no nose! I liked this one better than Part Two because many people make it out of this movie alive, and even though there are some sad bits, it's not overwhelmingly depressing. Also included in this one is a pretty cool animated sequence explaining the meaning of the title that feels simultaneously realistic and stylized.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great first part of the big finale,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" was once again directed by David Yates and is this first part of the seventh instalment in the Harry Potter franchise. After Harry has learned about the dark magic of Horcruxes that Voldemort used to split his soul into seven pieces, he and his friends are left to find the remaining five in order to have a chance to defeat the Dark Lord once and for all.The decision to split the seventh book into two movies was very good and actually helped the material, as there was still a lot to tell. This is a great first part to the big finale that is the second part. It is a very slow character driven story, however unlike its predecessor ""Half-Blood Prince"" this film has great humour, emotional moments and good story-telling even during the first and second act. There really is not much to complain about this film, however in the end it is yet another drag to the last entry of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter ..you lil gem...,"When David Yates took over the franchise from OoTP, i was a lil skeptical about his dark themed direction, but boy oh boy is he a great director or what? DH part 1 is exactly the penultimate movie you would want to see before Voldemort finally rests in piece(s). It has stunning visuals, great acting by Dan, Grint & Watson and a great screenplay to boast off.I quite liked the idea where the first part ends, 'cos it gives ample scope to show the battle of Hogwarts in second half, i so wanna see Neville chop Nagini with the sword of Griffyndor...The film appears to go a bit slow specially when Ron exits and Harry and Hermione are left to fend for themselves. but its all part of the story and im sure all potterheads are gonna understand this..Overall, the first part sets tone for a grand finale...

"The best yet, sets the stage nicely for the grand finale","The decision to split the Deathly Hallows into two parts was not just welcome, but basically imperative.

It is far more atmospheric than it's predecessors and the quality of acting is significantly improved.The story whips along without feeling rushed or compromised and the whole film is gripping and enjoyable.

Absolutely fantastic!,"After HP6, I was beginning to worry that the HP films would turn into another example where we see the motion picture doesn't match well with the novel. I must admit that I am revealed after seeing this installment. The film was very well made and inline with the book. The emphasis given to different events is distributed in a good balance. You see a very good mixture of fear, confusion, and that slightest hope that the characters always keep with them. The psychology of every scene is wonderfully executed. I felt like I am also going through this journey with the characters on the screen. The division of the book into two films was a great idea and where it is split into two is perfectly chosen. You want to see more but you also feel like ""yes, part one is over, let's see the rest next year"". Congratulations to everyone in the cast.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most Mature of the Harry Potter films,"Harry Potter has Grown up. Along with Hermione Granger and and Ronald Weasly, the three friends began this adventure at Hogwarts, and what started out as a silly romp through magical inanity has turned in to something very dark. Although Hogwarts is not where this story takes place, it is still part of the ongoing story. As with Lord of the Rings, the story has taken on proportions that Author J.K. Rowling probably had no control over - This story is telling itself and under the superb direction of David Yates, who has been at the helm for the last few Potter films, has been brought to vivid life. Magic and Technology clash in the middle of London in the sight of all of the unsuspecting Muggles.Each Potter film has been subsequently better then the previous films, and this film hits the peak... all stops are pulled out, nothing is held back... And so this part of the story which began with Goblet of Fire and the reawakening of ""You-Know-Who"" is a lot like the final parts of Lord of the Rings. Catastrophe has been reached, we await the EuCatastrophe.We know that Potter has been accumulating useful magical objects during his education at Hogwarts, and in this film he uses most of them. Also, look for the very first Magic-Gadget used by Dumbledore in the first Potter movie. Now we are in a race to find the objects that make up the Deathly Hallows - We know who has one of these objects, it has been used in previous Potter films. It is not used in this one. And now we know ""You-Know-Who"" is searching for these same objects. Who will get them first? Many questions which have been unanswered through the entire series are now being revealed, some questions we did not know were being asked. The doorway that Serious Black fell through as he died, what was that, where does it lead? These loose ends are just beginning to be tied up and I look very forward to the final installment of the Potter series - Will these things be explained, or will Harry have to explore more and more nightmarish scenarios? Although Deathly Hallows is part 1 of a two part story, this film stands by itself and some of the questions are already being answered.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Quite well directed and the young cast has grown in acting skills,"I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books.I was pleasantly surprised while watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. I can hardly wait to see Part 2.David, Emma and Rupert have grown so much in their craft (acting!). I also think the movie captured most of the important ideas of the book and I really love the way they handled the division into two parts.Part 2 is going to be very interesting to watch!One review mentioned the popping in and out by characters so quickly from out of nowhere that it spoiled the movie for him.I knew exactly what was happening - they were apparating. I thought the film ""apparating"" sequences were well done and DID give you the sense of how ""apparating"" is described in the books. It doesn't look pleasant although I'm sure we muggles would risk that if we only had the ability to do it! :) Perhaps anyone who is not familiar with the Harry Potter books or Harry's Wizarding World needs to watch this with a Harry Potter fan in tow to explain the things that Muggles might not understand.Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Unfortunately, What Really Lets This Film Down Is The Pacing As It's All Over The Place As Well As The Overbearing Score, But Still Pretty Solid Regardless","Pros:
1. The colour palette is brilliant as it moves seamlessly from warm and inviting in the beginning to signify happier times, to cold and dark to represent the bleak oppressive world.
2. The special effects look fantastic as usual and provide many memorable moments, for example the seven Harry Potter's at the beginning.
3. The sound mixing and sound design are incredible again. If there's one thing the Harry Potter series has done really well consistently, it's the sound mixing and design.
4. There is once again great chemistry between Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter).
5. The animated Peverell brothers scene was beautifully animated with its haunting visuals, and read by Emma Watson.
6. The action moments are thoroughly enjoyable, particularly with their grown-up execution.
7. There are tremendous performances by Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange).Cons:
1. Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden) was clearly unreliable and unwilling to help out, so why did the Order of the Phoenix trust him with transporting Harry Potter? It seems like a lazy way to insert tension and drama by lazily killing off Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson).
2. The score is often overused and becomes slightly annoying, particularly as it weakens the serious, tense and emotional moments.
3. The pacing is way off. It skips through the important moments as if it's just ticking events off a list to include from the book. It then drags needlessly inbetween those important events.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a complete waste of my time.,"Let me put it this way. THIS FILM WAS TERRIBLE! I can not believe that I gave up going to a party to go to a midnight screening of this piece of crap. It was horrifically boring. Most of the film was mellow and pointless. I thought this film would be good for the 8.3 on this website. But apparently, those idiots do not have a good taste of movies. If it was a 2 hour film of Harry, Ron, and Hermione taking a dump it would be more entertaining than this crap! It also had a terrible ending with no warning. In conclusion, this movie did had some good action and some funny moments, but if you were to choose between this and a party, I would choose the party because the director made 3 crappy films in a row, and although this was better than the crappy 5th and 6th films, it was still on my ""waste of my time"" list. I certainly hope that they won't screw up part 2, because if those kids are getting millions of dollars for this crap, then someone's gonna get sued.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The magic returns,After the slightly below par 5th and 6th instalments of this saga I was pleasantly surprised with this entry.All the Hogwart aspects of these films are stripped away making this film feel more like a road movie as Harry and his friends search for objects that will destroy the evil Voldemort.It's not without its slow moments but overall this film maintains the ever growing darkness that this series has been brewing towards while also allowing the three principle performers to play some scenes with depth. The cut off point for this film feels rightly placed while also leaving the audience wanting more.All of the normal faces from previous films return albeit briefly but this film much like the last two feel like a drawn out build up for the final film.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfectly Set-up for the Finale,"David Yates is credited for having pushed the Harry Potter franchise down a shallow gutter. The last 2 movies in the series were an average fare compared to the previous versions, but with the new Harry Potter movie, he manages to push it all behind, and he might have just brought the franchise back to its glory again. But be warned, if you proceed to watch this movie without having followed the previous movies, or at least have failed to read the books, then this movie will be clear to you as a person who has just been cast the 'Obliviate' spell (which in HP terms, purges a person's memory). Another piece of advice, this movie is much more mature and darker than the previous movies. What started out as a fantasy for kids has moved to the next level and taken over the mantle of a wholesome movie for all the fans of the franchisee.As usual, the movie starts with the the group trying to get Harry Potter to safety by flying him out of the Godric's Hollow out of reach of Voldemort and his gang of Death-Eaters. Some breathtaking scenes follow it up where he is escorted to the Burrows with the Death-Eaters and Voldemort trying to take him out. The rest of the movie deals with Harry, Ron and Hermione trying to solve the riddle of finding and destroying the Horcruxes.The first part of the seventh movie definitely is a bit slow but caters out well as the movie progresses. The action scenes have been perfectly orchestrated, and some of the scenes have been shot extremely well. The first half does well to keep the movie audiences well attended. There is rarely a dull moment, but the problem arises after the interval, when the trio spend most of their time in a tent in the wilderness. This is where the movie starts to drag a little and there are long unnecessary stretches which could have been cut out of the movie to eliminate the extra minutes. But it never fails to let the viewer go with its interesting moments that occur at regular intervals. At 2 hours and 26 minutes, you might feel the movie is a bit long, and yes it is indeed. But its worth it. The screenplay is extremely well handled by Steve Kloves. The best part is how Yates plays with the viewer's emotions, especially during the climax where a thrilling part of the movie takes a wild turn and engulfs you with the other side of emotion that you would have never expected. Nonetheless, the high point of this movie is how well it is set-up for the launch of Part-II of the Deathly Hallows and an exceptionally well done animated sequence about a story of three brothers. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson who started out as kids, have grown out of the shell, and have probably given their best performance yet. (Especially Emma and Rupert). A special mention to Peter Mullan who portrays Yaxley, has a very small part, but plays it out extremely well. There are definitely the let-down moments, but the lead-up to the big finale is definitely exciting. Rating: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's nearly all over!,"This must go down as contender for longest film title although I think Borat may claim that crown. So we are nearly at a close! 7 books and 7 films later with one left and finally we can put Harry Potter to bed for a good nights sleep. He needs it.I'm not even going to begin to explain the plot in this latest installment, part 1 of 2, that the seventh and final book has been stretched over. The film is enjoyable, with some great sequences, lashings of special effects all of which look great on the big screen, a stellar cast of Britain's acting elite and hints of comedy and romance as Harry Potter and pals battle on towards what we can only expect will be an epic showdown with Voldermort.I read the first four books, but lost interest and haven't ventured further, but I have seen all the films (although I can't remember all of them enough to rate here) and whilst my interest isn't exactly enormous, I feel duty bound to see them through to the end, after all I've come this far. For true fans this will be enough to excite just as much as previous films and no doubt frustrate that it's been split into two with most having to wait until June 2011 for the final installment. For me, with my mild level of interest there is a lot to enjoy, but because I'm not a huge fan I struggled at times trying to keep up with it all, who's who, what everything means, not that it's excessive difficult to understand. My other issue is that the film is just so long, at two and half hours it pushes my limits for watching a film, so goodness knows how younger fans cope. . Still, that aside the film looks wonderful and there is something er, magical about taking a ride with Harry Potter et al. The rich imagination of J.K. Rowling is vividly brought to life with multiply Harry Potters in one scene to people flushing themselves down the loo to get to the ministry. It's for the most part all good fun, a little darker now as the story reaches it's climax, but overall it keeps as the saying goes the magic alive.More review at my site: iheartfilms.weebly.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the Best Harry Potter movie so far,"the film is loyal to the book without being boring. It has the right atmosphere - very dark, much tension, but there are enough funny moments to change the mood in the right time. Visual effects are stunning as they should be, wouldn't expect anything less than that. as a huge H.P fan, I'd say the film is highly recommendable.the decision to cut the film to two was smart, since the length of the book makes it impossible to make a movie that will be both loyal to the text and won't last a day or cut out important moments like in the fourth part (Goblet of Fire), which was truly a shame, as it's the most spectacular book of them all. The film ended just in the right moment to leave me with a taste for more!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This are Dark times,"Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. The acting was fantastic. The trio plays their characters exceptionally well. Emma and Rupert was outstanding in my opinion. As for Daniel, well lets just say, those two has outshines him this time around. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was a very standout character, Bill Nighy's Scrimgeour certainly look like a lion, Helena's Bellatrix was menacing and torturous as ever, Snape was being himself like he always is, Lucius and Narcissa also plays their supporting role well (I love it when Narcissa shivers as Dobby was making his speech). However, I do think Ryhs Ifans's Xeno was 'over cooked' compare to the Xeno in the book.The Harry Potter series has inspired generations. I grew up with the books and the movies. As I grew, the characters, both fictional and actual actors grew with me.I am so impressed and excited about the accomplishments of this series.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1While most teen mages are binge drinking potions and experimenting with hex, the sophomoric sorcerer in this fantasy film is more concerned with retrieving magical trinkets.With Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his cronies (Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Tom Felton) on their trail, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) embark on a quest for Voldemort's fragmented soul.En route, they unearth a fairy tale that speaks to three enchanted items that could turn the tide in their battle against evil: the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility.The first half of the seventh and final installment of the Harry Potter franchise, Deathly Hallows is the most rewarding: the pacing is precipitate, the action is amplified and the relationships are thrown through the wringer.Nevertheless, conjuring up a sequel inside of an existing sequel is the mischievous handiwork of marketing witchcraft.

"Harry Potter, the evolution","I remember when I saw the first movie , I was about the same age as Harry was back then. I had read the book first and I was sold immediately, so I wanted to go see the movie as soon as possible. Ever since I have watched Harry Potter grow and evolve. The movies got better, more mature , more intriguing but also darker,just as the books did . The Deathly Hollows is simply the perfect finale to a legendary franchise. Just like any Harry Potter fan I was afraid that the movie would not do just to the book but I couldn't be more wrong. The movie is brilliant , it has everything it needs to be a good movie but without being your typical blockbuster . It gives the viewers what they want and it gives the readers what they want. It has thrill, action and suspense. It's grim but not to grim, it's dark but not to dark. It's exactly like everything I pictured in my mind from reading the book , the scenery, the atmosphere ,the emotion ... It's certainly the best movie from the franchise , so far . I'm confident that Part II will be a worthy successor and it will blow everyone away.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit confusing for non-fans but still entertaining,"I was quite impressed with the development of the story. It's a bit sad and a bit dark, representing the maturity of the character. I quite like the visual and sound effects, the psychological development of the 3 main characters is also quite good. If your aim is just entertainment, then this movie has it all. However, adapting too many things from books to movies makes the film quite chaotic and lack of cohesion. The clips are disjointed and also lack drama. If you haven't seen the previous 6 movies and are not a fan of this series, you will find it quite confusing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Expected more,"I'm not really what you call a Harry Potter fan, but I am a fan of good movies. Unfortunately though, I didn't find this movie all that good.Maybe you had to be a Harry Potter fan to truly appreciate it, but with it being a 2 parter, I feel like that this was the more boring of the two, with plenty of boring and irrelevant time fillers. Also with making it into a two parter, I felt like it more more about making money, than giving the general audience what they wanted.It did have its good moments, but it's alot different compared to the previous films, where they where students and the majority of it being set at Hogwarts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Kids, this isn't your movie anymore","(edited to add: Have noticed people who've given it a 10-star rating are getting an unhelpful rating by, I'm assuming, one individual.. given the fact that several of the most recent 10-star reviews have ""0 out of 1 helpful"". How very childish...)I absolutely LOVED this movie. I won't give a thing away (although I'm sure most have already read the book!). I just want to say how I loved it all: the acting, the directing, the screenplay, the effects done just right, the overall tone... as close to perfection as a movie can be. I am so grateful that this series has grown with our kids. My oldest is now 18 and was a little child when the first movie came out. Rather than being dumbed down, it's grown, become more mature, darker, as it should (think the opposite of the Star Wars prequel to understand what I mean).Excellent!

Darker but lacks the magic we know and love,"Story:
As Harry, Ron and Hermione race against time and evil to destroy the Horcruxes, they uncover the existence of the three most powerful objects in the wizarding world: the Deathly Hallows.Review:
This one is far darker than any previous Harry Potter movie and it fits adults, however, I cant help but feel it lacks a bit of the magic we all know and love in the series, and it was more focused on Potter and his friends which is fine but the series used to produce a lot of characters with each movie which was great and interesting, also it has fillers not to the point makes you hate it but it would have been better if it wasn't filmed and save you more time.Anyway it wasn't a bad movie but it definitely could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
These are getting worse,"The ending is closer and the movies are worse. Still they are trying to make an action film out of Harry Potter, but what's worse is how the filmmakers clearly don't know what to cut. There is such a long time of... nothing. They do nothing. There's some dialogue but it's not always entirely insightful. And there's the weird dance scene and all that. Yes, those scenes how Harry, Ron and Hermione were on the run for a really long time, but that's really frustrating for the audience. How about you cut that and make this film shorter - or better yet - include some things that were in the books but were barely mentioned in the movie.I also don't like the point where they cut the movie in two. I've checked so many times what is the half point of the book, and I think they should've cut the movie around there - where that chapter ends at least. But I guess they wanted to stuff the Deathly Hallows into this movie.Best part of the whole movie is the Tale of the three brothers. It's visually more stunning than anything we've seen in Harry Potter movies. It's so awesome it seems completely out of place in this movie. It's still of course an interesting piece of lore, and a nice way to take a break from the events in the movie.Everything went downhill after Prisoner of Azkaban. I've been wondering why I don't like Harry Potter so much anymore, but this seems to be the reason. None of the later movies were good.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Masterful,"I have seen all the Harry Potter films so far and I've not once been disappointed in any. The performances are always great,The VFX are becoming far better and The story lines are having far more bite to them. This was the first David Yates film i've seen and he made an outstanding impression (And that's coming from a Frank Miller and Zac Snyder fan) Emma Watson blew me away with one of her scenes she has with Helena Bonhem Carter. Each Potter film that comes out always impresses me more than the previous one. I've not read any of the books cause for me that would just ruin the spectacular chance of seeing it on screen. If you haven't seen this one yet than make it a mandatory goal.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, directed by David Yates, was a highly anticipated film, with some great moments, but David Yates seemed to have missed on the potential this film had, making it feel somewhat underwhelming. The way the film was structured was pretty messy, because they felt the need to split this into two films. Most events felt underdeveloped and unfinished, having no real pay off, because they needed to fit so much into this film, for Part 2 to work the way they wanted it to. Part 1 can only stand on it's own, due to the tie ins from the previous films, because it took all of the set up hits, to create just an action-packed finale. When Yates went off the source material, that's where the film takes it's dips. The stuff he throws in, just feels like unnecessary filler, because it has no real meaning to what's going on. Other than that, David Yates managed to stay fairly true to the source material, creating a nice mystery, with great stakes, and a really intriguing adventure. The pacing of the film as fine at first, then became more of a slowburn film, and it threw off the excitement this film had to offer. The tone Yates set was probably one of the darkest, and unsettling yet, almost having a slight horror vibe.If you love all of the characters of Harry Potter, you're going to have a good time with this film! David Yates incorporates a decent amount of team chemistry, but really focuses on individual motives, and it helped drive the film. The villains are now a huge presence in the films, and they're all utilized in a great way, keeping the tention and stakes high at all times. The only issues I had with some of the main characters, there were some forced conflicts and drama, that dragged on for too long, while having some inconsistencies with some of the motives.The magic and action of the film was so much fun! There were countless enjoyable sequences, where you can feel that the teams, both, behind, and in front of the camera, are feeling extremely comfortable with their abilities to perform.Overall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, has their fair share of issues, but there was just enough enjoyable moments to keep this film afloat.*stand alone rating- 6/10*",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One line,"To quote Keith Cohen: ""Non-readers and Potter virgins will be frustrated and completely lost by the confusing story."" Enough said. It is a movie that panders to the book readers. Yet for everyone else, potentially including those who have watched the other HP films as well, a lot of things are thrown by the wayside, such as character introductions, short goodbyes, and an ever-stalling narrative that falls in the middle of the too-long 2 1/2 hour screenplay.I also found the cinematography to be a bit analytic and less fluid, filling the movie with weird angles and drowning out the suspense.I thought the acting was pretty good, albeit the accents were rough. I also thought the visuals were spectacular and the sets were amazing.Knowing what the rest of the book entails from the point of stoppage, they could have added one or two more action scenes, since I feel like the last movie is going to be overflowed with those. But, overall, I enjoyed the dialogue and storyline, but some of the directing decisions I think were flawed.And in comparison to the rest of the film series, I think this movie is sort of a niche and is too far off from the others. It would be really hard to watch it in succession with the rest and keep the Harry Potter charm for non-book readers.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best Potter movie yet. Do Not Miss!,"Before you read this, know well that I am a Potter-maniac of the highest degree and anything branded 'Potter' will have my utmost approval. Nevertheless, I will try my best to review this film exactly like it isn't - just another movie.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is, in one word, God-Awesome! Now that I have briefly described the film, I will start with the reasons.Now for several years, the book fans have complained that the Potter movies take their creative liberty a little too far and deviate considerably from the story to suit cinematic paradigms. But Deathly Hallows truly takes inspiration from the book and remains faithful to even the tiniest plot point. This disproves several critics who claimed that the movie-split decision was purely financial. It is clear that Yates could not have made a single final movie and stayed true to the book at the same time. So splitting seemed obvious, resulting in the Finale getting extended to the delight of fans worldwide.The film begins, and for most part, maintains a dark, brooding tone that compliments the events of the story. The first part of Deathly Hallows has its own share of shocking deaths. But there is hardly a moment to mourn, as there's a reason to laugh in the very next. The movie starts with the effects the magical world has on Muggles - scenes of the Dursleys leaving their home and Hermoine erasing her parents memory, even as Voldemort tortures the Muggle Studies teacher from Hogwarts, who pleads for help to colleague Snape sitting right at the Dark Lord's side. With Dumbledore gone, Harry's turning of age means he should be put right into a safe house, with the flight from Privet Drive turning out to be an ambush. There-after, the movie proceeds on and this time around, the trio, instead of being on the train to Hogwarts, go around camping across beautiful landscapes to escape the Death Eaters on the prowl and gather clues that would lead them to the next bit of Voldemort's soul.Now the movie is most definitely the best one in the series so far, simply because it is much more dark and much more strongly driven. There is the slight characteristic dip somewhere in between that we've come to expect from Yates's movies. But otherwise, the film is crackling for most parts, with several moments that bring you to the edge of the seat and immediately throw you back. The music, the locales and the very feel of the film gives you the impression of oncoming dread, and in several ways the film is a perfect set-up to what I can imagine would be a magnanimous end. The movie ends on two notes, one of a burial and another of an un-burial, one tear-jerking while the other gut-wrenching.Also, the movie truly belongs to the coming-of-age trio of Harry, Ron and Hermoine as there is no one else to hog the screen space this time around. This movie tests the bonds that they've formed over the years like never before. Also, with Dumbledore's absence, Lord Voldemort becomes more visible and the audience gets to see more of him in this film. With a neat and near-flawless execution of a brilliantly written plot, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 definitely sets the tone for the final movie and gets a 4/5 from me. I recommend you go and catch this one right away.Don't miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow and does a disservice to the book,"While the other Harry Potter movies condense long books into short movies, this one tries to match the pacing of the book directly and ends up crawling at a snail's pace instead.

Review for those non-die hard book fans,"I was one of the many that were dragged along by a die hard fan. I have been made to watch all previous films and despite not having read the books I still found them enjoyable enough. But the Deathly Hallows part 1 broke the mould. It was a complete waste of time. I felt at times like I was watching a documentary about some bored kids camping in the woods. The whole film could neatly have been summarised in a conversation at the start of the second film so I can only conclude this film was purely driven by financial greed. While a book can get away with this vast periods of inactivity I'm afraid if you haven't read the book then it is incredibly tedious in a film. Unlike previous films, nothing really happens. I often go to the cinema and afterwards we discuss our ""favourite"" scenes. When we left this film someone asked me what I enjoyed about it and I actually struggled to think of something that happened that I could talk about it. My advice, if you haven't read the books, skip this and wait for Part 2 which I assume will be better. I did ask for my money back but I will never get those 3 hours back.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
lots of tears and lots of love for this film,"I don't have much to say even if I could stay here for hours talking about this amazing film. I start by saying that I cried for this film, especially at the end. Truly truly terrific, it takes you and engages you, maybe some moments are a bit slow since the last book was divided into two films and it was necessary for it to last a while, but everything seems to fit together perfectly. The fact that the story is completely focused on the mythical trio is something that personally made me even more fond of the protagonists. One of the most beautiful parts was certainly the story of the deathly hallows. In conclusion I say: dobby you are one of my favorite characters, you are in my heart. Of course i suggest this film to everybody, but certainly you must have seen all the previous films as well lol.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not kid friendly, Now an adult dark film","Harry, Hermione and Ron have grown up. The horrors they met at Hogwarts are but nostalgic memories. They are cast out now into the vastness of the world, on their own, and Voldemort and his Death Eaters draw ever closer. Also drawing near is an equally unsettling phenomenon, sexual maturity. Both are barely kept at bay in this first part of the last installment of the Harry Potter film saga. David Yates' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is a handsome and sometimes harrowing film, and will be completely unintelligible for anyone coming to the series for the first time. At 146 minutes, it confronts us with a roll call of the many, many characters in the series, and requires a nearly encyclopedic recall of the epic's previous chapters. Though I've seen all the films, there were times when I had no idea what they were talking about. Indeed, there are times when Hermione has to explain to Harry. The film opens with a frightening meeting of the Death Eaters, plotting the destruction of all three young heroes. Presiding is Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), his noseless face disturbingly like a snake's. Harry must be destroyed. That our hero survives after the myriad attacks on his life in the earlier installments does not speak well for Voldemort's minions, but this time they mean business. The late, beloved Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has left obscure clues to their whereabouts, leading to two observations: (1) Beyond a certain level of obscurity, a clue lacks usefulness, and (2) How extraordinary careless of Voldemort to leave missing pieces of his soul lying about. Setting aside actors from earlier films who have passed away (Richard Harris) or are no longer needed (Emma Thompson), let me just cite a list for those who know their actors: Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, John Hurt, Rhys Ifans, Jason Isaacs, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, David Thewlis, Warwick Davis, Tom Felton, Toby Jones, Simon McBurney, Peter Mullan and Julie Walters.

please watch it....................,"i saw the preview show yesterday,,,i cant wait for the next part....story was wonderfully depicted on screen.....all HP freaks watch it ......climax is not rosier but its adequate to create enthusiasm for next one ... on brief--Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I sees the most mature performances by its lead cast. With the most deadly task at hand, the 20 year old performances resonate the plight of youngsters standing on the threshold of adulthood.There is no room for mistakes or misunderstandings. Harry will now have to set aside everything including his love for Ginny Weasley and use all his possible magic, mad bravery and mind to destroy the mightiest Lord Voldemort which seems a nearly impossible task.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a thrilling roller coaster ride which forces you to read between the lines to get to the climax. Layer by layer the filmmaker very beautifully drops hints as he unveils the mystery slowly and steadily leaving you satiated yet desperately anticipating the second and final chapter of Deathly Hallows.As the film progresses you too start solving the jigsaw puzzle. The plot is racy, characters arresting, action scenes thrilling and cinematography chilling. The twists and turns, suspense quotient, drama and fun elements all co-exist making it one of the most gripping Harry Potter films.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I meets all the expectations you had from the most awaited final chapter of the Potter films.worth all the hype!

"A good film, with good qualities.","At the beginning, we see the Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), setting a grave mood which continues throughout the film (not continuously).However, this grimness didn't seem to continue throughout the whole film, which I was disappointed about. This, I found, was when Ron (Rupert Grint) left Harry (Daniel Radcliff) and Hermione (Emma Watson) in the first half of the film. Ron was always the grimmest of the trio, with the help of his trusty radio, which always set the mood on edge. Once Ron left, it lost most of the grave mood, which I found disappointing.The film, as a whole is good, but I found it dragged on a bit. I found that the cause of this was the highly exciting, amazing action scene at the beginning (where they get Harry to the Burrows). I found this scene the most exciting scene of the entire film and with it being so fast paced, you expect the other action scene's to be equally, if not more exciting.I found that this wasn't the case. The other action scenes were good, the only one equal to the first action sequence was the fight between Harry and Nagini. The action sequence that I thought lacked luster was the foot-chase through the woods. The problem with this scene is that the trio had always managed to fight off a fair few Death Eaters at once, but as soon as confronted with 5(?) snatchers, turn tail and run. I would have liked this scene to have a bigger fight, instead of an occasional spell going off here and there and with no real fight happening. It had potential to be another exciting scene, but it fell short.The scene's between the action gave us a sense of being alone and the times being full with stress between the characters. The trio often don't talk or when they do, they argue. This brings a sense of tension between them and heightens the feeling that they are alone.I found three, truly emotional scenes in the film (not just filled with stress and tension). The first of these was when Harry and Hermione arrived in Godric's Hollow. They pair realise that its Christmas Eve, which is always the time for family and friends, but they have no one. And also, we see the grave of Lily and James Potter, Harry's parents. You can see that Harry is upset to finally see the grave of his parents, and Hermione shows that she feels sorry for him. The second one, was where Ron returned. This scene is emotional because it renews Harry and Ron's friendship and trust in each other, and also it is the scene of the destruction of the Horcrux, which tempts Ron into killing Harry. Finally, the third one is when Dobby (Tony Jones) is killed. The final words from Dobby are, ""Such a beautiful place it is, to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend, Harry Potter"". This shows us that there is hope and friendship in the world, even as there is death and sadness, a truly powerful scene, in my opinion, the most powerful in the film.A final note: a good film that followed the book closely. But it dragged sometimes with extended scenes with no dialogue and no excitement, although I understand the reason for them. The film, I felt, lacked in the excitement department. Especially after the two excellent action scenes in the first half of the film (chase to the Burrows, the fight with Nagini) and they raised my expectations of the other action scenes, which failed to deliver. On the other hand, they succeeded spectacularly on the emotional side of the film, living up to my expectations, and going beyond it since David Yates managed to keep the feeling going during the duration of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Greater Comeback!,"Finally is Voldemort getting a full picture of himself. The puzzle pieces are starting too come together, as well as the closing finale (That is separated in two parts) and Harry Potter is finally leaving Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry too accomplish the mission of stopping the powerful and almighty Lord Voldemort, and destroy all of the Horcrux. The seventh installment is a real banger with all of the intense action and holding suspense, as well as the question who will win. When you watch movies with the genre ""Evil vs Good"" it depends on if it's predictable or not. Recently when I watch a Marvel movie it's very easy too guess the answer, but here, for example, it's much more interesting and less predictable, because the chances for both sides are on the same level. Harry, Ron and Hermione, the childhood friends trio is settling together on the journey where nothing is safe. And that ""Nothing is safe"" feeling is really holding and greatly presented here. You never know when the danger is coming (Besides if you have read the book) and the suspense is always on. The trio most trust each other more than ever before, and they are showing not only friendship, but survival trust. The action sequences were on the highest level. The sound, music and camera filming were greatly composed together into this wonderful entertainment. The magic and spells shooting out of their wands are greatly made with nice effects and looked greatly visually. Other computer made creations like the fantastic beasts were a nice addition and the Gringotts dragon, for example, looked very real and is on a similar quality to Smaug from The Hobbit. The dramatic and sad scenes were made as it should be, and what was really great about the film was the moral and showing that every life counts, and that everyone should be taken care of. About the characters, great development. Voldemort and his army was really the dark ones, and Voldemort's connection with Harry was on the strongest stage in here. When it goes nearer the finale, we can see how everyone becomes more desperate to finish this battle once and for all. To summarize, the ending is near, and the story is getting concluded. An entertaining time, and a great first half!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

We missed almost half of it due to the darkness. You can see some movement, but you sure can't tell what is going on. We thought it must have been filmed in a cave.The parts we did see were good. Good acting as always, but it looked like Ron Weasley was working with 2 black eyes most of time. I don't understand why anyone would want to film a movie this way. It was almost like they were ashamed of the film, so darken it. We have purchased every Harry Potter movie and were extremely disappointed in this one.

Worth the wait; the darkest and best of the series.,"Having read the beloved series, I was expecting loads from this film. I was O.K with the series so far; just not liking the structures of the 2nd and 6th. The 6th was a major disappointment and I REALLY wanted something much better. This film is what I got as a spectacular result.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is a sophisticated cinematic experience as well as boasting. Featuring great performances, joyous thrills, and dazzling effects; it also remains known as (for me) the darkest and best out of them all. Wow, what an adaptation...Making this film well worth the watch are notably well-orchestrated performances. From little 12-year old's to mature 17 year old's is a huge transition. Yet, its very well performed. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint; give performances that seem to show their hidden talents. Radcliffe is good, but still better than what I saw of him in the last 6 movies. He is charming, reluctant, and efficient. Grint is also the same; adding nostalgic humorous moments throughout the film; as well as maturity ones. Watson is great; having improved the same as the other two.The thrills throughout this film are unbelievably appraisal. The 'jump-out-of-your-seat' scares are VERY well-done. Making them even better are the dazzling effects and visuals. So, beautifully filmed and pretty scary! Overall, this is the best 'Potter' you'll see yet, mainly because of more maturity and darkness than the other ones. It's a thrilling ride that's well acted and genuinely directed. A perfect example of a great book adaptation. Man...I just can't wait for Part 2!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fascinating but ""darker than dark"" prelude to the finale...","These hallows are not only ""deathy,"" they're ""darker than dark."" Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly ""in support."" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Volemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.Summing up: Many of the ""dark"" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lengthy introduction to something else,"Unlike the other six novels in the Harry Potter series ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is being filmed in two parts of which this is the first, Part Two being slated for release in July 2011. The reason for this is that J. K. Rowling's last Potter novel is a long and complex one and that to film it all in one go would either result in a movie of insane length or involve omitting many scenes and details from the book, something which Potter anoraks would never forgive. (The film-makers took plenty of flak for altering some of Rowling's plot details in the earlier instalments).It has become a commonplace to remark that the Potter series has been getting progressively ""darker"", both literally and metaphorically, ever since the third episode, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", and ""Deathly Hallows"" continues this trend. The plot is a complex one, concentrating on the efforts of Harry, Ron and Hermione to I will not attempt to summarise it here2010/2011 two-part epic fantasy film to find and destroy the Horcruxes, magical objects which hold Voldemort's secret of immortality. The Deathly Hallows of the title are three other magical objects which play an important part in the plot.This film is the first in the series not to be set in Hogwarts School (although we learn that Severus Snape is the new headmaster). Since the death of Albus Dumbledore at the end of the sixth film, there has been a revolution in the wizarding world. Lord Voldemort and his supporters, the Death Eaters, have taken control of the Ministry of Magic and are using their new-found power to impose a quasi-Nazi dictatorship and to persecute Muggle-born or mixed-blood wizards. Whereas the atmosphere of the earlier instalments, especially those directed by Chris Columbus, resembled that of the traditional British boarding school story with added magical elements, parts of ""Deathly Hallows"" are closer to Orwell's ""1984"" or similar dystopian satires.""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is not my favourite of the Harry Potter series; I certainly did not enjoy it as much as the previous entry, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". The acting is as good as ever, well up to the normal standards of the series, but the character of Albus Dumbledore was sadly missed. (He died at the end of ""Half-Blood Prince""). Whether played by Richard Harris or Michael Gambon, Dumbledore functioned as a source of wisdom and authority, the moral anchor of the series, and his absence from this film means that something feels lacking. The decision to film the novel in two parts does not seem to have come off, at least as far as Part 1 is concerned. Whereas all the earlier films ended with a satisfying resolution, this one comes to a rather abrupt close, leaving the plot hanging in mid-air. For all its length (nearly 2 1/2 hours), ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" feels less like a film in its own right than an introduction to another film which will not be released for another few months. We can only hope that part 2 will be better. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Decent film,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Overall good ... a little bit scary !,"A good movie with the following points making it stand out;(a)The acting is much better than previous movies, especially Emma Watson(b)This movie captures all major details of the book, only leaving very minor things out and changing a few(c)The movie is good at holding your attention and definitely does not seem as long as the 140 minutes it runs for.(d)The action scenes are well done. Although sometimes they can be difficult to follow, they still include the suspense you want them to in order to elevate what happens next.Aside from a few scary moments there isn't really anything that inappropriate in this movie, it is only PG-13 because of violence (which isn't even that bad) so you could bring your children if you wished.Padraig O'Dea Eaton Square Monkstown",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not the most exciting Harry Potter movie, but story is still intriguing","This movie is different from other Harry Potter movies because everything about it is dark due to the circumstances. The story was intriguing even though it is mostly focused on the guys finding the Horcruxes which they were making slow progress at. I liked the seeing the guys depressed and annoyed because it's better than it being easy and fun to defeat Voldemot. Towards the end it got more interesting when someone you don't expect manages to save the guys which I liked. There was not many thrilling moments which was understandable, but I'm expecting the last one to be epic and hopefully contest for my favourite Harry Potter movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The end is drawing closer,"The seventh instalment of the world's biggest franchise opens the way you may expect our Prime minister to act, as if Bill Nighy was channelling David Cameron and with such a moody tone about you know who's return, you know instantly this will once again be the darkest Potter to come out of Warner Brothers.As always going to see a Potter film at the cinema is a not to be missed experience. To see all familiar faces with the stakes higher than ever was exciting and we will never see anything like this ever again.This particular instalment, based on J.K Rowling's global knockout stories, is the first part of the last book, seeing the three main characters set out on a mission to destroy all of Voldermort's horcruxes, which are part of his soul.Returning director David Yates lets us know straight away we are in for a rough ride as a tearful scene sees Hermione wipe her parents memories. A too brief and not intense Dursley leaving and a torture at Malfoy's home will set the tone for the two and a half hours.However you can always rely on the supporting cast to give you a good chuckle to remind us of what Potter is all about. Fred and George, albeit brief have a great few lines and screen time, Dobby the house elf you can't help but laugh with and Ron always has something to say.It is great to see Rupert Grint get more intense and angry and his character's jealousy sees the young star at his dramatic best.Radcliffe continues to cement a consistent character before our eyes and Watson is given more drama as well. There was a gut wrenching corny dance sequence that is the worst thing to ever happen to the series and my friend and I just looked at each shaking our heads. But in all honesty these two are the stand outs as the film is all set on the roads.The landscape settings are tremendous, some great choices and picturesque art styling. There was a good chase sequence through a forest and the settings at Godric's Hollow was brilliant.Critics and fans have looked at this release and raised an eyebrow at the 12A certificate. There are certainly a lot more graphic notes. A torture scene at Malfoy's, a nude Harry and Hermione and snakes that attack the camera. There are a lot of dark themes and scenes here so if you plan to take your children be cautious.Nevertheless the darkness is required given the context of this careful story. The stakes have raised and things are worse than ever for muggles and wizards alike. We find constant surprises as the trio are jumped numerous times by evil wizards, there is a lot of animosity between friends and family and Voldermort always seems present as we revert back into dream sequences.At first everything is fast paced with great action, plenty of magic and a tender sadness given all injuries and deaths. When on the run the pace really slackens and you wish it would get moving again and thankfully it does in a flurry of wand battles, evil horcruxes and bloody torture.This isn't the best Potter by a long shot but it is, as always, something totally unique and entertaining.Only one more to go.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, but not the same by itself","To begin I have not followed with the series of Harry Potter movies that have come out since ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" in 2001, but I was fascinated with this newest edition to the series ""The Deathly Hallows"" mostly from what others had been saying and the idea that the film would be split into two parts. So after deliberation, I went and saw the movie. To be fair, I did enjoy the film, from start to finish I was intrigued by the events that transgressed and began to get an understanding of the characters. I was a little slow in understanding the plot of the movie but gradually got a small idea as to what was happening. The actors all do a fair job with their roles and character development was one of those moments where the writing truly impressed me. The foreboding scenery and visuals aided to enhance the seemingly hopeless plight of the characters and some of the dialogue further added to the mood of the film. However, I do have to say that the film really isn't the same for one who first comes into the series. One really must have seen some of the other films to truly grasp what's going on in this one. There were times when I thought that I knew what was happening in the story but then quickly began to question myself after something else happened. Sometimes I couldn't really understand the dialogue and that left me feeling a little confused, which persisted throughout the film. In conclusion I have to say that ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" while entertaining, was just alright to me. For those who have seen the other movies might think that this movie is great, but I just didn't get that same feeling. However, I will say that the film did get me interested in the series just from seeing this film and I can safely say that I am looking forward to seeing part 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Please End On a High Note,"I have to say that I was quite disappointed with The Half Blood Prince. I expected it to be much darker and it failed to succeed with that effort. Up until it's release, all I remember hearing was how dark and ominous The Half Blood Prince was going to be; that it was taking the series to a whole new level.Now I have to be honest in saying that I was never much of a Harry Potter fan to being with. I had and still have not read the books and it wasn't until last year that I felt inclined to buy a DVD and watch some of them.For me, i like to be entertained with visual effects and action. I like something fast paced and fun. It's good to have great characters like Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange and great actors to play them. I just hope that this as the series is coming to an end, justice is done for the fans. I speak to this point more so on behalf of the die hard fans than myself. But they still owe it to the fans to end on a high note.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good Harry Potter movie,"First off, I was never a big Harry Potter fan. My brother loved the books. as a kid. I saw previews for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and it looked awesome! I wasn't too thrilled about having to watch the Harry Potter movies first. I got to this one. I sat through 2 1/2 hours. I saw credits pop up and I thought, ""NO!"". I wanted to see more!! It just made me wonder, ""Where are they going to go now?!"". But then I remembered that it wasn't the end. I had to give it a 10/10. I didn't expect much of the movie. It is kind of like the movie Inception. It keeps you wondering. Every I watch it, my brain keeps on spinning with questions. The movie was completely amazing! I am SO going to see Deathly Hallows Part 2. The questions that run through my head are something like: are they just going to stay there? What is Voldemort going to do with his new wand? It is a must-see! The rating should really be WAY higher than 7.7/10. Amazing!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Average additions be gone, things are starting to get magic at last.","No-one was forthcoming about OOTP and HBP. They have succeeded in the infamous Potter manoeuvre of neither being wildly brilliant or atrociously laughable, but always being huge box office phenomenon's that have now outdone the likes of Star Wars, so they must have been doing something right, right?Well other than being the best franchise rights attained by Warner Bros. for being such a successful series, they always were inviting to people new to the experience, specifically those who hadn't read the books. The problem? The people who are fans of the book (including your dear critic) are always spotting the missing scenes, the awkward relationships - that aren't supposed to be awkward and the rare but recent addition of scenes that had as much logic and point behind them as singing into a turned on Hoover nozzle.So being the best book, (arguably) the routinely depression encased within the restriction Hogwarts has lifted, as has the more customary check list. Big castle, problem, another problem, acting sad, kissing, wand walloping, morning, end. For once the relationships, like the plot, aren't constraint to the walls of Hogwarts, they are free at last.Though Yates has been irksomely juggling the same premise for two films too long he makes up by, fi-na-le being faithful through the decision to cleanly cut the film in two. He also includes additional scenes (wait for it) that aren't unlike the characters motivations; HBP had the attack of the Burrow scene with no motivation from Death Eaters what so ever. In Deathly Hallows there are emotional additions that aren't hosted in a sulky and heavy atmosphere, such as when Harry is trying to console Hermione.The film also amplifies its standard of being funny, something which the books only mildly covered as a quick disengagement from the 'fun'. And for the first time in history, when the newly instated Minister of Magic quotes: ""These are dark times, there is no denying."" the theme turned clich√© of diluting the lighting for the gazillionth time so it's darker therefore 'more rugged and scary' - lives up to its sense of impending doom, without having the usual buzz of hopeful expectancy followed by obvious disappointment - like the lottery always does.It's quiet easy to be bitter about the fact the best director, Alfonso Cuaron, never got the chance to make another instalment that could have established a new high point of the relatively indistinguishable mountain but saying that, Yates would never have got the chance to prove he can make one of the best additions to the series, that wasn't even close to being the money-grabbing, giant tease it could have been. If Part II can be this enjoyable to all audiences, then the Potter finale will rouse as much love as when he was first seen branded with his slogan scar and if not, it would at least be well-deserved to see Part I make the top 250.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good set up and first half,"As the universe and entire film series starts to wrap up, the stakes and expectations are high. I found this first half really explored the tensions, emotions and vulnerabilities of Harry, Hermione and Ron. We've come a long way from the innocent and carefree children that started the film series. We've seen them grow up and take on a darker and more dangerous world.The Deathly Hallows storyline is intriguing and well told.

"On the outside, looking in¬Ö.","The Harry Potter phenomenon has been all around me. I've seen each of the films and made a stab at the first book, but after a few pages, I wasn't interested in reading further. Yet, the spectacle (and considerable hype) surrounding the films has always been a draw. But to say I have any emotional investment (or even curiosity) in the story couldn't be further from the truth.Action films, particularly those with elaborate CGI content, can keep me interested. Only a few of the Harry Potter films were truly a disappointment, so walking into the ""Deadly Hallows,"" I was only there for the show. My companion, however, had seen none of the previous ones nor was he familiar with the books/story, and from his reaction (""And just where did they get the shovel?"") I'd suggest if you don't know anything about Harry Potter, you'll be¬Ölost.As the actors have aged, each episode has brought a more serious tone. While much of the art direction is self-referenced from the previous films, there's something claustrophobic in ""Deadly Hallows."" There's a sense of impending doom that is very well-done. In most ""chase"" films, the characters have a chance to rest or hide and plan their next move. Not here. Danger lurks at every turn and in every shadow. That is very well reflected by the young actors, and the sense of weariness and defeat is somehow beautifully realized by the technical crew. (For instance, a short animated film is used to illustrate a key mystery, and it's stunningly beautiful and frightening as well¬Ölike a nightmare Tim Burton would have.) And in fact, this film points towards a deepening realization that evil is not just something in a children's fairy tale, but can take over the world at a moment's notice. And whether the forces of good will be able to win in the battle that's ahead, is a lesson not just for children or adolescents.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Emma and Rupert's lack of interest in their roles,"I've been watching Hollywood movies ever since I came to this world (*sarcasm*) and I always concentrate on two aspects of the movie, the acting and dialog delivering. This past week I've been going over the whole Harry Potter series watching three young kids become teenagers, their acting, expression and confidence improving with every epic episode of the series. Taking into consideration the latest of the series ""Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows Part I"" there were a lot of new faces as compared to the previous episodes. The good thing about the movie was the storyline that mostly revolved around Daniel, Rupert and Emma. Some of the acting scenes were really exceptional but I was a little disappointed in Rupert and Emma's acting. The reason being, I couldn't see the same enthusiasm and passion which they portrayed in the previous episodes.Emma, although did good but wasn't great and I couldn't see the spark that she had earlier. She did a good job in delivering the dialogs but the way she used to express previously was missing this time. It seemed as if she was acting forcefully and wasn't happy. Similarly she was also lacking the eagerness of proving herself. In short she could have done an exceptional job by paying more attention to expression and adapting greater keenness towards her role. Rupert did a good job but could have been better and I believe he lacked interest in his role; it seemed as if he was tired and bored of playing the same role again and again. As for Daniel, he did an exceptional job, acted and delivered in a perfect way and I could see a lot of energy and enthusiasm. It seemed as if Daniel was there for Rupert and Emma and helped them pull through the movie.Whatever the reason being for Emma and Rupert's lack of interest in their roles one thing was clear that they were bored of doing the same old routine for the past decade.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best Harry Potter adaptation,"For many years, we old Harry Potter's fans had been angry on the disappointing adapting of the books; a brief synopsis the action parts none of the things that made the series a modern classic or a literally work of art. As an example; the best (and longest) book; The Goblet of Fire was so badly adapted and worse directed that the real meaning of the book (youngster anguish, rebellion and sexual awakenings ) was completely trimmed. Characters and actions related to the next part where eliminated, creating a hole in relationships and even our feelings from some characters (i.e. Sirius Black). David Yates took over on the franchise but even if the adaptation was better; the movies barely reflected the books. I regained hope when I heard the movie will be shown in two parts; finally Hollywood greed will be useful for something !!!.Well, the first part is really like the book. There were a few trims but the slow action and Harry's, Hermione and Ron desperation and disorientation was perfectly staged. Three almost kids fighting against the world without any idea on what to do.A few people (who did not read the book), though the movie was too paced and with poor special effects. There is some true about that; but the pacing was exactly right as in the book and the special effects this time not really that important.Let's hope that Yates do the right thing for the last and most expected part.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deathly dark...,"I have read the book but obviously have only come to this first part of the film dramatisation rather late in the day. Not a bad thing actually as it reduces the book-to-film comparison it's very easy to fall into. Thus I found myself watching it almost afresh and was able to watch it as a film first rather than an adaptation.That said, I did find it slow in parts yet conversely haphazard in some of the no out essential editing to get the required halfway point of what is a very long and detailed novel. This method rather exposes the acting skills of the young leads and while they've come in a bit since the early adventures, I still don't think they can quite carry the movie off on their own shoulders. The action sequences are much darker and scarier than before but probably too far apart to really have the maximum effect. In between we get a lot of scenes in the dark, on the woods, by a loch and in a tent, where we're meant to get caught up in an imaginary triangle between Harry, Ron and Hermione. There's no Hogwarts, the Express train or even Hagrid's Cottage and also very little in the way of experienced support to relieve the lack of dramatic tension too.This accent on melodrama reaches its nadir with the death of Dobbie in a terribly overblown ""Little Nell"" type scene. From there we don't even get a cliff-hanging climax to propel us onto the sequel, which while I will watch it soon, will I think be more satisfying as it reaches its conclusion. This did look to me very like half a film but with more vigorous editing could have ended up better than it did, at least in my eyes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Beginning of the End,"Waiting in line at 6:30 on November the 19th, I was waiting for the midnight premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; Part 1. Despite the obvious excitement, I was worried. The last two installments were poor in my opinion and David Yates (the director of parts five, six, and seven parts one and two) was still at the helm for this one. Once I left the theater the next morning at 2 AM my faith was restored. The film was beautiful and moving beyond measure. It is easily the best film of the series since Prisoner of Azkaban, and it creates great excitement for the final installment.HPDHP1 is the first part of the conclusion to the series. Harry Potter knows that he has to destroy a number of magical items (known as horcruxes) before he can attempt to kill his life long enemy and the most dire threat to the wizarding world, Lord Voldemort. For those of you who have not read the books or seen the movies, this film will make almost no sense to you. Without a decent understanding of the Harry Potter series this film will be completely incoherent. However for those who have followed along, you should have no trouble with understanding the film.The biggest concerns with installments five and six were that they each had one element that was necessary for the movie to be great. The fifth was missing good acting and the sixth was missing a good mood. Part seven is missing neither. The mood is set from very early on and keeps hold even when some lighter moments do arise. Those lighter moments which ruined part six, due to corniness, were wholesome and relieving. The acting which ruined part five, again due to corniness, was genuine and emotional. It brought a lot of true feeling to what could have been an emotionless film.Some die hard fans will say that the film was ruined due to parts that were missing from the book. I tell you to ignore those nay-sayers. JK Rowling (the author) had huge amounts of input into this so I think you can safely assume that anything that was done, was done to make part two, the most spectacular finale you could imagine.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I am (was) not a fan of the movies, because I'm a true die-hard fan of the books, but this one topped them all.The acting of all three actors was superb, so emotional, touching, moving, I can't find enough synonyms. Their chemistry bounced off the screen, it really hit me. I was impressed, because the last two movies weren't that good at all.The special effects were flawless and magical, they really did an excellent job on them this time. I especially liked how they told the story of the Deathly Hallows, the animations were fantastic!Of course it's not as good as the books, but it's the next best thing. The beginning already brought tears in my eyes, it immediately took a turn for the serious, the entire movie had a sense of dark foreboding.There were some hilarious moments too, and they put a lot of effort into making it as true to the book as possible and it worked. They also split the story at just the right moment, it couldn't have been better. Hats off to the crew!There were a few minor things I missed in i but I loved it and I can't wait for the final part.

Mixed Up Feelings,"I've read all the Harry Potter books and they are the best books ever. Must say, Rowling is the savior of teenager reading skills. The earlier movies were great, I still enjoy them. I just cannot imagine any better actors and environment for the stories. The first two were probably the closest to the book, or that's at least how I think. I didn't really enjoy the third one; it has a weird decor. The fourth one was brilliant, the fifth was okay, and the sixth was a bit darker and much more emotional. But one thing combines these 6 movies - Hogwarts.In the 7th book the trio isn't in Hogwarts anymore. I got used to it while reading the book pretty fast, but didn't while watching the movie. It was so different.Anyway, must say that I'm glad they split up the seventh movie into two parts, because it simply has way too many things.This movie was very close to the book. Like when I was reading the book in 2007, I was watching this movie already. The image was very close. They even put some little details, but also missed some. They could make the beginning more like the book's. Also, my friends say that the movie didn't follow some details, like how exactly they found out something about one thing, but I didn't notice any. Maybe I just started to forget what the book told.In the other hand, this movie was very dark and it was very hard to get used to the outside of Hogwarts. Sometimes it seemed that they stretched the scenes for way too long. I mean, yes, even the book tells about all their boredom but the movie showed it in a bit more different way. And in the end, after the movie, I was depressed.I was so damn sad and lost. I couldn't leave many things out of my head. I almost cried in the theater (70% of the audience did). So yeah, it is also a powerful movie. Not every filmmaker can make people cry, and make the wizard world so real.So after a few days I started to remember the little funny parts, and suddenly wanted to watch the movie again.I'm waiting in excitement for the second part. It has to be better because the book tells about way more things in more exciting places. But anyway, this wasn't so bad also. I started to ask myself: 'What did you expect? Isn't that what the book told about?'So yeah. I know that even you... yes, YOU, have already watched the movie. These days not many people read reviews before they go and see a movie. They usually only take a look at the star rating. So tell me your opinion. But who knows, I wish you best of luck if you haven't seen it yet :)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Wingardium Leviosa"" To the Highest Level","I almost forgot that I was watching one of the Harry Potter's movies. I feel like in a different universe compare to its predecessors. Thiz last grand epic is still directed by David Yates who was unknown Director before his involvement in the 5th film ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" in 2007. Actually, Yates has ever tried to implement thiz kind of atmosphere into the 6th film ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) which is dark and gloomy with more realistic approach. But back then, it wasn't supported by attractive storyline. Thiz is the finale of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world when everything is about to end. The villain Voldermort (upss¬Ö I mean You-Know-Who) gets stronger than ever. Harry Potter and his two loyal friends Ron and Hermione have to find hidden Horcruxes in order to destroy the dark lord himself. The movie starts with the doom element and dark impression everywhere, and then enters into Special Effects extravaganza, just like the previous prequels. The story as we know it before, it is centered on Harry, Ron and Hermione. Thiz chapter explores the unrevealed relationship further and for the result is something very different. I think I can see what happens here. Yates tries to lock them up alone in the same room, and then see what could possibly happen. For the first time in thiz franchise, Yates has shown us that Harry Potter's movies aren't just always about Special Effects exhibition, but also about the depth of its characters. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) has done everything he can, to show more mature emotions. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) improves his acting better than ever. Emma Watson (Hermione) has grown up to be a beautiful and gorgeous girl. She obviously has the most promising career in the future. The heavy caliber Supporting Cast members are also in solid performances such as Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange and even Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Yates himself explores every possible technique that he could find, like flash back sequences, racking focus, bird's eye angle, hand-shake camera and even graphic animation when he reels of ""The Tale of Three Brothers"". The animation is artistic, enjoyable and mind-blowing. I ever hoped that Guillermo Del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth"" {2008} and ""Hell Boy"" {2007}) would be the Director of thiz last phenomenal epic. With his resume it will be perfect! But that never happened. Each of us has been growing up with thiz franchise. The franchise itself certainly manifests being more than just the movies, but it's also becoming the part of our culture in thiz generation. It is ""Wingardium Leviosa"" to the highest level, ""Expelliarmus"" all the bad factors, and it surely won't be ""Obliviate"" for a long time, it will be ""Lumos"" brightly until the end.

My Least Favourite in the Series but Still Good,"This is my least favourite one. As much as I love Part 2, I really don't think this should have been split into two films. Just make a 3 hour epic the finale you COWARDS. No but seriously, the pacing, particularly in the second half, is just too slow for me to really get into it. I still like the visuals and the story overall, and I would say that the performances of the lead three are probably the best that they've ever been. They've truly come into their own as actors, and it's great to see that. I do wish Ginny got more screentime aswell, but that's been an issue since the 5th film so that doesn't bother me anymore. I still really like where they went with Draco, and the opening action sequence is really enjoyable, and sets the film up really well. So whilst I don't love this as much as some of the others, I still appreciate a lot of elements within it, and at the end of the day I do enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Harry Potter- Good Movie,"This is a very good movie and I'm not really a good fan of Harry potter, but in this movie the directors capture my attention with amazing special effects. Also the history has a lot of comic scenes and then BAM an action Scene. So I recommended this movie. Also the effects in 3D are very good. The directors make an excellent decision to divide this movie in two parts because in the end you will want to see the final part. Actually I have to see the other harry potter movies because I don't remember a lot of details of the history, so I have to spend some time to see them. So for all the really fans of harry potter you are going to enjoy the movie, and for all the people who aren't fans of harry potter also you are going to enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The importance of the Deathly Hallows by Hermione Granger,"Entering at last of the sequel the Finale movies that divide in two parts. In separated 2 movies too conclude the final battle between the famous Harry Potter vs The Dark Lord Voldemort. (Tom Marvolo Riddle) In the middle of the first part in the Deathly Hallows. Is a tales of children's book called The Tales of BEEDLE The Bard that's given too Hermione Granger By the Minister of magic Minister Rufus Scrimgeour who given to her in memory of Albudus Dumbledore by who been attacked Professor Severus Snape hands. In a short version of the tales of the Deathly Hallows. Who been explend in Xenphilius Lovegood at Luna's Lovegood house. One of the golden trio friends in Hogwarts. The tale has been told as a creation of the three brothers that represented a triangular figure making with 3 magical objects including an Elder wand, a Resurrection stone and a Cloak Invisibility by a deathly wish too vanishing
death fate. I think the tales of three brothers is the most important based on this two movies. I would go back the previous reviews from the sequel. When I explained before it continues furthermore until the end. The expedition journey to the battle the chasing the golden trio Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and Their friends, families and there professors and not least the Ministers of magic staff members to support the cause as well. Too weakened The Dark Lord Voldemort by there Horocruxes throughout the movie by his creation himself. Before I conclude and finished I would like to add my shocking moment when Doby dies in the hands of harry potter in a beautiful sunset with the golden trio and friends in a beach and a calm ocean with no waves so beautiful and a proper resting place so peaceful, warmhearted just sadness doby it should deserved the perfect scene. Metaphorically speaking this review in other terms it speaks it's self explanatory form the the other second half of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Part 1 is Exhilarating, Thrilling and has good emotional depth","The 3 Key points to make a decent to good film is shown in it's description, at the top. It's what makes this movie gell, yeah sure not everything works but it's still a good film that tackles many things. Arguments, action and even a sad scene. The Movie is very intense, and will get to that, but honestly the siries is very good, mostly having an average of 7 for me. Which is a good score for a film, I think the Movie is better then Chamber of Secrets (score of 5) and Half Blood-prince (score of 6). So it's better then those too in my opinion. And although this movie is meant to be filler, granted it does work quite well.The Wedding of Harry's and Ginny's seems to be coming together well, theirs some nice scenes with each of the characters here and the writing team seems to have done a good job. Then the movie starts to get more intense and becomes a thrill-ride to watch. When Bellatrix turns up and tries to ruin things, this chase scene is well shot, well executed and fantastically choreographed, with plenty of thrilling moments here it seems to be quite exciting. Especially when are characters move from one place to another, and being on high alert for any danger. They are completely unsafe, they even go in an ordinary caf√© and that turns out to go badly. But with the cleverness of Hermione they are able to get out of the situation safely, and more importantly alive.The Camping scene doesn't feel like it fits in with Harry Potter, but for understandable reasons the group needs somewhere to hide. Ron and Harry have a falling out and this creates some tension between the two characters, but they quickly resolve their issues and are focused on nothing else but the Horcruxes. Which they are chased by in the woods, it seems to have very high stakes and risks in this film, and for the most part it works really well. It's very intense and shows how exhilarating this movie can be, with some close calls happening between some of the Characters.However, what isn't a close call is Dobbie's death. Which is really well directed and performed by the guy who plays Dobbie. Sadly Bellatrix had killed him, just like she had killed Serious Black. And her cackle is nightmare fuel for anyone, disturbing and almost as if to say it's a bit creepy in away. This has some great moments between the cast.I feel like this should of been shorter or should of just been one part, but the film certainly works very well on it's own too feet. I didn't like the other goblin either, he seemed very rude and grumpy and for no rymal reason. He was only temporary which was good. But the Run Time for the movie isn't so bad, just some scenes feel dragged out and others feel like it's going too quick at times. There's a lack of cohesion inside this film in my opinion.So, Would I recommend this film?Yes, I'd recommend all of them, they all have their enjoyable moments, 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still going strong!,"I chose to go and see this on a cold damp Tuesday evening because I remember a bad experience watching the previous Harry Potter last year. I foolishly went on the Saturday of the opening week and the cinema was packed. It wasn't until the interval that I finally managed to threaten the teenager behind me enough to stop him kicking my seat all through the second half. But that was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away¬Ö I must take some of my pills. Here's a very brief summary before I tell you what I thought of this one (summary haters please hide the chosen one in a forest while I write the next paragraph).Lord Voldemort and his followers have taken over the Ministry of Magic and are hot on the trail of Harry Potter. Those loyal to him try to move him to a safer location, but they are betrayed and some of their number are killed or injured. After a further attack Harry, Ron and Hermione escape and decide to go it alone. They have discovered that one of the remaining Horcruxes is at the Ministry. Posing as three of the members of the Ministry they manage to steal the Horcrux, but have no way of destroying it. In his will, Dumbledor has left each of them an item that could help. Harry has been bequeathed the snitch he captured in his first game of quidditch as well as the Sword of Gryffindor which is currently lost. Hermione discovers that it is possible that the Sword could destroy the Horcrux. A mysterious light leads Harry to the sword and they are able to destroy the Horcrux. There a three more to be found and Lord Voldemort is becoming more and more powerful as time goes on. I have missed an awful lot out, but those are the salient points and, I hope, very few (if any) spoilers.As we have come to expect, this is a beautifully made film, although much darker than the others. It was nice to see the three main characters out in the real world for a change. I love the animation that was used for the explanation of the meaning of the Deathly Hallows, beautifully done! Great performances all round, particularly from Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione. All are growing into fine actors.As you may notice from reading my summary (assuming you weren't hiding in a forest), that a knowledge of all of the previous six episodes does help when watching this instalment. I did find it a bit hard to get into at first, but was soon enthralled again. The scenes in the ministry did remind me a little of Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil and there are more than hits of 'The Lord of the Rings' throughout. Over all, a very good film and one I heartily recommend.My score: 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why two movies? (IMAX),"It's my second IMAX experience with HP after the ""goblet of fire"". This time is better, maybe because i have indeed real all the fabulous books written by Rowling. Thus so far, i have only watched the 1st, 4th and 7th movies because i wait them to be released in a box set to grasp the entire saga.I find this movie enjoyable because it matches my mental pictures i got when i read this volume. There isn't no boring moment even when the characters are lost in their confusion. Two sets really amazed me: The ministry of magic and Godric's hollow.However, the pace is maybe too fast because I got some holes at the narrative. First of all, this kind of movie should begin with a resume of previous movies. I take notes while reading thus i don't understand why the filmmakers don't do this same effort for the audience. If i went there with the kid, i imagine he would have been totally throw back by the beginning because a torture with dark people sitting around a table and a huge snake would appear crazy for the non initiated! Next, i didn't understand the problem that Voldemort has with his wand, how many horcruxes haven already been destructed and how many are left, why have they been followed in London.Beyond those remarks about adaptation, the movie really takes its strength in the fantastic trio of actors. I think it really great to have seen those kids becoming mature, even though the movies get darker and darker and more violent.Now, i must wait almost a year to watch the end: another stupid production decision as the choice to expurgate John William's themes !",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic Magic Unleashed in a Gripping Tale of Courage and Sacrifice,"Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint star in the engrossing movie version of J. K. Rowling's well-loved book series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1. The movie immerses audiences in a frightening and gloomy wizarding world where Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out on a risky mission to foil Voldemort's evil schemes. The story examines friendship, selflessness, and the difficulties of right and wrong. Filmmaker David Yates gives the picture a moody, gloomy feel while expertly preserving the spirit of the original work. The action moves at a breakneck speed, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as the group overcomes obstacles and solves the Deathly Hallows' mysteries. Part 1 is an emotionally charged introduction that sets the tone for the spectacular finale.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Creativity at its best,"Some one has to be highly creative to come up with names like, Griffindoor. Globovitch and other similar concoctions. Hats off to Mz Rowling for crafting such characters and places. No doubt the director, Yates has done a brilliant job in illustrating the grown up Harry Potter. New jokes, New situations they get caught up in.. THe movie is a visual treat..shot in the potter movie camera style, the lord of the rings kinds..it transposes you to a new world..the full 2 nd a half hours or so u experience -mmmmmm- feeling ..the one that can be associated with something dark....yet appealing and not scary ..AN out and out fantasy, it deserves credit for all the accolades....",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Yeah, it sounds clich√©, but the book was better.","Since this is the 7th movie in the series, you pretty much have to be caught up by this point because it gets right into the plot without explaining much, but that's simply because it would take too much time. After just reading the book for the second time, I can safely say that I would have been mostly lost if I hadn't read it.The movie's pacing is all over the place. The first third has a very brisk pace, but then it slows down a LOT in the middle, but to be fair that's how it went in the book too. Then it finally starts to pick up again near the end. This is also, put simply, a road movie with Harry, Ron, and Hermione out to find the remaining horcruxes, while camping in many different locations and getting themselves in one situation after another. Some of these situations were pretty downplayed compared to the book, but some, such as the Malfoy manor scene were handled much better.What more can you say about Harry, Ron, and Hermione at this point? This movie is all about them, more than any of the other movies. However, this does give them nice moments of character development. Of course many other characters make appearances, but they are only around for 1 or 2 scenes.The film has a dark and tight feel to it. Many scenes are filmed very up close and some are so dark I could barely see what's going on, which took a lot of impact out of those scenes (you think they would use that Lumos spell more often). However the set pieces, such as the forest, for the most part look nice.This is not my favorite movie in the series. It fact it might not even make the top 3, but still it could be worse. I'm just glad I read the book first.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved it!!!,"This is my favorite Harry Potter movie by far and it stays as true to the book as can be expected. I wish The Goblet of Fire and Half Blood Prince had made the same effort. It's a very dark film, but it is very satisfying for a Harry Potter fan who has read all the books. It's nice to see the characters really mature and we get to see a lot of the characters from Goblet of Fire. This is not a sappy Twilight film with the Happily Ever After scenario, since the two franchises are always being compared. Every moment of happiness is hard won and it's fleeting at best. There was not a sound in the theater because everyone was so caught up in the film. Since I don't want to spoil anyone, I will leave it at this. I can't wait to see the final installment!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Necessary Building Block,"This movie is often forgotten because of the brilliance of Part 2. It is honestly, probably the least rewatchable of the franchise, but that's not a bad thing. This movie ditches Hogwarts, robes, quidditch and most of the magical elements of the Wizarding World. The grittier tone and constant paranoia are perfectly captured in the poster of the golden trio running.While it isn't a movie that I find myself wanting to revisit, the tonal shift works. These characters are no longer lovelorn students or angsty teenagers, they are the good guys seeking to destroy the bad guy (even though the locket does create a little nastiness).There are raw scenes in this movie that evoke a strong tearful response. The initial ""obliviate"" scene, the dance, the torture, the culminating death, this movie packs an emotional punch. The film is a good entry in the Harry Potter Universe and a necessary building block to the finale, though it's missing the magic and charm of earlier installments.Best Character: Hermione
Best Quote: ""What a beautiful place... to be with friends."" - Dobby
Best Scene: The Dance
Best Piece of Score: ""Obliviate""Note: Hermione's scream is one of the most painful sounds in cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The dark set up,"There are a lot of viewers out there that may look at this film and decide that is was a little boring and drawn out. Well, if you're a Harry Potter fan and watch this film in the context of all the others in the series, hopefully you'll appreciate this movie.I can say that there was more story line than computer generated wizardry, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There was still enough action sequence to make this an enjoyable film for a variety of audiences and it certainly appealed to a more mature audience compared to its predecessors.The majority of the movie has a dark overtone to it and this results in much dire consequences for some of the characters involved in the action. Since the setting has been taken out of wizard world of Hogwarts and has been placed in the real world, the movie makes a stronger connection to the audience.The only thing I felt this movie could have included more of is the development of the personal relationships between the characters. Though there were some scenes that did push these stories along, the movie did little to give finality to many of the questions the audience has had since the beginning regarding ""who ends up with who"".Overall, this was a great movie that added deeper tones, drew in newer audiences, and brought the series closer to home. It also certainly did what it was intended to do which is to set up the final showdown.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantastic start to the epic finale in the HP series. An almost perfect movie,"I am a die-hard Potter fan and have got and read all the books and seen all the movies made up until this point. After the good, but most disappointing of the Potter films, Half Blood Prince, I am very pleased to report Harry comes back in style thanks to terrific direction of the very capable David Yates and a mesmerising screenplay by Steve Knowles.In this first part of the Dealthy Hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione are cut off for most of the film by the magical world as Voldemort has taken over the ministry of magic and Hogwarts as Dumbeldore has left Harry the task of finding and destroying the last of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Throughout we see the trio desperately frail about trying to decide what to do next. Throughout we get the sense of the desperation they feel with the whole wizarding world literally against them. Steve Knowles has done a sensational job of keeping as close to the novel as possible and it was lovely throughout as I could follow the sequence of events from the book and know roughly whereabouts the film was up to. The narrative structure of the story is held together extremely well as mostly everything is in there for the first part of the book. Obviously there were some parts missing, but it dosen't in any way degenerate the narrative structure too much.The biggest strength of this first part is the acting. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson have come a long way since the Philosopher's Stone and it shows, over the series they have explored their acting abilities and I am pleased to say this part one of the seventh film is their best acted yet. Grint provides much of the comedy element of the previous films, but also provides surprisingly in depth angst as he feels alienated from Harry and Herminone when they are camping in different parts of the UK and suspects they are a couple. Radcliffe gives an excellent leading performance as the Chosen One with the whole weight on his shoulders that is pushing him down and it shows, but Emma Waston is undoubtedly the best of the three. She has matured into a terrific adult actress. She radiates the screen with a touching and very believable performance.The supporting roles have to be mentioned, unfortunately Alan Rickman dosen't get enough screen time to flex out his role, but it was nice to see him anyway. Neither does Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid or David Thewlis as Lupin (a couple of parts he was in, which were cut out). Also Tom Felton as Draco dosen't get much at all or Timothy Spall as Wormtail. However those that get enough like Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour, Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood, Evanna Lynch as Luna, Toby Jones as the voice of Dobby, Brenden Gleeson as Moody and Andy Linden as Mundungus Fletcher all make the most of their moments in terms of comedy like Flecther and the Weasley twins and the rest more serious. Special mention though has to go to Ralph Fiennes at his best as Voldemort he has a delightfully frightening menace. Jason Isacc's though he only appears twice is great as a father imprisoned by the Dark Lord and wants to please him. The dishevelled look of his appearance all but communicates it, but perhaps the best supporting performances are Helen Carter as the cackling mad Bellatrix Lestrange who is superb and a real delight is Imelda Staunton as Umbridge who plays her part to devilish effect and still has the great simpering laugh.You also get the notion of Harry, Ron and Hermione working together as a team, which was lost in the last film. The audience is very much attuned to the emotions of the three on their dark, lonely and disturbing journey, which is mostly full of sorrow and anger. But you get the sense they will never give up. Be warned though it is extremely dark and there are a few moments of terror, which may make you jump, though I didn't a few people around me in the cinema did. One moment I have to mention, which I particularly liked and was unexpected was the moment in the tent when Ron has left and Harry and Hermione get up to dance was very touching indeed.Other positives is the music is beautiful and depicts perfectly the emotions the trio go through on their journey, the cinematography of the dark and gloomy settings is gorgeous with excellent special effects as ever with a sharp script to go with it. The pace of the film never flags and there is some suspense and tension throughout, however this is where I feel the movie went slightly wrong.When it comes to the action there is little of it and it is apparent if you've read the book they cut parts out particularly the chase from when Harry leaves the Dursley's. Due to this restriction, you don't feel the full impact of emotions of what the characters are going through, which also loses some of the suspense and tension. This is why I stopped short of giving it a ten.However I won't put this down too much as it is still a stupendous achievement for Yates and the rest who have done a sensational job. The first part ends at a perfect place. This deserves to be a big hit and I cannot wait for part two next July, which I know will be even more amazing. If you are a Potter fan I don't think you will be disappointed. This is definitely worth the money and time to see and will bear re seeing many times. Thank you David for doing me and lots of others proud. Roll on part two!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sometimes a negative overwhelms the many positives.,"This particular movie possesses many admirable qualities. Fine acting, exciting storyline etc. But for me the poor quality lighting of many crucial scenes out weighs all else and because of this I would give this movie a poorer than average rating. What good does all the rest mean,if you can't make out the picture? I watched the movie in high definition blue ray and scene after scene the lighting was terrible. I realize that the action took place after dark. Time after time I could not make out what was going on. I believe that the makers of this film and all of Harry Potter movies would be well served if they gave proper illumination to the scenes. I realize England can be drab and dreary, that wizards wear black and that they teach in Hogwart's dark chambers but consideration should be given to the viewer. I give you as an example, in the case of audio, how many of you have seen a movie in which within a scene horrendous noise is occurring, bombs are going off etc.? Yet, within the scene two lovers speak, perhaps one dying in the arms of the other and there is utter silence in the background as they speak. You are allowed to hear their conversation (literary license?)(perhaps need to tell the story). In the same way, the Potter franchise has often suffered with trying to set the scene with realistic light when what was needed was enough light for the viewer to make out the subject matter. Do others see it my way?",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows pt.1...saying this is fantastic is an understatement,When i read that people say that this wasn't loyal to the book..I'm in shock. They split this up into 2 parts. How is that not the MOST faithful adaptation to the book? As a movie and book adaptation..it's the best out of the series. The actors were superb..the visuals were stunning..and the directing is better than ever for HP films. This is top notch film making. You may have to know a lot from the previous ones to understand what is going on. There is a point at the movie where it gets kind of slow..but it helps tell the story..and it is only about 20 minutes. I had high expectations for this and the movie exceeded those expectations.

Fantastic,"Harry Potter has come a long way. From the age of 12 learning the art of magic and wizardry, defeating many villains and successfully battling grave dangers and enemies he is now a 17 year old lad. Same goes to his lifelong buddies Ron Weasley and Harmoine Granger. These 3 friends are now the center of attention of many and Harry is yet to face the greatest challenges of his life while his allies fall in numbers and the whole game starts to become his burden. More enemies heading towards him and keeping the balance of the known world and the threats against it becomes the prime objective of this young guy with specs and gift of magic. Knowing he is the chosen one put more and more pressure on him and his enemies the same while trying to achieve their own ambitions vigorously.I'm not a hardcore fan of Harry Potter as I'm with Lord of the Rings or Star Wars for that matter. But one good reason I still spend over two and a half hours with this movie each time it comes out, from its 1st to the latest 7th chapter 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚ÄìPart1' is it's profoundly fantastic space it gives for wildest imaginations and fantasies. Growing up and becoming an adult is not a reason for anyone to lose the grip over this wonderful series of movies. If you like movies and if you like to give yourself a break from all known hazards of your natural life and embed your heart and soul in to something magical, then Harry Potter must be the place to invest your dime.I have no intention of going deeply in to the plot of this chapter or describe the characters in detail as this movie has come a very long way by now. All of you who want to watch it I'm quite sure that will do without taking a second thought as it's in your dreams already. Basically Voldermort is becoming powerful day by day and he is working towards his ultimate target of killing Harry Potter. And Harry and his 2 buddies are on the epic effort in order to find the Horcruxes and to destroy them before the dark lord finds them and use it for his advantage. The plot grows bigger and bigger and seemly not in favor of Harry which is clearly creating the grand finale in next chapter.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚ÄìPart1' is another wonderful chapter of this brilliant series of movies. This maybe the most successful movie franchise in the history of movies ever other than Star Wars. So I really don't need to make your mind in order to watch this. Packed with staggering work of animation, music score and acting performances with a good deal of dramatic plot, I'm quite sure you would!

The Darkness begins,"This is the first Harry Potter movie which refers to a part of a book and not the whole. This may have to do with the fact that the last book of the series is quite long or with reasons of profit or possibly both. It is a good movie in general with aspects of fairy-tale, modern angst, Kafkaesque interiors and Orwellian situations, as well as poignant scenes of family relationships or even subdued and latent eroticism.The main actors support their roles ably while scenes in the Ministry of Magic remind one of classic political movies such as Brazil.The sequence of events is that of the book and the choice to present the sub-plot of the Hallows of Death with animation instead of actors is I think justified.I recommend this movie to the numerous fans of the series although I think that for viewers above a certain age limit the myth of Potter has started to blur. It meets expectations though, what more can be achieved with such material in hand. Mind the enchanting dance of Harry and Hermione.Also the bell has started to toll for Mad-eyed Moody the auror and Dobby the house-elf, and it is just the start of the HŒølocaust that the last book contains and which we are presumably going to see in Part 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Give it a miss,watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part one last night... - the Scariest part in the entire movie was when he took his top off in the beginning... i cried myself to sleep.I had the feeling they tried to make it too emotional with constant teary eyed moments lamenting the loss of certain characters.It just didn't have the punch I was expecting - I had heard it was a lot darker than the previous installments but people were referring to the lighting and not the story...I sincerely hope the last installment rectifies this and does the series some justice.What ever you do don't pay to see this movie.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good beginning to The End,"Harry, Ron and Hermione search for the Horcruxes.This is a solid first part to the movie saga finale.The plot starts at breakneck speed, with plenty of suspense and excitement before grinding to a halt and spending a long period reflecting on the main characters, providing exposition, and slowly pursuing the central mcguffin. It may sound like a criticism, but the above is all done very cinematically and with good character development. It also ends on a powerful note that makes you want to find out how it turns out.All the themes developed over the previous movies, particularly the dread associated with totalitarian control and the associated death and conflict are wonderfully realised in what is another quite dark chapter.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have some of their biggest opportunities to shine as the stars of a memorable franchise and I think they do some of their best work here.The stellar supporting cast are superb as always, particularly Helena Bonham-Carter, Rhys Ifans, and Brendan Gleeson. A special Welsh shout-out to Bill Nighy, who, in the opinion of a West Glamorgan native, could easily pass as one of us.Visually it's incredibly good, with beautiful cinematography that makes great use of locations and maintains a strong sense of mood. As ever, the art design is outstanding.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter 7a,"Almost everyone reading this review will have read the Harry Potter novels and seen the previous six films. Deathly Hallows part 1 is a natural progression from the earlier works--faithful to the book and very well done.I didn't enjoy the film very much, but that reflects the ""calm before the storm"" aspect of the plot. Everything in this film is preparing us for the final shootout (curseout?) that will take place in 7b.We don't learn too much new in this movie. We already know that adolescents have sexual fantasies, Emma Watson looks good in jeans, and Voldemort is a really, really bad guy.Except for the three stars, all the other regulars just have cameo roles, although Dauby has one great scene.If you're into Harry Potter, naturally you have to see this film. If not, it's not the one with which to begin.As always, the special effects are great, and many will be lost on a small screen. If you're going to see the movie, see it in a theater if possible.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I wanted it to be better somehow,"I've seen all of the Harry Potter films and read the first 3 books. Going to the films has been a big movie event for us ever since the first one was announced all those years ago. I really enjoyed the first couple of ""innocent"" romps.For my money though - and I have to say this - Rowling had no way to foresee the immense success of the first couple of books. They are fun, fresh and you want to find out more - so you keep reading/watching. Then it started getting serious - and a worldwide audience grew and required satisfaction. This is where the writer began to search for deeper issues, more complexity, more ""poke"". The plot lines begin to get stretched deep and moody, the author is trying to get to things which she never anticipated ever having to write about, because she never thought there would ever be any demand for any later works. She tries hard with the elemental Good Vs Evil thing and through interesting characters and connections manages to get to the 4th book out. I put Book 4 down because the whole concept had run its course by then. I didn't need to read anymore.Book/Film 4 is the point where my patience wears thin. So you can imagine that by this film I'm going along because Harry Potter films have become a habit - they have punctuated my life.I didn't really enjoy this film - it's not there to be enjoyed. It's a bleak, dark, thankless watch which has not one jot of the joy and fun of the early works. Sure - there's a war, sure, the badies are winning, sure - our heroes don't look so bright and shiny now that they don't really know what they are doing. But I found that I hardly cared; I wanted to, but I didn't.I'm assured that the film is very true to the book; and this film will satisfy devotees of the books (like my wife...). But it just didn't do it for me. I watched it as someone who has seen all the films and felt the need to watch this out of a sense of completeness. I'm not going to say I was disappointed - I like the screen Harry Potter and want to see how he and his friends develop and perform as characters. Given the content I don't think that the film could have been any different to how it was; I just wanted it to be better somehow.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1,"Great movie and the saddest movie in the Harry Potter series. The story of the movie was amazing. It clearly outperformed the rest of the parts. Acting in the movie was excellent. The action scenes were few, but they were amazing. I was getting a little bored while watching the movie. I know it's a prequel to the next movie, but if it was shorter, it would be so much better, my rating for the movie is 8.5.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry the fugitive,"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part I finds young Harry played by Daniel Radcliffe and his posse Rupert Grint and Emma Watson fugitives after a palace coup at Hogwarts. The academy of magic has been taken over by Professor Rufus Snape after headmaster Dumbledore has been killed. It's not just that Harry and his friends know too much, it's that Harry has a mysterious connection with the mysterious black lord Voldemort, the evil genius behind all the bad things happening. And Voldemort is quite anxious to sever the connection and sever young Mr. Potter from immortality.In this next to last of the Harry Potter series the familiar cast goes through their usual paces as young Harry and his friends are exiled from Hogwarts and have to live by their wits, knowledge of magic, and the help of friends. The Deathly Hallows refer to three charmed objects that he must destroy to keep Voldemort from taking over the world of magic.This film received Academy Award recognition with Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction. One thing the Potter films have done is certainly brought an appreciation of Charles Dickens to the young. After you've read J.K. Rowling's work, you will love how she's given such descriptive names to her characters in the way Dickens used to. And if Harry Potter isn't a 21st reincarnation of David Copperfield, then I don't know my Dickens.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice change of pace,"Change of pace for our three heroes, as the hunt for Voldy's Horcruxes begins. The young actors have the scope to show us their chops, with Watson finally showing us what she is capable of.

Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"If it is a film for fans only, it turns out that I'm not a pious fan of Harry Potter series, which could be the truth, I only read one book (I vaguely remembered it was the third one), still I will be satisfied to watch the final installment next year, even though this one hardly meets my appetite.Okay, let me complain a little bit about the pace, I sense that the trio's road-trip is lengthy and the conflict between Harry and Ron is weakly ensnared (have no idea it is a faithful adaption from the book), and as an average audience, I am very puzzled with the subtraction of how 7 Horcruxes suddenly reduced to 3 after they destroyed one in the film. On the other hand, lots of supporting characters sacrificed their screen-time in order to leave enough stage for the trio, which effectively extinguished a great quantity of fun (poor Snipe only appears in 5 minutes at the beginning).The great side is that even the plot is getting darker and darker, the merrier moments are all deprived from the film, nevertheless this film is not as scare as its recent precedents (only the python scared me a little bit when it jumped out from nowhere, which could have been upgraded as an impressive 3D set piece). The depiction of the three brothers' anecdote is definite the highlight, the scissor-cut cartoon creates an oriental impression and saves the film from the tiredness.I wish I could watch it in an IMAX screen instead of just an ordinary one, but I noticed all the seats were occupied, I think this one will reach a new peak on the box office chart in China for Harry Potter series, maybe 300 million Chinese dollars is not a fool's paradise.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deathly Hallows Pt 1,"Deathly Hallows Part 1 serves as a necessary separate movie to set the stage for the finale. It takes place outside of Hogwarts which is cool and interesting to see but I feel like it makes it lose some magic and connection to the others. There's also a lot that happens in terms of chasing down Voldemort's horcruxes but ultimately there's no ""major"" scenes. Again, more so serving the purpose to reveal history and context to prepare everyone for the last movie. It also had moments that were a little dragged out and boring at times. But nevertheless, it was needed to pave the way for the best and last movie of the HP series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Detect anything?,"The first five ""Harry Potter"" movies all have one significant thing in common. Regardless of the plot, the ending is conclusive. Obviously, it's clear the big picture is not yet complete, but this one, this particular installment in the huge franchise is nicely ""wrapped up"". Discoveries may have been made, tragedies may have shaken our heroes' world, but for now, it is over, and they're all happy and at peace. As are we, the viewers. Then ""The Half-Blood Prince"" arrived and something was different. The ending was different. This time, regardless of how big the events depicted in the movie were, the ending was a strong way to make you immediately want more. This time, if you didn't read the books, you still knew exactly what our heroes were going to be up to in the following film, and that film arrived.The seventh one opens with a short but strong sequence of introductory events which all basically tell you one important thing. There's a storm coming. Then, several discoveries can be made. Some movies rely too much on big and loud things to make sure you are entertained, and the result can be a problem. A movie with too much ""action"" can easily bore and even make you feel tired. Look no further than some of the ""Transformers"" movies from Michael Bay. Such movies lack air and they suffocate under their own weight. But ""Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is the opposite. It is slow. It wants to appear as realistic and serious as possible and gets carried away in that regard, and can bore you because of how little is happening in the plot. There are big and exciting episodes, of course, but the overall impression is far from exciting. The plot is unbalanced, and the movie ends with bait that immediately makes you want to see what happens next. Also, the movie underuses Bill Nighy and Brandan Gleeson. That is not a positive thing to say, considering the significance of the characters they portray in the movie.Speaking of the characters, the main heroes are three teenagers, two boys and one girl. They are the main characters throughout the entire saga, obviously, but this time, more emphasis seems to be given to one disturbing element. That element is the fact that the girl, Hermione, is more capable than both the boys, Harry and Ron. They are superior to her physically, which is only natural for a male human being. But it is clear they wouldn't have survived the movie without her intelligence. It even has to be said by one of them. Ron says to Harry they are not going to last two days without her. He later tells her she's best with spells, Harry later compliments her on her brilliant intelligence. Obviously, one can be wrong to suspect something here. But the target audience of these movies is kids. And the kids are basically taught that boys are dumb and all they can is use their physical bodily superiority, and the girls are so much better. And if that isn't enough, Hermione and Ron are dating, and Hermione reveals in the movie that she is always mad at Ron. She is always mad at Ron but they keep dating. That is not normal at all, that is a serious problem, and it should be dealt with, a family should not be created by two individuals that cannot have peace together. But the movie makes it look normal.A very promising opening followed by a stretched out and unbalanced plot and ended with a scene that basically baits the next movie. Was this satisfying? Yes, it was. The actors were great, the music was impressive. Was it good? One is free to rightfully doubt and question that. The cinematography could have been better, the computer generated snake was clearly computer generated, and the plot could have been put together and paced in a better way.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The best Potter film yet, but it is only an appetizer, prompting us for the main course.","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, is the third Potter film to be helmed by director David Yates. Since Yate's catastophe he called, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" got bad reviews, he kicked it up a notch, directing beautifully in, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". This time, in Deathly Hallows, he kicks it up about 12 notches. Beautifully filmed, this Potter film is without question, the best. The film really is brilliantly acted as well, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint really give it their all in this sometimes emotional and dreary entry. Radcliffe is still mediocre though, and we can't help but feel that his acting is kind of weak at points. But Helena Bonham Carter's over-the-top Bellatrix counteracts that weakness, even though she is in the film for only a small period of time. Alan Rickman as Snape, is barley even there in this film. We see him once in the film's killer opening sequence, but then he vanishes.In this Potter installment, Harry and friends must destroy the evil Lord Voldemort once and for all. They set out on a dangeous and life threatening mission to find Horcruxes, each an object where Voldemort had split his soul and hid. If you are a Potter virgin, please do not go see this film. You wil be baffled by the countless names and places included in the story.Gorgeously lensed by the magnificent cinematographer, Eduardo Serra, this film is a lot more sullen and more bleak than the others, which is very apparent considering the material worked with. It seems less magical and more real life. The early technicolor palet that chris Columbus often used is a farewell to us. This is the prelude to the last Potter finale, which will be in theaters July of 2011, so it does feel unfinished. But that is the adventure in the Potter films. You never know what your gonna get.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow plot progression to stretch into two movies,"While the opening is as thrilling as it is emotional, the story grinds to a halt after Harry, Ron, and Hermione are separated from their friends and family. The inclusion of several drawn out subplots make it unclear whether this final chapter needed to be split into two parts at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"I was impressed as always with the film itself but it could have been cut down to a much shorter film. The layover in the different locations got a bit boring. I'm guessing without doing any exact timing it could have been cut down to at least under 2 hours. I'm hoping the final part will have a bit more action and less milling around. I would rather sit through a three to four hour single part film then have to wait 8 months for the final part. The old epic films when we'd sit through a 3¬Ω hour film with an intermission would be perfect for this finale. They could have combined both parts, made it in 3-D and had a brief intermission.And I definitely agree with the person that said, don't bring the kids. The series has gotten darker since movie #5. The cast and film has grown up in years as should the viewers. I would not bring my grade school child but someone who saw Part 1 as a youngster would appreciate it more now some 10 years later. Can't wait for the final film, hoping for a good follow-up and watching both parts on blu-ray in a year or two.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best harry potter yet...,"when watching this i found it to be closest to the book than any other film. there was only 1 or 2 moments where i thought, that didn't happen in the book, where as in the others, i constantly was disappointed by the huge changes made.the acting was best out of all harry potter films. i think after all these years, Daniel Radcliffe has started improving on his acting.the chemistry between Ron nd Hermione was as usual, very well done.i thought the direction was very good too. although my personal favourite film was prisoner of azkabam, because of the great directing and style, this was done well too. build up and action scenes where done exactly how i pictured them in the book.now the bad side, which is how i feel in all harry potter films, and i feel most people would disagree. the costumes worn by the main characters were poor. this is set in the present, yet harry and Ron walk around wearing the most ridiculous clothing. obviously I'm not expecting Fred perry tops and Adidas joggers, but come on. i saw weird purple vests from Ron, over sized jackets, green waistcoats from harry. not good. as always, they've made harry look too geeky, silly haircut. i know thats how it is in the book, but they could have done it better like in prisoner of azkabam.special effects were much improved from previous ones, and all acting from Beatrix, voldermort, etc was brilliant.overall, i thought this was the best adaptation from the book, and was very intense and done very well.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I recommend this movie for viewing,"One of my favorite movies is Harry Potter. It is a whole series of movies directed by Chris Columbus. The first film was released in 2001 in the United Kingdom. The movies are based on the books by Joan Rowling. The story is about an orphan boy living with his uncles and aunt. On his 11th birthday, Harry unexpectedly discovers he has magic and goes to Hogwarts. There he meets Hermione Ron, and the main events of the film take place with them. The setting of the movie is simply mesmerizing in its beauty, the delightful scenery, the flying around on broomsticks, everything immerses you in this magical world. I really like these movies and recommend them to all people of all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1: Captivating,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is absolutely spellbinding; a full-blown fantasy epic with the magic, heart, and characters we have come to love over the last decade's worth of Harry Potter films. However it is a different world. For our heroes Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer bound to the safe haven Hogwarts once provided, but are on the run, trying to find the Horcruxes to defeat Voldemort.Dan, Rupert, and Emma have never been better, and Rupert especially manages to project genuine anguish and emotion into the audience, something we have not seen from him before. Emma Watson has always been in my opinion the strongest of the three, and its no different here. You can't teach the way she delivers lines and between her and Toby Jones as Dobby, the two of them steal the show. That's not to say that Daniel Radcliffe was not a standout as Harry. He carries the film quite well as our reluctant hero, and manages to convincingly pull off some very tense moments in the film. Ralph Fiennes as always is terrifying as the Dark Lord, even with his limited screen time, and Helena Bonham Carter is Bellatrix Lestrange (notably in the final few scenes which get quite crazy). This franchise really has casted better than any I've seen in quite some time.The special effects as always are breathtaking, with many enthralling action sequences throughout, with some noteworthy cinematography from Eduardo Serra. The nature and scenery shots are absolutely beautiful and the darker, greenish tints play quite nicely with the film's mature tone. On that note this truly is the darkest film by far. Violence and gore is seen throughout, as well as some more adult themes, and the little ones should be cautioned. That being said, if your family has grown up with Harry Potter, then it should be no problem.Unsurprisingly, this film adapts the book incredibly well, probably the best since Chamber of Secrets, due to its splitting of the final book. Some have criticized the film as being slow in the middle because of the camping scenes. I have to disagree with these critiques however, for it moved quite nicely, and every scene had information relevant to the plot. Fans of the books will be incredibly excited by the attention to detail portrayed in this ""Potter"", and the subplots included. David Yates has finally directed the film that will please both the die-hard fans and the casual moviegoer. All of the films have been masterfully done, but I am aware as a fan of the books, that some fans have been slightly disappointed by the adaptations of the last two films. That being said I was extremely satisfied by this film as both an adaptation and prelude. I do feel like this film will be especially fun to watch back to back once Part 2 comes out, which I can not wait for. If you have not seen the previous movies, or read the books, do not bother with this movie. You will not enjoy it more than likely, and be confused beyond reasonable doubt. Overall this film is absolutely mind-blowing, and now my favorite of the films that were previously Goblet of Fire and Prisoner of Azkaban. And yet, it is only half the journey. For the epic finale awaits in July, and as we draw nearer to the close of our beloved boy wizard, one can only wonder if the magic will ever really end?.....",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Where the split the film is a good decision, but it leaves the viewer dying for the second part; probably great planning on WB's behalf. Well done. It is lacking something though, but as someone who read the books I'm going to believe that something is missing, but overall it is an amazing adaptation.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Majorly boring... I fell asleep.,"I have never really been a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I never read the books, but I did see all the movies so far. I didn't think of them as super or great, but not bad either. I would say, to me personally, they all hover around a 7.0.However this last 7.1 HP movie was really terrible. I am glad I did not pay for it (borrowed it) because what a ripoff it would have been if you paid money for this.I just turned it off after 1,5 hours after the whole woman snake scene... I just couldn't care to watch it further anymore. This movie is so slow, so boring, so uninteresting.... I don't see how even the fans could like this.

Still not a 'HARRY POTTER' fan but I can always admire a well made movie!,"'HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1': Four Stars (Out of Five)I'm not a big 'HARRY POTTER' fan, I've never read any of the books and although I've seen all the movies I've never been that involved in any of them. Although I'm a huge fan of creative and imaginative sci-fi and fantasy the world of 'Harry Potter' has never been that fascinating or interesting to me. With that said I do admire and respect the films for being able to capture the essence of the books (I'm told) and so effectively deliver what the fans want to see. Despite a rough start with the first two films (the poorest received by fans and critics alike) the films have gotten better and more mature, for the most part, with each installment (despite a mild setback with 2007's 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX', the next worst received of the series). It is only fitting that as the characters mature the movies do as well and this installment is by far the darkest and most mature yet; I'd imagine it's far too frightening for most young children.The film is once again directed by David Yates, who has directed the last three films as well as the upcoming final chapter. The only other director in the series to direct more than one installment was Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films (and many thought butchered the job). It's once again written by Steve Kloves (adapted from J.K. Rowling's book of course) who's written every single film adaptation in the series except for 'ORDER OF THE PHOENIX', which was written by Michael Goldenberg (and is where the series faltered of course). Daniel Radcliffe (who is now 21), Emma Watson (20) and Rupert Grint (22) all reprise their roles of Harry, Hermione and Ron. The film is adapted from the first half of the seventh and last book of the series.The film continues the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione's continuing journey to thwart the plans of the evil Lord Voldemort (once again played by Ralph Fiennes) and save the 'Wizarding World'. Voldermort now has control of the 'Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts' and as the movie opens the 'Order of the Phoenix' meets to move Harry from Pivet Drive to the Burrow by flying him there to avoid the Ministry's detection. They also use a special potion in order to create Harry lookalikes to confuse any 'Death Eaters' that might attack mid-flight. After surviving an immediate attack they make it to the burrow with some casualties. Once there they begin preparing for a wedding during which they are again attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Ron and Hermione escape to central London to continue the late Dumbledore's mission of finding the Horcruxes and destroying them in order to defeat Voldermort. The problem is that once they find one they have no idea how to destroy it. Things get dismal and convoluted and the story stretches on (and it's only half over).I found my mind drifting, losing interest and becoming confused on what was going on several times during the movie (as I do with all the films) but I was always visually captivated with what was being depicted in front of me. The cinematography, by Eduardo Serra, is breathtaking and Yate's directing has only gotten better and more interesting with each film. The way he handles the subtlest of character driven scenes is fascinating, as well as his adept ability to orchestrate a complex action scene. The score by Alexandre Desplat is involving but minimally used to great effect. Although I had a hard time focusing at times and felt the story dragged on too long I did admire how well executed it is and could tell if I was a fan of the material I would have been captivated. The filmmaker's obviously treat their fans very seriously and don't talk down to them at all. I like how much more mature the films have gotten with time and truly feel that they're no longer kids' films. I'm still not a big fan of the series but I can always admire a well made movie and this (like most before it) is one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEG4WJ28XNA",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The plot of the film might not be the most complex but still keeps you engaged.Theres a lot of character development for a few of the more minor but more interesting characters i.e. Creature, Dobby and Belatrix.Once again the performances are excellent from the cast.

The epic and amazing tale of Harry Potter will soon come to an end.,"I honestly just don't know what to say. Its all started in some coffee shop in the United Kingdom, and its going to end on the electronic billboards of Trafalger Square and big screens all over the world. Harry Potter has been with us as we grew up and now its going to end. Its kind of hard to believe. Whenever a new movie came out, everyone was pleased and excited to see the next one. 'There will always be a next one'. Nope. The reason we will all feel different in the cinema on July 15, is because this is the last one. I'm going to be honest, I have not known about Harry Potter as long as some other people have, but I know how they feel.In my opinion (and most others' around the world) J.K. Rowling is a complete genius. I couldn't have come up with an idea like that even if i was given ten years. ""The idea simply just fell into my head"" she says. Well, that's kind of rare for a lot of people trying to come up with a good story. Because of that idea, she wrote seven books, became famous worldwide, and eventually became richer than the queen of England. Now that, is what I call a success.These books always made me feel different no matter what mood I was in. Whenever I read the books, It made me feel all wondrous and awestruck. if I was in one mood or the other, the magical tale of Harry Potter always made me feel different.The movies made me feel even better. What annoys me rather a lot, is how people say they are true Harry Potter fans, just because they have seen all of the movies. The movies make you look at the series differently than the books do, i'm afraid. Yes, Warner Bros. Has done very well transforming J.K. Rowling's amazing tale into motion pictures, but nothing beats the good old Harry Potter Book. If you ask me, you enjoy the movie a lot more if you have read the book. Seriously, depending on how the movie makers did it out as a motion picture according to the book, it may just ruin your day, or make your day. Maybe both!Yes, the movies are amazing, but there is no doubt about this: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was the most amazing movie I have ever seen based on harry Potter. Warner Bros. should be proud of themselves. They really did it this time. Better than any other of the 6 movies. Soon to be 7.A part of me wants the last movie to release tomorrow. A part of me wants it never to come.When I sat in the theater, watching the Deathly Hallows Part 1, and I saw that Warner Bros. logo striding towards me, hearing the theme music playing, I really knew that that was the beginning of the end.I have heard rumors that Rowling is planning on making an eighth book, but that wont matter to me. don't get me wrong, I will still read it, and I'll probably like it, but the truth is, J.K. Rowling was done her job as an author, and has brought happiness to readers all over the world. Her duty, is done.An awesome, epic series like Harry Potter will last a long time, but unfortunately, everything every good series eventually comes to an end. We hope the world keeps this amazing tale alive, and we hope you always will be with us, in the magical world, of Harry Potter.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter Review,"As a Harry Potter fan, this was a long anticipated watch for me. I was so excited to see this film and had high expectations. Needless to say part one of the deathly hallows exceeded my expectations. First, this film is for sure PG-13 for a reason because Harry and his trio go through and experience older situations and there is a lot of death in the movie. Yate's ability to make the book come alive is unreal, and the plot had all of the fan favorites: romance, thriller, and adventure. I feel like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint completely transformed into their characters and brought me into the movie with them. I was able to feel the emotions in the scenes because of their amazing acting ability/range. Also, the background music choices were so fitting for the movie, they couldn't have been better. This film has crushed my heart and put it back together with the amazing acting and cinematography. Beware Harry Potter fans, tears will come... Go watch this movie!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter: 9/10,"It is a shame that Warner Bros decided to split the franchise into 2 parts, but that was however a very smart move. Even though the movies were made to satisfy the fans, but its main reason was to make more money with Harry, Ron, and Hermoine. We'd watched all three of them grow for a decade, now to think that they're all adults and the franchise is going to be over soon, it is an odd feeling to say the least. The wizard world is corrupting because Lord Voldemort is back with his powers. Even the Ministry of Magic has to hide. The movie takes us on a journey with the three friends rather than giving us a battle between Harry and Voldemort. This is the number one reason fans are complaining about: there wasn't enough action and adventure. But in my opinion, the movie is just building tension for the next one. Even though the film doesn't give much on action, the acting is perfectly where we want it. The three friends give it their all but standing out is Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and his evil companion Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter). The make-up part in the franchise is always mesmerizing to see. These artists must've worked really hard to have Voldemort's face looked like that! Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 does not disappoints at all, not with its fine acting and brilliant make-up.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

In terms of cinematography, the colour palettes really reflect the depression and hopeless feel in the film, there are also a lot of long shots that enhance the emotions. I'd like to mention the three brothers animation which is absolutely gorgeous and definitely my favourite scene from the film!The music is used very well and the sound design sounds very professional. The score builds up sich a strong sense of dread, with music that gets quite chaotic during the intense scenes! It works very well for the film. The song choice during the Hermione and Harry dance scene is beautiful and the perfect choice to tie the scene together!The actors all out an enormous amount of effort into this film and it shows! I'd specifically like to talk about Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, he is so intimidating! The dialogue is well written and in-depth too, a lot of my favourite scenes are where characters are just stood talking.The film starts off on a very sad note, with Hermione erasing her parents' memories, and it sets the tone so well. It's tense right from the start with a strong atmosphere and some slow yet steady pacing. The film also ends with a cliffhanger that always has me excited for the next one!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The end is near,"DOBBYYYY!!Last movie, they still said his name, now, he became you-know-who again. That's how much danger Harry and his friends were in.The opening scene of this movie was the best so far. The long chase through the Muggle's world was fast and riveting. The camera angles were creative with many cuts. They were a little bit disorienting, but still entertaining.What I liked the most was in this one, the trio spent most of their time together. Everywhere they went, the dark order was there and ready to ambush them. Even worse, the danger was so great that it affected the friendship. Also the romance, not as big of a part in this one, was still there. I enjoyed the focus on the trio quite a bit.In addition to the trio trying to run away from the dark order, they learned more about the history of you-know-who, as well as other important characters. There was a lot of mystery being explored, and it got me invested throughout the runtime.Overall, a dark and grim continuation of the story that is nearly coming to an end. Fight on Gryffindor! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Bellatrix has given Dobby a knife! Dobby is a free elf""","They decided to break the last book in to two parts, what a great idea. It's just a shame that there's still so much missing, so much that wasn't explained in the previous films, because they weren't given the same two-part treatment. It's quite difficult to sit and enjoy this film when you've got a room full of Muggles, who have never read the books or forgotten that they did and they keep asking questions about it, because at some points there is literally no explanation of the things going on. Even my knowledge isn't as good as it was, having not read the books for a while and with the films stretching things so much, it's easy ti confuse what is really supposed to be happening. I wonder if J.K. had a hissy fit at any point and stormed off the sets whilst some of these films were being made as I surely would have, because they were cutting so many of the necessary backstories.As you can tell, I am quite frustrated by the film franchise that has been interpreted from seven outstandingly great books. If it's not made in to a Netflix series or a 7 year BBC Christmas special series, like 'Dark Materials', I don't think we will ever get the story properly told except in the books.However! With all that said, because I do know what happens in the books, mostly, I can still enjoy this film as one of my favourites of the eight. I like endings. I like everything tied up in a neat little bow and this is the beginning of that conclusion.
It is a shame that the start of this one is so rushed as you don't get to see what they're fighting for, which is probably why the wedding scene was there in the first place. I don't know for sure, you'll have to ask Jo?The special effects have definitely improved since the appalling Neville on the Broomstick scene in 'Philosopher's Stone', but it's all filmed in a very dark way. I actually had to turn the lights off in the lounge to be able to see anything moving on the screen at one point.It's great that the story gets more real and by that I mean that it has a more adult and mature view of the world, as a seventeen year old might see it. As with the books, the films have at least grown up with Harry and his readers.The cast are all generally acting well, but with no noticeable stand out stars, but why is Bill Weasley (Domnhall Gleeson) being Australian? I know he's been abroad, but that was Romania. Is there a fan fiction out there explaining that he got cursed by Fred & George when they were younger and he's never been able to find a fix for it? Or is it just bad direction/character development?They seemed to have enjoyed getting Daniel repeatedly topless, which I really don't mind and I think was probably put in for the adoring fans, so enjoy that if you can, especially if you can forget what a goofy looking goober he was just a few years earlier in 'Philosopher's/Chamber/Etc' at only 11 years old.Overall as a Harry Potter fan, I can say that I like this film. I'm just disappointed that I don't love it and I feel it misses a trick by not being more accessible to others.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No Hogwarts. No Problems.,"The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the first Harry Potter movie that is not set in Hogwarts as Harry Potter is on a quest to find and destroy all the Horcruxes. This does not dissipate the excitement and in fact it has improved the story as the main characters are not bound by anything.As this is a two part movie, the first movie acts as a set up to the final movie due to which the ending seems unresolved which may by disappointing for some. However, most of the movie builds up to a crescendo which will likely be ending with a rousing climax in the second part.The acting is wonderful as all the lead characters return for this film. Due to the increasing difficulty in making any progress, Ron gets extremely frustrated and even leaves Harry and Hermione only to return later.Other Technical Aspects of this film is solid as usual. As the director is the same as that for the previous two films, it makes it much easier to work in a world that has already been developed vividly.After watching this movie, I cannot wait for the second movie. I would suggest to everyone to watch the two parts back to back as it will deliver the greatest amount of satisfaction.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another good movie.. but,"I gave mostly 9s to the series of movies but frankly this one had such long spans of nothing going on, hanging out in tents with no purpose and no meaning... as with. Hallows 2.. I was disappointed... I've watched the entire series a third time over the ast week and After reading the book I felt so much more could've been made of DH Part 1. I had to rate the final two movies in relevance to how I rated the others and after all these years and multiple viewings I really think Yates and Rowling failed to bring across the wonderful ending in the books. I hope the movies are redone in my lifetime, I'd love to see another screenwriter and Directors take on the books.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

1 Word amazing !!,"This is such an amazing film you can't not like it, its the second best one yet and seeing as I'm a horror fanatic it was quite scary for a harry potter film which made me enjoy it even more than i did the storyline is brilliant the use of the deathly hallows story background was immense and the acting as usual was amazing I give this 9/10 amazing film !!!!!! There is just something about this film that leaves you with an amazing happy feeling but an eager feeling for the second one .

Harry potter,"I think it's rather boring... Way to much conversation! Plus, after all, nothing really happened? I hope part 2 will make up a bit... You expect a lot because at the beginning there's like a lot of action but then it's done. I just don't understand why everyone says 'oh he's so good, haven't you seen him yet?' Then you obligate yourself to go and watch it and then it comes: disappointment... All the elements of the book are found in the movie but in the book I liked to read it, this movie, no, I'm sorry. I haven't seen a lot of movies but this one is definitely not one of the better ones. I think I'll stick onto the older movies again! They could also made it much shorter.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"In a Nutshell: ""Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1"" (8/10)","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1...""These are dark times, there's no denying""If you read around and check out reviews on The Deathly Hallows, you'll see that the most predominant theme of the hype about this film is anticipation. Literally, the most redundant keyword in the first paragraph of any article, any review or any news report is the word ""Finally"". HP7 is tagged in its trailer as the finale of the worldwide phenomenon, the motion picture of a generation. Needless to say, it is one of the best selling stories of all times. Bottom line is, like the movie or not, it made over 300 million dollars in the first few days, and judging by how things look, this should be just a tiny fraction of its coming success.As a result of the intense criticism on the last three Potter movies for not being worthy of the books, David Yates and Warner Bros. had to spread the finale on two long films; a decision leading to an utter cinematic and commercial success. And since the fans can't get enough, you can always give them some more on the boy who lived, the chosen one and his magical adventures that have become the prevailing obsession of millions around the globe.The gloominess of the opening scene and the dramatic dose you get from the film's first lines spoken by Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) tell you all about what you're in for; a journey of darkness, a daring quest of the good to defy the evil, a hopeful adventure shadowed by blood, love, tears and death. After the sad ending of late Dumbledore, it is now Harry's mission to find and destroy all the horcruxes that shield Lord Voldemort from death. As Potter accompanies his lifetime mates Ron and Hermione through their ultimate journey, they stumble across some of the most significant and powerful secrets of the wizarding world, the deathly hallows.When you watch The Deathly Hallows Part one, you'd only wish they did the same with at least the last two books; split them in two. God knows how many scenes and characters had to be knocked out to fit in something like The Order of the Phoenix in one movie. This time they fill it in with details that even book readers may have forgotten about. The events go on sort of an inverse bell curve scenario; it starts off exhilarating and thrilling, it mellows down a bit in the middle and then it gets all fired up towards an ending that comes very quick.It is safe to say that behind the scenes aspects, of making a movie, all played out quite well in this one. We've seen more sophisticated cinematography and art direction in previous episodes of the saga, but this still does have its eye catching moments as well. Acting, however, has evidentially elevated quite a bit here. An obvious reason for that is the age of the main three characters that have grown in shape and experience through ten years of shooting. But it is not to be ignored that Emma Watson is the one that stands out this time; her character's confusion of emotion, determination and humour were damn sure not easy to be portrayed as good as she did.We've also seen something new to the saga in this one, and it was indeed some of the most amusing three minutes of the whole thing, an actual animated short. The tale of the three brothers narrated by Hermione plays back in a shadow, puppet- like animated sequence, that is just pretty entertaining.In a nutshell, The Deathly Hallows Part one is merely is a lengthy introduction to the ultimate climax of this masterpiece of a story. It's truly beyond me how J K Rowling is not yet up for a Noble Prize in Literature. This film paves quite the road to what's coming ahead, and looking at that combo trailer, it gonna be quite fun. It will feel at the end as if someone has switched the TV off in the middle of your movie. You will really want some more. Too bad you'll have to wait another eight months for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 sets the stage for an epic conclusion,"As the penultimate film in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 sets the stage for an epic conclusion to the beloved franchise. This film takes a darker turn as it follows Harry, Ron, and Hermione's journey to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes, all while being hunted by Voldemort and his followers.The story is well-paced, and the tension builds steadily throughout the film. The plot is intricate, and the attention to detail is impressive. The film's slower pace allows for character development, and the dynamic between the trio is explored in greater depth. We see the strain that their quest puts on their friendship, and the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are excellent. They convey the complexities of their characters' emotions with subtlety and nuance.The film's visual effects are stunning, and the cinematography captures the bleakness of their journey with a somber beauty. The film also benefits from a stellar supporting cast, including Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, and Imelda Staunton. They bring a level of gravitas to their roles that elevates the film.One of the standout scenes is the animated sequence that tells the story of the Deathly Hallows. It's a creative and visually striking way to convey an important part of the story. The film also includes several action sequences that are well choreographed and thrilling.However, the film's main flaw is its lack of resolution. As the first part of a two-part finale, the film ends on a cliffhanger, which can be frustrating for some viewers. It's clear that the story is building towards something big, but the lack of closure may leave some feeling unsatisfied.Overall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a strong entry in the series. It sets the stage for an epic conclusion and handles the more mature themes of the story with care. The performances, visual effects, and pacing all contribute to a film that is both engaging and emotionally resonant.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A gorgeous bunch of nothing,"There is no doubt that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the weakest entry in the Harry Potter franchise, which furthermore makes me doubt the weird decision of splitting this adaption into two separate films, since basically nothing ever happens in its 2 hour 26 running time.The cinematography is once again astonishing. While not as good as Azkaban's or Half-Blood Prince's cinematography, cinematographer Eduardo Serra does manage to create some beautiful images in this film, but in truth these are images for the sake of being images and not much else, since our three heroes spend hours in some forest in the outdoors while the direction focuses on a couple bits of melodrama & inner struggles, which ofcourse succeeds greatly as a time filler, but in the end it has little context. It starts off with this weird escape from the Dursleys towards the Weasley home ( which i thought was destroyed in Half-Blood Prince, but i guess nothing has to make sense in this movie ), even though the Dursleys was not the place we left off in Half-Blood Prince, making me even doubt how they got there in the first place without the death eaters interfering. Ofcourse, with tension for the sake of being tension they somehow do manage to find the crew when they travel back from the Dursleys, and after some death and injuries they afterwards decide to have a wedding party, which in itself is ofcourse asking for trouble, and it makes little sense in the context of what is happening.We also have a scene at the start to show how 'evil' Voldemort is and how we are supposed to hate him, with some unknown woman who is supposedly a teacher at Hogwarts as captive being killed for liking muggle-wizard connections. Unfortunately, this is not a very subtle way of forcing the audience to direct their emotions of hatred towards him, and since films should always leave that choice to the viewer themselves, or atleast pick a known character to be killed, this scene, like most in Part 1, is a time filler and nothing else.It is a film that is very different from previous Potter films since it seems to be a documentary about forests and outdoor scenery instead of something that is supposed to have an actual plot. The connection between the three main characters has never been worse as it was in the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. All three of them bicker and argue amongst themselves and none of them create any sympathy for the viewer, except maybe Hermione ( Emma Watson ). The biggest problem with this motion picture is that it is simply going nowhere. All the melodrama between Harry, Ron & Hermione is just such obvious filler while they try to charm the audience with its cinematography that it becomes an obvious wasted effort, and after the ending you will probably wonder 'Is that it?', since absolutely nothing happens.It has often been cited as 'Too slow', but that is not the problem at all. The problem is the entire plot is so vacuous of structure and payoff, and while most slow movies have a general core for its narrative or seem to be going somewhere, literally nothing ever brings a payoff in Deathly Hallows Part 1, it simply drowns in all its melodrama and the need to split the novel into two parts. The few action sequences that are there feature a lot of shakycam like Harry Potter has turned into a Jason Bourne film so you can no longer have any idea about what is going on. It hurts the eyes to watch, and it also hurts the eyes to witness this sluggish bunch of nonsense that never goes anywhere.If you enjoy documentairies with great cinematography about forests and general outdoor scenery, this is the film to watch. Otherwise, as something that is not intended as purely a time filler, and having an actual narrative structure, it fails on every aspect, since absolutely nothing seems to happen during the entire course of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Best Potter film yet!,"This is one of the best Harry Potter films yet. It follows the book very well (probably the best so far). This is my personal favorite Potter movie ever, It has the best acting yet and very amazing special effects. The actors are amazingly great and very well cast but have been from the beginning. This part of the series has just the right balance of effects and normal movie acting. Radcliffe has done an excellent job of being harry and always has but it is shown greatly in this movie. Watson is a very great actor and does an amazing job with this film. Grint has always been a good actor throughout all of the movies in this one though he does a superb job of portraying the character well.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Black Sheep of the Franchise,"The first time I watched this film, I was bored out of my skull. I left the film with the impression that it was the most pointless film in the franchise. Granted, I was eleven years old. But even as I matured and provided the franchise with a ridiculous amount of day-long marathons, I always skipped over this film, thinking that I was avoiding a useless addition to the series that was universally disliked for its meandering slowness. But recently, I gave it an honest effort, and boy, was I surprised. As a summer blockbuster, it falls flat on its face. But as a brooding and powerful film that depicts the characters that I know and love being forced to mature in the real world, it excels beyond any other of the films in the franchise.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 begins with Harry, Ron, and Hermione preparing to hunt Voldemort's Horcruxes, or pieces of his soul, in order to finally defeat him. But they are forced to undertake this task on their own. Dumbledore, having died, is no longer there to guide their quest. Thus, the trio now faces their most difficult challenge yet. They have barely anything to go off of in the search, and don't even have a weapon with which they can kill the Horcruxes.They are forced to wander the land aimlessly, slowly piecing things together, dodging Snatchers and spending many a day trekking across vast landscapes wonderfully captured with stunning cinematography. Even the action scenes, which are very sparse in this film, are subtly spectacular, director David Yates taking an often minimalistic, yet effective approach to every frantic shot. The scene in which the trio runs away from the Snatchers is definitely one of my favourite scenes in the whole franchise.But it is in this film that we see these characters as actual human beings, capable of sadness, anger, and loneliness. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all have their little bouts with each other as their emerging personalities clash. Ron is no longer the comic relief. He becomes the one who actually has something to lose. Harry is no longer the proud little boy. He is driven by the guilt he feels towards his mistakes and perhaps even his existence. Hermione is no longer the nerdy little girl. She becomes instead the lonely woman, attempting to keep her friends together after removing herself from her own family. This added depth of humanity is what drives the film, much unlike the previous films which were driven by action and an overall sense of wonder. It is surprisingly mature coming from a franchise about witchcraft and wizardry.This film understands its roots, and pays them tribute by adding humanity to them. In the first scene of the film, Harry waits in Number Four, Privet Drive for Order of the Phoenix to arrive. As he walks through the empty house, he expresses a certain fondness for it, despite the hardships that he endured there. In a way, he forgives it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
