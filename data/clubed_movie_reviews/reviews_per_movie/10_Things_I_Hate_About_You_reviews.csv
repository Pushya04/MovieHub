Shakespeare's teen rom-com,"Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is a hard girl to like. Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a new student at Padua High in Seattle. Michael (David Krumholtz) befriends the newcomer. Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) but her father Walter (Larry Miller) won't let her date until his daughters graduate. Then Walter changes the rule to allow Bianca to date when Kat does. Cameron intends to find somebody for Kat. Michael tricks Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) to pay mysterious bad boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to take out Kat. It's basically William Shakespeare's teen rom-com ""The Taming of the Shrew"". It has enough wit and fun. On top of it all, there's the good young pretty cast. Stiles is a terrific high-minded B and Ledger is a great bad boy with a heart. It's all good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, lively and enjoyable despite being a little predictable","On his first day at a new school, Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford. However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister, Kat, is negative, bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable. Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be paid to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca - but things never go smoothly when it comes to love.I'm not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame, trading on the same old plots and clichés that have been around since Animal House and Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving rise to some poor films like `She's all that'.  The plot for this is basically `The Taming of the Shrew' updated - most of it bares little resemblance to the play but that doesn't matter - the core is interesting enough to stand on it's own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and it's fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that's not it.No - the film is funny, lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are genuinely funny, such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress. The jokes happily never stoop to the gross-out type and this helps it feel fresh and lively, rather than just scrapping the bottom of the barrel.Another strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in `She's all that' this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and he does well here - he doesn't over-egg his bad boy cake and his fall into love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles she has had of late.  Here she rises above the `outsider' cliché given to her and does good work - again being a likeable and believable character.. Gordon-Levitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two roles, likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three adult support roles really do well and are very funny -  Janney, Mitchell and especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a side role that doesn't play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in bigger roles but here she is a `minority face' in a predominately white film, just as she was in She's All That - maybe I'm being a little paranoid but that's what it feels like.Overall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was. It didn't sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may be predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen comedies you COULD watch, this is fantastic!",,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty good overall,"Based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew,"" ""10 Things I Hate About You"" offers a refreshing revival of the ""good"" teen films, as compared to the ""typical"" teen films.It's based on Shakespeare's story somewhat loosely. It's about a teenaged girl whose father will not allow her to date. Finally he comes up with a clever idea - if she can convince her older sister (who is a strict, boring ""b***"") to date someone, the younger sibling can as well. Her father knows this is as realistic as saying ""When pigs begin to fly"" but then he can't be accused of being unfair.""10 Things..."" is overall pretty good. It's better than I thought it would be. It has some funny moments, it's got a talented cast with some older actors popping up in various humorous roles, etc. It's not as refreshing or unique as a John Hughes teen comedy but it certainly plays upon some of the clichÃ©s of the genre (invented by Hughes no less) to good effect.Overall, I was impressed with the movie, and the actors, and that's saying a lot considering it's a teen film (a genre I have come to loathe recently with entries such as ""Slackers"" etc.).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
They don't make movies like this anymore,"Love love LOVE this movie. It is a classic, story is great, the actors are amazing, and the comedy is funny! There is something to laugh at every minute, and all the elements marry together perfectly to make a feel good movie, with depth and humour that isn't seen very often these days.The cast are brilliant, Heath Ledger is awesome and brings an honesty to his character, Julia stiles is authentic and someone every girl can identify with. Has a lot of actors who made it big after the film - great cast.An old school movie, they don't make them like this anymore!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Average high school fare,"Based extremely lightly on Shakespeare, our story picks up when young high school kid Cameron falls for Bianca, who isn't allowed to date. Bianca and her sister Kats father decides that Bianca kay date, so long as her sister Kat does as well. What seems like a sure bet as Kat has no interest in boys. When part model and full time jerk Joey Donner and mysterious loner Patrick Verona get involved will she change her mind? This film wants to be so much, but the limited investment in any of the characters really hampers what could be a fun and effective comedy. That's not to say the cast isn't good with their limited material, but that's the problem - there just isn't much to munch on. It wants to be as bad as some 80s sex comedy but the big party just isn't that big, the kids just aren't that interesting, and the big prom feels like an afterthought. Recommended only if you're a big fan of the era, the stars, or high school comedies in general.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Makes me cry looking back,"This movie was one of those turning point movies for cinema as a whole, from the same batch as A Knight's Tale, Titanic, The Matrix, Donnie Darko, American Pie, and so on.So many brilliant actors in their youth here, in this petri dish of talent, it makes my heart wrench at how much the world, cinema, and life has changed since then, and those who are no longer around, such as Heath.This is one of the best romance movies imo, and reminds me of my youth when life felt so new, young and excitingThe casting, acting, direction, writing, everything really, is superb.Recommended for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I can't stop watching this movie!,"I wanted to see this movie when it first came out but never did. I didn't get a copy until a week ago and finally watched it with my girlfriend. I have to admit, I've seen it five times in the past week. A lot of teen movies have very basic or clichéd plots, but not this one. It's based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and it has a lot of interesting twists. The music is awesome, every song actually fits the moment, and the two love stories are actually interesting to watch. Even all the actors did a really great job. The only bad thing is the occasional dirty jokes. If you don't care for teen movies, don't worry, you are just like me, this movie is still worth watching. I'm giving it a 10 to bring those ratings up!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Happy 20 years!,"It seems very timely that HBO was playing this today- on it's 20th Anniversary. Of course, I had to watch it while I was getting ready for work. Since this is a rewatch (for the nth time), I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that I know most of the dialogues here- I can even recite Kat's (Julia Stiles) lines! Even the French scene between Cameron and Bianca. Crazy! This is a ""terribly underrated"" movie and I still love it 20 years after- I still fell for Heath and JGL, for the music, for all the clichés, the fun and all the 90s aesthetics.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was very good,"A movie like this doesn't exactly hit you over the head with its originality, and can only be as good as the actors. They must convince you that you've never seen anything like this before. In this case every single member of the cast is so good that they sold me on the movie from minute one.  Heath Ledger & Julia Stiles make a great couple and his rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" was one of the highlights. When Julia listed the ""10 Things"" she was crying and I was, too - extremely unusual for me in a movie like this. Everyone else was just as good and this movie is a keeper.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Made better by Heath!,"10 Things I Hate About You is a generally nice, fun and easy going film to watch. This is the first time I had ever seen Julia Styles in a role and I thought her acting went way beyond what is normally expected from a typical 'teenage' flick. She is so believable. Just saw her In Dexter and I cannot believe she still looks exactly the same all these years later.I remember watching this all those years ago and totally falling madly in love with Heath Ledger and realising how amazing he is in this film. OK it pains in significance with his future roles e.g. Brokeback/Dark Knight etc but all the same he does carry this movie. Joseph-Gordon Levitt also is very good.It's a nice film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. I enjoy it as much now in my late twenties as I did in my late teens.It's a must for Heath Ledge fans, especially the singing on the stairs scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, Cheesy Comedy","This movie is nothing short of predictable, cheesy and goofy. The transformation of Julia Stiles character is quick, unbelievable and cheesy. The filmmakers must think the viewers were idiots to buy the change in character's ""overnight"" transformation from ""men are scum"" to ""i want a man"" as it comes about. This movie should have been a made-for-TV small screen gem vs. a large screen goofy, cheesy and predictable comedy that is far from being a ""classic"".PLOT - Strict rules in the Stratford household forbid Bianca from having a boyfriend until her odious sister has one of her own. Mating mayhem ensues when Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger)--a sullen young man with a mysterious past--is bribed by Bianca's wannabe boyfriend (Andrew Keegan) to woo and win Kat, in order to clear the way for Bianca to begin dating.They say it's a twist on Shakespeare's play, however this is a far cry from it. It doesn't come remotely close to being in the same class as a Shakespearean play. The comparison is laughable and a downright lie.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly funny romantic comedy,"When I went to see 10 Things I Hate About You, I expected the usual boring, pointless romantic comedy, where the romance is unbelievable and the comedy part seriously lacking. Instead I got an excellent plot and funny jokes with actual chemistry between the leads. As it is a modern remake of Shakespeare's The Taming Of The Shrew, you might think you need to know all about the play, but in reality the plot of the film is different and only the occasional bit of name-dropping has any connection to the play. Julia Stiles as Kat is undoubtedly the best actress, with Larisa Oleynik as her sister Bianca (an airhead eerily similar to Clueless' Cher) is also funny and believable. Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are also good as their eventual boyfriends. The dialogue is hilarious and while the romantic plot is corny, it is entertaining (although the happily ever after ending is a bit too routine). The soundtrack and in particular the main title song (by Letters to Cleo) are catchy and the outakes at the end are good, although including outakes of scene that were taken out of the end movie is kind of confusing. I would recommend 10 Things I Hate About You to absolutely anyone as it is hilarious and without doubt the best romantic comedy I have ever seen.RATING: 4/5",,Anonymous,Romance
This was a story by Shakespeare?,"It's kinda weird that people say this story was based off of a Shakespeare story, yet no one ever mentions what this was based on. But 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the classic teen movies that came out of the 90's that was actually pretty good. It had a great cast, the story was original and a lot of fun, and the whole movie made you laugh and feel good. This was the movie that really sky rocketed Heath Ledger's career in America and I remember in school how all the girls were just drooling over him. Also all the guys fell in love with Julia Styles, she was also just awesome in this movie and made for a good strong female lead. This movie captured a great amount of what most teens go through in their world, wither it's just wanting to be different, popular, having an over protective parent, dealing with sex and rejection, this movie just worked on so many levels.Cameron James, the new kid at Padua High School, is given a tour of the school by Michael, who is an audio-visual geek. Michael provides Cameron with information on the school's various cliques. During the tour, Cameron spots the beautiful and popular Bianca and is immediately smitten with her. Michael warns that Bianca is shallow, conceited, and worst of all, not allowed to date. Michael does, however, inform Cameron that Bianca is looking for a French tutor. Bianca's outcast sister Kat is another problem of hers' as well as her protective father, Walter, as he wants Kat to attend college nearby and wants Bianca to not date thinking it will lead to pre-marital pregnancy. Bianca begs her father to allow her to date, but is rejected, Kat's aversion to dating prompts the father to come up with a new rule: Bianca can only date if Kat is dating. Cameron starts tutoring Bianca, and she informs him of her father's rule. This news motivates Cameron and Michael to set out to find a boy who is willing to date Kat. Patrick Verona, an outcast who is just as ill-tempered as Kat. Cameron tries asking Patrick for his assistance, Cameron pays Patrick to take Kat out. Patrick agrees, but Kat, however, wants nothing to do with Patrick. Leading into Dawson's Creek drama.If you do have the opportunity to see 10 Things I Hate About You I do recommend that you take the chance. It's a good movie and doesn't push you around or play games with you, and that's why everyone loved it, because it was just honest. Plus you just have to love the adorable scene where Heath Ledger sang to Julia Styles on the bleachers and got chased around by security, if that's not love and commitment, then I don't know what is. It has a great happy ending and just makes you feel good.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet *teenage love, lies, & consequences* flick!","I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Granted I'm just 15 years old, and also a huge fan of Shakespeare, but it was really a great film. I would have to say it's definitely more directed towards the teenage/GenX generations, but it was awesome.  The tongue-and-cheek Shakespeare references were great (the ""Stratford"" girls, etc.) Julia Stiles & Larisa Oleynik were convincing in their roles, and not to be shallow but the guys of the movie just all looked really good. =) I recommend this to most teenage girls, although it's not totally a ""chick flick"" because my brother enjoyed it too.  In any case, the scene with the ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" ballad at the soccer practice is a can't-miss for all you love saps. =) I will tell you right now, the ending IS predictable, but not hackneyed. It leaves you with a happy bubbly feeling about teenage love.  Excellent movie, that is.  (P.S. When watching this in the theaters-- DON'T leave as soon as the credits roll.  There are some hilarious out-takes afterwards.)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A masterpiece that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling! 10 out of 10 for 10 Things,"All the praise in the world goes to every individual involved in the production of 10 Things I Hate About You,a film that rarely leaves my DVD player.I'm not a fan of Shakespeare's traditional plays,but the modern day screen adaptions are brilliant,and 10 Things I Hate About You is no exception.The highschool stereotypes of the cool kids nobody messes with,the wannabe's that try too hard to be something they're not,the geeks everyone picks on and the rebels everyone is afraid of,mean there's a character in this film everyone can relate to.The stand out performances are Heath Ledger as Patrick,the rebellious,feared and elusive bad guy who wins the heart of Kat Stratford played to perfection by fine actress Julia Stiles who has no interest in the opposite sex and is perceived to come from the planet 'Loser' while her more sociable,boy crazy sister Bianca (Larissa Oleynik)hails from planet 'Look at Me,Look at Me'.Her good looks catch the eye of the smooth,suave and egotistical Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) who is a male model,and fights for the affections of the prettiest Stratford sister with Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the highschool geek,with a big heart and a big crush on Bianca.The hilarious Larry Miller stars as Walter Stratford-the kind of father who puts his girls on a short leash and desperately tries to shield them from the horrors of sex,drugs and rock and roll,and of course,boys.A typical teenage comedy,but its witty dialogue,goofy,sexy,cool and bad ass characters,and enjoyable storyline set it apart from all the rest.There's plenty of memorable moments,romance,and clever and classic lines,all leading up to a predictable but perfectly good ending that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling about teenage love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Looking back,"Looking back, this movie had a pretty (no pun intended) decent cast. The now deceased Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles as front runners of course. It is a pretty good romantic teen comedy, that is pretty nice. And that's saying something, if you consider the fact, that it came out the same year, American Pie was.While the latter was a pretty gross comedy, that still had heart to it, this is more the classical approach to a teen comedy. Something that hasn't been done that much after ""10 things..."" came out. Which obviously lies within the fact, that it's pretty easy to slide down the cliché road and wind up boring people more than entertaining them. But which also states the fact, that this is pretty decent and a nice addition to the teen rom-coms!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best high school movies of the 90s,"This was the Kickstarter to three big actors careers. Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Some of the comedy is well utilised and the jokes can come in so bizarrely that you can't help but laugh. I mean, I love how random this film is. Parts of the film feel so different and bizarre and it actually works. And also the multiple amount of main characters. I mean, at first u think it's gonna be Joseph Gordon Levitt because he is the new kid at school, but then it changes to Bianca and Cat and it starts to become a story about two sisters but then it sort of changes to a love story about Heath Ledger and Cat. However, it doesn't feel bad either. But if I were to say anything negative about it then I would say that Cameron's backstory was kinda glanced over and he isn't really given much character development. Also, there's really strange scene. This is where they are trying to ask a bunch of strangers whether they would date Cat. Now they could have just had them all laughing which they do, but then proceed to ask them one by one. It just feels a bit too strange and the editing isn't great either. Anyway, my favourite character is probably the English teacher. He's just the embodiment of what you wanted, but also didn't want your teachers to be like. But obviously the best scene in the entire film is the 'Can't take my eyes off you"" performance done by Heath Ledger. The acting is gray with Julia Stiles giving a strong performance and Heath Ledger killing it in his role. R.I.P Heath Ledger! Another great scene is the one where Cameron's friend nearly cycles all the way down to the sports stadium. It was so bizarre and out of left field but great at the same time. Anyway, while this film isn't perfect it's different to your average high school romcom and makes you feel just whelmed. Definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

10 Things I Hate About You is unlike most teenage romcoms.,"Finally decided to watch 10 Things I Hate About You after seeing shorts here and there on social media. I'm usually not a huge fan of romcoms but a friend of mine told me I would probably like this one.Well, I can tell you this one's on my comfort film-list! As an adult I actually really liked this slightly more teenage oriented film. I think that's mainly because the main component was comedy and the drama was brought in a more light way while still having just enough to feel compassion for the characters. It covers relatable topics during high school and is fun, heartbreaking and heartwarming to watch all the way through. Usually with (teenage) romcoms the drama is overdone, storylines are way too farfetched or characters are too exaggerated and although we are seeing stereotypes and are dealing with the standard teenage experiences, the filmmakers did a great job at finding the perfect sweet spot.Based on the stereotypes of the characters the casting was spot on too. And it was so cute to see young Joseph Gordon-Levitt! While most people seem to know Heath Ledger from this film, I only knew him as the iconic Joker up until now. I was curious to see how he would be in a more ""normal"" role and wow, I knew he was weirdly charismatic as the Joker but as Patrick he seems to carry another, pleasant type of charisma. It remains painful to know we have lost such an immense talent.There's a small part of me that wishes I had seen 10 Things I Hate About You during high school. I can see how it's such a huge hit for especially that age group. But as they say, better late than never! I understand from other reviews that the storyline is also parallel with some of Shakespeare's work. I'm not that familiar with it but it sure is a cool thing to know.Since teenage romcoms are more predictable and almost similar in general, I wouldn't go higher than a 7 within this genre. So, based on my standards for review 10 Things I Hate About You gets a solid 7! For its genre, it's the best and most fun I've seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Stereotypical Teen Movie; Nothing Fresh Or Original About It,"I'm not going to argue with teenagers. This is a stereotypical teen movie filled with every cliché that the genre uses. And of course there are a lot of teen movies filled with those same clichés simply because they work for their target audience. This one clearly works with the target audience. It has a good rating. So be it. But my warning: if you're not a teen, please avoid this.I didn't find it funny or fresh or original. It's the same basic plot that gets respun over and over: kids (some cool and some not) desperately trying to fit in, and somehow in the midst of it all finding love in the most unexpected places. It didn't do anything for me - but then again, I'm not a teen. In fact, I wasn't really a teen even when I was a teen! So I'm definitely not the target audience. And maybe that's the reason that I spent a good part of this movie wondering about the title. What 10 things? I didn't really make the connection between the title of the movie and the content of the movie. It's like someone just made up a title out of thin air because it sounded cute or funny or something. But what did it have to do with the actual movie?It's not a bad cast, but you really have to be into this kind of movie to enjoy it. I'm not, and I didn't. It has two or three mildly humorous and/or heartwarming moments. The father/daughter talk near the end of the movie as Mr. Stratford finally lets go of Kat was basically THE heartwarming moment of the movie, and it actually worked quite well, and so left me with a bit of a more generous reaction than I might otherwise have had. Still, though, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this in any way, shape or form. (2/10)",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
obstacles to true love knows no time era,"One thing about the Bard -- he knew the plots that touches everyone's lives, no matter where on the social strata or when in history they may be. It is made apparent in the case of Cameron James, new kid in school, as he falls for the lovely Bianca, who cannot date until her older shrewish sister Kat will date. But Kat doesn't WANT to date, and thus Cameron must scheme to find a suitable guy for this harpy-with-the-heart-of-gold if he is to win the fair Bianca.Julia Stiles may be no Elizabeth Taylor, but then, she doesn't have to be. This flick relays the same message to a brand-new audience and is fun and entertaining to boot (plus I don't think Taylor could dance on a table quite like Stiles does in one of the more memorable scenes.)In the end, this is a charming movie that will entertain and educate high-schoolers as well as those several years past graduating. After all, Shakespeare knew what he was writing about -- there is no age limit when it comes to matters of the heart!",,Anonymous,Romance
10 Things I Hate About you follows teens that are trying to fall in love.,"Is it possible for a movie to hire actors that are too good for their roles? If so, then 10 Things I Hate About You did this. Gil Junger directs this 1999 Touchstone teen romance that follows the love adventures of 4 teens. The plot line is nothing too different from every other teen romance movie and is quite predictable. The actors, however, were charming, engaging, and lovable. Their wonderful portrayals brought the seemingly worn out plot line to life and left the audience feeling happy and filled with warm fuzzies. The dialogue and one-liners added humor and made the movie enjoyable for everyone watching. The story follows the classic chick flick plot line and doesn't stray too much. While it is quite predictable, viewers still find themselves drawn in and excited when things work out. The standout actors in this film are Joseph Gordon Levitt, Heath Ledger, and Julia Styles. Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays the adorable Cameron, the new kid who falls for the popular, beautiful Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). He is cute, sweet, pure hearted and very easy to love. Ledger and Styles, on the other hand, play the ""scary"" and misunderstood teens. Styles gracefully embodies her ""heinous bitch"" character but is immediately liked by the audience because of her sass and wit. The same goes for Ledgers character, Patrick. This fierce Australian boy is surrounded by mystery and rumors, which causes the students at Padua high to be very afraid of him. He plays the bad boy role well but in a way that leaves room for later in the movie when his character is seen as a respectful, kind guy. Andrew Keegan, who plays Joey, and Larisa Oleynik playing Bianca have much easier characters but also portray them well. Joey simply has to be the handsome, popular jerk and Bianca is the ditsy cute girl who eventually gives up her selfish ways. Its no surprise that this film racked up seven nominations for awards based on actors performances (IMDb). The actors were excellent, and it was obvious to everyone who saw the movie. Having such good actors, however, may have hurt the film. Viewers are forced to see the actors change their minds with almost no prompting. The plot does not address why Bianca suddenly changes her mind about Cameron, or why Patrick eventually falls for Kat. All that the viewer sees is that these teens now magically have feelings for people that they were originally using for their own selfish gain. As Robert Ebert said in his review ""Sometimes it's a mistake to have acting this charming; the characters become so engaging and spontaneous, we notice how they're trapped in the plot"" (Ebert). If you ignore the over used plot structure, however, you see a great movie. The story has a lot of heart and some great one-liners. The dialogue in the movie is fantastic with the sexual innuendo and sassy retorts. For example; in English class when Kat and Joey were arguing Joey asked the teacher ""Mr. Morgan, is there any chance we could get Kat to take her Midol *before* she comes to class?"" to which Mr. Morgan fired back ""Someday, you gonna get bitch-slapped and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it."" What makes this line even better is that it is foreshadowing because at the end of the movie Joey does get bitch-slapped and not a single person helps him after. Even the sisters' outrageous father is hilarious when he is telling them what not to do when they go to a party; ""No drinking, no drugs, no kissing, no tattoos, no ritual animal slaughtering's of any kind. Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas"" (10 Things 1999). While some of the lines are a bit wacky, they give the movie character and help it stand out from the thousands of other films in the genre. It is these moments that really make the viewers fall in love with the characters and become invested in the story. When a movie is quotable, people talk about it more, mention the quotes whenever possible and thus they want to watch the movie again to hear the funny lines. Overall, the movie, while being very predictable, has a lot of heart. The witty dialogue and the fantastic performances make 10 Things I Hate About You a memorable and enjoyable movie. I would give the movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Anyone can find something they like about this movie. Guys, if your girl is going to force you to watch a chick flick this one might not be quite as dreadful as some of the worn out, sappy ones out there. 10 Things I Hate About You has romance, but also comedy and a positive vibe.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is This Maybe The Best Teen Rom-Com Ever?,"(Right off the bat, I'm reviewing this film as a stand-alone movie without any connection to Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"", which supposedly the film is based on. I've never read that particular play, but looking through the plot synopsis it bares only a passing resemblance to this flick...at least in my opinion. As such, I'll be reviewing based solely on the viewing experience.)Though perhaps not my favorite genre of film, I can usually get into a teen romantic comedy/drama as long as it is done right. Despite being pretty much prime age (15) for this one when it first come out (1999), for some reason I had not (until now) seen the whole thing straight through. What I discovered after finally crossing it off my watch list is that ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is one of the most engaging, witty, emotional, and all-around best teen movies I have ever seen.The plot of the movie can be a bit cumbersome to explain, but here are the basics: Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the prettiest, most desired girl in high school. This certainly does not escape the eyes of new kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who desperately wants to take her out. The problem? Due to a very strict father (Larry Miller), Bianca is not allowed to date until sister Katarina (Julia Stiles) does, and Kat has no interest in high school culture (thus dating) whatsoever. As such, Cameron--with the help of pretty boy Joey (Andrew Keegan)--enlists the help of school bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger) to woo Kat so he can have a shot at Bianca.""10 Things"" has a special energy to it that never wanes from beginning to end. It also expertly combines the stereotypical language/activities one is used to seeing in a teen movie (at least one from the late 90s!) while at the same time turning them on their head (usually via Kat's snarky remarks). Basically, it is the perfect combination of ""fun"" and ""deep"" (in that special way that only high school can be ""deep"").Only helping matters, of course, is the incredible cast. I mean, just look at the above names! At the time most of these actors were relative unknowns, so that fact that most of them are established or legendary in the business today is quite an accomplishment.About the only ""ding"" I give this movie is one area where it is a bit transparent: In the early goings, the film expects audiences to believe that: A. Stiles' character could never get a date; & B. Ledger's character is a true ""bad boy"". Neither of these things really work because Stiles is probably the most beautiful woman in the movie and Ledger is too handsome to really pull of ""mysterious"". Fortunately, the film doesn't require a total buy-in on this point (almost as if the filmmakers realized it themselves and didn't hit those characterizations so hard as the film went on), but for a while it is a bit ridiculous.Overall, though, I was incredibly impressed by ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and actually kind of mad at myself for missing out on its greatness for so long! I have a relatively high ""BS meter"" when it comes to movies like this, but ""10 Things"" captured my interest from the get-go and never saw me wane. Perhaps this sounds a bit clichéd, but what ""The Breakfast Club"" is for 80s teens is similar to what ""10 Things"" accomplishes for the subsequent decade. That isn't a statement I make lightly, either.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very 90s teen comedy that's fairly enjoyable,"Being a teen in the 90s too, I regret not watching that when it came out as I probably would have been to relate to and enjoy it even more.

"The best teen flick, like, ever","You know how teen flicks are usually shallow, stereotypical, poorly written tripe? And you know how most romantic comedies are shallow, stereotypical, chick flicks?Well, this film will forever put those films to shame. Brilliantly written, funny and warm this film deserves a spot on everyone's Watched list. And anybody with a teenager should buy a hard copy, because they will love it.I feel that I am fairly well qualified to write a review of this film, as I have been conducting an unofficial study of teenage behaviour for the last 25 years as a high school teacher, and I have been showing this film to my classes every year since about 2000. All up, I have probably watched this film about 5 times a year for the last 15 years. And I still enjoy it!The writers are to be commended for this film - rarely do you see a film that can blend comedy with true human experience. This is a film where every scene and every shot has been carefully crafted - and the meaning is not lost on a younger audience.I could write about the storyline here, or give you a few of the many really funny one liners or tell you about the brilliant casting (the actors really are perfect). But instead I will just leave you with this - nearly 2 decades on and this film is STILL enthralling teenage audiences. For that alone it deserves a spot in the list of greatest teen flicks of all time. Students, today, have stills of this film on their smart phones and they tell me it's their favourite film, like, ever. Do you know how nearly impossible that is? To create a teenage flick that both guys and girls will love? Or a film with a PG rating but young adult humour? Or to make a film about teenage angst where every viewer walks away identifying with the characters and feeling empowered? Lets not hold back here, a film that can win over audience after audience, for nearly two decades deserves 10 stars - even if it is just a light hearted, teen comedy. I'm bringing out my green pen and giving this a great big tick and smiley face, well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
10 Things I Hate About This Movie,"I have a long running dislike for this film.  It's supposed to be Shakespeare, but it ends up being badly made, ""girls are supposed to be this way"" teenage drama. The entire thing is one pretentious cliche. While I appreciate films like Hobgoblins (1987) for their campiness, this film really seems to try and say something.  I mean, that's why I hate it so much.  I can think up 10 things that I hate about this movie.1.  Julia Stiles - supposed to come off as some feminist boy-hater, comes off as just whiny.  That's it.  Her acting isn't very good.  I'm sorry. 2.  The Shakespeare scene in the High School.  It was like a cinematic version of ""Saved by the Bell"". 3.  The parents' rule - who would, in their right mind, prevent one of their girls from dating because the other one won't date anybody?  What?  What if ""Kat"" was a lesbian? Then her sister would never date anyone. 4.  The examples for teenage girls.  You're not anybody unless you date anybody. 5.  The whole macho bribe thing.  I'll bribe you to date her.  How offensive to women. 6.  The headache that it gave me. 7.  The way that it depicts youth as an MTV culture.  Young life for some people is alienated and depressing.  Not a 24/7 party. 8.  The fact that only beautiful people exist in this movie's world.  If this movie had the characters from ""Gummo"" in it, I would have appreciated it more. 9.  The dull cinematography. 10.  The way that it vomits on Shakespeare's grave in a late 90's drunken stupor.All in all, this film should be reviewed by some future ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" show.... they could have a field day with it.  1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best teen movies of all time...,"I can't say enough good things about this movie.  I do remember the first time I saw it, coming away thinking that I wanted to be just like Julia Stiles' character in it, though.  She was so cool and did such an excellent job in her role, that still to this day I consider her to be the coolest teen in any 'teen movie'.Basic Plot: Cameron (Levitt), a new student at Pagua high school, falls in love with a sophomore named Bianca Stradford (Oleynik).However, Bianca has a flirtatious crush on the most popular senior at school named, Joey (Keegan).  Cameron's sidekick Michael (Krumholtz)tells him, that Bianca is looking for someone to help her with French and Cameron decides that's how he'll ask her out on a date.Kat Stradford (Stiles) is Bianca's sister.  Totally opposite of Bianca, she is anti-social and is the most feminist high school senior you could ever meet.  Against boys, dances, and anything having to do with prepiness and silly fun, she swears off dating and finds herself being accepted to Sarah Lawrence a college across the country in hopes to get away from her father and the city she lives in.Bianca desperately wanting to date, is told by her father (Miller) that she will be allowed to date when her sister Kat does.  Desperate and not knowing how to get her sister to 'date for her', ends up asking Cameron, her new French tutor, to help her with her predicament. Enter Patrick (Ledger).  An outcast and rumored to have sold his kidneys on the black market for a new set of speakers, also attends Padgua high, and is unsuspecting of what will happen soon in his future.Cameron and Micheal decide that in order to make this work, they need a backer.  ""Someone who's stupid, but has money.""  So they go to Joey, telling him that they know he likes Bianca, and they need him to pay Patrick a tidy sum, to have him date Kat, in order for him to date Bianca.  What Joey doesn't know, is that Cameron secretly plans to date Bianca, while he pays Patrick to take out Kat.It may sound like a very confusing movie.  But it is so funny, cleverly written, and not entirely true of American teenage culture, but pretty close.  The acting is wonderful and in my opinion nothing in the movie would have worked as well, without the people who played their characters.  As I said before I think that Stiles' portration of Kat Stradford was right on, and no one could have done it better. Her best role, more than certainly, and I love this movie so much!  I would have to say it's my favorite teen comedy next to The Breakfast Club.  One the best movies, and a great watch!I give it a 10 out of 10.  Go rent it, or better yet go buy it!  You won't regret it!",,Anonymous,Romance
Miss you Heath,"This was easy enough to watch. Heath Ledger tends to make anything watchable or memorable. Miss him a lot!The young cast were all very talented. It has a kind of comforting 90s vibe, which is what I was looking forward to.

Late 90s teen classic.,"The late 1990s saw a resurgence in high school comedies, in the vein of those from the mid 1980s. Some of them were generic and forgettable, 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the highlights of this period.Everyone is cast perfectly, in particular Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles who have amazing chemistry as the two ""outcasts"". Ledger as Patrick brings total charm to his role, especially when he serenades Kat on the school football field. The supporting cast all perform brilliantly. Larisa Oleynik and Joseph Gordon Levitt as Bianca and Cameron are very cute. Alison Janney as the school counsellor isn't in many scenes but she's hilarious.There isn't a single bad scene in this film and the script fizzes with great and often hilarious dialogue.I'm nearly 44 now, which puts me at around 20 when this was in the cinema and I still love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"You can't fault this one, it just aint typical.","When hiring this movie was first suggested I turned up my nose at it. I thought, another teenagers flick where the hottest guy in school has to appreciate a lesser unpopular chick etc etc etc. Since seeing it it has enterred my all time favourites list. Any old somebody can take the formula of The Taming of the Shrue and put it into a school yard, and any old somebody can avoid cle she's in the finer details, coming up with decent alternatives is the hard part, whatever they did here works like clockwork. I would easily give it the best teen flick mantle.Firstly, the acting is perfect, the roles are not overly demanding but Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play this to perfection. The supporting cast is great aswell, there is not a soul that doesn't contribute to the perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for nor what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is phenominal, words like, Vapid, Pensive, Hanus, Tempestuous, Miscreants. There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.For once they avoided the school bully theme, the bad guy in this is just a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time given alot more credibility, he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one liners and finds a soul mate for himself, instead of them just making it a joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in, you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull moment.The best quote of the whole movie would have to be ""it's just an excuse for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven lives"" that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For once you actually identify with the ""bitch"" role in this, both she and the guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step, usually when it comes time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant believe him after they have focused for so long on his efforts, this time for some reason you do, it fits straight into the story. There is another half to that situation here aswell but I wont disclose, it is probably the best bit of the movie.And the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell of alot stronger than before, if that had been weak so would the rest of the movie have been, but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the characters all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual story.To sum it all up the characters, story and acting are all perfect, adults can enjoy this one aswell, also because the main relationships are more stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships, if they can be called such. So here is the count.Production Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5/2, Screenplay 2/2, Originality 1/2Anyone can get something from this movie and most can get alot. This is a must. For the movie it is I would give it 10 but going by the main qualities listed above which all movies can be measured by it would get8.5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
"The best teen romantic comedy in recent years, being able to create characters and scenes so striking and irreverent to the point of being so remembered by the public","A classic of the nineties youth romantic comedies, 10 Things I Hate About You shows impossible love stories, placing them in the micro-universe of the American high school. The synopsis is based on the book ""The Tamed Shrew"" by William Shakespeare, and tells the story of Kat and Bianca Strattford (Larisa Oleynik), two sisters who are completely opposite in personality. While Bianca aims to be popular and find a boyfriend, Kat is tough, outspoken, feminist and doesn't care what her schoolmates think of her. The girls' father is strict and creates a rule to prevent them from going out: knowing that Kat shows no interest in boys, he stipulates that Bianca can only date when her sister does too. That's the hook for the events to unfold, when Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the new boy in town who falls in love with Bianca, and his friend Michael (David Krumholtz), devise a plan and decide to persuade Joe (Andrew Keegan), a male model who is also in love with Bianca, to pay someone to date his older sister. However, the only one willing to face the tough Kat is Patrick (Heath Ledger), a bad boy with several mysteries about him.More than a true adaptation of Shakespeare's work, 10 Things I Hate About You works more like a tribute to the English playwright. In addition to the similarities in the story, the director and screenwriters left their clues, especially in choosing the names of the main characters. If for the sisters the names were left exactly the same - Bianca and Kat, nickname for Katharina, or Katherine in English - all the others were changed, but keeping a link with the work or the very life of Shakespeare. Petrusco from the play was given the name Patrick Verona, a good transition from the Italian name to the English one, the surname being a clear reference to the character's hometown in the play. The girls' father, who in the play is Baptist, was given the name Walter Stratford - an allusion to Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon. There are at least two more explicit references to Shakespeare: the name of the school where the young people in the film study is called Padua - the city where the original play takes place - and Kat's friend Mandella is passionate about the English master's theater.The film results in a romantic comedy well within Hollywood standards, despite references to Shakespeare and his work The Tamed Shrew. A lot had to be adapted to today. Today's girls just want to date; they don't think about marriage. Kat is not necessarily a bitch like in the play, but only with feminist ideals, which do not include submitting to the whims of men, being a woman who wants to stand out for her intelligence more than physical attributes. It's nice and unusual for an unpretentious romantic comedy to pay homage to a classic writer that many students read out of obligation at school.It is very skillfully that the plot addresses various relationships, especially the love triangle involving Bianca, Cameron and Joey and Kat and Patrick, but in addition, several of these characters have interpersonal relationships that despite being related to the story have their own nuances. For this to work, the film has well-defined scenes (as in the theater) in which the audience can understand what is happening in each relationship without one interfering with the other, of course Kat and Patrick are more interesting, but the couple's charisma and its very essence was written in the 16th century to have greater public appeal.That's why ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is capable of having so many memorable scenes, for me nothing beats Heath Ledger singing ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" to Kat during soccer practice, but the party scene at the rich boys' house and the scene in which Julia Stiles gives a spectacular performance and reads her sonnet (inspired by a sonnet by Shakespeare) and finally declares her love for Patrick are striking scenes and much remembered by the public. This film, of course, has a script advantage which is Shakespeare's dialogue, most famously the first time Cameron sees Bianca and recites ""I burn, I weaken, I perish"" using cultured English to reference the original work, of course. While this goes for the sonnet at the end and for the little nods that the script makes to the playwright himself, the dialogue between sidekicks Michael and Mandella using the text of ""Macbeth"" comes in very well, especially when thinking about the content of what is said.The ambiance contributes a lot to the construction of a 1990s moment, the soundtrack filled with artists such as The Cardigans, Letters From Cleo and even ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" had recently found success again in the voice of Ms Lauryn Hill. Escola Pádua has a building that resembles a castle, referring to the scenario of the play, but the costumes recall the fashion of the 1990s, platform sandals and baby look blouses put us in their own time in a story told 400 years earlier. As a good adaptation of ""10 Things I Hate About You"", brings several of the themes of ""A Tamed Shrew"" with a different look, an interesting nod is that in the play, the action often happens through references to the theater, the film relates to this because the two key moments are the scene where Patrick sings to Kat and the scene where she recites a poem in front of the class to him. But the main theme is transformation: by the end of the movie Bianca and Kat are more like each other, after Kat opens up emotionally and Bianca reacts to what she didn't like. Another important influence is the theme of the relationship between the characters, be it the arc of the father with the daughters, which in the end is resolved, or the love relationship, which we never see but we have hints, the film not only depends on but also explores the possibilities of relationships between people.Light and fun as befits an unassuming romantic comedy, including the inevitable happy ending, the recipe paid off and the film was an unexpected success, particularly in the US, thanks in no small part to a love interest that has their chemistry. At least one scene stands out and has become classic: when Patrick confesses to Kat on the school football field, singing Can't Take My Eyes Off You. With proper proportions, it is almost the equivalent of a monologue in a classic theatrical play. ""10 Things I Hate About You"" may seem too shallow or escapist in the extreme, but it translates Shakespeare in a way that few professional theater companies can. Shakespeare wrote about young people and built a comedy about love and opposites. By transforming the 16th-century classic into a 1999 modern adventure, director Gil Junger reaches the audience Shakespeare was meant to reach: young audiences.More than being remembered for its quality as a film or its free adaptation of a famous and classic Shakespearean play, 10 Things I Hate About You has entered the memory of moviegoers for having brought together in the same film three young talents who would soon stand out: Julia Stiles (The Bourne Identity, Mona Lisa Smile), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception, Looper) and Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain, The Dark Knight).Can we say that ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is the best teen romantic comedy ever? It's hard to say, but he shows that you can do teen romance with technical quality. So, is it the best teen romantic comedy in recent years, being able to create characters and scenes so striking and irreverent to the point of being so remembered by the public. There's so much heart in ""10 Things I Hate About You"" that it's a hard movie to hate.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Serviceable modernization of Shakespeare,"This movie is worth a watch for the performances of several then up-and-comers. It does smack a bit of the late 90s - early 2000s kitsch, but I think modern teens would still enjoy it. This is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, and the writers gave homage to the Bard with the inclusion of not only lines from the source material, but also a nod to the poetic form for which he is still noted. Heath Ledger gives a great performance (this makes me sad for the work we have missed due to his untimely passing), Joseph Gordon Levitt turns in a charming performance as Cameron, and Larry Miller puts his character acting skills to good use as Kate and Bianca's father. Andrew Keegan embodies the entitled rich boy with sites set on Larissa Oleynik's Bianca (a role that I suspect was attempting to break away from her Alex Mack days and progress into more mature roles). Gabrielle Union does well, if not a bit under utilized as Bianca's friend, and David Krumholtz serves well in a support role in the transition between The Santa Clause and Numbers. The soundtrack is a sampling of the pop music of the time, which works with the film's setting. Overall a bit of fun and a way to help make Shakespeare more accessible to modern audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very watchable, not particularly memorable","This movie is very competently made, it's difficult to find many areas where it doesn't hit the mail on the head. The characters are likable and charismatic, they mostly avoid stereotypes and don't feel one-dimensional. The story is compelling and easy to invest into, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome. It's very easy to get through this movie, the pacing feels natural.One thing this movie doesn't quite get right is the comedy. There are a couple chuckles but ultimately the comedy pales in comparison to some of the other iconic teen rom-coms of that era.This movie also suffers from that classic unrealistic distorted version of high school that only exists in movies and TV. Is it realistic that an English teacher belittles his students on a regular basis, the principal authors an erotic novel during school hours, and a student flashes a teacher without being reprimanded? No, but it's those little intricacies that give these types of movies charm and personality.This movie is not some masterpiece, but it's extremely watchable and makes for a nice little comfort movie.

Because it is a replica (a good one at that) of Bill Shakespeare's Taming the Shrew.  So much in fact the names match (the two daughters are Bianca and Katerina like the play), and the story reads like the play, so I don't need to go into the plot.  Just know it is witty, and actually funny at times (Larry Miller is dead-pan funny as the worried dad).  A",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
My insurance does not cover PMS!,"This is supposedly based upon some play by Shakespeare. Who cares? he is so last millennium. This is a fantastic and funny movie that was brilliantly written by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith.

This performance here makes me want to see everything she has done. She was just fantastic and I am totally in love with her! Heath ledger was also perfect in this film.

Excellent,"Great movie for the teenage girls in us. This is my most favourite film ever! It appeals to the romantic in me as well as the (i hope) strongly minded woman in me. I love the character of Kat i think she's amazing and Heath Ledger is just so amazingly hot!! Some may see this movie as cheesy but i've seen worse cheese in a movie, you seen the wedding singer? that one is covered in brie!! I recommend it, i love it and atm i can't stop watching it!!Honestly, during Kat's poem at the end I did get tearful and I love the scene where they go paintballing, that scene makes my stomach tingle every time i watch it! I really don't want to put any spoilers in here so I hope what i've written so i hope what i have written has aided in your decision whether or not to watch it. At least give it a little watch, it's only 93 minutes long! My only criticism is that it should be longer because i loved it so much!!WATCH IT!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Film is dying...,"...for a refreshing movie like 10 things I hate about you. Let's be honest, maybe back in the day when this movie first came out people thought it was only so-so... but having just watched it again after all these years, well I bloody well loved it. There was just something about the 90s. There was less technology to hide behind, feelings were more true, movies were more original and actually funny. And who would of thought the underdogs like Joseph Gordon-Levitt would of turned out as handsome as he has today? What I'm basically trying to say is give this film another chance because it definitely deserves more than 6.9/10 rating! It has everything: real visions of high school, crazy cliques, teenage angst, HEATH LEDGER IN GLITTERY TIGHT PANTS, real chemistry & etc. It was just a really cute, cute movie I don't know how else to put it. Instead of just everyone sleeping with each other throughout (ahem, seems to be a popular storyboard these days) 10 things had the works: Pretty boys aiming for the fresh meat, caring but somewhat psychotic parents (can relate), misconstrued images of one another, I mean the last one in particular DEFINED high school for me. No one was who you thought they were, in fact they were better.So in conclusion, I demand thee to give this another go, it doesn't take much effort (I watched it on Youtube :) and please, this message goes out to all IMDb members and movie watchers alike: stop being so darn critical! Especially about the 90s, leave them alone. They will forever remain pure nostalgia for me and I'm sure many others.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: (DVD) 10 Things I Hate About You,"10 Things I Hate About You is one of your typical teenage romantic comedy, loosely based on William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Taking place over a semester with the introduction of new kid on the block Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and culminating in the school prom, the movie has a surprising number of sight gags and plenty of pop music throughout, so much so that it really does have a bloated soundtrack which seem to give a whole extended music video feel to it all.As with plenty of the Bard's stories, there's quite an ensemble cast assembled, starting with the Shrew herself Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), two sisters who are living under their father's strict house rules of no dating until graduation. Despite Dad's ultra protective nature in having his daughters live out his worst fear of being impregnated, the rules do get modified - Bianca can date if Kat dates, and that in itself is a tall order given Kat's nasty I-don't-give-a-damn attitude.And the suitors in competition are none other than Cameron, who's after Bianca, and his rival the school heartthrob Joey (Andrew Keegan). As with Shakespeare's stories, expect a little strategizing and some mistaken intentions at certain points, with Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger with that trademarked frizzy hair) being roped by the two men to woo Kat, thereby freeing them to go after the girl of their dreams.Without gazing into the crystal ball, you'll know that Patrick will probably fall for Kat for real, and thereby complicating matters, affecting even his own chances. For the most parts I thought where in the movie will the title be referenced, because it doesn't seem to be the case, but when it finally is included into the plot, it's actually quite an emotional, moving piece.The introduction perhaps inspired Pretty Persuasion, with the orientation of the rookie in the school premises, pointing out the various cliques and school politics. The supporting casts, especially the school teachers, were fun and totally opposite what you might consider proper conduct. And I thought it was pretty fluffy material until the romance between Patrick and Kat touched upon impressions, and the building of walls as a defense mechanism to fragile hearts. I thought that was a pretty frank outlook, with the characters mentioning it as a matter of fact.Still, don't expect the masterpiece although it's based on a classical play. The editing and narrative flow do seem to be choppy at times, with transitions proved to be quite abrupt, allowing me to suspect that some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor for some reason, except to smoothen the flow. It's quite jarring and sticks out like a sore thumb, but nonetheless it's still a fairly enjoyable movie for a lazy weekend afternoon.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Grow up, it wasn't that good","The first thing is, I am sick of people telling me how good this movie was. It's not a good movie.  The only decent part is the plot, and since all they did was adjust a good Shakespeare play, (who, I'm sure, was not the first to use the plot, but has arguably one of the better adaptations) of course it was good.  The acting was horrible, it wasn't anything like real life or high school (definitely not the same thing), and it plays to every short-attention-spanned flaky teenager who likes ""cute"" things and an easy emotional high.  If you actually watch the movie as a movie, it sucks. Spend your time actually reading Shakespeare, or watching a better movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A New Shakespearian?,"I checked out this video because I just saw Hamlet and was completely captivated by Julia Stiles. Then I learned that she has already done three Shakespeare adaptations (this, Hamlet, O).This is really interesting. Is this really a talented actress (only 19) who understands something of Shakespeare and has purposefully targeted film adaptations? I've heard she was a success on TeeVee. I have to know, wondering if the flash of brilliance in Hamlet was a one-shot deal.As for the quality of this film, I cannot say. Teen dating dramas succeed or not based on a secret, everchanging language of the subculture. I don't have a pass to that area, so must demur. This isn't much Shakespeare though, just the barest skeleton.Her acting seems fresh, but its mighty hard to tell much here. She's not asked to do much, except for one moment when she reads a poem. Gwyneth Paltrow turned out to be limited, albeit sometimes entertaining in what she could bring to Shakespeare. Maybe Julia will do better.",,Anonymous,Romance
Cute and Funny Movie,"I rented this movie on the strength of having seen Julia Stiles in another movie.  I knew nothing about this ahead of time.  Boy, were we pleased. It's funny and well done, not stupid and vapid like Clueless.  Again, I think Julia Stiles does a good job.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
not another teen movie!,"""Not another teen movie!"" I hear you all say! Yet 10 things... is so much more than a teen movie. First it has a fabulous cast (the ever- brilliant Julia Stiles and the up-and coming star, if A Knight's Tale is anything to go by, Heath Ledger), a superb script and it's just really clever. Yes, it is a love story, but a very intelligent re-working of Shakespeare's(also known as the king of writers)The Taming of the Shrew. Yes the ending may be all too perfect and happy but by the end you'll just love Julia Stiles' character sooo much that you'll be glad for her. There are some great laughs and a hilarious overprotected father played by Larry Miller who has some killer lines that had me in hysterics. There's not just comedy though, there's a few heart felt moments (those who've seen the movie I'm talking about the bit with the poem!) Overall I would recommend this movie to everyone. Don't be put off by the teen movie tag, because it's a really fun movie for teens and those beyond their teen years!A very enjoyable 8 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just watch it...,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a pretty and famous teenager cannot go out on a date unless her older sister go as well. Her sister is a very short tempered young woman who does not want to go out with anyone.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot, many funny scenes with plenty of humor and some very good interpretations. The direction which was made by Gil Junger was good and he succeeded on creating the feeling that the audience is a part of this movie, something that made us relate to his main characters. The interpretations of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played as Cameron James, Heath Ledger who played as Patrick Verona, Julia Stiles who played as Kat Stratford and Larisa Oleynik who played as Bianca Stratford were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Andrew Keegan's who played as Joey Donner and David Krumholtz's who played as Michael Eckman because they created some simply iconic scenes. To sum up, I have to say that ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is an all time classic comedy movie that combines romance in a beautiful was so, I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Misleading title. Cliched ending.,"Based on the title, it seemed to me that ""10 Things I Hate About You"" should have been a movie about unlikeable characters doing despicable things to one another with comedic results. Probably a black comedy, perhaps along the lines of ""The War of the Roses"".It turns out, however, that the plot is a sweet high school romance story in which several unlikely scenarios play out just right, and everybody ends up happy in the end. The cast works well together, highlighting Joseph Gordon-Levitt's (""Tommy"" on NBC's ""3rd Rock from the Sun"") attempt to romance Larisa Oleynik, whom is not allowed to date until her sister (Julia Stiles) begins to date as well. Unfortunately, Stiles' character is rather bitter at men and life in general, so getting her to date proves a chore until the school criminal played by Heath Ledger comes into the picture.I wasn't aware that this is actually based on a Shakespeare play. I only read ""MacBeth"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" in school, although because of this movie, I'm now interested in reading ""The Taming of the Shrew"". (upon which this movie was derived.)One complaint I must note: In the past year or two, I've seen several movies where either the main plot or a sub plot involves a teenage guy dating a girl for purely selfish reasons (getting paid by friends, trying to win a bet, etc.), but SURPRISE! he ends up falling for her anyway. Then of course, right when the most romantic moment promises to be right around the corner, SURPRISE! the girl finds out and gets her feelings hurt, and then the guy has to convince her that ""it's not really like that"", and eventually she forgives him and they stay together. It's starting to get a little overused as it's been played out in recent movies as diverse as: Cruel Intentions, She's All That, Carrie 2: The Rage, and now 10 Things I Hate About You.Maybe Hollywood should start writing some new material, instead of rehashing the popular plot lines of previous films. But then again, I suppose it wouldn't be Hollywood with any real originality, would it?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great job,"Okay, I admit it.  I loved this movie.  I loved it even more than the classic play on which it is based.Remaking, and especially modernizing, a classic is a delicate business. It's terribly easy, when bringing old truths into modern idiom, to fall so far into the pool of popular culture as to lose depth, or to work so hard at making an old story accessible to a young audience that the result is pure tedium for all ages.In 1999, She's All That, a very loose and unacknowledged update of Pygmalion, gave us a perfect example of this kind of failure.  Thankfully, however, the same year brought us this movie, 10 Things I Hate About You, an update/remake of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew - and a great example of how to do it right.Doing it right, you see, is not about putting the thing into modern dress and language or adding gimmicks you think will appeal to people who might otherwise expect themselves to be bored.  Doing it right is about deconstructing something old until you get right down to the barest timeless truth of the thing, the reason why the author wrote the original, the reason why you are drawn to retelling the story in the first place, and then - and only then - reconstructing the story around that truth in the spirit of the original author, but dressing it according to your own zeitgeist.Ever since my parents took me to see The Taming of the Shrew when I was eight years old, I've had kind of a love/hate thing going on with it.  I've loved the humor, the cleverness, and the fact that everybody who deserves happiness and love gets it in the end.  The parts I've hated are, first, the part where Kate is privately humiliated, and then the part where she has to appear subservient to her husband, even though she does it for love. Without spoiling it for you, I can tell you this is not quite what happens in 10 Things I Hate About You.Strip away all the business and temporal context of Shakespeare's Shrew and this is the message you are left with: Love, trust, and respect must be earned.  They are not simply consequences of being young and cute.  Having a good relationship, loving well and being well loved, require trust and respect.  These are earned in a relationship when two people are kind, generous, and honest with each other, and bound up in all that, a little humble and a little nakedly needful and desirous of each other.And guess what?  When you strip away all the business and temporal context, this is also the message of 10 Things I Hate About You!  Of course, it's been put into modern context, young language and dress.   And I love the fact that this version has also been thoroughly adapted to the modern consciousness that a young woman can learn this stuff herself, just by being smart and true to herself, and without being forced there by a bunch of men. I also love the way that the boys in this version of the story have to go through the same painful process and learn the same lessons.  But all the best elements of the original - the timeless truth, the humor, the cleverness, and the just deserts - remain intact.The really cool thing about this version, though, is something I don't remember from the original.  In 10 Things, we really get to watch all the main characters grow up.  We get to watch them make choices, right and wrong, hurt each other, heal each other, and learn.  We get to watch them all become more human.And that's the kind of transformation that makes a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the Definitive 1990s Movies,"A new kid (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) must find a guy to date the meanest girl in school (Julia Stiles), the older sister of the girl he has a crush on (Alex Mack), who cannot date until her older sister does.There is not much reason to write a review for a film that everybody already loves and that really launched the career of Heath Ledger, one of the better actors of his time. I would just like to comment on how the film has aged over the past fourteen years (I am writing this September 2013).Amazingly, it has done pretty well. The clothes scream 1990s and the bands featured in the film -- Letters to Cleo and Save Ferris -- have long since faded into obscurity. But the update of Shakespeare is still funny with some great observations on high school life.Sadly, this was probably Julia Stiles' best role.

Typical Teen Movie About 10 Things,"'10 Things I Hate About You' is pretty much a typical teen movie that has nothing new to offer. It follows all those clichés about girl not liking guy in the beginning, guy woos her, girl likes him, there's a conflict, guy and girl split and then girl likes him again. Said to be based on 'The Taming Of The Shrew', this adaptation is fairly week and it would easily be lost among the dozens of forgettable teen films. However, it does have its funny moments. Plus, the chemistry between the actors makes some scenes work. The cast does work in favour. Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do quite well. Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles irritate a lot in the beginning but in the latter half of the film, they improve. Allison Janney is a scene stealer as the principal/aspiring erotic novel writer. It is not a bad movie by any means, just not a very good one.",,Anonymous,Romance

A excellent adaptation of a classic,"I don't tend to do reviews of films as I watch films I like and like the films I watch. Films that I have no interest in or don't like I don't watch. Therefore most of my reviews come out as gushing sections of superlative prose, showing only positive criticism of anything. My reviews don't tend to give any negative comments. However this film deserves my praise.This film is a case in point. I love it.I was 25 when this film was released and so was arguably at or above the age range that this was targeted at. I was aware of this when I choose to watch it, and being male was a little quiet about my willingness / keenness to watch it.I generally don't re-watch films. There are a few exceptions; epics like Lord of the Rings; classics like Star Wars and comedies like Spaceballs, Hot Shots and Monty Python. Even then I haven't watched them that many times. However 'Ten Things I hate about you' I have watched again and again – not obsessively five times in a day, but probably once a year (or more) since it was released.Why do I keep coming back to this film? I don't know, but everything about it exudes quality. I'm male, cantankerous, stubborn and cynical but this film is emotional and of such a calibre that it affects me each time.The plot is not simple, it is a number of different people and how one persons goal affects and intertwines them all. Only later did I discover that this was based on Taming of the Shrew by Shakespeare, no wonder it presents as a well written and carefully thought out story.The acting from all the main parts, lead and supporting roles are excellent. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play the main leads with superb skill, as if the roles were made for them. The music is all well chosen and exactly appropriate to the scenes.But what makes it for me, what holds the whole film together as an excellent portrayal of a superb story is the overprotective but exquisitely loving and caring character that is the father to the main female protagonist. Larry Miller does an excellent job of giving the story meaning and holding all the story together. Without this father figure with his rule about dating for his daughters, there would be no story.It is slightly predictable, but in away that doesn't distract from the film in anyway.It is one of my favourites, and I suspect always will be, despite not being sci-fi or fantasy based, despite being a little chick flick, despite being based on a classic work of literature.The film just works. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Heath Ledger could've had such a promising career,"When ""10 Things I Hate About You"" got released, I thought that it looked like a typical corny teen flick, so I avoided it (that weekend I saw ""The Matrix""). After Heath Ledger died, I learned that he had starred in it, so I thought that I might want to see it after all. I finally got around to it. The movie is an impressive adaptation of ""The Taming of the Shrew"", with a Seattle high schooler attempting to woo a girl and hiring a bad boy as part of his plan. Now that I live in Seattle, it's fun to see some of the filming spots. But most of all, the movie makes some good points about relationships. In addition to Ledger, Julia Stiles, Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz and Joseph Gordon-Levitt put on some fine performances.I recognized Ed Robertson's ""One Week"" at the beginning because ""Weird Al"" Yankovic spoofed it (his version was about Jerry Springer).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A nice surprise.,"Considering all the dreck coming down the 'teen movie' way these past few months, '10 Things' came off as a nice surprise. If you're going to rip off somebody, you might as well rip off the Bard. The transition to the high school setting went rather smoothly, with a fair number of references to the play on which it was based (including one character referring to Kat as a 'shrew' at some point... so much for subtlety). I was also relieved to see that none of the main characters was involved in the run for Prom Queen. It wasn't even mentioned. Hallelujah. The romances were sweet, and the comedic performance of Bianca and Kat's dad was perfect. It definitely ranks as one of the top teen movies of the season. That may not be saying much, but oh well.

Appreciating art in a whole new form,"10 Things I hate About You has a wonderful soundtrack, an awsome cast, and gives a whole new audience the chance to appreciate a classic, even if they don't realize it. The remake of Taming of the Shrew is done beautifully, in a way to get the point of the story across to a whole new generation who would probably never read the original story anyway.  The soundtrack provides the same idea, with great remakes and samples by modern yet somewhat underground bands.  The soundtrack is as great as the movie. Julia Stiles, admittedly my favorite actress to date, seems to actually ""be""  Kat, she plays the part so well.  And Heath Ledger is her perfect match in every way...they even have the same smile.  Larrisa Olynik is almost as convincingly clueless as Alicia Silverstone's Cher, and Joseph Gordon Levitt was perfect in his puppy love. The cast was great, the story line was great, the music was great, and I couldn't appreciate the movie more.  It was a cool and convincing way to bring Shakespeare up to speed (though universally classic as he is) and to just plain have fun.  The 10 is in the title for a reason.",,Anonymous,Romance

Granted, there is some cheese on display here. The music is dated and some of the dialogue is just too obvious. Nevertheless, there's good stuff here. OK, there are some flaws and I am not too naive to suggest this movie is worthy of an Oscar. My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it.

Heath Ledger played the perfect Patrick. Hard on the outside, yet sweet and mushy on the inside. Julia Stiles was sparkling as Katarina Stratford, temperamental and edgy. Larisa Oleynik was the perfect Bianca, sweet and simpering. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a brilliant Cameron, scheming yet all too charming. Andrew Keegan was great as Joey Donner, self obsessed and hateful. I was thoroughly liking the movie until the scene in which Patrick (Ledger) woos Kat (Stiles) with a heart-melting rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" that literally brought a stadium full of people to become an ooohing and aahing mass of fuzzy, warm happiness.

One up on Shakespeare,"Gil Junger (and naturally the screen writers, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith) have pulled off the impossible; they have made a smarter, sassier and altogether more likeable version of the Bard's ""The Taming of the Shrew"", up-dating it to an American High School on the eve of the millennium.Maybe it was the nostalgic factor, (yeah, this was the High School 'prom' I went to here in Ireland some 30 years ago) but I think more appropriately it was a combination of terrific direction, great dialogue and first-rate acting (Heath Ledger has already proved his worth but Larisa Oleynik and David Krumholtz surely have major futures ahead of them) that made this such a pleasureable experience.It isn't every Shakespearean play that lends itself to a modern up-dating (just because HE wrote it dosen't mean YOU have to do it) but one thing Americans are good at is comedy and the great one-liner (not to mention rock n'roll, of which this has a terrific smattering) and ""10 Things ..."" rocks, rolls and bounces with the best of them.  It is also touching, moving and a lovely teen romance with characters you actually care about.  I loved every heartfelt minute of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I love you baby,"I liked this way more on a second viewing and what helped was just to turn my brain off and enjoy it for what it is. Is it just a cliché teen romance movie? Yeah but it´s still doing the tropes to perfection and actually had me laughing. It is a fun movie that knows what it wants to be and that's that. That doesn't make it great to me in any means, but it makes it quite enjoyable.Cameron James is a new student and gets a crush on Bianca Stratford. However he cannot date her for 2 reasons. A contester in the form of Joey Donner and that Bianca can´t date or go anywhere unless her sister Kat does it too. Cameron sets out to make Kat date with Patrick Verona, both outcast.The cast here is great and fun. Heath Ledger does a great job as Patrick and is no doubt the backbone of this movie. Julia Stiles as Kat and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also gives good and fun performances. This also comes from Daryl Mitchell as the English teacher and Allson Janney as the principal. This is just a fun cast that makes the movie come alive since they all want to steal the scenes they are in from each other in the best way possible.This is your classic teenage romance movie. The drama, the sexual tension, the sweetness, the sadness, the trials and tribulations. It´s cliché and has been seen a million times before but it still works. The triangular drama is good here though. I liked the interconnections between characters that also leads to drama later that you of course see coming. The ending is still a bit clumsy to me, with a bit too much drama and will they make it mentality with an argument not really sitting with me at the end. But still the groups at school and just the disregard from the teachers and such makes the movie very fun.This is a movie where you have to turn off your critical sense and just enjoy the moment. That made me have way more fun with the movie and see it for what it was and wanted to be rather than seeing it in the cliché and oversaturated marked of clones it's in. It´s a good time.The jokes are a bit hit or miss here. Some jokes really land. To me the English teacher hating Kat was fun, and the training equipment being shot back it fun, but there is also a bit too many sex jokes that did not land with me. It is pretty mixed in that regard.The ""can´t take me eyes off you"" part of the movie is iconic and so charming in all the right ways. A wonderful performance by Ledger that shows so much joy and life, that makes the movie feel so much more alive.The needle drops in this movie is plenty and cringe. The lyrics are often a bit too literal to the point it could be called tell don´t show and it just comes in all the time. It still works at times and there are some great needle drops too, but the majority is way too much. Also what´s with the ending on the roof?You are left with a great good, fun time that just works from start to finish. Elevated by the great performances and fun complex narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lively and not hateful at all!,"Yet another teen flick that ends at the Prom! But still 10 Things I Hate About You is lively enough to be reasonably appealing.And at no stage were 10 things listed about anyone! That bit must have hit the edit room floor.This is pretty familiar territory. Boy likes girl. She doesn't like him. Someone is bribed to go out with someone he doesn't like. He falls for her. She finds out. You get the idea.There's a Shakespearean spin on this version though. There's a shrew and so we have a taming of the shrew. The school is called Padua High and the shrew is called Kat and her surname is Stratford.But really it would be stretching it to call this Shakespeare and most of its intended audience wouldn't even notice.Full marks for Padua High though. The buildings really look stunning and are used to great effect, especially in a final pan with surprise, surprise, a rock band on the roof.And would that band notice or care about the over reactive acting style that infects these types of films? They probably wouldn't because most teenagers are like this in the company of their peers. Under developed personalities are by definition shallow, even if this trait is amply compensated for by enthusiasm and embarrassment.But I still couldn't help wonder how actors who are obviously adults can hope to pull off the idea that they are children in these films.There aren't too many school age actors who can pull off mature acting performances. There aren't that many actors like Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio;  who have had the magic touch at a suitably young age.10 Things I Hate About You hasn't revealed any more of these either. They didn't even try. In particular Australian actor Heath Ledger looked unlikely to be of school age. And when he slides back into his school desk after a night out drinking and playing pool with his bikie mates, well it seemed a bit rich.But that's all irrelevant, especially since school agers seeing the film would probably much rather see someone who's as adult as Heath playing the hero anyway. Why aspire to pimples?Anyway the dialogue is smart, the school looks good, the music is bouncy and the characters are interesting in spite of their shallowness.",,Anonymous,Romance
Another underappreciated teen movie...,"Man I really hate teen movies,but this one way maybe a little cooler than the rest of them...I honestly can understand the huge lie behind them bit in this kind of movies you cant honestly expect something less.First of all,the plot was very meh nothing too fabulous and still nothing eay too unexpected to see just teenagers like me way older than they are supposed to be dealing with romance and silly things.The soundtrack was good and honestly I liked it in some scenes not one of my favourite obviously but still a very good one.kimda helped the whole movie getting away eith the romance cliché and helped it stand out.The cast was unexpectedly good Heath ledger in a role like this kinda made me understand how good of an actor he really way the rest goes to therest of the cast, which I'm not afraid to say it but they have a better tone to this film.Sadly,""10 things I hate about you"" is normally a movie maybe your girlfriend would suggest you to see it msybe that's why the whole movie doesn't get the appreciation it was supposed to have.Obviously as every movie in this pathetic world this one had some Deficiencies in many areas,its ending was completely predictable and it really alienated me too bad the movie followed all the clichés faithfully plus most of the time I found myself cringing at several scenes and getting bored by the end of the entire movie...I think it is not a film for everyone as it is aimed at a limited audience of a narrow age.I admit I kind of liked the whole movie Despite how predictable and cliché it was it was good in quite a few parts and I'll give it credit for that...If you are a teenage girl around the age of 15-19 (at worst) you can watch it and you will definitely enjoy it now for the rest of the audience better stay away because the movie simple doesn't refer to them as an audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hey ... that was okay,"I had never seen this before because I was 31 in 1999 and far too cool for teen comedy adaptations of Shakespeare. I've been recently trying to catch up with popular movies I have never seen, and at 54, I'm no longer too cool for teen comedy adaptations of Shakespeare.I'm glad I did. This is a solidly okay film that both amused and entertained. It's not a perfect film. The plot is EXTREMELY predictable, but in ways that are more comforting than annoying. It raises a few comic dead-ends, but generally speaking ... it was a spend an hour and a half.I didn't expect Julia Stiles to kind of steal the movie away from Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but damn if she didn't manage it.They let Ledger just talk in his Australian accent.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Don't worry, be happy","Yes, that was the feeling of mine when i left the theater. Hakuna matata. So, it's a sweet teenage movie. But to be true, i didn't like it so damn much like She's All That. I don't know why. But, i just want to say that Julia Stiles' (the best young actress of her generation, i think. This girl rules!) Kat Stratford was one of the most realistic, smart, great characters of all the teen movies. A girl who doesn't want to act like the other ones expect her to do. Come on, that's a REAL person. I think the best things about the movie are Julia Stiles, the sequence where Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Cameron) explains to Larisa Oleynik (Bianca) what kind of person she is, and the Heath Ledger's (Patrick) song scene. These are just awesome things. But there are not-that-good things too, like how Bianca can't understand anything about Joey until the moment he starts pausing in front of her, and how can a person like Kat can sell (yeah, i can only find that word to use, sell) herself to just a GUITAR? We knew that she was in love with Patrick before, but she could resist him before, too. Hmmmm... Anyway, at the end, rent the movie&enjoy it. That's what you have to do. Again, don't worry, be happy!

The Joker and Robin in the same High School? Really?,"10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is a smart, sweet, caring and funny film. This film's characters aren't your normal mid 90's dumb teens, they talk eloquently, they actually think and not utter useless lines (except for one or three dumb teen lines). The script, written by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith is funny and throws in some Shakespearean type dialogue in there because this film, after all, is based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" written by William Shakespeare.The movie is about this new kid Cameron (the incredibly talented Joseph Gordon Levitt in a very early role) wanting to date the beautiful, popular girl in school Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) but in order to do that she has to find someone to date the ""wild beast"" of her older sister played by the hormonal and teen angst ridden Kat (Julia Stiles). Kat has her own set of rules that she abides by and believes that she doesn't need to be someone that other people want her to be. That's true and all but to a certain point. Cameron's adventure in finding the right guy to even breathe near Kat comes to a screeching halt when he sees the dark and mysterious Patrick Verona (the late and great Heath Ledger, not his movie debut but came into the spotlight after starring in this film). All sorts of funny and interesting scenes abound after meeting Patrick that I will not spoil.Cameron is being aided by a nerdy, audio guy named Michael played by the funny David Krumholtz who I first saw in The Addams Family Values (1993), another hilarious film. He may be nerdy but he's a good ad helpful right hand man to Cameron. The film is a genuine mid 90's funny and romantic film with very likable characters and somewhat witty, charming dialogue. When I first saw it 10 years ago, I immediately was hooked and never realized that this movie would give way to two very talented actors who would go on to have interesting film roles that showcased their talents in Levitt and Ledger. I forgot to mention that Kat and Bianca's dad is played by character actor Larry Miller, and he's hilarious in this film as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Just great teen update of ""Taming of the Shrew""","At Pardu High School young perky sophomore Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) wants to date--but her overprotective father (Larry Miller) won't let her until her older sister Katerina (Julia Stiles) dates. Problem is Katerina hates everybody! Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) wants to date Bianca and hires tough boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Katerina. Trouble is Patrick falls for Katerina...I can't believe I'm giving a 10 to a teen comedy (I'm in my 40s!) but I loved this! It's bright, full of color, quick with many interesting characters and some absolutely hysterical one liners. I laughed out loud more than once! The script is sharp and just great--it updates Shakespeare's play in a very affectionate manner.The acting is just perfect. Stiles has already proved she's a good actress--she plays the comedy and drama to perfection. Oleynik is perfect as her younger sister--she could have been too perky but she wasn't. Gordon-Levitt is touching in his role. Allison Janney has a few hysterical bits as guidance counselor Ms. Perky and Andrew Keegan plays the drop dead handsome but obnoxious jerk Joey Donner very well--his verbal fights with Stiles really work! Ledger is just OK.There's also a great soundtrack and some truly funny outtakes during the closing credits along with the band Letters from Cleo belting out a song on top of the school! The only negative I have is that there was a bit too much swearing and sexual innuendo for a PG-13 movie. Still, I loved this movie from beginning to end--funny and moving. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie,"I have to say that this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It has a cast good, camera work and the plot is great. It leaves you feeling satisfied and happy. Being different from a lot of teenage movies today it has substance and contains characters rather than thin pretty superficial girls. The music gives the movie a happy down to earth feel and there is lots of great comments and quotes to pick up. Easily laughable.

What I hated would take more space than allowed, however I can't resist a few inspired comments. I am a HUGE fan of Will Shakespeare. I sat through Leo DiCaprio's modern version of Romeo & Juliet without major trauma, but this remake of Taming of the Shrew, shredded my innards. From a raucous soundtrack to mindless teenage acting to simplistic direction, man, oh man was this one BAD. As I said at the onset, the only redeeming factor was Heath Ledger, who manages to come off good in anything he's associated with. He was the only true actor among this travesty of sleep-walking, boring, over-acting thespians. Duh, gag me with a spoon man...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A very funny, original script for a ""high school"" movie.","Watching ""10 Things I hate..."" I was not aware it is based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew."" I'm not a big ""Shakey"" fan, so that's neither here nor there. And, just last week I watched another ""high school"" movie - ""Never Been Kissed"" - and ""10 Things..."" is in every way a better movie. The acting is good, the situations are funny, and the clever writing is very original. The ending where the ""pay for date"" scheme becomes apparent and then resolved is pretty predictable.

Probably more of a girl's film, a lot of girls I know consider this film to be very good, but for me it's enjoyable anyway.

Good thing my husband obliged. Back to the movie. Upon my first viewing, I didn't know about the ""Taming of the Shrew"" connection, but really enjoyed it upon that realization.

A Pleasing Teen Film!,"The late 1990's and early 2000's is home to a truckload of teen films and many of them are the same thing over and over again. But I'm pleased to announce, 10 Things I Hate About You is one of those above-average ones. In fact by today's standard, the film manages to hold up very well. It's sweet, charming, and funny and that's what I expect from these films. It also happens to bring back some nostalgia in me especially when every social group is explained in the film.Gil Junger's film is about a new student at school, Cameron who happens to fall this pretty girl named Bianca. When he's told she's not allowed to date because of her father, that does not stop him from trying. Meanwhile, this thug named Patrick gets paid to take out Bianca's older sister, the ill-tempered Kat. But he realizes that he may actually fall for Kat.This film has some solid acting by future big stars. Heath Ledger makes a name for himself here and is really charming. Julia Stiles has some great scenes and is my favorite character. I loved her dialog between herself and her black English teacher. Very funny indeed. Finally, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really good here as well and it's weird to see him this young.Overall, despite many teen clichés including the prom scenes which have been done to death, this is an awesome film that many of us can relate to. It's a believable story and the characters in it all seem realistic. There are some good themes such as ones like never give up and such. Of all the teen films that were pushed upon us, this is one of those that stand out. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""10 Things I Hate About You"": My Review","The Taming of the Shrew has been adapted often, sometimes by cutting and changing the play itself and sometimes by retelling the story completely.The first Shakespearean ""talkie"", a 1929 movie starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, keeps many of the lines but adds whips, silent film techniques, and some unintended humor. Also in this category is a 1950 ""live"" television production (now available on YouTube) starring Charlton Heston that runs a mere sixty minutes.The brilliantly filmed 1953 Kiss Me Kate, which tells the story of a musical production of Shrew, has some lines from the play, plus the great advantage of Katherine Grayson and Howard Keel in the main roles.The Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd television series, Moonlighting, did a version with its own rhyming dialogue and a scattering of lines from Shrew and other Shakespeare plays.The original Star Trek presented the story as science fiction with Kate and Petruchio coming from warring planets and Captain Kirk taking over the job of taming in an episode titled ""Elaan of Troyius"".The big-screen adaptation, 10 Things I Hate About You, moves the story to a twentieth century high school in Seattle. Only a couple of Shakespeare's lines survive; however, the film does some interesting subtextual exploration, speculating about what happened to Katherine and Bianca's missing mother.Julia Stiles is an intelligent, feisty, and striking (in both senses) Katherine.Larisa Oleynik, also well cast, does not overshadow Stiles, but manages to be both appealing and spoiled.Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Lucentio) has a certain klutzy charm as a very young lover, and Heath Ledger brings strength, compassion and mischief to this version of Petruchio.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
'The Taming of the Shrew' in a '90s high school,"This film, loosely based on Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' is set in a high school near Seattle. New student Cameron James is smitten by Bianca Stratford; there are two major problems though; she is keen on the wealthy Joey Donner, who also likes her, and her father has banned her and her older sister Kat from dating till they graduate high school. This latter rule is changed to state that Bianca can only date when her sister does... potentially a stricter rule as she appears to show only contempt for boys and they are all scared of her. Cameron tutors her hoping to get closer and when he learns of the rule he, and his friend Michael, plot to find a boyfriend for Kat. The candidate for this role is bad boy Patrick Verona; he will need some persuading though. Here things get complicated as he approaches Joey suggesting he pay Patrick to date Kat... inevitably things get a bit messy.The way the film ends won't surprise too many people but how we get there is fun and provides plenty of laughs. The cast does a fine job; most notably Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles as Patrick and Kat respectively; they have a good chemistry that makes the potential relationship seem believable. Other notable performances come from Larisa Oleynik; as the pretty, and not as vacuous as she first seems, Bianca; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron and Andrew Keegan as the vain Joey. If you are a fan of high school romances I expect you will enjoy this. It has many good characters; both the teens, their teachers and the Stratford sisters' father. While it doesn't reference its source material as much as 'The Easy A', for example, there are plenty of nods with references to other Shakespeare works in class and even the sisters' surname. Overall this is definitely one to watch if you are a fan of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"There are a few things to like about ""10 Things I Hate About You""","If one thing is true about plot, you can rarely go wrong with Shakespeare. ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" based on the bard's comedy ""The Taming of the Shrew"" isn't exactly more than an homage to the theatrical classic, but it's a teen comedy from the '90s that sticks out because of its fresh quirkiness and good heart.When Cameron (Gordon-Levitt, ""3rd Rock from the Sun"") arrives at Padua High School, he's easily smitten by Bianca (Oleynik, ""The Secret World of Alex Mack""), but word is that her strict father won't let her date anyone, especially if her older sister Kat (Styles) doesn't. So Cameron and his friend Michael (Krumholtz) conspire to trick self-centered jock Joey (Keegan), who also has the hots for Bianca, to pay off local bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to take out Kat so that Bianca will be available.""10 Things"" assembles an impressive cast of young talent. Ledger and Stiles are the highlights. Despite the fact that the script calls for their relationship to make no actual sense, they manage to sell you by just acting together on screen. In honesty, what the script lacks in practicality, it makes up for in charm, a charm it couldn't pull off without Stiles and Ledger.For another thing, the movie is not filmed like a typical teen comedy. In this way it's both better and not as good. It feels more like a TV show, not a surprise because director Gil Junger has made a career directing TV sitcoms. Junger likes to choose strategic camera angles, especially in more comedic scenes, emphasizing the film's sense of humor. There is a whole comedy element based on the characters not minding their surroundings or making clever remarks. Junger keeps the camera where he thinks these jokes will be most amusing.The script he works with is very teen drama and definitely accurate in a sad sort of way though definitely exaggerated at times. Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz definitely come across as rookie writers with some really good ideas. Between some of Junger's work and the talented young cast, there's a lot to smooth over the bumps in ""10 Things"" to make for a satisfying and not too over-the-top romantic teen comedy. It doesn't avoid clichés, but it works with them better.---Visit my blog at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Taming of the Shrew for the teen generation,"Modern versions of Shakespeare can often fall flat on their faces, and there were times while watching this when I thought '10 Things I Hate About You' was one of those failures.Bianca and Kat, transposed to American high school and aiming to go to the Prom, mirror Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' characters to a point - however, this Kat is just a sarcastic, roll-eyes, typical teen we've seen hundreds of times before.This film's Petruchio becomes Pat, an arrogant rebel (played well by the late Heath Ledger in his debut movie role in the US). At first he pursues Kat (spiky but effective Julia Stiles) as a bet but, guess what, the path of true love ...One of the best scenes is the 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' song in the stadium, but even that becomes a cliché and despite its charm, doesn't really work.This film is OK. It has its moments and some touches (Kat's poem instead of her 'big speech') which work well, but in the main it suffers from the usual teen movie problems - bad language, cardboard background characters, tedious back-plots (which have little to do with the Shrew source).As Shakespeare for the masses it is fun, pacey, and fairly true to its theme. And perhaps that is all it should be judged on.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
one of the best,10 things I hate about you is a really worth it movie and probably one of the best rom-com movie till date. All the actors had surprisingly done a great work. Kat and Patrick have amazed our minds :-*,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best teen movie ever.,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and by far the best teen movie around. It's the kind of film you can just sit, watch and be entertained without having to do too much thinking. It doesn't seem to matter how many times I watch this film, it always makes me laugh.  The best bit of this film has to be when Patrick and Joey are arguing about taking cat out on a date in the corridor and Patrick does a cheesy grin. That is one of many hilarious parts in this film that will guarantee to get you smiling. This is a feel good film to watch when you're feeling sad. And even if you don't like the story it's worth watching for the brilliant soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fair romantic comedy for young people!,"It's quite something to see how young these actors looked back in 1998/1999 who were just getting started with their (mostly) extensive careers. While most of the movie was predictable (like other romantic comedies) and while some stuff may not hold up entirely anymore in 2024, it was good enough for what it was meant to be. Julia Stiles did good in her role and was a talented actress for her age, and Heath Ledger did well too (died tragically way too young, RIP to him and his unique talent). I even liked the teacher played by Daryl Mitchell who is hilarious and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's friend/partner in crime.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Health Ledger is so sexy,"Weird but good movie. I really enjoy how intriguing the story and concept were. Pretty much it's about these two sisters in highschool. The younger sister wants to date but the dad has set up a rule where she can't date unless the older sister will date. And it's a story about how all of that unfolds.They executed this concept well! Pacing is good and the writing is really good.Heath Ledger is literally one of my favorite actors if not my favorite. He makes this movie so much better all while still playing a very specific but deep character.Emotionally this movie has a little to unpack. I love seeing these two supposedly ""scary"" and ""tough"" characters break out of their shell and be real with each other. Also anger at the Joey dude and also anger at little miss white girl for leaving Cameron for a sec.The movie looks pretty good but nothing insane, there was a super dope shot when they use a drone or crane or something at the very very end. Super good shot. My favorite one though is from the paintball scene when they are on the ground with each other before they kiss. Pretty fire stuffSound design is fine but the soundtrack was actually really really good!!No special editing, and the themes are interesting and kinda hard to land. Maybe not to judge a book by its cover.Seen the movie twice an it's good, I don't know if you can learn anything else but it's still fun to watch more than once.This movie would definitely be 9 for me if it didn't have so many inappropriate jokes and as bad of language as it had. I really did enjoy it and would recommend the movie to others but just in select circumstances.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A teen flick for all ages?,"When I sat down to watch this film, I will admit it, I was expecting a cheesy teen flick that will float to the top of the pile, which includes American Pie 1/2.

Julia Stiles is a great actress and so is Heath Ledger... Sorry, actor! Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes good use as the annoying boy who wants to get off with Julia's Sister, (Larisa Olynik).There are some bad bits, well, not so bad, but embarrassing - but it's a cheesy teen-flick!OK, so which is it; A cheesy teen flick or a mature flick for all ages apart from under 12's? The answer? Neither - it's a flick for all ages that is based on the Shakespearean novel 'The Taming of the Shrew'. Yes, I liked it, so it gets a 3/5 from me!Also, the soundtrack ROCKS!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Find a 99 cent rental or wait for HBO,"Seemingly a good start, the movie quickly turned into one that I almost walked out on.  I gave it a higher vote than I thought it deserved only because there was no sex (even though the characters were 18!) and instilled the notion that it's all right to wait and get to know somebody better before spending part of your life with them.  For a teenage girl, this type of movie is a must-see.  For all others, save your money!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Supurbly funny,"10 Things I Hate About You was absolutely hilarious and is one of the funniest teen movies of the year. Julia Stiles is fabulous as Kat, and incredibly funny. She is definitely going to be a someone you should get used to hearing. So is Larissa Olynk, a girl whose only other acting atributes were a Nickelodeon show called The Adventures of Alex Mack and the Baby Sitters Club Movie. And the guy who played their teacher was incredibly funny and should be moving on to bigger and better things. Not to mention the hilarious girl who played Kat's best friend who is in love with Shakespeare. So, in conclusion go see this fabulous movie based on one of the best Shakespeare plays ever written.",,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining hour and a bit,"To sum it all up, this was a funny teen flick and had a great soundtrack and brilliant cast.

Still enjoy it many years on,"Firstly let me say I'm 23 and I first saw this one it first came out in the cinemas when I was 13 - and promptly loved it, bought the soundtrack and a year or two ago bought the movie. The two couples have good chemistry and play their characters with feeling, the music was up to date, up beat and completely fitting for when it came out and still fun to listen to now. Also around that time and still today I am Shakespeare buff and am always happy to sit down and take a look and a new adaptation.I'm not going to say that the fashion has dated and some of the ideals have too because they have but honestly in comparison to the other teen films coming out right now this is well written and well acted by people who have gone on to do amazing things and who actually played characters who were both likable and relatable. As I said before I'm 23 and saw this for the first time when I was 13 and even ten years on I can still sit down and enjoy nearly everything about this movie and yes I still have the soundtrack....somewhere.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another teen-take on Shakespeare - but really quite good!,"I am a huge fan of Shakespeare and when hearing about this film while it was in production, I experienced this sudden feeling of dread.  I mean, Tommy from 3rd Rock and Alex Mack from The Adventures of Alex Mack acting together in a take on The Taming Of The Shrew?  I thought PUH-LEEZE!!But when I actually saw the film, I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting was good (although the little references to the Shakespeare were a little cringe worthy) and the chemistry between Julia Stiles' Kat Stratford and Heath Ledger's Patrick Verona was amazing!  And to be honest, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larissa Oleynik were really good (even though they aren't in their respective T.V. shows).Julia Stiles was the best thing about this production - although Larry Miller as Katerina and Bianca's over protective father was superb!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Your Average Teenage Comedy,"Bianca Stratford(Larisa Oleynik) cannot date until her older rebellious sister Kat(Julia Stiles) starts dating. A new guy at school Cameron(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls completely in love with bianca and will do anything to get her. When he finds about the rule that bianca cannot date until her sister starts dating, he tries to make a popular jock Joey(Andrew Keegan) pay someone to go out with Kat, in order that Bianca can also start dating. Cameron, of course, wants to do that for his own good because he's already starting to win over Bianca. Joey has found the perfect guy to go out with Kat: A handsome bad-ass from Australia named Patrick(Heath Ledger). Patrick agrees to go out with Kat if Joey pays him a hundred dollars per date. Now everything is going fine until Patrick really starts falling in love with Kat. This wasn't a bad movie, it's your typical teenage movie but that it's based on a Shakespere play must mean something. Plus it's got the lovely Julia Stiles in it, so that's always a bonus.

Jane Austen is much funner,"""10 Things"" tries hard and but in vain to revive the twinkle-toed atmosphere of Amy Heckerlings great Jane Austen adaption of ""Emma"" as a teenage-comedy in ""Clueless"" (1995). However, compared to the many truly mindless teenage-comedies excessively tiring our patience of(f) late (with ""American Pie"" just the epitome of the lot, repeating everything that has been said before conclusively and therefore the single one movie poised to have closed that sorry chapter for good enough) ""10 Things"" annoys ever the more by mistaking its classic groundwork to make amends for dull improbabilities that weren't even funny enough at the masters times (like: moron father says dumb younger sister can only get laid by some moron when older sister gets a moron first): a glorious source is no excuse for a dumb movie. And someone who wrote ""Hamlet"" is not a glorious source when it comes to judging ""The Taming of the Shrew"", ""Love Labours Lost"" or ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"".Given that ancient drama and classical works became as lasting as they are because they basically deal with eternal human frailties, any pubescent teenage nonsense will have grecian models somehow or has been made into a play when Shakespeare, when Moliere, Goldoni, anyone of those, where at their times in need of easy cash - they remain tales told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A superior teen comedy,"""Teen comedy"" and Shakespeare: two concepts that shouldn't fit very well in the same sentence, especially if the former turns out to be an adaptation of a work by the latter, set in the present day. Thankfully, the writers of this film get it right most of the time, which is why 10 Things I Hate About You should be rightfully considered one of the more interesting interpretations of the Bard's works.One of the smartest moves on the makers' behalf is actually the choice not to reveal the origin of the story: Shakespeare's name isn't mentioned anywhere in the credits. Instead, we get a few playful and fun references to the original author and the comedy The Taming of the Shrew, on which 10 Things is loosely based: the high school where most of the action unfolds is called Padua (the city where The Taming takes place), the female protagonist's last name is Stratford (Shakespeare's place of birth) and the male main character is named Verona, after the town where Romeo & Juliet was set.Instead of two ill-fated lovers, we have two people who can't stand each other: Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles), the ""shrew"" who refuses to socialize with anyone, and Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), an Australian textbook rebel who allegedly served jail time for setting a cop on fire. Thw two are brought together thanks to the actions of a younger boy, Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a crush on Kat's sister Bianca (Marisa Oleynik). Unfortunately for him, her father (Larry Miller) won't let her date guys until Kat dates someone as well, and since no one will spontaneously go out with Kat, Cameron and is friend Michael (David Krumholtz) come up with the idea of paying Patrick to ensure everyone gets their happy ending.Naturally, as in all rom-coms starring teenagers, things get a little more complicated than that, and so the entire third act is about how everyone screws up and has to fix the mess they caused. It's all quite predictable, but that doesn't lessen the movie's appeal: sure, it'a very traditional genre comedy, but it's executed with wit and pace, both delivered by sparkling dialogue and above-average performances. Stiles, best known for more troubled roles, pulls off the difficult task of making Kat sympathetic in spite of her apparent coldness, while Ledger, in the part that got him noticed in Hollywood, goes beyond a mere ""brooding thug"" clichè. So much of the movie is in their hands one wishes there was less focus on Gordon-Levitt and Oleynik, who might provide the tools for setting the story in motion, but also happen to be incredibly daft compared to the main couple and constitute the film's biggest flaw (paired with an embarrassing paint-ball scene). Fortunately, that kind of blandness is compensated by a terrific adult cast, most notably Miller (familiar to Seinfeld fans) and Allison Janney, whose two-scene cameo easily qualifies as the best laugh in the whole picture.To summarize, romantic comedies aren't always that good, especially when teenagers are part of the main plot, but when they work, the result can be something as warm and funny as 10 Things I Hate About You. Then again, the Shakespearean roots of the screenplay must have helped a great deal too.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the better re-tellings of ""The Taming of the Shrew"", writers Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith did a nice job bringing Shakespeare's work into the almost-21st-century. The characters are well defined and excellently played, particularly Kat Stratford by Julia Stiles and Patrick Verona by Heath Ledger. The supporting characters are all nicely played and fun to watch, filling out the cast nicely and keeping the movie clipping along at a nice pace.

"""10 Things I Love About '10 Things I Hate About You'""","10 Things I Hate About You is a charming and timeless teen rom-com that still holds up after more than two decades since its release. The movie is loosely based on William Shakespeare's play ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" but it has a modern twist that makes it relatable to audiences of all ages.The film is set in a high school in Seattle, where the new student Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls for the popular and beautiful Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). However, Bianca's father has a strict rule that she can't date until her older sister, the feisty and independent Kat (Julia Stiles), does. Cameron enlists the help of the rebellious Patrick (Heath Ledger) to win over Kat's heart and clear the way for his own pursuit of Bianca.The standout performances in the movie come from Stiles and Ledger, who have a sizzling chemistry that lights up the screen. Stiles is a powerhouse as the sharp-tongued Kat, delivering her lines with sarcasm and wit, while also showing vulnerability in her emotional scenes. Ledger, in one of his earliest roles, exudes a natural charisma and charm that makes him an instant heartthrob.The supporting cast also shines, with Gordon-Levitt displaying his trademark earnestness and humor, and Oleynik bringing depth to her seemingly shallow character. The soundtrack is another highlight, featuring iconic hits from the late '90s and early 2000s that perfectly capture the movie's youthful energy.While some of the plot points and character arcs may be predictable, 10 Things I Hate About You is still a delightful and fun watch that will leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. It's a movie that captures the essence of teenage angst and first love, and it's easy to see why it has become a beloved classic in the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless teen movie,"There's atleast a single character which you can relate with or maybe all of them.

Heath,"I first saw this movie in the early 2000's before Brokeback Mountain and The Dark Knight were released. It was nothing special. It certainly isn't my fave rom-com, teen or otherwise. It is very obvious that a bunch of bros rated this movie much higher than other rom-coms only because HEATH Ledger is the male lead. This movie only got a tv show ten whole years after the movie was released (!!!) and only then because Heath had died before his performance in The Dark Knight as The Joker was released in theaters and that kicked off the wave of Heath-O-Mania that some kids are still riding. It's ironic that Larisa Oleynik -whose career went nowhere- was the bigger star in 1999 than Heath Ledger. No one cared about Heath when this movie came out. No one thought this was the best teen movie ever (because it's not) or that Heath was the best actor in a teen movie (because he's not). It's all an extremely belated case of jumping on the bandwagon and it's still going on today.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Sorry not sorry, but most 90's teen romance movies are exactly the same!","First of all, I have to admit the reason why I decided to watch this movie is because, it was a very popular movie in the 90's and most reviews were positive, so I decided to give it a chance. Eventually, it was just an average teen/romance film and I kinda enjoyed it. The movie synopsis wasn't really interesting, because there are too many movies similar to this one. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was very simple and easy to understand. The characters weren't interesting, nor well-developed but they were very likeable (especially, Kat). Regarding the casting choices, they were nice and their performances were descent. In my opinion, it was just a nice feel-good romantic film and there were some funny moments during the movie. The 1st act was kinda slowpaced and boring, however the 2nd and 3rd act were both way better. The ending was definitely predictable, even though I enjoyed it a lot.

Insipid crap desperate to be Clueless.,Insipid attempt to go the Clueless (which succeeded admirably) route of using classical literature as a template for a high school romantic comedy.

a teen movie that didn't tick me off,"I generally avoid teen movies as best I can because they are almost invariably shallow offensive stereotypes that present a totally inaccurate view of what an average sixteen-year-old ( or  any teenager ) should be/think/look like etc.Although this film isn't a great insight into what real high school life is like, at least they got some things right that most of the others in this genre miss.  The school is populated by stereotypes, but at least there are consequences and some realistic expectations of life.  Kat was wonderfully sympathetic and gave a decent role model for high-schoolers in terms of not having to do what 'everyone' is doing.It was also nice to see a 'don't judge a book by its cover' message that wasn't quite so shallow as usual.  The geeks were still geeks at the end, but they found other people that they could relate to.One thing I especially liked was the fact that this film wasn't about a bunch of sex-crazed teens.  The plot was initiated because of one kid's over-active glands, but he was the exception, rather than the rule.  The couples were able to end up together without ending up in bed.  I much prefer that because I get tired of the generalization that all high-school and college students think about is sex and beer ( or sex and football as another film put it ).Anyway, off the soapbox.  The one way that I knew for sure that this was a good movie was that I kept thinking to myself ""I hope it's not over yet."" Not a great work of art and aptly rated PG-13 for not-for-kiddies language and humor, but a solid 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly good,"Despite the fact that the movie is set in a classic high school scene, it's done rather well.Yes, the story is based on the Shakespearian story The Taming Of The Shrew, and the writer does a pretty good job of sticking close to the story.There's a lack of plot holes and the dialogue is rich in wit and humor, which is actually very rare these days, considering most ""humor"" is based off the word ""fart"". Don't get me wrong, the movie has its fair share of vulgarities, but I suppose that's so it appeals to.. well, a younger generation audience.The movie switches from slow to fast paced, and the characters are.. memorable, to say the least.However, it still, in some ways, is like a lot of other teen movies you'd see. It was good, but it wasn't brilliant, you know?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
love Patrick's and Kat's relationship,"10 Things I Hate About You is a classic rom-com movie in the 90s.

Taming of the Shrew Meets Bad Teen Acting and Hoaky Story,"There is a growing library of films that re-make, revision, re-do, and otherwise re-show  many of Shakespeare's plays.   In this case, Taming of the Shrew isdone as a 1990's love story between a not so interested ""Shrew"" and a boyequally uninterested in her.  It has its moments with some good one-liners but that is about it.  Regardless of the fact that it gains its inspiration from a Shakespeare classic, this is no different from the many Teen-love comediesreleased as films and television series.It is still worth the cost of a rental but don't expect anything great. Of the Shakespeare-to-film  movies, this is likely the worst or very close to it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The young female intellectual.,"This may just be one of the most significant pieces of accessible idealism to come round in a long while.As a literature teacher I have used this film as an example in the classroom.  The concept of a THINKING teenaged girl who is able to make rational judgements about the attitudes and actions of others, and then to actually live by her extraordinarily high standards, is an invaluable example.  We've seen enough bimbos diving into the sack.  If only more girls were like Kat--!But shrewish Katrina is more than an intellectual snob.  She's been hurt, and her deeply-closeted motivation is to spare her sister the pains she herself has known: 'Not all experiences are good.'  It's appropriate that the story takes place at a school-- for the real purpose of education is to learn from the mistakes of others instead of stupidly repeating them yourself.  That alone makes the film worth watching for young people, younger teenagers... and maybe even tweens.Some observations: 1. The producers seem stuck in a '70s-'80s musical rut, choosing Cheap Trick and Joan Jett numbers.  But the hook in Nick Lowe's tune 'Cruel to be Kind' comes from 'Hamlet', a connection that Kat (and perhaps no other character) probably appreciates. 2. NO public-school teacher would EVER get away with Mr Morgan's behaviour in the classroom.  This is the worst drawback in the story, and it's major. 3. Why don't we ever see Bianca and her date go sailing?  It's a wholesome sport requiring brain power and responsibility, and seeing them actually go would assuage the audience's concerns as much as Dr Stratford's. 4. I can't help it-- I just keep seeing Katrina as.. DARIA!",,Anonymous,Romance
"A Much Better Than Average Romantic Comedy,","10 Things I Hate About You is a good movie with a decent storyline that is reasonably cliché but the films cast and script is good enough that you can see past the cheesy story and enjoy this movie.The characters and the humor is very different to what you would usually see in a romantic comedy,but it isn't too different for people who enjoy them the way they are not to enjoy,which makes this a very good couples film,because the humor will make bought men and women laugh.Heath Ledger brings a very inspired performance,a bit too good for a movie like this,he lived and breathed every moment of this character and I was very impressed with him, I also really enjoyed Julia Stiles and Joseph Gorden Levitt.While it still is at times a very clichéd romantic comedy,10 Things I Hate About You has enough good humor and unique characters to be much better than average.Cameron (Joseph Gorden Levitt) try's to find a student in his new school to date Kat (Julia Stiles) so that he can date her sister.He makes a deal with Patrick (Heath Ledger) to dare her,but then starts to really fall for Kat.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Underrated,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" (1999) is probably the all-time most ambitious of the teen comedies. Updates of classic literature like this have become relatively common; ""Emma"" is adapted as ""Clueless"", ""Othello"" as ""O"", ""Pygmalion"" becomes ''She's All That'', etc. etc. ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" (which has also been adapted as the Broadway musical and film ""Kiss Me Kate"".The strange title is less Shakespeare derived than a play on the Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet that begins ''How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.'' Even knowing this, the title withholds its relationship to the film content until the climatic scene late in the film when Katerina (Julia Stiles) reads her poem (in iambic pentameter) to the class: ""I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all"". Either the producers can't count of they didn't like the sound of ""13 Things I Hate About You""The film was fairly popular at the time of its release and made a considerable amount of money, but critical reaction was mixed. Most of the negative reviews came from critics who felt the film was too distanced from the original; specifically that Katerina was not Shakespeare's mega-shrew and that her taming was just too tame. While these observations are correct, in this case toning down the original makes the film work better. A less gritty story allows for more lyrical storytelling and better a unity with the great pop soundtrack and the inventive cinematography. And few will miss the original's out-of-control misogyny. The film goes out on fantastic rotational helicopter shot of the group ""Letters from Cleo"" as they perform the closing song on top of spectacular Stadium High School in Tacoma.The story begins with obstetrician Walter Stratford's (Larry Miller) grudging agreement to allow his younger daughter Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) to date if her older sister Katerina (Stiles) starts dating. Walter's occupation has made him super-paranoid about teen pregnancy, but he feel quite safe with this compromise because Katerina is a brain with little interest in boys and an abrasive enough personality to drive away anyone who might be attracted to her.Miller and Stiles are exceptional in these roles, the best performances of their careers. Oleynik (formally Alex Mack) does not have nearly as much to work with but is solid in her role. My main criticism is that the film has the same dynamic as ""Some Kind of Wonderful"", with the abrasive tomboy significantly more desirable than the foxy girl every guy is after. Back in her ""Alex Mack"" days Oleynik was the #1 ranked female in a People Magazine survey of the most beautiful person in the world. I don't see it and I'm pretty sure that I have a lot of company.One interesting bit of trivia is that Oleynik went on to attend and graduate from Sarah Lawrence College, the school that Katerina wants to attend in the film.Female viewers will generally be pleased with Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona (afterall the action takes place at Padua High School), who is hired by two of Bianca's admirers to tame the shrew. Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) is the obnoxious pretty boy who is cruising for his comeuppance throughout the film; but he is not close to the bad guy standard set by ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and Pretty in Pink"". Allison Janney is hilarious as a porno-writing guidance counselor.I really liked the tentative feeling between Patrick and Katerina. In one of the most enjoyable scenes he appears in the grandstands while she is at soccer practice and sings ''I Love You Baby'' over the P.A. system, having bribed the school's marching band to accompany him down on the field.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No, not a masterpiece but a better 1990's teen comedy","I saw this around 5 or 6 years ago so this is the second time I've seen it. I recalled it wasn't too bad the first time so I was not dreading see it again. There are some great laughs and great acting from Julia Stiles, Alison Janey, Daryl Mitchell and Larry Miller. Heath Ledger was also not bad. It's a predictable movie but predictable happens a lot... so it's how you get there which determines if it's any good. This rises above dumb and keeps it just funny enough to be entertaining as well as interesting.

Great Shakespeare this isn't.,"If you want to see an excellent contemporary reworking of Taming of the Shrew, look elsewhere.

Lighthearted Shakespeare?,"It's nice, for a change, to view a movie that tries to hit the usual movie targets: plot, charactor development and a climax. This film is unusual because it really targets the teenage generation. Admittedly, I'm just 20 years old, and I have liked Shakespeare for quite some time, but I found it a satisfying rewrite of, lets face it, a time tested classic play.The quality of the acting was, for mind, well done.  I have read several other reviews that are critical of the 'over age' look of Verona (good to see a fellow Aussie doing great!) but I feel that his acting was credible to his role.. after all, how many pimply rebels do you see these days?This film really fits into many different film genres: shakespeare, teen, comedy.. I think there's something in the film to make just about the ardent film critic laugh.  Much of the humour is tongue in cheek, but I personally, find those films to be the best to watch.Julia Stiles really hit the 'shrew' level, and I really admired her performance.  The scene at near the end of the movie provided her with the prose to really hit audiences and provoke emotion.The support cast portrayed the teenage 'falseness' to a comic end.  The performances acted like a combination of 'Can't Hardly Wait' and 'Clueless'.In summary, I think that people should view this film if they want to see a good lighthearted film with a good ending.  If you are an ardent lover of the Shakespearian guild, you might not appreciate it's approach to converting to a 90's scene.  In any case I recommend to all.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Equally good every time,"I've seen this movie so many times, (some might call it too many) but it just never stops being good. The casting is done very well, and the actors have done such a good job. Nice directed by Gil Junger: the flow is fantastic.I feel like when you've watched a bunch times, you start noticing the small details, which seems like they've required lots of thought. Like the pearl necklace's reappearance, and the colours of their clothing which changes a bit.Even though the ending is so cute and nearly perfect, I wish the movie would've kept going. Seeing Kat go off to college, and the impact it'll have on her relationship to Patrick and to her family, is something I'd give a lot so see.Of course it's based on personal taste, if you like the music or not, but I love it. Not only is it good, but it fits so well to the vibe of the movie, it also underlines the mood in the current scene.The base line is, that this movie will be equally good, funny, romantic and comforting no matter how many times you watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
10 Things I Hate About You,"""Cameron"" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a bit keen on ""Bianca"" (Larisa Oleynik) but she has eyes on the wealthy school Lothario ""Joey"" (Andrew Keegan). Regardless of who likes who, though, her dad won't allow her out of the house, socially, unless her independently-minded and rather stand-offish sister ""Kat"" (Julia Stiles) goes too. She's no intentions of playing any games of conformity, though, so it's a stale mate! Hormones drive ingenuity and swiftly ""Cameron"" and his pal ""Michael"" (David Krumholtz) come up with a plan to hook up ""Kat"" with ""Patrick"" (Heath Ledger). He hasn't much interest in the school or it's traditions either, so he might just be for her. Their cunning plan needs a backer, so they alight on the dim ""Joey"" to fund the operation so he can get a date with ""Bianca"". What a complex web we have weaved - and of course it's only a matter of time and tequila before we are set on the, rather predictable, bumpy course of true love. It is all standard fayre that leads to an obvious, slightly too sentimental, conclusion, but along the way there is a great soundtrack - Joan Armatrading sounds great with big screen sound - and plenty of humour too. Some of that is a bit crass, but there is still loads that works better as these horny, vain and bloody-minded kids try to get their guy/gal. Allison Janney features all too sparingly as the guidance teacher who cares little for her pupils - unless they can contribute to the steamy novel she is writing when their problems don't disrupt her concentration. Stiles and Ledger do gel well with the latter showing quite a degree of mischievous charisma with his pretty limiting role. There isn't really anything new here, but it has something engaging of the ""Breakfast Club"" (1985) style to it and I quite enjoyed it. The ending really did make me glad I come from a nation that spares it's children from that ghastly end of term torture that is ""the Prom""!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
You Will Feel Like A Teenager Again!!!!(If you are not),"One thing which striked me most about this movie was it's perfect casting and hence the performance of all the actors. Their are characters which make you feel attached to them and their are ones you dispose off. But that just reflect the quality of the acting brought out sweetly by the director Gil Junger. Hats off to you Sir.
Having a good story to work with is always a boon and to have Mr. Shakespeare as your story writer a heavenly gift. But kuddos to all the screen writers for adapting the story to a common school life with utmost ease.
On one side we have Kat and Patrick, a little mature couple and on the other Bianca and Cameron a young at hearts pair. They are just lovely together. Then you have high school stud Joey, gothic dressed up girl Mandella and everyone else they just strike a chord with you in their own way.

Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger impress, and the Third Rock kids hold their own.  Also, the kid from ""Life with Mikey"" has some nice comic lines.

Great!...,"This film works because the audience are given a group of well rounded characters; many of which are quite likable, which helps. These are then put into a sequence of situations that resolve themselves into a satisfactory conclusion. Of course we are taken on quite a journey before this conclusion and I can see how some may find the plot a little hard to follow. Fortunately I have read the Shakespeare play and even seen it performed and so am familiar with all its twists and turns. I love the way it's written with allusions to the original text, for instance calling the school 'Padua' was a very nice touch. All the performances were excellent with both Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona and Julia Stiles as Kat Stratford taking the plaudits. I must also give a nod to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron James, Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford, David Krumholtz as Michael and Andrew Keegan as Joey Donner. Oh, and look out for a nice comic turn from Allison Janney as Ms. Perky; very funny.It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I really enjoyed this film and have every time I've seen it! I know it got few plaudits from the critics when it came out, but it certainly speaks to me. It's surprising just how many people 'love that movie' when I bring it up; but so few can tell me what it's about. Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it and if you have, give it another look sometime; it's well worthy of a second look.

One of the better teenage comedies,"To be honest with you, I've never really been into these teenage comedies. 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the better ones, tho. It's slightly based on the Shakespeare play Taming of the Shrew. It's about love (what else?) mostly, but it also has some other qualities plus attitude! My favourite character must be the all-around tough and rough chick Kat Stratford played by Julia Stiles.To play out the basic plot, there's two sisters, Katarina and Bianca Stratford. Kat is the outsider, attitude-girl who pretends never to have cared for anyone. Bianca on the other hand is real outgoing, smiling girl who boys find attractive. Neither of the two sisters have been allowed to date boys, it's strictly denied from them by their overprotective father. Bianca can date when Kat does, but that never appears to happen. Two boys have a crush on Bianca and the rich boy pays a guy to date Kat so he can date Bianca. But what the rich boy doesn't know, is that the other boy, Cameron, is dating Bianca behind his back. And Kat doesn't know that the boy who seems as if he had a huge crush on him is just really been paid to go out with her.The best thing in this film is definitely the music, especially the music Kat likes in the film. I'd love the soundtrack, it's definitely in my wanted-list! If you like a nice, humorous teenage romantic comedy, this is the one to get, I assure you. It just doesn't get any better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I want to steal her black platfrom flip flops, low rise jeans and her STUNNING blue silk prom dress;) The poem that she wrote and performed in the end of the movie is like she is/was expressing what millions of teenager girls go through every day: HEARTBREAK and first love. As for Patrick, his sexy curls and bad boy image fits the character like a customized suit and PLS MARRY ME ASAP<3 I love how they get closer and closer, however both of them have strong personalities and behave in a distant way. All of their dates are relationsip goals (EVEN WHEN SHE VOMITED HIS SHOES HOW ADORABLE HE WAS)!!!

A tame Taming of the Shrew,"No one will mistake Stiles and Ledger for Taylor and Burton but there are a few enjoyable moments in 10 Things to make it a marginally worthwhile teen oriented adaptation of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. The likeable teen cast which features many recognizable faces besides the leads do a competent job bringing their characters to life. Unfortunately too many of the characters are written as stereotypes of what the writers think teenagers are supposed to be like. We have all seen these characters many many times before. And the writers couldn't resist having the climax be at the all important prom as if that plot device hasn't been used a million times before.

"Cute, Fun Entertainment.","1999 was a year for dumb-ass teen films. Fortunately, 10 Things I Hate About You wasn't one of them, I, surprisingly, largely enjoyed this film.10 Things I Hate About You focuses on cute, affluent sisters Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katarina (Julia Stiles), the former as sweet and popular as the latter is mean-spirited and sulky. Their dad (Larry Miller) has imposed a house rule that Bianca can't start dating until her older sis does - not the best news for besotted Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). In order to win the saccharine sophomore, he plots to find someone willing to date Kat - the ideal candidate being loner-with-past Patrick Verona (Aussie newcomer Heath Ledger) - and the inevitable sparks fly.I expected this to be just like She's All That and Drive Me Crazy, but this film is so cuddly, clever and cute that you can't help but have a blast watching it. The performances are great, Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger, both newcomers, have a marvellous on-screen chemistry and they have a promising future. All the characters are properly developed and the film paces itself brilliantly, therefore resulting as one of the better, more carefully worked out teen films of the year. There are faults, of course, the film is extremely predictable and some of the performers sometimes becoming annoying, but otherwise, this film is no less that a good, strong teen flick.Recommended for a bit of fun on a weeknight, mostly for teens, but larger audiences may also find this entertaining.I rate 10 Things I Hate About You 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

10 Things I Hate About You,"Knowing the unfortunate fate of Australian actor Heath Ledger (1979-2008), it now feels oddly nostalgic to view his breakout success movie 10 Things I Hate About You, even though I hadn't even seen it until just now. The story is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's famous play Taming of the Shrew set in a present day American high school: a new guy named Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) arrives in the school and instantly becomes attracted to a pretty girl named Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). Much to his chagrin, Bianca's overprotective father won't allow her to date any guy unless her hostile big sister Kat (Julia Stiles) also dates somebody. Together with his preppy friend Michael (David Krumholtz), Cameron devises a plan to get a handsome bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to persuade the smart and independent Kat into going out with him, so that Bianca would become available as well. However, Cameron is not the only guy after Bianca – a vain male model Joey (Andrew Keegan) is also keen on winning her heart.Even though high school comedies are a cliché-heavy type of cinema and 10 Things doesn't exactly strive to reform the genre, it manages to feel pretty fresh considering its old building blocks (referring to high school movie conventions, not Shakespeare's writing). The colourful fashion and brightly lit locations, such as the castle-like Stadium High School, bring pleasant echoes from the 1990s, a decade I remember fondly. The obligatory scene of showing the new guy around and pointing out the rivaling social cliques is pretty amusing too, even more so than in average school movies. One notable big scene involving Ledger performing ""Can't Take My Eyes off You"" while fleeing security officers also belongs among the highlights of the tale.Some energetic performances by the young cast help to maintain interest in the criss-crossing romances: I have always liked Julia Stiles' appearance that is somehow both strong and timid at the same time and she fits in the role of the sarcastic indie girl effortlessly. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Heath Ledger aren't given highly memorable roles, but they do what they can alright. This is why David Krumholtz frequently gets to steal the show as Cameron's talkative but socially awkward friend Michael, not to even mention Allison Janney's small role as Ms. Perky, the school's aptly-named guidance counselor and writer of erotic fiction.To recap, the story is not highly imaginative and the ending is pretty cheesy, but many individual scenes earlier in the movie are fairly entertaining. A very obvious comparison can be made to another Shakespeare-in-school movie She's the Man (2006) starring Amanda Bynes: both films succeed decently in what they do, even if they are nothing groundbreaking. Gah, why am I being so apologetic about liking the movie? In the end, I think it is alright and recommend it to fans of its kind.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film for movie night,"10 things I hate about you is a romance sprinkled with a little bit of humour that makes it a romantic comedy.This film is directed by Gil Junger and it's adapted from Shakespeare's world-known play ""The Taming of the Shew"".The main characters are the two sisters,Kat and Bianca.Unfortunately,for Bianca,her father's rules say that she can't date a boy,unless Kat does,but Kat isn't the type to date.Soon Kate meets by accident Patrick Verona and falls in love without thinking about it.The initial release was on March the 31st 1999,so you can find it on many websites nowadays. In my opinion this movie is great,except the clicheic parts.But that's not a major problem,because most people like this.For 1999,the actors acted incredible,so I consider it really worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good romantic teen-comedy,"This is one of the relatively few romantic comedies that are actually based on a good premise, and, as such, it's watchable for guys too. It's very funny, the humor is well-placed and perfectly timed. The romantic scenes aren't sappy or boring. The chemistry works out pretty well between the actors; you actually believe that these characters would get together, realistically. I read that it's based on Shakespeare's ""the taming of the shrew""; now, since I haven't read that, I can't comment on how good the movie is compared to it, but as far as I know, the basic idea and theme is the same, as is most of the plot, and, considering that, it's a very good modernization of the story. The plot is good and involving, you are interested in what happens to these characters. The acting is all good. The script is well-written, and allows for the characters to be in some very funny scenes. The humor is directed at teens, but it isn't crude or offending, except for a few scenes, and even then, it's not too bad. I found it interesting how the focus completely shifted, in the last part of the film... the lead characters became supporting ones, whilst ones that were supporting before are now leads. I leave answering the question of whether or not this is true to Shakespeare's original text(or at least in the general spirit of him) up to those who have read his work. A good comedy for teens to watch, probably good for teen couples too. I recommend this to most people who enjoy teen comedies. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm gonna make this short and sweet...,"... because there really isn't much to say about this movie. It's no masterpiece, and I don't think the makers intended it to be. But as a teen comedy, a contradictio in terminis if there ever was one, this one really works. No fart jokes, no abuse of animals, but instead an interesting story, great music and nice acting. Heath Ledger obviously stands out here and would go on to do bigger and better things (look out for his short but pivotal role in this years Monster's Ball). 10 Things kept me entertained for the duration of the movie and I was left sitting with a smile when the credits ran. And that's something that can't be said about every movie Hollywood churns out.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The last non-gross teen comedy,"What we have here is yet another highly enjoyable but predictable teen comedy about characters displaying realistic teenager qualities in rather outlandish circumstances. It's very very funny though, and even sweet in a way, and the plot would be fabulous if it hadn't been lifted from Shakespeare. As in all teen flicks there are characters everyone can relate to and sympathize with; I liked Daria-like Kat (Julia Stiles) particularly. A very good movie, not great, but very good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Coming of age story turned classic,"10 things I hate about you, directed by Gil Junger, is categorized as a coming of age/ romantic comedy film. I believe the Disney's interpretation of a romantic comedy written by Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah should be considered one of the classics when it comes to romantic comedy. One reason for my belief is because the writers pull elements from classic authors like Shakespeare, forbidden love to so close but so far its a direct spin off of the Romeo and Juliet storyline.
10 things I hate about you is a film centered around a boy named Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) how falls for a girl named Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), but their is a problem her father has very strict rules about dating. He says Bianca cannot date until her sister Kat (Julia Stiles) who is known as the moody, and angry starts dating. Trying to solve the problem Cameron gets the only guy in school with a reputation worse than Kat Patrick (Heath Ledger) to try and take her out.
10 things I hate about you did a fantastic job using tracking shots and low angle shots to capture every scene to its maximum potential. There is one scene in particular that sticks in my brain when I think of tracking and low angle shots. This scene takes place when Patrick is still trying to get the attention of our mysterious Kat. He attends a concert that she is at and you see the camera become his eyes as he moves from the back of the crowd to find Kat in the middle. Once he gets to kat the camera immediately changes to have a slightly lower angle on Kat even though Patrick is taller this really highlights the intensity of Kat's character and that even the toughest of guys still are intimidated around her.
On top of the excellent shooting techniques used in the film the acting does not feel like cookie cutter acting whatsoever. Julia Stiles who plays Kat does a tremendous job displaying a moody teen how really doesn't care what people think about her. Then you have Larisa Oleynik whos representation of a peppy highschool teen is so spot on. The best part is that since the two are so different when they have sense together the way the filmmakers used lighting and the colors in the clothing really helped sell this idea that they were so different from one another but yet so similar.
Like every good film there is always at least one element you would change. In my opinion I would change the soundtrack of the film. I don't believe the soundtrack adds anything to help the film, but in the same token I don't feel it was awful. I believe if the filmmakers had spent a little more time on the soundtrack it would have brought the film to a whole other level entirely.
I will always appreciate a feel good Romantic comedy but when you think of the classics, there are a few that always come to mind the 1989 film When Harry met Sally and 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle and now in my opinion 10 things I hate about you.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Shakespearean Ode to Teen Angst,"Oh, joy of joys, this teen rom-com is a modern-day adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, which, let's face it, is about as outdated as a '90s hairstyle. And by '90s, I mean 1590s. But hey, if you're going to modernize a classic, why not set it in a high school filled with the quirkiest characters you can find?We have Kat Stratford, played by Julia Stiles, the poster child for teenage rebellion and general disdain for all things remotely cheerful. Of course, she's a modern-day incarnation of the infamous Katherina, our supposed shrew, who's apparently determined to make life miserable for anyone who crosses her path. Enter Patrick Verona, portrayed by Heath Ledger. He's the bad boy with a heart of gold, the kind who can make even the most cynical soul swoon. His mission? To tame the shrew, of course. What's more romantic than attempting to change someone's entire personality for your own amusement?And let's not forget the other characters, each a walking stereotype. There's the doe-eyed, innocent Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), who's just dying to date but can't until her sister does. Apparently, dating in high school is a family affair. Then we have Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the new kid who's so desperate to win Bianca's heart that he resorts to paying Patrick to woo Kat. Ah, young love, fueled by manipulation and deception.But before you dismiss this movie, consider its undeniable charm. Its witty dialogue and clever one-liners keep you chuckling throughout. It's a veritable smorgasbord of adolescent clichés, served with a side of Shakespearean irony. Plus, Heath Ledger's rendition of Can't Take My Eyes Off You is like a ray of sunshine breaking through the storm clouds of teenage angst.In all seriousness, 10 Things I Hate About You is a surprisingly enjoyable journey into the absurd world of high school romance. It may be laden with stereotypes and melodrama, but it's also undeniably fun. It's a guilty pleasure that captures the essence of '90s high school rom-coms, for better or worse. So, if you're in the mood for a Shakespearean-inspired teenage love story that's both eye-rolling and endearing, this film might just be your cup of poison... I mean tea.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A very good movie,"Kat and Bianca are two very different sisters. Although both good looking, they are unable to get on a date, partly because of their very strict father, and partly because of Kat's attitude in relation to other people. Thus, when a playboy sets his mind on Bianca, he is inspired to pay someone to take her sister on a date, in order to take Bianca to the prom.Although simplistic as a main idea, this movie proves that you can make a really good movie with an apparently simple plot, without having some bombastic ideas. One leads to another and so, two separate love stories emerge, proving what the partners are willing to do to get the one he or she loves, without thinking about consequences.It's an enjoyable movie, romantic and sometimes emotional, even funny at times, which puts a smile on your face if you want it to. It isn't groundbreaking or anything, especially considering it's, above all, a teen movie, but it's a very good watch. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Comedy With Errors,"The second film, alphabetically on Sky Movies is 1999's ""10 Things I hate About You"" and adaptation of Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew"" set in present day (well... present day at the time) Seattle.Desperate to date Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is thwarted by her father's rule that Bianca can only date when her sister Katrina (Julie Styles) does. This seems unlikely as Katrina is forthright and opinionated to the point of alienating almost all her school. But Cameron hatches a plan, he encourages the schools rebel, Patrick (Heath Ledger) to approach Katrina, hoping that if successful, his path to Bianca has been cleared.Time has not been kind to ""10 Things"". One aspect of that is not in the least related to the film itself. The untimely passing of its leading man casts a shadow over watching any of this films. There's a melancholy to seeing him, knowing that this is one of the few movies he made. Away from that, the film has aged badly, the visuals for the opening credits look awful, musically (though there's the odd good song ) it is mostly terrible, even the film stock (of the version I saw) looked like it had seen better days.Which is not to say that the film is awful, the performances are nice and the script raises a smile from time to time, there's a definite wit to it. The story perhaps is less solid, there could have done with a few more story beats to convince me that there is actually something to the relationship between. . . well, actually either of the principle pairings. It also unravels pretty quickly if you start to apply any logic to the situation. The dad has a ""no dating until college"" rule in force when the film starts, why does he open up the loophole of dating when her sister does, what actually constitutes ""dating"" anyway. Bianca is alone with Cameron, away from school grounds on a couple of occasions.Whilst I appreciate that some people love this film, looking at it constructively, 20 years later (how old is J G-L anyway he looks the same!) it's a decent, if slight film with a couple of classic moments, but a few bizarre ones. Far from essential.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A film only a bop could love,"""10 Things..."" is a typical teen campus romantic comedy romp with the usual bunch of slightly older than teen stars, a thin plot (forget Shakespeare), and envelope pushing on sex innuendos required to separate the kids from the price of admission.

all the characters were being too extra,"Almost all the characters were somewhat cartoonish, I mean they were overreacting all the time. They were being extra.Especially the african american teacher, imagine trying to remember the characters of this movie days later. You will only remember the race of this character because that's what he only talked about. Rapping about literature, calling Shakespeare a ""dead white man"" and saying ""he had a point there, even though he's white"". This is inappropriate on many levels. I know they wanted to do stereotype comedy, but it's just not funny and very exxegerated.Kat was an irritating character for sure but that ""no boys want to date kat because she is a smartass"" thing was also too unrealistic. She seemed ready to socialize after a slight interaction.I'm not quite sure if she wanted to attract attention by talking too loud about literature and whatnot because no one else in the class seemed interested or informed on the context, including the teacher. All i see was a girl arguing with herself very loudy.Heath Ledger was quite lovely in this movie, he was pretty much the only reason I could endure to this cliche teen movie.

"+[68/100] - ""That's what I loved about the film, it strikes a balance amidst drama and romance perfectly"" - The Indian Novelor Review","20th - 22nd December 2021,
Disney + Hotstar.As an avid movie watcher, I have been exposed to several high school drama films. Some are musicals. Some are obnoxious. Some are conservative and some are philosophical.But we can round up that most of the teen dramas are raunchy and kinda overbearing to watch. This film is not one of them. It is also not one of those frivolous films which makes you question the logic and reason behind the making.10 Things I hate about you stands in between - it is perfectly balanced. It has its grossest moments and it has its cutest moments. Anyone who has really been to high school can feel that.The story is not about your usual triangular love tragedy or the exaggerated/disgusting dramedy. It is about two sisters. One is popular and another one is uptight. Their conservative dad nails the condition that either both of them should date or they should not.This puts the boys who woo over the popular girl in a tricky position. What happens when they hire a fellow student to woo the uptight sister so that they can go prom with the popular sister forms the rest of the story.So see, the stakes are high for a high school drama. And there is competition. Money is involved. Everything to make the screenplay more compelling. That's what I loved about the film, it strikes a balance amidst drama and romance perfectly.With love,

It's also stereotypical of teenagers in a shallow way. a To be honest the only reason I decided to check this movie out was because of Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, because I like these actors and was difficult to pass on it. It's basically a wacky and silly romantic comedy and yet lively and enjoyable movie for the most part. The movie however starts off pretty good but after about a hour it starts to get a bit dull and too generic.

Nothing to hate here.,"There's nothing to hate about '10 Things I Hate About You (1999)', a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of The Shrew'; it's about as good a high-school rom-com as I've ever seen. There's a lot more going on here than you may expect and the piece holds up pretty well despite some of its more nineties elements (including a central concept that's a bit iffy). Though it's predictable, it's a really enjoyable experience. The cast are all likeable and share a palpable chemistry, their characters never quite conforming to the stereotypes typically associated with them. The various relationships that underpin the plot are believable and satisfying, with the flick's overall message being surprisingly good. It's also somewhat ahead of its time in the way in which it breaks down certain tropes; it's ultimately rather feminist. It's a fun, chuckle-worthy and easy-to-watch affair throughout. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A  predictable romantic comedy,"""10 things I hate about you"" is a modern adaptation of Shakespeare's play ""The Taming of the Shrew"". The movie takes place in Seattle and it follows the story of two sisters who have different mindsets and desires. Their dad is overprotective and, as a result, the girls can't date until they graduate. Then, one day, he decides that if the older sister Kat is going to date someone, Blanca will be allowed as well. As Bianca tries to convince her older sister to change her mind, in the whole picture appears Joey, a bad guy who wants to have all the girls in the high school. Cameron, the new boy, falls in love with Bianca and sees beyond the surface. He sees the real Bianca. Also, he has a plan and Patrick has a huge role in it. But will their lies destroy everything?

"Funny, clever update of Shakespeare classic","""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a funny, clever update of the Shakespeare classic, ""The Taming of the Shrew."" The premise for the story is much the same -- in the original, Bianca Minola could not marry until her older sister Katharine was wed -- in the new movie, Bianca Stratford cannot date until her older sister Kat does. Petruchio, now renamed ""Patrick Verona,"" is paid by one of Bianca's suitors and thus neatly sidesteps the whole dowry issue. The jokes are funny, and the situation is just ludicrous enough to be entertaining without insulting the audience's intelligence. This is the ""Clueless"" makeover (""Clueless"" was an update of Jane Austen's ""Emma""), and it works quite well.The one performance that never quite rings true is Andrew Keegan's as Joey, presumably the Hortensio role. He seems somehow too uncomfortable with the material to really sell it, and I have a hard time believing that this person was ever that popular. Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik, as the Stratford sisters, are both excellent. Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, in the Lucentio role (Cameron), is the best of the ensemble as he makes his play for Bianca. He is a fine actor, especially for one so young. It probably doesn't hurt that he's had some of the most experience of the young cast, starring in the hit sitcom ""Third Rock From the Sun."" David Krumholtz (""The Slums of Beverly Hills""), as Cameron's friend Michael, also turns in a funny, convincing performance.The one quibble I had with the picture was a mainly regional one: I live in Tacoma, Washington, where most of the picture was filmed; our town's historic Stadium High School was transformed into Padua High for the purposes of the screenplay. However, I was offended by the supposed premise that this picture takes place in Seattle. Shots of the Space Needle and Gasworks Park are clearly visible, side by side with shots of downtown Tacoma and ... Stadium High, one of the city's most famous landmarks. The view from the Stratford house is also plainly Commencement Bay (my own house is less than a mile away), and I question how the filmmakers could decide to be so blatantly ambiguous. Pick a city, folks.Apart from that, the movie was delightful enough, and a terrific date movie. Prepare yourself to laugh your sphincters off.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good movie,"Sometimes I think my age is a hinderance when it comes to enjoying films aimed at people that are about 10 years younger than me.  And then I think that maybe it isn't my age but my memories of films that I grew up liking. And if I have to be honest about the films that I enjoyed, I remember older people thinking the same things that I think of most teen films today: they are good  but nothing great.  I remember films like Fast Times and Mischief and Secret Admirer and Porky's.  They were funny and they looked at high school with a more sexual themed story.  And maybe that is what is missing in films today.  I'm not saying that T&A makes a movie better, but it sure makes it more realistic and funny.  Because when it comes down to it, high school is a time when most people find out how amazing sex is.  It is the first time they start to discover their bodies and it is the first time they actually make a concerted effort to get laid.  That is what made films from the early 80's entertaining and it is the lack of that edge that makes movies like this one and every other film that comes out ( except American Pie, that is a true 80's film and it may as well have been directed by Bob Clark and produced by Amy Heckerling )in the late 90's a little disappointing.This is a good movie, but it is hollow.  I don't remember this as being all that high school was about.  This certainly has elements of high school, but it is missing something.  I do recommend this film because it is good, so much better than Never Been Kissed, but if you are in your late 20's and yearn for silly films like Fraternity Vacation and Wild Life ( have a maple bob brotha, they're fresh ), then you will be disappointed.  But if you are under the age of 20 and have no idea who Jeff Spicolli is, then this is your cup of tea.  I am unfortunately in the former group.  So I will say treat yourself and go see American Pie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
10 Things I Hate About You — Fun teen romance with interesting plot ideas,"10 Things I Hate About You is a teen movie with some nice spunk. It is set in a language that most adolescents will associate with. The themes correspond to that group age and are not dealt with in an adult manner, tone, or perspective. Neither are they rendered in a puerile or slapstick way. Overall, it's an excellent balancing act.The characters are interesting and well portrayed. The story captivating, the dialogs believable, the romances sweet and simple. The laughs are aplenty and well orchestrated. The music is well chosen, energetic, and youthful. Finally, the sets and wardrobe are realistic and colorful.It is an easy watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sophomoric sex shoots down Shakespeare,"Likeable characters, a plot with hundreds of successful years behind it, some really charming interaction between the characters and the energy of new attractive leads all comes to a screaming halt for decidedly unfunny sex jokes.  When sex is mentioned, the confidence and wit that propel much of the movie disappears.  There's rarely a joke about sex, mostly there's just a mention of it as if it was the punchline.  Too bad, they squander engaging performances by both leads and several of the characters.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
I was pleasantly surprised!,"I went to see this movie because it had quite a few good actors in it.  I loved the plot and the way both Patrick and Kat changed, proving that maybe they weren't what everyone thought they were.  I loved the scene when Patrick sang that song for Kat on the bleachers, probably my second favorite scene.  My favorite scene is when Kat read her poem to Patrick, hence the name of the movie.  A very good movie, not just a teenie movie with teenie actors.  I wonder if I could get my English teacher to let us all see it?",,Anonymous,Romance
Not Shakespeare but it had its moments,"There's a ""shrew"" and she's tamed. Actually, she's not all that tamed so I don't see how it's based, albeit loosely, on ""Taming of the Shrew"". Well, Taming of the Shrew tended to be a lot patriarchal anyway so it was welcome to see Bianca punch out Joey and Kat paving her own way as herself.I don't think I've seen a teen flick since ""Clueless"" so this was out of the league of movies I usually see (it was in a movie marathon, ok?). My verdict - you could generally see what was going to happen but the difference with this movie was that it was hard to guess how it would happen. It had its amusing moments, its 'heroes' and 'villains' and the obligatory prom and love and all that teeny stuff you get enough of on TV. Not bad, probably better than what some others would have done with ""Shakespeare"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cute for GenX-ers;Heath Ledger a big hit.,"Saw the film this weekend; soundtrack a bit obnoxious to my nearly-40-year-old ears, but otherwise, it's a cute movie.  Obviously geared toward a young audience, especially those who aren't familiar with this formulaic plot.  Heath Ledger got squeals from all the young girls in the theatre--every time he grinned, they went nuts.  Reminded me of Beatle-mania!  I'd recommend this film highly for young people, or those who don't feel like thinking too hard.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Personal opinion of 10 Things I hate about you,This was a really good romance film. This wasn't a typical teen flick but rather different. The actors put in a great performance and you could really sense how the characters felt. I think the portrayal of certain characters relates to family life and the expectations other people have because of individual style and personal differences. This film has a humorous and romantic tone to it and a very light atmosphere. I think all the actors enjoyed working on the set of this film. This film really portrayed that attitude and lifestyle of teenagers in America in the late 90's. I'd really want to have a friend like heath ledgers character. A film i would have loved to watch at the cinemas.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, Intelligent and Entertaining","This is definitely the best of the recent wave of teenage movies.  Julia Stiles is so talented, Heath Ledger is charming, and Larisa Oleynik and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are more than adequate, and most importantly, really cute.  I don't know that it gives a very accurate picture of the average high-school, but who wants to watch that anyways? I think the scene where Ledger does the ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"" is a classic in the making. This movie isn't Oscar material or anything like that, but it's a fun film that you can watch without feeling that your intelligence is being insulted.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly upbeat,"I was very impressed with this movie, for once the writers addressed an ACTUAL teenage issue.  I'm 24 years old, however, remembering my high school years, and having a sister whom is a senior in school this year I could relate to the characters.  The acting was well done in my opinion and ""believable"" unlike a lot of ""teenage"" movies of the 90's.  It was nice to see an actual ""reason"" behind the whole idea of the movie, i.e. showing teenagers they don't have to be like everyone else or do what their friends expect them to do, and not to judge a book by it's cover and get to know the real person inside!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Charming Bunch of Characters,"Teen flicks are a drug.  I've come to realize that when I go to see a movie like ""She's All That"" or ""10 Things"", it's not because I think the story will be particularly interesting, or even because the leading actresses are gorgeous (though they are), it's because I know that I'll leave the theater feeling giddy and charmed.  ""10 Things"" and ""She's All That"" are extremely similar premises:  money is offered to turn the female school outcast normal, only to have the boy and girl fall in love.  The twists are few and the ending predictable, and yet I find myself interested in these characters and the high school environment that they live in.  ""10 Things"" has its humorous bits and its touching moments, but mostly it's just enjoyable to watch these surprisingly talented high school actors interact.  It may miss by throwing in a few to many trite teen-flick scenes--a school-wide party, a climactic prom scene--but the characters are warm enough to make us care. Not only did I leave the theater wishing I were a student at the school, I also had a curious smile plastered on my face for the rest of the night.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Good, but teen movies need to find other creative outlets","This adaption of Shakespeare's play could have been completely charming , if only it wasn't so sex related. Everything seems to revolve around sex in these often obvious teen flicks. Sex and its counterparts has become too easy to manipulate on the big screen.  Everywhere you go sex is screamed at my young generation. It's easier to follow everyone else and write a rude and crude movie.

"If you've not seen it yet, go...","I adore this movie. I've seen it about 10 times, and I'm sure I'll be watching it again! It's cute, it's funny, it's smart and definitely enjoyable. The first time I saw this movie I was 23, and even though I was skeptical (another one of those boring and predictable teen flicks?), I was blown away. The actors are all great - even the guy who portrays Joey, the underwear model, is somehow cute. I mean, he's kind of the ""bad guy"" of the movie, but I like him anyway, he's just funny. The best character was Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) in my opinion, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) a close second. Julia got to show a whole lot of emotions onscreen, and she's bloody good! I hadn't seen Heath Ledger in any movie before 10 things, and I have to admit I developed a soft spot for him afterwards. But hey, I'm just a girl! Anyway, a very enjoyable film.

Stiles and Ledger Carry a Cute Romantic Comedy,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" is not as cleverly written as ""Clueless"" in modernizing a classic.But leads Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger (he of TV's ""Roar"" on Fox a couple of years ago) have wonderful chemistry that carries the movie (and into the out takes over the credits). They are that good that the movie's worth seeing as sheer romantic fun even when ""Taming of the Shrew"" is dropped half-way through for a more conventional teen movie.Finding this amazing high school in Tacoma cost them $1 million extra than shooting in L.A. but was really worth it. It's hard to believe such a school exists.One knows that this will just be a summer romance - I sort of see this as a prequel to John Sayles' ""Baby It's You.""It makes good use of the subtleties of music battles in high school. This was the second movie I saw in a week where a guy woos a girl by pretending to be into grrrl rock (""Mad Love"" was the other, on cable). Letters to Cleo are (is?) featured prominently.(originally written 4/11/1999)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very entertaining,"As usual when it comes to teen comedies I didn't expect much, so I was pleasantly surprised when ""10 Things I Hate About You"" turned out to be a very entertaining, funny and genuinely likeable film. All the characters are interesting, although some of them seem to be the typical teen comedy archetypes, and the actors' performances were overall great. I'm thinking about Julia Stiles and Heath Sedge in particular. And you have to see the end credits as there are some really funny out takes there in which we see the cast do the wrong things and start to laugh et cetera.So, ""10 things"" is a really good teen comedy and I recommend it to anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It Does What It's Trying to Do as a Rom-Com FLAWLESSLY,"Overall, this is a highly regarded movie by both critics and audiences (as it should be), yet there are a few people who gave it a negative review on here. Some of them are Mormons who legitimately thought this was too vulgar for a PG-13 movie, which I find extremely laughable. But the biggest reason for people not liking it seems to be that they only like extremely deep and pretentious movies, which basically no rom-com lives up to. And I'm not going to sit here and claim that it is deep and philosophical and really makes you think, because it's not any of those things, but that's perfectly okay!This is a romantic comedy that tries to be a romantic comedy, and accomplishes everything a rom-com should with perfection. It's hilarious, heartwarming, VERY charming, and satisfying because everything works. Some people say the acting is terrible, but they must have lost their minds. Heath Ledger is an Oscar winner, Joseph Gordon Levitt has been nominated for awards, Julia Stiles is terrific, and rounding out the cast with people like Allison Janney and David Krumholtz is a delight.A lot of movies try to be modern takes on classics, but usually fail miserably and insult the source material. As an English major and teacher who loves Shakespeare, I can say confidently that this movie did justice to The Taming of the Shrew as well as a movie of this genre could. In no way was it ever cringy. It felt authentic the whole way through. And there is nothing wrong with subtle nods with the character names. In fact, I appreciate them using names like Verona and Stratford.Another thing a lot of movies try and fail at is the now extremely trite trope of ""someone dates someone for a bet or money or whatever but ends up falling in love."" The reason most movies fail at this is that it often feels forced and inorganic. Take She's All That for example; sure, Freddy Prinze is a nice guy deep down, and Rachael Leigh Cook can teach him a lot and they can maybe be friends. But they don't have any deep moments and have nothing in common. It felt like they got together because it turned out that she's hot more than anything else. That isn't the case with 10 Things. All three hook ups fit and feel right. Patrick and Kat are obviously perfect for each other. Same with Krumholtz and the Shakeapeare girl. And although they don't spend enough time on it, Cameron and Bianca fit. Bianca thought that she liked being popular and getting vain attention, but she realized (by meeting Cameron) that the attention she was getting was shallow and meaningless. Guys only saw her as hot meat. Cameron gave her GENUINE attention and helped her realize what she really wanted in a partner. Everything just feels right. Kat's poem in the end was perfect.Also, the soundtrack is amazing. And for the people who complain and say no school is like this: this movie was filmed at a real high school in Seattle, so I guess some schools are like this one.Again, this is not a deep movie, but a movie doesn't have to be deep to be perfect. This movie is so funny, romantic, and most importantly, it is authentic all throughout. SO well written and well acted, and honestly it is the perfect rom-com.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
10 things I hated about this movie,"1. The pathetic, one-dimensional characters, with the exceptions of Bianca, Patrick, and Kat.2. That the ""10 things"" sonnet at the end of the movie really had about 14 things.3. That either Kat's transitions were edited out or she spontaneously bounced from bitch to lovable and back again, giving no reasons at all.4. That Cameron and Bianca looked too young for high school while Patrick, Kat, the nerdy guy, and the model looked old enough for college.5. That the school band, consisting of maybe two dozen total members, practiced on the same field as every other athletic team in school AT THE SAME TIME.6. That they never identified the band ""letters to cleo"".  I'm sorry, they're not popular enough to recognize by SOUND, much less by sight.7. That Bianca's prom dress was inspired by ""I Dream of Jeannie""  meeting Clueless.8. That there was an entire relationship developed with the Shakespearean angle, with the nerd and Kat's friend, for no reason and with no logic.9. That this much sexual content and foul language was allowed in a PG-13 movie, AND10. That I really didn't completely hate this movie. While it didn't even have the low level of charm that Shakespeare's original dull play had, the actors were cute and the jokes occasionally funny. Very few of the characters matched their analogues in Taming of the Shrew, but for this movie it didn't matter.  While I feel that I wasted my time seeing this, I'm voting it a 4, very high for a movie I didn't even like.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great fun,"It's not your stereotypical teen movie, this ones different. The jokes are actually funny, the actors can actually act, and there is a point to the plot.

Much better than it should be,"With one of the best titles in recent memory, this little movie is much better than it should be.

Tries way too hard,"In the past year or so there have been a number of 'teen films' loosely based on concepts of classic stories and books. 10 Things I hate About You is probably the worst one I have seen so far. From the onset it tries far too hard to be cool, to have a look and feel that will appeal to the teen masses. The only probably is it really slams you in the face with its brutal approach to teen love, rather than taking the sweet route ( She's all that) or the sexy road ( Cruel Intentions), it just tries to exist by shoving the principal story line down peoples throats. The acting is atrocious, although its hard to determine whether thats the fault of the actors or the one dimensional stereotypical characters that they have been forced to play. There are a couple of scenes that are not too bad, but most of the time the viewer is left cringing at the antics of the immature and irresponsible teens and parents on show. The main problem with this film is it has absolutely no point to it, its not even entertaining. A total waste of time and money.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

After hating this movie immensely, I thought I'd try reading the Shakespeare version and compare the two. Shakespeare beat the movie by 100% and I didn't even like the Shakespeare story!

"Rare ""teen"" movie worth watching","""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a rarity in the genre of ""teen"" movies. The teens are for the most part smart, and the film is not non-stop drug and sex obsession. In fact, that's hardly a part of the plot at all. I did find the glorifying of the ""Let's Party 'Till We Puke - that's what parties are for!"" attitude unfortunate and disappointing, because the characters were otherwise very intelligent and mostly independent thinkers. But, that, too, was only a small part of the whole.This movie is intelligently written and acted and does not rely on the tired clichés that ARE nearly all other teen movies.

The best Shakespeare adaptation,"Being a '90s kid, I was brought up watching the modern Shakespeare movies before I learned the original stories. It certainly helped when I was called upon to study the difficult texts in drama class, let me tell you. I'd seen 10 Things I Hate About You, O, and She's the Man a dozen times each before I'd been forced to read The Taming of the Shrew, Othello, or As You Like It.It's very hard to pick a favorite, but if I must, the award goes to 10 Things. It's so fantastically clever and inventive, and it's so hilarious, I split my sides every time I've watched it the past twenty years. Larry Miller steals the show, playing the girls' protective father. Every line out of his mouth is hilarious and true. His character is an obstetrician who constantly sees the mistakes young girls make with their wild behavior, so he keeps his daughters close to home. ""What are the two house rules? One: No dating 'til you graduate. Two: No dating 'til you graduate."" His older daughter, Julia Stiles (playing Katarina), doesn't mind because she has no interest in immature, hormone-driven boys. His younger daughter, Larisa Oleynik (playing Bianca), can't stand the rule. She's popular and enjoys flirting, so when the new rule is lifted and replaced by another she's thrilled. The only catch is her sister has to date before she does. In Shakespeare's world, Katharina has to get married before Bianca can accept a proposal from her many admirers, so the young boys decide to pay a daring guy to pursue ""the shrew"". In this version, Heath Ledger is the paid suitor, the bad boy on campus with a reputation for the ridiculous, like spending the past year in prison and selling his own liver on the black market.Filmed at the beautiful Stadium High School in Seattle, this Nineties teen flick would be great in its own right, but all the large and small tie-ins with Shakespeare make it one of the best movies from the time period. Direct quotes like ""I burn, I pine, I perish!"" are included, and Julia's best friend, Susan May Pratt is ""involved"" with Shakespeare and hangs his portrait in her locker.Instead of the mother's death, she abandoned her family years ago, which adds to Larry's motivation to keep his daughters close. In a class assignment from Daryl Mitchell, the students have to write a sonnet in iambic pentameter. Even the family names are Stratford and Verona, and the school is called Padua High. Down to the last detail, this movie will help even the most ignorant of Shakespeare students remember tidbits of the original play. Believe me.Julia and Heath have that perfect ""grunge"" of the turn of the century, and Larisa and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have the sweet innocence that make a perfect foil and help inspire love and hope where cynicism previously lived. Alison Janney is the school counselor, and while she has a realistic disinterest in children, she shocks everyone by letting her attitude hang out. She flips off students, tells kids to get out of her office, and even lets Julia know that her peers call her a ""heinous b***h"". Gabrielle Union starred in her own Taming of the Shrew film two years later (Deliver Us Unto Eva) but in this one she plays Bianca's friend. To prove they talk about deep issues, they discuss the difference between like and love. Bianca likes her Skechers but loves her Prada backpack. ""But I love my Skechers,"" Gabrielle insists. Larisa's insightful reply: ""That's because you don't have a Prada backpack.""David Krumholtz is Joey's friend and wingman, and he has the important job of steering the plot. He shows Joey around school on his first day and introduces all the characters, dubbing Julia ""the shrew"", and suggests they hire Heath so Joey can date Larisa. But Larry Miller really steals the show. He happily keeps his daughters under lock and key while he can so he can enjoy ""the deep slumber of a father whose daughters aren't out being impregnated."" When they finally go to their first party, he lists off all the outrageous activities he doesn't want them to do. Gabrielle tries to calm him down, insisting it's just a party. ""And hell is just a sauna,"" he replies. I could quote the whole movie, but I've seen it a million times. If you can't quote the whole movie, it's time you saw it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Easily The Worst Of It's Kind,"I am putting this into the category of Say Anything. That was a popular movie like this, which confounds me almost beyond words. I think they're both atrocious, because the characters don't fit their intended roles one bit. A father who acts in the worst way, not funny or believable at all. Teenagers portrayed so wildly inaccurately that it's an insult to anyone who is or was a teenager. But where Say Anything had a plot somewhat credible, this one doesn't even start with a promising premise. It's so incredible AWFUL I had to watch it just to see how low it could sink. Even the peripheral characters were so annoyingly nauseating, such as David Leasure as a mindless teacher and Daryl Mitchell as a stereotypical black radical who insults his students repeatedly. He reeked. Disgusting role played poorly. Larry Miller as the father just cannot be tolerated as his speeches and rules are so far beyond the realm of believability. Eye rolling fast forward type stuff. But the worst of all are the people we see the most. Julia Stiles is just a whining snotty unlikeable girl, and considering she's supposed to be edge and scary she's stuck up and arrogant. Doesn't fit. Flashing a teacher? Yeah, that could happen and she could get away with it. That sort of stupidity permeates this movie. She gets upset that Heath Ledger won't kiss her, but who would?! She puked just a little while before that. Plus he's not believable or likeable either, being a self assured smug fool. No chemistry at all between those two, who are as wooden as can be and just go through the motions. All interactions beween them are dull beyond description. It's not only predictable, but so horrendously acted and scripted. A completely nonsensical side romance where a totally gorgeous girl falls for a loser because he quotes Shakespeare? A 180 degree flip flop in one second. And the daughter calling her idiot Dad ""Daddy"" is cringe as well. Nothing worked in this at all it was so flat and dense. And I'm not even to Joseph Gordon-Levitt yet, who was another complete toolbag who falls for the sister, who apparently is selfish and nasty but he can't resist? But at least she's gorgeous and is actually the only thing in the film worth looking at. Mmmkaayy.....didn't anyone who wrote this pay any attention to a coherent storyline. The sisters didn't get along and of course eventually bond in one of dozens of sappy and overacted scenes. Even the music stunk. That wailing girl caterwauling during prom really destroyed the mood. I muted it. And when there was a good song playing, it wasn't the original it was some horrible remake. Gag! The Andrew Keegan character was probably the worst as a rich inspiring actor who has no way how to treat women but they seem to find him irresistable? Big disconnect. His insipid overacting was matched almost to the same extent as David Krumholtz's character. Women are actually treated disrespectfully throughout. The younger sister's ""friend"" tries to steal the boy she's intersted in, then at prom reveals the secret of the deal that started this whole fiasco. It's all just so much silly garbage with nobody acting or talking in any believable way. I can't believe I wasted this much time reviewing this trash. It's so sad seeing these somewhat talented actors and actresses clumsily going through the motions of this disaster. Nobody deserved happiness here. All these cliches and bad acting shouldn't be rewarded with any sort of praise. Sappy drivel and nothing more. Bad beyond bad. I can't stress how lousy the acting was, but I blame the director and writers. Just another feeble attempt at non-talented people trying to capture the magic of more competent film makers. They followed the formula but execution was lacking in every regard. Add the worst possible ending and there you have it. When someone receives a gift and says, ""Is this for me?"" you know the kind of attention was given to dialogue. It's not a case of needing to edit out the worst parts, because even if they did that there wouldn't have been 2 minutes of material left over to use.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

He falls in love very quickly of one girl, Bianca, but not just any girl. THE GIRL that all the boys want. Cameron does a plan to go out with this girl and the first thing to do: the old sister, Kat, must have an appointment with a boy because it is the rule imposed by the father.10 things I hate about you is one of my favorite movies. I'm a fan of this movie first of all thanks to the actors. We find in this film Heath Legder (in my opinion, best actor in the world), Joseph Gordon Levitt. Today, they have become key people for my part in the cinema. I do not count even any more the number of times i saw this.The characters are engaging.

Even better than She's All That.,"I really loved this movie.  Considering all of the teenage movies that have come out lately, mostly all romances, and a few of them Shakespeare remakes, this one is extraordinary.  I may only be in high school, but I think I would have appreciated it even as an adult.  The actors were really good, and when they cried, I cried too.  This is one of those movies, where you walk out of the theater and try to plan who you can go see it with the next night.  :)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good movie but very definitely an R.  The PG13 is a truly inept rating.,This is not a PG13 movie to see with you children unless you are a particularly emancipated adult.  How in the world this ever got less than an R is utterly beyond me.  Matrix got an R and this gets PG13?  Gimme a break! This was a terribly embarrassing movie to see with my 12 and 15 year old daughters.  I expected a PG13 adaptation of Shakespeare.  I got a nearly NC17.  As an R movie I would have liked it but I'd have left the girls at home.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance

True love beats all odds.,"This is not your regular Dawson´s Creek Guide line. It's a more realistic story that happens to everybody. Making an adaptation of Shakespeare makes it even better. The basic boy likes girl but girl likes other boy is the common line for movies but as always the tend to bend it a bit. The whole story is based on normal stuff (with an occasional exaggeration) teen problems.The overall acting was really great, making it believable.

Formulaic older than teen high school movie...,"1st watched 8/14/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir- Gil Junger): Formulaic older than teen high school movie that had very little going for it except for the music sounded good on surround sound. The talent was wasted with this piece of TV-like fluff. Julia Stiles & Heath Ledger have a lot of talent but apparently not very good agents to allow them to be in this. This is basically about two sisters who are very different and want to date boys but daddy won't let them unless they both do it together. Soooooo, basically they work it out so that they both live happily ever after by the end in their high school heaven. And the title doesn't work at all for this movie because this isn't about chicks putting down guys, but this was a poem brought up near the very end of the movie that the Stiles character didn't even believe. Nuff said, please avoid this loser.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

I loved the way the plot progressed, just enough depth to the characters for the audience to get sympathetic, great acting by Julia Stiles, believable mistakes and consequences. All in all, how love makes one soften and get vulnerable even though you try to put a shell around yourself. It's laced with just enough fun moments where you can get reminded of your own teenage years. Although it is an old movie, I did not have chance to watch this in its time.

Worth Owning,"I'm a sucker for romantic comedies, and especially teen ones. However, my tolerance of them is usually limited to just enjoying them because even the best aren't that good. This is the exception. 10 Things I Hate About You is not only a brilliant re-take on Shakespeare's Taming Of The Shrew, but also just a good stand-alone movie. The few clichés they use are handled well (besides, it wouldn't be a romantic comedy if there weren't a few). The characters and motivations are believable, and the frequent comic relief scenes are put to good use (it's a Shakespearian Device, after all). It's cute, it's sweet, and Surprise! Hot actors and actresses abound! If there's only one Teen Romantic Comedy to see, this is the one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Above Average Romantic Film,"This heart throb of a film captures all the emotions of a perfect romance: anger, affection, joy, and sadness. 10 Things I Hate About You is not just like your typical romance movie, it captures the emotions perfectly of a high school romance, but still has elements related to Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew which is the basis of the movie. Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca Stratford (Laria Oleynik) live with their father who has strict rules for the sisters to follow since the mother abandoned the family, and when Bianca wants to start dating Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), her father quickly makes a new rule that she cannot start dating until Kat does. This seems like a simple task for most high school girls, but Kat is not your ""typical"" girl as she is introverted, independent, and feisty which many of her peers have described her as scary because she is not afraid to put you in your place. Kat winning the title of ""heinous b*tch"" among her high school peers. Cameron James and Bianca work their magic together and try to find a man who matches the personality of Kat, where they no sooner try to convince Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to be apart of the deal. Patrick is known as the ""bad boy"" who is a smoker, bad influence, and tough which is perfect to stand a chance with Kat. Patrick agrees to the deal after some negotiation and payment, but Kat refuses his advances multiple times before she finally accepts. Patrick tried many ways to win her such as talking to her at parties and even getting the high school band to do a performance with him during Kat's soccer game. This is one of the most iconic roles Heath Ledger plays next to The Dark Knight where he plays the Joker. The characters in this movie are all so unique and encompass the perfect personalities of high schoolers in the 90s. Even though the ""rom com"" genre is one of my personal favorites, I enjoy this movie for the plot and because of the actors that went farther than just acting, they provided energy and laughter to the screen making the film stick out in my eyes. This is a movie that I can replay repeatedly and find new details that I did not notice prior and still enjoy watching because it does not get boring. I think many other people besides me also enjoy watching this film because all the characters are not your typical romance characters, where the most popular girl and guy fall in love and are high school sweethearts. 10 Things I Hate About You's main characters are all so different Patrick is the ""bad boy with a bad attitude nobody messes with"", Bianca is the ""pretty, flirtatious girl"", and Kat is the ""hard to get with and the tough cookie"". I like how the actors did not take the typical route by making Bianca the main actor because she is the young and attractive sister as many described her as, they wanted to show the minority which puts a fresh perspective on the movie, drawing a more diverse crowd of people who understand Kat. Even though I was not even born when this film was created in 1999, it feels like I am in the 90s when watching because the little details with the cars they drive, the slang they use, and their attire fit perfectly with time and make me feel like I grew up then. I have watched this movie plenty of times with my mother and she says the exact same thing, that this is a realistic 90s dream movie! If I had to pull one disadvantage from this film, it would be that they had more connections to Shakespeare's The Taming the Shrew, because if you were not a big fan of Shakespeare's romantic stories you would not notice the subtle hints dropped throughout the movie, connecting the loose resemblance. Some Shakespeare mentions made were the last name of Bianca and Kat being Stratford, named after his hometown Stratford-upon-Avon, and the high school Padua, is named after the city in Italy where Shakespeare based stories. It took me a few times of watching the film to recognize the cues, and I probably would of never recognized them if I did not learn about Shakespeare in high school. I would give this film a 10/10 rating after every time I watch this film because it is one of my ""comfort films"" that always provides entertainment not only with the witty comments throughout but the coming-of-age characteristics that make the young generations like me relate to. In general, I would recommend this film to a large variety of audiences, especially those who grew up in the 90s, or younger generations since both populations have a stronger relation to the movie. Most people generalize that romance movies are for girls only, but I feel that 10 Things I Hate About You can be for any gender because it shows the hardships everyone not only Kat faces in the film such as the dad, the sisters, Patrick, and even many of the supporting actors. Many others have considered this film to be very predictable, especially in the third act of the movie, which I might agree with but in this genre many of the films are predictable, which is commonly known before watching. Overall, I think this is a very low-key film that is a nice break from the more serious genres of movies such as documentaries, horror, or science fiction and can be played without giving much though or attention to and you still would understand the main concept of the movie. I would put 10 Things I Hate About You above the other films commonly mentioned in the romance genre because of how engulfed in the storyline you become. I would rate this film 10/10 every time I watch it, and will continue to watch it for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I ""Hate"" this tripe","""10 Things I Hate About You""""Disturbing Behavior"" director David Nutter complained loudly that his film was taken away from him and cut to shreds. MGM executives said that to appeal to the teen market the film had to be short and no shot should last more than 4 seconds. ""10 Things"" seems to come from this school of thinking. It's a miscalculated film that feels like it was trimmed quite a bit. Certain scenes are very slapdash, and the whole film seems to edited to make the littlest possible effect on the viewer. I was also not duped into finding it clever just because it's source material is Shakespeare. That's an idea that needs to go away for about 20 years. The reason it worked in ""Clueless"" is because Amy Heckerling in a vastly talented director, not because of the gimmick.Leads Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger seem to be appropriately talented actors. They have a nice chemistry in this movie, and the best scenes are of when the two just stay still and talk. The rest of the actors are just a bore. Larry Miller plays his millionth role as himself, and it's still not funny. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is introduced as one of the main characters of the film, but without explanation is pushed aside, becoming a supporting player by movie's end. David Krumholtz showed a comedic spark in last year's ""Slums Of Beverly Hills"", but saddled in this with lame sight gags, he cannot make an effect. The rest of the cast is predictably a Hollywood version of High School students.Director Gil Junger comes from a extensive TV background. You don't really need to have that information to see that ""10 Things"" is really just a glorified episode of ""Saved By The Bell"". Packed to the brim with a shockingly schizophrenic soundtrack that blasts a new tune every 30 seconds, this is another case of shameless self-promotion. I detested a lot of this movie. And I wished that it could have been more. But what I question the most is why this film is praised by some critics. I'm not opposed to having fun at the movies, but when it panders to the lowest common denominator, then I ask ""wassup wit dat?""------------ 1",,Anonymous,Romance
Chemistry is not working,"Though I really love teenage high school comedy, this film just didn't work for me. The characters seemed two-dimensional and often acted totally without any motivation, without any heart. Julia Stiles does not work with Heath Ledger, and the Baywatch boy certainly did not work at all as junior casanova. Some of the actors seemed too young, some too old, and the plot was often so cheesy that it was not only hard to swallow, but also hard to bear.So all in all, we watched three teenage movies that evening and this one was the worst. Unlike American Pie, Mallrats, Road Trip or Ferris Bueller, there is just no good chemistry going in this one. Forget it and get one of the genres jewels mentioned above.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Writing tries to be edgy, comes off as cringey","I'm in a real Emperor's New Clothes situation because I'm the only person I know who thinks this movie is as bad as it is. But it's horrible and I have no idea why it's considered an 'iconic movie' or even good.It's just a worse She's All That, but also the edginess of the dialogue from Heathers without any of the thematic execution or surrealism/stylistic elements that makes the dialogue passable in that scenario. In this world, teachers tell students they ""should be btch-slapped"" and students draw dcks on each others' faces. Ooh. So edgy. /s I can just imagine the writers grinning thinking they were writing 'cool' dialogue when to the viewer it's just stupid and occassionally grating. I was rolling my eyes on one of the lines one of the characters says when asking about why Bianca is so popular- ""Does she have beer-flavored npples?"" The writing is at the level of a sixth grade boy.And the references to Shakespeare- I've had writers try to convey something in a movie in a heavy-handed way, but I think this movie gave me a concussion with how they beat you over the head that this is a reference to Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. What are the characters reading in class? Shakespeare. Whose poster is in the friends locker? It's Shakespeare. What's the school called? Padua, the country from Taming of the Shrew. One of the characters goes to the prom as... Shakespeare. And in case someone is so dense not to catch all of that, the characters will sometimes just straight up quote from the play, unprompted.Some scenes are also strange, indicating they might have been trying to go with a more surreal take before going with a very standard depiction. For instance, there's an unnecessary scene at the beginning explaining the social cliques in the school (this type of scene is a teen movie cliche, but it's only necessary in films where cliques are central to the narrative. Not so in this movie, which is very much about individual characters) and the cliques explained contain groups like 'white rastafarians' and 'cowboys'. Clearly going for a comedy moment, but this wasn't sustained during the rest of the film, as much of the scenes with the main characters seem to be neutral or even slightly realistic to the high school experience. The movie also seemed to start out with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character and Kat as dual main characters before dumping him and relegating him to a side character.Some like this movie just for the performances (which in my opinion, the actor/s have to hit it out of the park to justify liking a movie with other flaws) but the performances are pretty standard. Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are likeable but they have many scenes where their delivery is flawed. I don't think any acting is standout and the characters aren't super unique either.Overall, serious execution flaws and especially awful dialogue make this movie quite an unenjoyable watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Where is their house?,Watched this film again recently on TBS.Loved the movie. I think I enjoyed it more years later.We watched it again recently & even though it is a teen flick rework of a classic - Heath & Julia are great in this film.Also fun to see the younger version of _______ (from Numbers)However - where in Seattle is that house? The wrap-around porch is AMAZING!

Wonderful,"The summary says it all.  This review is coming from a 100% Heath Ledger fan, so it might be a bit biased.

My parents watched it with me, and THEY even think it is funny!  But anybody that seriously wants to know my ultimate favorite part, it's when Heath's character is singing to Julia Stile's character during her soccer practice.  That and the end when Kat says ""You know you can't buy me a guitar every time you screw up.""  Sorry, but I can't help myself.

I liked Patrick, there's something nice about Heath Ledger. I hated Joey, he's such a poser. I can watch this film over and over again. I like the bit when Kat crashes into Joey's car and when Patrick starts singing a song to Kat. I think it's cute how Cameron has the courage to ask Bianca out. Not much people can do that. I thought parts of it were very funny. I'm glad Bianca beat the crap out of Joey at the end, he definitely deserved it. Does anyone know how you can reach Julia Stiles?

Heath Ledger was awesome,"I thought this movie was excellent....maybe all the critics say it was awful, but they have to realize that it was targeted for a teenaged audience, because they must be looking at it in a very adult way, It is a fun movie, and I thought the cast was good, but Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles were excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly predictable but undeniably charming,"It's a story that has been told countless times and the plot is as predictable as it gets. However, 10 Things I Hate About You manages to retain its charm. It stands out thanks to great performances by the two leads (Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles) and their sparkling chemistry. The comedic side of it is also quite strong, it works more often than not with many great lines (for example when Kat runs into Joey right after Patrick has left ""What is it, A**hole Day?"" or when Patrick finds out that both Joey and Cameron are interested in Bianca ""What is it with this chick? She have beer-flavored nipples?""). The music is also nice, a nostalgic throwback to the '90s. And of course the highlight of the movie, the scene where Patrick sings I Can't Take My Eyes Off You.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Kat is not a shrew.,"I never read the original Shakespeare, my knowledge of the great playwright is limited to Hamlet/Macbeth and ""Shakesphere in love"" I enjoyed this movie it was very modern take on an old outdated concept. Julia Stiles is very good young actress, I recommend Mona Lisa Smile as well as Save the Last Dance. These are good teen flicks. Julia Stiles has the ability to play a exceptional mature teenager and not some valley girl ditsy time (for example she does not play the stereotypical blonde girl roles). I just recommended to a friend to watch. The credit goes to the director, we need more movies like this. This movie is before HL became a big range. He is not that bad either, especially in the scene where he serenades Julia's character that was very funny and very sweet. Every girl likes that! The two sisters were funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Northwest Scenery,"'10 Things I Hate About You' is atory about a teenage girl and guy who are mutually repelled by each other but thrust together by a fellow with a large crush on her sister. Predictably, their mutual dislike eventually melts into something quite different. While mom is out of the picture, dad is comically overprotective. The plot deals with topics of interest to young adults, but is generally weak and escapes being a candidate for the dustbin only by good acting from Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. The overuse of Northwest scenery also held my interest. To summarize, unless you were born after 1990, there are plenty of better things to do with your time than watching this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

I think the Ms. Perky thing was brilliant, because the normal teen movie would have the counselor be the friend, and turn out helping the kids, but in this case it was different :) (I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it).

10 Things I Love About You,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a film that perfectly captures viewers' hearts with its enchanting blend of romance, humor and endearing characters. Inspired by one of Shakespeare's works, the film contemporises the story in a way that resonates with modern audiences. The chemistry between the leads is palpable, elevating the narrative from a simple tale of teenage love to a memorable cinematic experience. The characters are complex and human, making mistakes and learning lessons along the way, which adds depth and authenticity to the plot. The iconic scene in which the main character declares his love to the tune of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" is a moment that captures the essence of the film, leaving a lasting mark on viewers' memories. For romantics out there, ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a cinematic treasure that continues to enchant generations with its timeless story of love and self-discovery.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I have finally found a teen film that can beat              American Pie!,"In the vain of She's All That and Can't Hardly Wait, comes Ten Things I Hate About You. I loved it. The story focuses on Cameron, the new kid at school, who falls for Bianca, the gorgeous girl of his dreams. The only problem for Cameron is that Bianca is forbidden to date unless her ill-tempered, completely un-dateable older sister Kat goes out, too! So to solve his problem, Cameron singles out Patrick, who can match Kat, the mysterious bad boy of the school, with a nasty reputation.Firstly, Australia's Heath Ledger was fantastic in this movie. He played the role of Patrick Verona ( the bad boy at school) perfectly. I look forward to seeing him in more films and if you haven't seen him in The patriot, then you have missed a truly great performance. Katrina Straforti (Kat for short) was played by Julia Stiles and she did every mood swing in the film perfectly. As Pat says to Kat, `You're not as mean as you think you are', there relationship is one of the key factors of the whole movie! While Kat's younger sister Bianca, played by Alex Mac star Larisa Oleynik was great too. She shows the potential of being a big star one day. Finally the movie itself has many twists to it and the title in many ways tells you what the flick is going to be like. So if you are dying to see a good teenage flick with a difference, be like me, go to the video store do yourself a favour and hire `Ten Things I Hate About You!'Rating: 4.5/5 Stars or 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good,"Being a more mature and sophisticated 16 year old I really didn't think this typical teen movie would make the cut. Boy was I proved wrong!!

Of course people are labeling this movie as being ""heath's worst mistake"" but everyone needs to start somewhere and hey lets face it you don't suddenly wake up one day and get cast as the Joker! With all the crap on TV these days I think 10 Things is a great movie that also didn't contain any what I like to call ""photoshop actors"" (you know the ones that are so unrealistically good looking they look, well, photo-shopped) All in all a great movie definitely worth a watch if you're sick of all the sappy teen crap circulating through the cinemas :)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my favorite comments (that I take as a compliment) anyone has ever given me is that I remind them of Kat Stratford! (""Likes: Thai food, feminist prose and angry girl music of the Indie Rock persuasion""). Heath Ledger is such a rare, charismatic star who left this world way too soon!

Popularity is a big thing in high school and this is displayed in the movie. Julia Stiles' character has like motivated me to not worry too much about what others think and to just be my own person.

Too immature for its own good,"10 Things I Hate About You is too immature for its own good. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to make the leap to raunchy R-rated teen comedy, but were too scared they'd lose the tween audience, so it falls awkwardly in between the two.

Because of language and scenes with alcohol I would not suggests this for kids under thirteen. The ending was a little predictable but most American films are.

This is one of the best movies with so many young and hott actors. It is where I fell in love with Heath Ledger and Julia Styles. They both are so convincing in the parts. It is great how the writers took this classic Shakespearean play and made it into a modern and hilarious movie. The romance that is involved is great too. Watching Bianca realize that she isn't God's gift to the world and end up with the right guy in the end and also Kat falling for Patrick. They just work so well together.

I have to say Julia Stiles was such a raw talented actress in the film that I had to love Kat and her sister Bianca and I am glad that I could say that Julia was a delight to be casted in the role because I never saw her before that movie. I thought the cast really did a great job in there work, but I have to say that the one I really liked and she was so supporting was Susan May Pratt (Mandella), which I thought she stood out as the most gorgeous girl in the film.

Not only are the characters irritating and unreal but the actual story has no plot to it. I honestly don't know how they managed to fill almost 2 hours with it.

The Taming of the Shrew in Seattle,"10 Things I Hate About You (1999) was directed by Gil Junger. Many directors have brought Shakespeare to the screen in a contemporary setting. Often they can't pull it off. Director Junger makes it work.I refuse to see Shakespeare's version, because it depicts a true taming. Violence, lack of sleep, and lack of food can, indeed, break a person's spirit. Some directors act as if Kate is just playing along, but I think that Shakespeare literally meant taming. That might have brought laughs in 1592, but it doesn't make me laugh in 2022.The good news is that director Junger doesn't just give us Taming of the Shrew in a contemporary setting. He changes the plot to make Kate (Julia Styles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger) equals.Also, he adds a subplot about Bianca and her two boyfriends. That works as well.As director Junger portrays the play, it's a creative romantic comedy. OK--it's not All's Well that Ends Well, or Midsummer Night's Dream, but it's still Shakespeare and it's an excellent movie that is worth watching.10 Things has a solid 7.3 IMDb rating. I thought that it was better than that, and rated it 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ten things I hate about Ten Things I Hate About You,"... Actually, I won't bother to count to make sure that I've got ten. Indeed, the film as a whole I rather like.  The crucial thing is this: Julia Stiles plays a likeable character, and so does Heath Ledger.  (I see they're letting Australian actors retain their accents.  Excellent!)  I was surprised to see that, MOST of the time, the script managed to treat the characters with respect.  A love story involving these two is worth watching.  If the backbone of the film is sound then the makers can afford to muff some of the inessentials.  To proceed:*  One of the characters is a fan of Shakespeare and Shakespeare is the subject of one of the classes.  Why doesn't someone NOTICE all the parallels?  `West Side Story', after all, kept the fact that Shakespeare had written a play on this very subject tactfully out of sight, and that's the way it should be.* The English teacher should be fired.  If not for his campaign of harassment against the only talented member of his class, then certainly for performing a rap version of Shakespeare's poetry to make it look `hip' and `relevant'.  Indeed, performing rap AT ALL would be misdemeanour warranting a small fine in any enlightened state.  So many other villains get their come-uppance in this film - why not him?* Speaking of which, why is it considered necessary for films set in high schools to have a score consisting entirely of songs?  Is it to remind us how many people out there are allergic to music without words?*  There's too much gratuitous pairing at the end.  Really, there's ONE couple whose fate is worth following - the rest can go hang.*  Why does the climax always have to be an end-of-year dance?Gee, that's only five.  Oh well.  I mean, this film is no masterpiece, but it's decent enough - there's no reason to be too harsh.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

But being sure in one's own actions is the most important thing to do. and if you stick long enough to your thoughts others may not understand it, but at least they will learn to respect it.Just great!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just ok,"Ledger's first American movie, huh. I don't find Ledger remotely attractive at all. His smile is his least attractive feature. He actually looks like the joker. The dark hair and style was most unflattering. Julia plays the shrew perfectly. I've never seen her in a movie before. Her sister played the snob perfectly. The character's were I guess okay. The teacher was hilarious. I have an issue with dad. His young daughter just wants to do teenage things date etc.. Only if your sister dates also, seriously? Dad is a physician, dad is a nut. I don't know the name of the actors so I'm struggling here. I may have enjoyed the movie more had I been a teenager when the movie was released and if I knew who the actors were. Why did I watch then? I remember Heath in Brokeback a movie I enjoyed. He looks nothing like he did in ten ways. Josh should have been cast in the lead, beautiful boy.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Refreshing and Fun,"Unlike the recent stampede of teen-oriented films that have been thrown upon us these last few years, ""10 Things"" was actually fun to watch and highly entertaining.  It's refreshing to see a ""different"" type of film starring teenagers (very talented ones actually) and the producers/director successfully remained faithful to Shakespeare's play.  Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger have some great chemistry and the always cute Larisa Oleynik is never a bore to watch.  Overall, great film!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
luv it,"I absolutely adore 10 Things I Hate About You. This film is a modern classic that brilliantly blends sharp wit with heartfelt emotion. The clever adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew into a high school setting is both inventive and refreshing. The standout performances, particularly by Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles, bring depth and charm to their roles. The movie's smart dialogue and engaging storylines make it an enduring favorite. Its blend of humor, romance, and teenage angst resonates with anyone who appreciates a well-crafted romantic comedy. It's a film I continually cherish and recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not so interesting,"This movie is okay. There's really nothing special to it. Next to brilliant teen movies as Breakfast club and Clueless, this one can't compete.It seeks to get emotional but it wasn't at any point. The characters doesn't seem true and I don't feel like I should care about their love troubles. It'as a bit too superficial and stereotyped for me. I felt a bit frustrate as there was no lesson to learn from this film, not even a small one.I will keep in mind a global feeling of indifference towards 10 things I hate about you.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Shrew Taming: Harder than you think,"For once a teen flick that to enjoy you don't have to be a teen. This teen flick succeeds where many have failed, mainly due to the rare introduction of characters you like and hope fall in love, have fun etc, unlike the shallow empty characters used in most teen flicks (Cruel intentions to mention one).The main character in this movie is Cat who goes around most of the movie being sent out of classes and being a bitch to everyone, which I have to say is very amusing. Her younger sister Bianca is miss popular of the younger year but their dad won't allow Bianca to data until her sister does. Two people are after Bianca so they come up with a scheme to pay someone to go out with her.

Lovely movie,"This is really one of my favorite movies! The soundtracks were good, especially Letters To Cleo.Julia Stiles played Katherine 'Kat' Stratford, the bitch of the school. In real life she's a sweet and nice person and does what she wants to. That's why her sister Bianca looks up to Kat. Her father made the rule that the two sisters won't date any guys. This all happened when his wife died. For Kat it's not a problem not to date and is busy with other things. But Bianca, popular and pretty, really wants to. She has a crush on Joey: a model and is a jerk and really dumb. So dad made a new rule: If Kat dates, Bianca may too. Next problem: Kat don't wants to date!Well, that's the story line. I recommend this movie to anybody who loves the high school movies. Julia Stiles really plays great and also Heath Ledger plays a good role. The rest of the cast is also good. The movie is lovely: has a great sense of humor and nice sayings.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was not that good.,"This movie was not bad. Ok It was bad, but it was bearable. It made me laugh once or twice, and obviously the two young ladies are very beautiful and ok actresses. It does also have a plot. You can't say that for a lot of movies.Ok, so you're probably saying ""does he like it or not?"" Well I didn't really like it. I didn't really hate it ether. The movie just is really sophomoric. The music in it great. I am sure it has a great sound track, but it really isn't worth going to the theater to see. It would probably ok on video if you rent it not expecting too much.So You may ask, ""Why is he writing this review? He doesn't really have very strong feelings?"". Well, I answer, I just want to give a honest review. A lot of people are writing about how fantastic they think this film is. They are entitled to there option, but not many people have been saying bad things about this movie ether. I put that up to the fact that it isn't awful enough to get like a surgeon general's warning.So all in all, the movie is not terrible, but don't expect to much. I give it a 4.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

A very authentic teen flick with enough substance and humour to warrant a second viewing for me - remember to stay for the outtakes at the end.

A Charming and Witty Teen Classic,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a standout teen rom-com that blends sharp wit, great performances, and a timeless story into a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Loosely based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, the film modernizes the classic tale with a fresh high school setting and engaging characters.The highlight of ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is undoubtedly the chemistry between its leads. Heath Ledger delivers a charismatic and effortlessly cool performance as Patrick Verona, while Julia Stiles shines as the independent and sharp-tongued Kat Stratford. Their dynamic is entertaining, filled with playful banter and genuine emotional depth. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larisa Oleynik also bring charm to the film's secondary romance, adding to the overall appeal.What makes ""10 Things I Hate About You"" stand out is its clever dialogue and humor, which feel natural rather than forced. The film balances comedy with heartfelt moments, making it more than just a typical teen movie. The now-iconic rooftop serenade scene and the emotional poetry reading remain some of the most memorable moments in the genre.While some plot points feel predictable, the film's charm, humor, and strong performances make it easy to overlook minor flaws. ""10 Things I Hate About You"" remains one of the best teen comedies of its time, offering a mix of romance, comedy, and heart that still holds up today extremely well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is an absolute must see,"10 Things I Hate About You (1999) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline for this picture depicts a younger sister that is invited to the prom and is told she can't go unless her older sister also attends. Her older sister doesn't wish to date anyone or attend the prom. Suitors for the younger sister hire a ringer to try and convince the older sister to go to the prom.This movie is directed by Gil Junger (Black Knight) and stars Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Looper), Julia Stiles (Save the Last Dance), Gabrielle Union (Bring it On), Daryl Mitchell (Galaxy Quest) and Larry Miller (The Nutty Professor).This movie has a great storyline, characters and soundtrack. The writing is well done with entertaining subplots, dialogue and circumstances. Ledger delivers an outstanding performances and Stiles is good too. It was fun watching a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt. There's some classic scenes in this like the the misdirection in the classroom and the singing on the football field sequences. The ending ties the movie up well.Overall this is a great addition to the romantic comedy genre. The storyline is straightforward but the writing is very good and cast delivers outstanding performances. This is an absolute must see I would score a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Predictable,"10 Things I Hate About You is a 1999 teen romantic comedy film directed by Gil Junger and starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Larisa Oleynik.

10 Things I Hate About You (1999),"There are good and bad things about this film. First, the bad, there's an over-reliance on teenage movie character archetypes; the good looking sensitive rebel (Heath Ledger), the semi-intellectual rebellious feminist rebel (Julia Stiles), the seemingly vapid princes with emotional depth (Larisa Oleynik), the slightly goofy and sweet natured nice guy who inevitably gets the girl (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the conceited mean-spirited athlete/model (Andrew Keegan). There's also a few teachers and parent authority figures thrown in with only slight character development. It's a reworking of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew with Heath Ledger in the Richard Burton role of Petruchio and Julia Stiles in the Elizabeth Taylor role of Katarina. That's a heavy pair of shoes to fill and this Shakespeare-lite teenage comedy that is intended for an audience that's probably largely illiterate in the classics.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Timeless Classic That Will Always Melt My Heart,"10 Things I Hate About You is an absolute classic! From start to finish, I couldn't get enough. The chemistry between Kat and Patrick was amazing, and let's be real, Patrick was hot! Having a guy like that fall for you? Dreamy. My heart melted every time he was on screen.I also really loved the relationship between the sisters. At first, they didn't get along, but by the end, they were so much closer, and it was really nice to see that growth.And the dad? He reminded me a lot of my own parents. Growing up in a strict family, I totally get that overprotective vibe!Overall, 10 Things I Hate About You is the perfect teen rom-com. It's funny, sweet, and has so many memorable moments.

There were quite a few that came out about the same time as this, and 10 Things was by far the best.And now I will explain why this is so great.  Esoteric humor.

And then, there are things that only people who are familiar with the play get, such as the fact that they attend Padua high.  Or the many lines taken straight from the play.

A Time Capsule of Stars,"Story: When updating Shakespeare, a strong story is virtually guaranteed, and this one doesn't let us down. It remains true to The Taming of a Shrew but doesn't feel terribly locked into an era. It should still be enjoyable in 20 years. AActing: Everyone brings the goods. Ledger, Stiles, Gordon-Levitt, and Oleynik all give memorable performances. ADirection: It's almost shot like live theater, in that the takes are long instead of the usual quick cuts that get associated with modern cinema, and it works, largely because the actors were strong enough to make it work. BVisuals: Nothing terribly memorable here. The dialog was the star of the movie and the visuals weren't bad, but they also weren't awesome. COverall: This movie is a lot of fun and it captured many stars in their younger years. Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have all gone on to make names for themselves, and this will be a testament to the fact that they've always been good. Heath Ledger fans should remember Heath as Joker and as Patrick Verona from this movie as I feel they are his best performances and they showcase his range as an actor, as Verona and Joker are so different that it takes a careful eye to notice that the same man portrayed them. You should see this movie and I give a B overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I also think the romance-quality of this film is very good and the humour is fantastic. Joey Gordon-Levitt play Cameron, a newcomer who falls in deep love with Catarinas younger sister, Bianca. Bianca is the most popular girl in school. The hot-shot Joey, a model posing underwear and socks, tells his friends he's going to get Bianca. The only problem for both of them is that the Stratford sisters are not allowed to date according to their father's rules. But when their father changes his rules to let Bianca date, when Cat does, Cameron and his friend Michael set their minds on getting Cat a date she can not refuse. Catarina, perhaps the only girl in school whom does not care of dating and have a reputation about herself that she is a very difficult girl, is not an easy ""schrew""/cat to tame.

Great Film,"Having seen this film some 5 years ago, I'm constantly surprised and amazed at its ability to delight me.Unlike other 'teen' films of its time, ""10 Things"" doesn't rely on crudeness, or 'grossing' its viewers out. As a result, the film seems immune to the passage of time.Instead, the sublimely written film, which uses wit as its main source of comedy, will always appeal to those who enjoy intelligent dialogue.Based on ""the taming of the shrew"", which is dubious material at its best, ""10 things"" manages to convey everlasting themes of angst and unrequited love.Further more, it is probably the only Shakespeare adaptation that is better than the original material from which it was created.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More than ten reasons to love this film,"This is an AMAZINGLY witty movie in my opinion. It is a remake of Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew"" but modernized wonderfully. The main character, Kat Stratford(Stiles) is a rebellious teenager who doesn't care at all what other people think about her. Her sister, Bianca Stratford(Oleynik)could not be more different. She is a popular, adored, and self centered teen who loves being a girlie girl. The new kid, Cameron (Levitt) immediately falls in love with Bianca. But alas, the Stratford sister's father is an extremely uptight, paranoid man who is deathly afraid of his daughters getting impregnated, and so has set a rule that Bianca cannot date until Kat starts dating. So now, Cameron has decided to come up with a plan to hook up Kat with the school's extreme bad boy, Patrick Verona(Ledger).This movie is one of the funniest movies, and my friends and i totally love it. It is also full of Shakespeare references, some big and some small, which is a nice touch. There are quite a few hilarious lines, and the acting is amazing in my opinion. This movie is definitely worth seeing, and you shall get QUITE a few laughs out of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Charisma, Romance, Ledger, Icon Discussion","I will talk about the movie a little bit in this review and then I will talk more about just Heath Ledger. First off, This is a very romantic and cute movie to watch. All the romance is genuine and terrific. The chemistry is really there with the two different couples(Ledger and Stiles, Oleynik and Gordon-Levitt) and you like the characters, you dislike the bad guys and it has one of the most romantic scenes in history where Ledger's character sings to Stiles' character on the Football field.This is a classic and it's where I first noticed Heath Ledger. This is a movie where the character that Ledger plays should not be liked this much, and Ledger brought this character to such a deep level that only a great actor like Ledger could do. Only time will tell if Heath Ledger will become a Movie Icon, but I think it's fair to say with performances like this one and many others that he had, he most certainly will.I think what makes a great movie icon is the fact that the actor/actress has to be a great actor(with a few exceptions) and they also have to have a lot of likability about them, which co-exists with good acting as well as co-exists with a certain humility about that actor/actress. A few examples are James Dean and John Wayne.People forget John Wayne was a fantastic actor and he was such a cool guy and the same goes for James Dean as well. You could identify with Wayne and Dean through their extreme likability and great acting. Patrick Swayze wasn't the greatest actor but he had extreme likability, and I think over time he'll be a movie icon too.And to kind of give an example more about the likability factor, in Heath Ledger's last film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, 4 actors played the same character(because Heath Ledger had passed away and 3 other actors did the part to finish up the film). All 4 actors were good in their own way. The 4 actors were Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell. Now Johnny Depp will be a Movie Icon, no doubt about that, he already kind of is.But my point is, Heath Ledger was the only actor as the character in the movie, who would really let you in, really let you in to a part of his soul. The other 3 actors were great, but they had some distance to them, you could appreciate their acting, but you couldn't get into them as a person/a human being. Ledger had always been very charismatic with all his roles, and he didn't have distance, he always let the audience in close to him, into his soul almost, into his humanity and you never quite get that from Johnny Depp, Jude Law, or Colin Farell, all great actors, but they're always a little distant in all their roles, with the exception of Farell who will let you in with certain roles he's played.I think Heath Ledger will be a great Movie Icon over time and he is also the big reason why 10 Things I Hate About You was such a great and special kind of movie. Heath Ledger let you into his humanity in this movie, and because of that, 10 Things I Hate About You wasn't just your usual teeny bop, cheesy romance movie. It had some substance, it had some real driven emotions, sincere humanity and love to it.You don't usually find that kind of substance within a film like this one, in this genre, but because of Heath Ledgers performance in particular and the other ones, 10 Things I Hate About You is a very romantic, very special and great movie to watch by yourself or with the girl or guy you love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Another great movie from Disney (in disguise, of course).","This film kick-started the careers of Julia Stiles and the late, great Heath Ledger (RIP). (Where did the last 18 years go?!)As part of a school event when I was 12, the film we saw was this. I expected rubbish associated with the genre. How wrong I was. This was good.It was partially inspired by The Taming of the Shrew (even with some direct quotes) but updated for modernity.The beer party and prom scenes, in particular, were my highlights. To me, they said '1999 was a carefree time. In those days, 911 referred to an expensive sports car.'Overall, from the initial Touchstone (Disney for mature audiences) logo to the end of the credits, it's a good 'un. If you're into the genre, add this to your collection.There is some salty language and violence, though.Recommended for ages 11+.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Intelligently funny film for today's teens,"This movie totally wasn't dumbed down for teens.  It was smart and hysterical.  The way over the top dad was a riot.  The soundtrack's pretty good too.  You can't really compare this to Shakespeare though, just because of the huge differences in the movie from the play.  Either way, this movie is priceless.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable,"This is a really enjoyable film which doesn't try to be too clever or to make you cringe.  The soundtrack is excellent which helps tell the story as the film centres on young people learning about love, life and heartache, which is what most songs are about, isn't it?  I haven't seen a film with as much vibrant colour in it before, and the use of the colour helps the film in the sense that it's a happy, light hearted positive film.This is a film for the girls, but it's a lot more enjoyable for for blokes than most romantic comedies. I think the idea of having the girls' father as a maternity doctor was brilliant.  For those of you who haven't seen the film watch out for the way he deters his daughters from making out with boys by making them walk around the house in a pregnancy mock-up with all the padding and bulges etc.  The fathers one liners throughout the film help keep the pace going and help in preventing it getting to mushy. Over all this is an enjoyable film that you could watch with your younger brother or your Gran as it is inoffensive, has no swearing, and has no nudity.  What it does have is a great script, great cast and great soundtrack.  Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
much better than the usual teen romance,"I recently saw 10 Things I Hate About You and was pleasantly surprised. After the flood of boring, formula teen-targeted movies, I was expecting another two hours of wooden actors and a script my six year old brother could have improved on.  However, I found the movie to be engaging and quite funny.  The characters were very well acted; the plot, while predictable, still had a few unexpected points.  The chemistry between Julia Stiles (Kat) and Heath Ledger (Patrick) was great, and they really kept the film going. I'll definitely be buying this on video.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
'Ten Things I Hate About You' - Film review,"'Ten Things I Hate About You' was made in 1999. Directed by Gil Junger and written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik it was a widely successful movie with an entertaining storyline loosely based on Shakespeare's comedy 'The Taming Of The Shrew.Although the film follows the stories of several different characters it is mainly based around Kat (Julia Stiles) who is the difficult older sister of the beautiful and very popular Bianca (larisa Oleynik) who's father has forbidden her from dating until her older sister does. When Cameron (joseph Gordon-Levitt) starts the first day of his new school he instantly falls in love with Bianca. However he has some tough competition from the overwhelmingly egotistical Joey (Andrew Keegan), but he shows that he is substantially more intelligent than the unbearably vain Joey and forms a clever plan involving Trailer park rebel Patrick (heath Ledger) and tricks Joey into helping him get the girl.However this film is more than your usual clichéd teen movie. The storyline and script have a genuine depth which demands more of the viewer than most other films in this genre. The characters are wonderfully played by top quality actors and actresses who play their parts with amazing insight into the characters and how they are portrayed to the audience.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film because not only is the main character female, she is also an extremely strong and intelligent person who is never afraid to express her own views and feelings. The fact that she is not your average teen-movie dumb-blonde type or completely gorgeous and impossibly popular also helps people relate much more easily to the character and makes you want to get to know her. I particularly admired her witty comebacks to any insults from people who disagreed with her less than conventional attitude to her social life and popularity. This character is a particularly good role model as although she made mistakes she learnt from them and never let any 'guy', or anybody else take advantage of her again.This film is also very different to most of it's genre as the script and storyline are extremely intelligent and well put together. It is an excellent modern adaptation of a classic play which hopefully would encourage more teenagers to be willing to enjoy the works of Shakespeare, and help them realise that the aim of his writing was to entertain and that his plays were certainly not written to be taught in schools. It also carries on the comedy genre of Shakespeare's play as the film is genuinely extremely funny. This is exaggerated by the fast pace of the film and the witty jokes and comments from characters. The screenwriters manage to successfully retain Shakespeare's original sophisticated aim and similar morals are communicated to the audience, along with added ones which are more relevant to teenagers today. The blend of old and new ideas works surprisingly well and enhances the quality of the film, making it modern but classic at the same time.My favourite part of this film is where Patrick sings 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' to Kat in front of a playing field full of his fellow students. The band starts playing along to the tune and everyone stops to watch. Now in your average teen-movie this would be unbearably sleazy but in 'Ten Things I Hate About You' it is made hilariously funny when Patrick runs around after policemen, who are attempting to restrain him, and slaps their bottoms. The swift movements of the camera in all directions and the jaunty camera angles in this scene exaggerate the humour and everything from the huge idiotic grin on his face to his sarcastic run adds to this effect and gives this scene two very positive qualities: humour and romance.The only part of this film which disappointed me is the ending. Like most other teenage movies this film of course ends with a prom. For such a thoroughly entertaining and quite unpredictable film this is an extremely discouraging ending which seems to have had very little thought or enthusiasm at all put into it. A prom seems to be the easy way out of your typical teen movie and i certainly expected much more from a film with such an admirable and creative storyline. The audience should by now be expecting a huge ending with humour and fast movement which sums up the rest of the film with a huge bang, but instead we are left feeling duly disconcerted with this totally uninspiring choice of ending.Although the clichéd ending does not spoil an otherwise excellent film, it left me feeling unfulfilled and disappointed and the experience was not as it could have been if the ending was just a little more inventive.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
10 things i hate about you.,"The Taming of the Shrew Ten Things I Hate about You shows how the ""tough guy"" in high school, Patrick (Heath Ledger) and the nonconformist girl, Katerina (Julia Stiles), get set up on a date. Katerina found out the reason they went on their first date was a complete set up where Patrick got paid to ask her out by her sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). The reason Bianca set this date up was because their father said the only way Bianca could date was if Kat were to date someone too. After Kat found out he got paid to be with her, she did not understand why he would lead her on like that because she was really falling in love with him. In the end she forgives him because he gives her a guitar and he realized that by the end he wasn't in it for the money anymore -- he was in it for Katerina.When this movie was made it was based on the older movie Taming of the Shrew. So when the director (Gil Junger) made this movie he wanted to make the plot come off similar but in modern times. He still made Katerina's character the shrew but she becomes tamed in a way that she actually gets feeling for a boy because her beautiful sister wanted a date. The modern movie was set at a high school because more people can relate to it.I love this movie because the dialogue is so entertaining and it the whole movie is put together so well it drew me in the first time I watched it. I can relate to this movie because, I was in high school. I know how it can be with the people, who don't want to conform, or the people that think they are the prettiest, and even the ones who think they are the toughest and coolest kids in class. What Patrick did to Kat I think is completely wrong but he did make up for it in the end of the movie. I know his character really came to his senses, finally realizing dating someone because he got paid to do so was wrong and he made up for his mistakes in the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Both Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger did a phenomenal job in my opinion. When I was younger, I wanted to be Kat so bad and still do. I longed for a relationship like Kat and Patrick's so badly.

Superb acting makes this a teenage classic,"This film, being a modern remake of The Taming of the Shrew, already had a great plot thrust upon it. Some critics say that it was too predictable but, if one thinks about it, so was most of Shakespeare so that was not a problem in my opinion. The main actors were Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles and they were both excellent playing their roles, but I felt that the most praise should have gone to Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford. She normally plays an age range of about 14-18 and her rendition of the self centered Bianca was outstanding. Being an 18 year old at the time, she slid into the role with exceptional ease but it is unlikely that she will become as big as the two main actors. Gordon-Levitt also played his role well and their was chemistry between them because of the past roles on Third Rock From the Sun that they had. Overall it was a brilliant piece of work from all involved. It will probably act as a starter film for Stiles and Ledger but I hope that the directors out there don't forget the roles that Oleynik and Gordon-Levitt played. Remember, there are no small roles, only small actors.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A twist from your average teen movie (this has depth and character development)!!!,"Wow. Of course this movie has it's typical I can tell what's going to happen moments, as the large majority of movies do. But the acting quality, the relationships between the actors, and the budding stars casted make this movie phenomenal. I must rave about all of the cast, but particularly Julia Stiles. She is fantastic. I saw her on NBC's ""The 60s"" which was not very good, but she made a huge contribution to help pull if through. It was her acting quality that made me return to watch the conclusion on the second night. Anyways, back to the movie. Larisa Oleynik was also very good at bringing the character of Bianca through her metamorphosis, as you learn to like her character.Based on Taming of the Shrew, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), a sophomore, is told that she cannot date until her older sister, Katerina (Julia Stiles), a senior, does. (the father actually changed the rule to this from his previous ""no dating till you've graduated"" rule). Throughout the movie you see the setup of he lovable Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) of trying to find a match for Katerina (Kat) so that he can take a shot at the seemingly-unobtainable Bianca. Follows the general plot of Taming of the Shrew. Of course you have a happy ending, but I won't tell you what that is.The innuendo-ish comedy and the slight language and the drinking and stuff they say gave it the rating. And maybe it isn't appropriate for the any-bit naive pre teen, all teens get the idea. I am one myself. I may not experience what happens there but I definitely know it exists.****1/2 (4  1/2 stars)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't hate it at all!,"I don't think that you can have lived throughout the 90's as a teenager without watching this film and totally enjoying it. It belongs with 'Clueless' and 'Empire Records' in the fun teenage category.It's full of great moments and the ""Too Good To Be True"" scene must surely go down in history as one of the greatest ever.It's a good story and how could it not be with a writer like Willy Shakespeare? A re-imagining of 'The Taming Of The Shrew', it's brought up to date so well, not to mention the fact that Julia Stiles seems to be a shrew without too much effort at all (I've never met her, but the faces she pulls are well rehearsed and don't seem to require too much acting).I absolutely love Heath in this role and the truth behind his character is lovely. He could perhaps have spent a bit of time in the gym though, his arms look positively twig-like at times.I think you can tell that the cast had a great time filming, as it comes across in their performance and it adds to the audiences enjoyment. I also love the Dad.Bound together with an awesome, and there is no other word for it I assure you, soundtrack, it's a film that lasts the test of time and I'm sure even my cynical Niece and Nephews could appreciate it.In some ways it is a cult classic and it will always be a firm favourite of mine.927.85/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Clever updating of TAMING THE SHREW with some twists,"I am late to have heard about this ensemble comedy but got it at the Video Rental Outlet before seeing Julia Stiles' new film this weekend (""O"").  She holds her own in both commendable movies and displays ""star power"" against the mostly second-tier co-stars.  I don't know much about Heath Ledger but he's sort of like Kevin Costner in the PRINCE OF THIEVES Robin Hood-vehicle of a few years ago: his accent needs clarification in such ""red,white, and blue"" American surroundings.  This film sadly lacks the appealing love of a local context (Seattle, Washington) that a drama-comedy like SAY ANYTHING (1989)had for its high school protagonists; yet it does have some authentically funny moments via excellent set-ups and punchlines.  Borrow it and enjoy the updated give-and-take of a romantic comedy that doesn't need pre-marital sex to explain all of the longing that teens have always felt about each other.  I do have some consternation that the single major African-American female character comes across as two-faced and petty but the film's English teacher succeeds and one-ups the History teacher of FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (Ray Walston) with a truly funny series of in-class Shakespearean assignments.

I watched this film and expected a high school, teenybopper dating crisis story, and thankfully, I was SO very wrong.  This film has much more to offer than that; the cast is very true to the characters' personalities, and they work so hard that it comes across as natural.  Oleynik (as the much-adored Bianca) is wonderful; it's refreshing to see her as another character besides Alex Mack (Nickelodeon fans know who that is).  I loved all the characters, especially the slimy Joey, whose mind is on his chiseled profile and on his, ahem, fly.

Give it a try- it might work out,"On the surface, there is much to dislike about this new rom com. 10 things I hate about you is derivative, trite, and filled to the brim with formulaic rom com devices. Let me narrate the story here: The main character initially hates her future lover. They quarrel, bicker, but she is somehow won over in a manner that is more convenient than logically rigorous. Then, challenges pop up which spoils their relationship, until inevitably, a grandiose gesture of love by one of the characters gives us our happy ending.I think it is into natural that movie audiences and film critics want to see something fresh and new. But rather than criticising a film for what it did not do, why don't we applaud it for what it does well? 10 things I hate about you, based on Shakespeare's taming of the shrew,
offers an interesting premise- of a girl who cannot date until her older sister does. It navigates this problem with genuine humour and a sureness of touch that keeps it from feeling cringey or overwrought. We also have a couple of winning performances, notably Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger. Ledgers character is known to others as a bad boy but in actuality he is a gentlemen. Ledger portrays his character with a likeable charm that immediately dispels any doubts about his ""niceness"". Likewise, Stiles is superb in her role. She plays an outwardly antisocial, angsty and independent ""shrew"" who hides a tender, emotional heart within. Part of her appeal is her voice- stiles has this deep, mature voice which lends depth to her character. She is also exquisite in handling her characters dichotomy- she is convincing both as a vat of repressed angst and as a girl who is genuinely heartbroken. Consider the final scene where she reads her poem as her deep, mature voice gives way to high pitched sobs and shrieks of tears- bravo!The humour in the film is also particularly well done. It is outrageous but still within the realm of possibility, and with some exceptions, genuinely funny. Patrick's rendition of can't take my eyes off you, and an English Teachers funny antics should crack anyone up.Part of the films charm over 20 years after its initial release is also its setting. The film feels almost like a time capsule of the late 90s, as the popular culture then pervades the film from its music to its references. This, rather than feeling dated, feels nostalgic, as we look back on an era which is not that long ago.10 Things I hate about you sets itself apart from the countless other teen rom coms because of its winning performances, absorbing storyline, and well handled humour. I normally loathe teen movies because I couldn't care less about their drugs, their parties, their sex, and precisely all the vapid, superficial aspects which Kat hates. But 10 things I hate about you never delves too deeply into its teen setting, merely letting it be a conduit for humour, charm, and nostalgia. It may follow a formulaic plot structure, contain convenient and contrived plot holes but, I hate to admit this- I really quite liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

10 Things I Hate About You,"Gil Junger set the gold standard for modern-day adaptations of William Shakespeare works with 10 Things I Hate About You. Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out Junger's high school version of The Taming of the Shrew. When popular sought after Bianca Stratford is forbidden from dating until her feminist, tradition despising sister Kat decides to date, she feels as though her life is over. Bringing to life the Bard's work for a new audience, Gil Junger graced us with a modern-day classic.New student Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is instantly smitten by Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) His student tour guide, Michael (David Krumholtz) quickly informs him that Bianca is off limits to all, as her strict father has forbidden her from dating until her older sister starts dating. Cameron believes finding a date for Bianca's sister Kat (Julia Stiles) sounds like an easy enough task until he meets her. Kat is introduced to the audience tearing up a prom advertisement lecturing the student body on the patriarchal origins of the prom tradition. Realizing his feat to be almost insurmountable, Cameron enlists the help of Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) the school bad-boy with a mysterious reputation to hopefully lure Kat with his mystique. Cameron also cons the school model, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) into convincing him that he will be the one that gets to take Bianca on a date after Kat falls for Patrick. Believing he will get a date with Bianca, Joey provides the monetary bribe to Patrick promised to him if he can successfully manage Kat to agree to a date. When Patrick begins to fall in love with Kat, however, the whole strategy might fall apart.My favorite part of these Shakespeare adaptations are the allusion to the actual works of Shakespeare that are sprinkled into the adaptations. In 10 Things I Hate About You, some of these allusions include Kat actually being called a shrew by a classmate, Shakespeare being read in Kat's literature class, and their school being within a castle. These allusions act as great kisses to the original work, and provide a nice touch of enjoyment to members of the audience ""in the know"". 10 Things I Hate About You is made up of a predominately young cast that really bring their characters out of the Victorian Age and into the modern day quite nicely. The music in the film also goes a great length to making the story fun and relatable even to audiences who know little about the film's original inspiration. A well-done Shakespeare adaptation will be enjoyable for fans of the Bard's, as well as people who didn't even realize that the film was based on another; 10 Things I Hate About You accomplishes this feat, bringing Shakespeare to an audience who may otherwise have skipped him.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Greatest Teen Movie of all time,"Simply a masterpiece.  Yes, this isn't the epic, artsy critically acclaimed type movie that is so often supposed to be the ones we like.  There are no academy award winning actors here, and isn't the typical movie a person would call a masterpiece.  Regardless of this however, I would recommend `Ten Things' to anyone in an instant.  In the saturated, gigantic and sometimes seemingly overpopulated genre of teen movies, this one not only stands out, but does so in brilliant fashion.  This is the greatest teen movie of all time.  The well know Julia Stiles is perfect for her part.and being able to watch the absolutely, beautiful, gorgeous Larisa Oleynik is worth the price of admission and cost of DVD itself.  It is sad this is Larisa's only major role, and we are all poorer for it, for to me Larisa is the most beautiful to ever live. For outright wonderful entertainment and a good watch, `Ten Things' is flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved it!,"This is a great movie for anyone to see.  It does lack originality but in this age where mainstream rules who am I  to talk.  It is a good, fun, light movie.  The movie had many high points which I unfortunately can not mention.  This movie is a must see and well worth the price of a rental. ($3.50 for two nights here.)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
