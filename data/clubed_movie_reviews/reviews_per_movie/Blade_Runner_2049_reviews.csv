Jaw dropping and richly rewarding...well worth running with,"'Blade Runner' is a masterpiece and a favourite of mine. It is still to this day a genre and film landmark, and ties with 'Alien' as Ridley Scott's best film, despite being disliked at the time it has rightly gained its reputation as a classic.Hearing that there was a sequel over thirty years later left me with intrigue, with a great cast (Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford), one of the best cinematographers in the film industry today in Roger Deakins and with an equally great director on board (having liked to loved Denis Villeneuve's previous films), but also nervousness considering (with notable exceptions) the general reputation with sequels. 'Blade Runner 2049' turned out to be well worth the wait, it is easy to see why it will alienate some with its very long length (can understand the overlong criticism) and slow pace but it is even easier to understand the acclaim the film has received.Is 'Blade Runner 2049' better than 'Blade Runner' or on the same level? No. Is it nearly, or shall we say just, as good? Yes. To me it is one of Villeneuve's better films along with 'Sicario' and 'Incendies' (my least favourite of his is 'Arrival' and despite being an understandably divisive effort to me it was still good) and one of the exceptions to the general reputation of sequels. A sequel that treats its predecessor with respect (including some thoughtful and cleverly done nods to it, including quotations from the original score, even Ryan Gosling's name is a nod to the original author Phillip K Dick) and also its audience with respect. Despite its faults, it's also one of my favourite films of the year, and this year has been very hit and miss for films so this is saying quite a bit.Sure 'Blade Runner 2049' is not without its flaws. Can totally see where people are coming from criticising the length, most of the time it was not a problem but some of the time there was a sense that the length was too inflated, 20 minutes could have trimmed with no problem at all. There are a few implausibilities and contrivances here and there towards the end and much more could have been done with the underdeveloped character of Jared Leto (the only weak link in the cast, he doesn't have the presence to pull the role off and doesn't look comfortable or interested).However, 'Blade Runner 2049' does a huge amount right. It looks amazing, it's impeccably and imaginatively designed with some of the best special effects seen in a long time. It's Deakins' cinematography that particularly stands out, darkly gritty, gorgeously fluid and beautifully audacious Deakins shows that he is fully deserving of being considered one of today's best cinematographers. One cannot praise 'Blade Runner 2049' without mentioning some of the best directing Villeneuve has ever done in a contender for the best directed film of the year (well between him and Nolan for 'Dunkirk'), he is absolutely the right man for the job and shows himself to be not only completely at ease with the material but also tailor made for it. Once again there is a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge and sense of wondrous awe.Another big standout is the synthetic music score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, so well done and fitting that one doesn't miss Johann Johannsson that desperately. Though imagine what the film would have been like with his involvement, from my understanding he was originally meant to do the music but was fired for reasons that are a mystery to me and Wallfisch and Zimmer were parachuted in and did marvellously with big shoes to fill. It's appropriately hauntingly discordant, heart-pounding and tension-filled, with seeming echoes and quotes to the original's score. The sound effects are clever and thrillingly authentic, like for example the replicated wolfhound.When it comes to the writing and story, 'Blade Runner 2049' also triumphs, even if the story is not perfectly executed. The action-oriented scenes and conflicts are filled with tension and suspense as well as ingeniously choreographed, a fine example being the masterful prologue which has to be one of my favourite opening sequences of 2017. The science fiction elements are positively awe-inspiring, often making my jaw drop, while the philosophical ones are incredibly thought-provoking and never heavy-handed (many films have made a hash with this aspect, it was refreshing to see a film doing it well). Despite being a long and slow film, a vast majority of the film was richly rewarding, with a delicious quiet tension and absorbing mysterious elements.Excepting Leto, the acting is great. Best of all being Harrison Ford as a suitably world-weary Indiana Jones-like Deckard, that and the 'Apocalypse Now'-like meeting with Ryan Gosling providing a nostalgic element, and a deliciously cold-hearted Sylvia Hoeks (her character and performance being what Leto's character and performance should have been). Ryan Gosling also plays it straight to great effect.All in all, despite imperfections this jaw-dropping, richly rewarding, very respectful and visually stunning follow-up is just as good, if not quite as, as the 1982 masterpiece and one of my favourites of the year. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A phenomenal sequel,"It's very rare when a modern sequel/reboot is equal to the original in terms of quality, but this movie is that rare one. It carries over the sweeping and hypnotizing cinematography, it continues the storyline in a natural way, it references the original, but doesn't rip it off, it introduces new concepts without ruining the continuity, it expands on the themes presented in the original in a very natural way, it doesn't drag nearly as much as said original and it's got a more compelling protagonist. I have a feeling I'll just enjoy this movie more and more as time goes by, and I already love it a lot. It's a movie with a lot to unpack, and I have no doubt it will improve even more on rewatches.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slow and beautiful,"I guess if the producers wanted to make another Blade Runner, they totally succeeded - at least so far. As with the original Blade Runner the visuals are the ones that people will refer to when it comes to this movie. And it's not just because of the Academy Awards. You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).Having said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.While it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it. If that sounds intriguing to you, with some added social commentary flavor, than by all means watch it. But beware that you have to have patience with it ...",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
pure cinema,"It's 2049 Los Angeles. K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner hunting for old Nexus 8 replicants under LAPD Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). After the 2022 blackout, most records have been erased or corrupted. Tyrell is out of business and replicant production had been outlawed until Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace is producing a new obedient replicant. Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is his replicant henchwoman. K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K's holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.This is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original's visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.The original's detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins' work is beyond beautiful. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. Gosling is a more effective lead. Ford comes in during the second half and is a more fun Deckard. Ana de Armas is a gorgeous vision of girl perfection. Sylvia Hoeks is an amazing villain. The movie tackles all of the ideas without hitting one over the head. This is a great film although I'm not sure if popular modern audience will take to it. The opening box office certainly does not suggest that.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quality Sci-Fi,"The user reviews seems to be over-run by a troll. Lots of repetitive 2 and 3 stars reviews that all read like they're written by the same person.It's a relief they still make movies like this; movies for adults. Yes it's a sequel, but it's quality and it stands on its own. This is real sci-fi, made with a proper budget and brought to life by artists. It's serious and paced so that you have time to think. If you're a fan of the genre and can appreciate some ambiguity and a little space for questions to breathe then I think you will appreciate this film. But if you can't remember the last time you read a book then maybe you will find this movie long and boring.The cast, acting, and plot are all quite good with only a few misses. The soundtrack doesn't blow me away but it's suitable. The visuals are incredible though and where this movie really shines; I can't think of a single moment in the film where I felt like the vision was held back by the technology available. And the scene at K's apartment with Joi (you will know it when you see it) pushed the envelope of what I thought was possible to do in a film. This one is a real stunner visually. Like the original, I expect Blade Runner 2049 to hold up extremely well over time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Visually Striking Sequel that is Well Worth Your Time,"Visually the movie floored me. There's clearly so much intentionality and careful effort and planning that went into making that world. Villeneuve blended call backs to the original while still making this his own vision. I'll see anything he makes because I always feel like I'm in good hands with his movies, right from the opening scene.The music had a similar feel to the visuals in that they blended old and new. The iconic ""Tears in Rain"" melody receives a much-deserved return in a delightfully appropriate moment. I'll give the movie serious props for providing a comforting level of nostalgia without ever feeling that it pandered.Joi (Ana de Armas) and Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) were fantastic in their own very different ways. Joi, who plays Gosling's love interest of sorts, is essentially Samantha in Her, except she is a holographic projection instead of only a voice. Luv is Jared Leto's favorite replicant assistant and a total ice queen.Gosling was cool and dutiful, though kind of lifeless, which I guess was on purpose since he plays a replicant (or does he?) Juxtaposing him with Harrison Ford really made the subtleties of Ford's performance stand out in a way that was absent for Gosling. But Gosling was still very handsome and that worked well with the rest of the movie, which is striking and beautiful.Even though I didn't feel bored during any of the 164 minutes, I often felt like nothing was really happening. Even at the end I wondered what was the point. I know it was a character exploration of K (Gosling), like the first was of Deckard, and he clearly grew during the story. Still, the movie overall came across to me as heavy on striking visuals and light on substance.Perhaps I'm demanding too much. While I enjoyed the heck out of the movie and would watch it again in a second, it fell slightly short of the profound best picture level movie that I hoped it would be. Somewhere in the two hour and 44 minute runtime is a great two hour movie trying to emerge.All things considered, it's a pleasing complement to the original and is well worth a night in the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too much style over substance,"Denis Villeneuve is today without any doubt the most prominent Canadian director. In recent years he was mostly active in the crime (""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Sicario"" (2015)) and science fiction (""Arrival"" (2016), ""Blade runner 2049"" (2017), ""Dune"" (2021) and ""Dune part II"" (2024)) genre.It requires a lot of courage to make a sequel to such a cult classic as ""Blade runner"" (1982, Ridley Scott). ""Blade runner 2049"" is situated, as the title already indicates, in 2049 and therefore 30 years after the story of ""Blade runner"".The theme however has remained the same, the fear of robots taking over. This fear is with the discussions about Artificial Intelligence in 2024 even more relevant than it was at the time of release of ""Blade runner 2049"".Relevance is however not the same as originality. In ""Blade runner"" (1982) the fear of Robots taking over was further elaborated upon in the fear that they could adjust their own expiration date. In ""Blade runner 2049"" (2017) it is the fear that they can reproduce. Variation within a theme.The cinematography is brilliant, perfectioning the decadent atmosphere of the 1982 film and having 3D technology as an extra. A very good performance by cinematographer Roger Deakins. Nevertheless the overall impression I got after seeing this film was that it is too much style over substance.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Intelligent sequel that, on its own, doesn't captivate new audiences","As a sequel and in the field of the plot creativity, it's done an excellent work that hypes old fans into awaiting a possible new sequel with the story's climax, once that Blade Runner 2049 introduces well-fit new characters that really add to the scenario of the old movie, even explaining some gaps or doubts on the bigger plot. Furthermore, the movie is intelligently made on the artistic aspect, showing wonderful simbols and plays with shadows and colors, making it clear that it was thought on the details. Nevertheless, although it offers some pretty engaging scenes, the story is not clearly put to the new (those who didn't see the original film) viewers as it should have been, what difficulties their conexion with the characters and makes it all boring at some times.Good stories can be relevant parts of interesting big universes, but they also need to give solely a good lead on the plot and to be weel self-contained to captivate new audiences. As an example, I had never watched the first movie by the time I watched this one (I did later and loved to do it), so I didn't catch up emocionally with the characters, besides being curious about it, what made tiring a significant part of it. That's clearer when you consider that I watched it with friends and I was the only one who felt some connection to it.By the way, it didn't need to have 3 hours, the story could have been equally told at maybe less than 2, so that the pace was annoyingly slow, contributing to those bored viewers.In short, if you're willing to watch a pretty slow interesting movie, it can fit you well and introduce you to the general concepts of the saga (but I still would recommend you watching the first Blade Runner first). If you liked the first Blade Runner, it's a must-see.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautifully made, but shockingly slow.","I always make it a rule to only ever do a review once a show or film is ended. In this case, I started about forty minutes in, for one reason only, I was bored to tears.I love the original film, and although a film I thought never needed a follow up, but I was open to it, and thought the basic storyline in this film was pretty good, and imaginative.I'll start with the positives, it looks amazing, genuinely, the effects, sets and all aspects of the visuals are seriously impressive, that's the major strength, the acting is hard to fault, Gosling is always on point.The downer...... It's insanely boring, how on Earth did they allow this film to be so slow, you almost forgive the first hour, where literally nothing happens, you convince yourself that it's bound to open up and switch up several gears. It never really does though, it improves, but it seems to be on half speed for large spells.I struggled with the plot a bit, possibly because there isn't one.In summary, the window dressing is terrific, it looks sensational, incredibly well acted, the problem, it bored me to tears. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Truth in the Rain,"To chase after an iconic masterpiece, to imitate or to try and supplant its rightful place, is a fool's errand.Thankfully director Denis Villeneuve along with his talented collaborators never succumbs to imitating or trying to super-cede Ridley Scott's 1982 landmark ""Blade Runner"".Hampton Fancher, who created the story of the original, has crafted a new screenplay with Michael Green, that not only builds on the themes of ""Blade Runner"", but ties them together with larger questions about the current human state and its challenges.Ryan Gosling stars as a replicant of the latest generation, who tries to solve a puzzle that leads him into the realm of real and manufactured life, and walks along the same noirish paths that made the original so gripping. Gosling imbues his character with a very compelling façade, which starts to crumble as his humanity takes over his mechanical design.The equally thrilling performances by Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, Robin Wright, Carla Juri and of course Mr. Harrison Ford, forge a credible bond with the audience and enhance the visual grandeur created by cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner.And although ""Blade Runner 2049"" may not achieve the same level of force as its predecessor, it is a tremendously immersive, philosophical and touching experience, that should be enjoyed on the largest screen possible.The movie's pace is deliberately patient, which may confuse some members of the audience. But by slowing down and observing, the audience can revel in the immensity of the images.The more we move, inexorably it seems, towards the do-or-die reality of ""Blade Runner"", the more vital these stories become.Whatever the box-office-fate of ""Blade Runner 2049"" will be, the long wait has paid off. It is far more than just a quick cash-in on a cult classic or an overly devoted sequel. It stands on its own and adds many new layers to the question: ""What makes us human?""And it urges us on to find the truth in the rain.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As Beautiful and Intriguing as Tears in Rain...,"From an original 1982 theatrical showing to a Beta videotape, to a standard laserdisc, to a deluxe Criterion letterbox laserdisc, to a DVD, to a high-definition blu-ray, Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" has been viewed countless times in the original voice-over version, the European cut, the director's cut, and the final cut over the 35 years that followed its release. All those memories have not been lost in time, like tears in rain, but rather are indelible images from one of the greatest science fiction films. Thus, any thought of a sequel evokes mixed emotions. Despite the involvement of Ridley Scott, the results could be another disaster like ""More American Graffiti,"" or an undistinguished but palatable followup like ""2010,"" or a companion masterpiece like ""The Godfather Part II."" Fortunately, ""Blade Runner"" cultists can breathe a sigh of relief; while ""Blade Runner 2049"" may fall short of the unqualified masterpiece status of ""The Godfather"" sequel, at least on an initial viewing, the film enhances and builds upon, rather than diminishes, the original; however, only time will determine if ""BR2049"" will enjoy the same repeatability as the first film and join it as a timeless classic.Fresh from his outstanding work on ""Arrival,"" director Denis Villeneuve helmed ""BR2049"" with a steady hand and attention to detail, which were likely guided or inspired by Ridley Scott. Set thirty years ahead of the original film, Roger Deakins's career-best cinematography captures a future that is colder and bleaker than that portrayed by Jordan Cronenweth's original work, which has a warmer tone. However, Deakins's cooler hues are appropriate for 2049 Los Angeles, where snow has replaced rain and holographs rule rather than neon. Warm or cool, the atmospherics in both films are equally dazzling. The aurals are as captivating as the visuals; the haunting music by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch evokes the original Vangelis score without plagiarizing.The casting is also superb with Ryan Gosling spot on as K, the blade runner whose job, like Deckard's in the original film, is to retire renegade replicants. While the role may lack showy moments for an actor, Gosling's tall lean figure and enigmatic face create an image possibly more enduring than that of Harrison Ford in the original. Both Ford as an aging Rick Deckard and Edward James Olmos as a retired Gaff return to link the sequel to the first film. Among the newcomers, Robin Wright is well cast as Gosling's deadly serious, deathly pale Lieutenant Joshi of the LAPD. Ford and Olmos are not the only returnees, an origami figure and a small wood carving wordlessly connect the two Blade Runner films, and implanted memories, flying cars, outsized advertising, and transparent plastic raincoats also have encores.""Blade Runner"" cultists are best served seeing the sequel knowing little; the story unfolds as a policeman sent in pursuit of a mystery that expands upon threads in the original movie. Tthe film's length is arguably excessive, especially for those unfamiliar with the original, and ""Blade Runner"" novices may be left behind by a leisurely narrative that prizes visuals above action. However, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is that rarity of movie sequels, a film that enhances and elevates the original, yet stands on its own as a masterful film. The passage of time will determine if ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Blade Runner"" become the inseparably coupled films that ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" have become, but all the elements are in place.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A visual masterpiece,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan and absolutely love every movie he made, from his breakthrough drama 'Incendies' to the action thriller 'Sicario'. But when I learned that he was going to make a sequel to Ridley Scott's iconic Blade Runner I had mixed feelings. Would he be able to live up to the expectations and make a sequel that could measure itself with the original? For this reason, I went into the cinema thinking ''This will be a great movie, I am a Villeneuve fan so I have to like it'' but that was a mistake, for once I stopped expecting and just started experiencing the film, I was enchanted by all of its visual beauty. I was wrong to doubt Villeneuve; his 'Blade Runner 2049' even succeeds in transcending in some ways the original masterpiece, especially as a visual experience.The bleak dystopian future Scott so perfectly created is even more beautiful in Villeneuve's 2049, for which a lot of credit has to be given to the brilliant director of photography Roger Deakins, who has made one of his best works (which says a lot). Every shot is brilliant, I loved every single frame and I cannot imagine that he wouldn't get nominated and win an Oscar for this phenomenal work. But also a big thumbs up has to be given to the entire effects team, for Deakins didn't do it all on his own.Deakins isn't the only mastermind at work, for the score is also beautifully done. When I learned that composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (someone who has collaborated multiple times with Villeneuve and did most of the scores for his movies) got fired I was surprised; Jóhannsson has always delivered great work, but according to Villeneuve, his score ''wasn't the right one'' for this movie for it didn't ''resemble Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner'' quite enough. So he got replaced by probably the best man in the business nowadays; Hans Zimmer. And as we are used to with the German composer, this was once again sublime and a great homage to the original. Zimmer's 2049 score can be compared to his Dunkirk score, in a way that it unsettles us from the first chord and just as the Second World War movie, it keeps us on the edges of ours seats, especially during the last hour.As for the people who are actually situated in front of the camera, they all play their parts very well. I was especially happy that Ryan Gosling's agent K was indeed the leading man and he did a very good job. I was slightly concerned that it would mostly be about Harrison Ford's Deckard, but luckily that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, Ford gives one of his best performances in years and after all the iconic roles he played once again in recent years (Han Solo, Indiana Jones) this is by far the best. The smaller but important roles are also noteworthy; Robin Wright's Lieutenant Joshi makes a fierce and convincing police chief, while the villain duo Jared Leto's Neander Wallace as the evil head of a corporation at the top of the new world order and his frightening hit-woman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) are also very impressive. Last but not least, Ana de Armas is also very good as Joi, K's girlfriend (even if she does remind me a lot of Scarlet Johansson in 'Her' and slightly of Alicia Vikander in 'Ex Machina', but maybe that's something Villeneuve did that on purpose and wanted to pay homage to these recent but also very good science-fiction movies).That said, Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. For unlike most of Hollywood's blockbusters nowadays, he doesn't simply deliver us a spectacle with some nice effects or a reboot of the original, but he picks up the threads where Scott left, which was a monumental task, for the original 'Blade Runner' is one of the most impressive and iconic movies ever made. 2049 continues on the same topics raised by the original, making the sequel worth the 35-year long wait; it goes further with what was proposed in the first installment, enriching one another. It is possible that one day a third installment could be made, but that is only if any director will ever find the courage to make another 'Blade Runner', for the bar is raised incredibly high. I believe that in time, 'Blade Runner 2049' will just as the original one, grow into a cult movie, and rightfully so, for it is its own movie, but, just as the original, a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.I am not going to say more about it, because the studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics and the first movie viewers not to reveal any plot points, but I am glad they did. Even if I could go on and on about the movie and the difference between replicants and humans (or is there really much of a difference, after all?) the less you know the better, because 2049 feels at its best when it surprises (which is one of Villeneuve's greatest strengths). This is a movie best experienced on the biggest screen in your cinema; trust me, it will be worth your while. As for me, I will most likely try and make some free time in my schedule for the coming days, 'cause I want to go the cinema again, guess what I'm gonna watch...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

humanity's possible fate,"In 1982, Ridley Scott released ""Blade Runner"", based on Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". It had two focuses. One was the question of what makes us human, as the protagonist (Harrison Ford) starts to question his order to capture the renegade replicants. The other was the look at a dystopian future, as there's no connection to the natural world and the population gets bombarded by advertising everywhere.Now, ""Incendies"" and ""Arrival"" director Denis Villeneuve has released a sequel: ""Blade Runner 2049"". The sequel expands on the original's dystopian focus, as anyone with the economic means has departed the moribund planet. A new corporation has replaced the one from the original movie, and has continued making replicants. A new blade runner (Ryan Gosling) is the protagonist here, but there's more than meets the eye.The visuals are impressive.

A masterpiece of science fiction and possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made,"Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) and once again based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, it successfully recaptures just about everything excellent about the original and is a superb sequel to one of the greatest and most important science fiction films of all time.Thirty years after the events of the first film, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) works as a Blade Runner, retiring old rogue replicants (artificial humans) hiding out around the Los Angeles area. One day while on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of a replicant which leads him on a journey to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical and thought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point where I felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted to see. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who does a fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhaps best of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fully understand everything that is going on, although it would probably still help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that author Philip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing and engaging,"It is 2049, 30 years after the events of the previous movie. K is a Blade Runner, a policeman who tracks down and terminates replicants (androids) whose model are viewed dangerous to society. K is himself a replicant, but has been programmed to be beneficial to society. One day he tracks down and terminates a replicant that has managed to evade detection and capture for over 28 years. In his garden are found the remains of a female replicant. Shockingly, the woman died during childbirth and the baby appears to have survived. Replicants cannot reproduce. If word gets out that they can, the human-replicant hierarchy will forever be disturbed. K must find the child, quickly. Also after it is Niander Wallace, a billionaire whose company makes replicants and whose main interest is in changing the world order.An intriguing and engaging movie, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies, Sicario, Arrival) and co-written by Hampton Francher, who co-wrote the screenplay for the original Blade Runner. Good plot with some great twists and turns. Some clever manipulation of the viewer too, as you are funneled down one way of thinking, only to have things turn out in another direction. This unpredictability, and requirement that you use your brain, makes for some intriguing viewing.Great special effects, without being too show-offy and gratuitous. Great action scenes too.While I have seen the original Blade Runner (in all three forms), you don't have to have seen it in order to enjoy, or even understand, this one. It works fine as a standalone movie.Solid performances by all involved.On the negative side, the plot is not entirely water-tight. There are a few key moments where things take a turn for the implausible and contrived. The end result ultimately justified these turns, making me less critical of them, but the writers could easily have developed the plot around those moments more, in order to make them less loose and clumsy.Though I thought it was going to be, the running time of 163 minutes is not an issue. The movie never drags and the time just flies by.Great movie - certainly not your average sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pure Awesomeness,If anything just the visual look of this film makes it amazing. You can sit back and watch this thing on mute and still be wowed. In comparison to the original it doesn't really compare but its as good as a sequel/follow up could have possibly been and had just enough nostalgia to hit those soft spots. A brilliant film by a brilliant filmmaker.,,Anonymous,Mystery
90's vibes,"The movie took me back to the 90s with the futuristic visuals, its cooler-than-cool one-liners, and senselessly cruel yet plain villains. There's an excess in visual output to make up for a -at times- simplistic, poorly developed story. There's a hidden element that drives the story forward and causes intrigue, but many times the protagonist is moving aimlessly and the bigger picture seems to get lost. The movie as a whole tries to take off from simply a good movie to an excellent movie, but it doesn't reach the desired destination, nonetheless is well clear of being a bad movie. After the hidden element is uncovered, the movie seems to lose all drive, it uneventfully and slowly dies out until it reaches the credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Visually stunning and thought provoking, but not flawless","So, I didn't expect much from this sequel when it was announced, but since the original 'Blade Runner' is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made (if not the greatest), I had to see it anyways. As I often do, I didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers before going.So, where do we start... While not perfect, and inferior to the original, this is still a great movie. Visually it's simply stunning and the actors are all excellent. Just as importantly, or maybe even more so, like the original it combines a slow pace and fantastic ambiance to create an introspective mood and invite reflection on some important themes and issues of our time. (although, maybe, lacking a dialogue with the same power as the Roy Batty monologue at the end of the first movie).As some negative reviewers said, it is slow..... but that works well with the story and its intent to create a very clear, pervasive mood rather than to dazzle with dumb car chases, gunfights, or explosions,not to mention pushing the viewer to form his own opinions. The boringpart is subjective: for viewers who like to be challenged intellectually I'd say many action movies are a lot more boring. Nothing wrong with escapist movies, which I also enjoy when I'm in the right mood, but it doesn't change the fact that they're inherently much more predictable, superficial and formulaic. In other words, entertaining but intellectually boring.Regarding Blade Runner 2049, one disappointment, though, to be honest, was the soundtrack: aside from being too loud, it really consists mostly of weird sounds/noises etc. While they do heighten the mood at times, or fit the atmosphere, they are not really not up to the lofty standards of the photography, the action, or the direction.Also, the plot could have been a little tighter, and while the slow pace is what this movie needed, I'm not convinced it really had to be this long (or to touch on so many themes, as it does).Still, it's a fantastic, and unique, viewing experience, and even with its imperfections it does create a believable (if gloomy and depressing) dystopian vision of the future, and touches on themes that could spark endless debate and reflection. And herein lies its beauty: shallow popcorn movies will have faded from everybody's memory in weeks. A movie like Blade Runner 2049 will inspire us and challenge us,whether we agree with some of its vision or not, maybe even whether we love it or hate it, for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Back to the blade,"The original Blade Runner was a futuristic noir thriller. It did not need a sequel but maybe like another film released in 1982, Tron, the producers thought a belated sequel was required.Denis Villeneuve directs with Ridley Scott taking a hands off Executive Producer role. The visuals are still great but not as breathtaking as the original film. We see a dark multi ethnic rain soaked LA with giant billboards.Ryan Gosling plays Agent K, a replicant whose job is to retire the older replicants produced in the era of the original film. The newer replicants are OK still being used as slave workers.Agent K comes across some buried bones which again leads to an investigation into identity, false memories and the whereabouts of an impossible child, now grown up.Jared Leto plays the mad messianic Wallace, the man who has taken over the Tyrell corporation and produces replicants but wants to creates life. He thinks Agent K will find the answers and sends one of his replicants out to assist and hinder his mission.Harrison Ford returns as Deckard who hangs around in a desolate Las Vegas hotel with holographic images of Elvis and Frank Sinatra who might hold the clues to what happened to the child.Blade Runner 2049 is really an overlong art film, it actually lacks the thriller element of the original film even some of the weird humour. I rewatched the original Blade Runner before I saw the sequel, despite the po-faced narration his Deckard provides some humour.Blade Runner 2049 has a few cameos from the original film including an iconic recreation of a replicant which excellent use of CGI.However the pacing and length is a negative, the story is not strong enough to sustain it although I have to credit the writers to lead you up one way and them wrong foot the viewer.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beautiful Atmosphere and an Interesting Mystery Help Blade Runner 2049 Continue a Classic Story,"I've only seen the original Blade Runner once and it was a long time ago. I liked it but I just haven't got around to revisiting it. I mention this because even though I'm not a die-hard fan of Blade Runner, I still found the plot of 2049 engrossing. It's a well put together mystery, I found that they constantly took the plot in unexpected directions and other than the trailer spoiling the return of Deckard, I was always excited about what was going to happen next. The movie pulls an excellent bait and switch at the end that really surprised me. They made the right decision to not repeat the formula of the first one and take the story to a new place. They also create some compelling subplots which is something that few movies get right.The biggest star of this movie is the cinematography and the excellent work of Roger Deakins. The original was noteworthy with the special environment that Ridley Scott and his creative team brought to the screen. That was continued here if not improved upon. The look of L.A. in 2049 they decided to go with isn't completely distinct but it was a little more understated (I'd compare it to the 2017 Ghost in the Shell but less fantastical). My favourite scene might have been a shootout in a defunct club where the lighting and the background show are turning on and off. I don't hesitate to praise when a movie looks good but this is an exemplary example of using visuals and atmosphere to help build on a strong story.Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously.There were points in this movie I could have rated this a 9/10 but some small things that I had to dock the movie for. Even with a compelling story, the movie has such a long run time that it couldn't help but drag. There are certain scenes where the movie wants you to really drink in the environment but they could have edited it a little tighter. They also couldn't help but lose me at points through how much artistic flair the utilize. Villenueve is an authority in this area and while I appreciate an artistic approach to this science fiction tale, for me they overdid it a little.I was surprised how much I ended up liking Blade Runner 2049. I think if you're a big fan of the original, you'll love this to bits. This is successful in bringing in the uninitiated but I think fans will enjoy this even more. I haven't been on board for all of Villenueve's films but this is a good combination of his artistic style with enough of a commercial element for the masses. I'd give this somewhere between an 8-9 but with the extremely long run time, I'll give this an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great visuals but ...............,"Plenty of raving reviews, but I do not agree with the masterpiece verdict by many reviewers. The original was complex, but yet simple to understand, and as the plot unfolds, the story engages you through the film. This sequel looks fantastic , and the performances are great, yet something is missing. A straight forward plot, with a flowing script would have a made a huge difference. Sitting through 150 minutes of drama, yet struggling to make sense of it, seems to me that the maker failed in the business of screen story telling. I was disappointed and found the first film so much better than this big budget fare. Dalton trumbo please help us as today's science fiction big budget films are in the main failing to be anything like as entertaining as they should be. Better script writers & screen story tellers are so important,yet it seems that simplicity is being substituted by muddled messy big budget effects, all for the sake of being so much cleverer than the dumb audience. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a film, a pity a few of these over hyped directors, don't have a rethink on what it takes to entertain an audience .

"everything Blade Runner did right, done wrong","Imagine Blade Runner without a strong directorial vision, an interesting story, or engaging characters. If you find that impossible to imagine, just watch the forgettable sci-fi flick Blade Runner 2049.Instead of the distinct '40s-noir of the original, 2049 offers scale without purpose and a dusty color palette. Instead of riveting, distinct, excellently-acted characters, you've got sturdy but unforgettable people. Blade Runner was full of amazing moments and places, such as the room of living toys and Rutger Hauer's every word, but 2049 has nothing but a bland lead and a bunch of characters whose motives can't be looked at too closely.Scenes come not out of the story but out of a desire to have something happened, resulting in pointless interactions like the tormenting of a naked replicant. There aren't so much huge plot holes as poor motivations and small inconsistencies that make everything in the movie feel false.If you don't compare this to Blade Runner, it's a mediocre but almost-watchable movie with the occasional interesting idea (the talking, naked ad, the memory designer's creation of a birthday party), but as a sequel to a classic, this movie is a travesty.And how is it that a futuristic L. A. heavily influenced by Japanese culture has no Asians in the entire city? It's as though there's no detail so big or small that the filmmakers won't ignore it.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I watched Ana de Armas glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate,"Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all.The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.The Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A refreshing sequel that is more art than commercial,"So on first viewing I am delighted to say that this is a true sequel to the original yet able to stand alone. Unlike other franchise reboots this chooses to pay homage to the original and thankfully avoids the temptation of being unabashedly commercial.I am a big fan of the original. I might even give BR2049 a 10 on later viewings.It wasn't what I was expecting so I can say a big thumbs up to those critics (and YouTubers) who agreed not to publish any spoilers. I found myself admiring the blade runner 2049 visuals without finding them distracting or in any way self-serving. Bravo to both Denis and Roger for pulling that off.I have to say that this is a true Sci-fi movie, a movie that will satisfy die hard fans of Sci-fi books. Hampton Fancher has done a truly awesome job of creating story and a script which would stand up well next to the bibliography of Philip K Dick.At no stage did this movie feel like an imitation of the first. The cast is a great fit, the score is sublime, the pacing it similar but different, the cinematography outstanding, the story and script original, the whole feel seems just right.Am I alone in this appreciation? Probably not. Half the audience will have never have seen the original in the cinema and yet we all clapped in unison, old and young when the credits began to run.Thank you to all those involved in this project.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not that good,"This film is not that sophisticated. It's pretty low on scifi film IQ scale. And yet there were people applauding the thing when it ended last night at the San Francisco Meteron.Anyone who read comics in the 70s and 80s will recognize the plot points in this film, and will know just how cliché and predictable this film was and is.A ""cop"" going after a rogue AI. Okay, fine, but wasn't the whole idea behind Replicants from the first film was that they were sociopathic, and that after a while they developed emotions they didn't know how to deal with? That's never really explored in this film, but it's kind of implied that you have some kind of loose knowledge of this in order to understand (so to speak) some of this film's story's basis.Truly this film's basic tale comes out of the graphic novel boom of the late 1980s, when the audience who read superhero comic books were holding onto their childhood icons and continued to buy more of those publications. The producers of said material put out more comics with slightly more sophisticated or adult material (and no, I don't mean sexually explicit, just stuff that had romance with some sex hinted at). That's pretty much all this movie is, and with a villain who is pretty cliché and one-dimensional.I could hit on this thing scene by scene, and break it down as to just how predictable and actually unintelligent this film is, but I'd probably violate the ""don't tell"" rule.This film puts on the pretense of being high-minded, but is just fairly slow. And even the ""big finale"" wasn't much of a surprise, again as if Frank Miller or one of the other noted comic book authors had written this film. For anyone who's read his work (say the ""Dark Knight"" series from the late 80s), you'll know what I mean when I say that this new Blade Runner puts on a presentation of being about more than what it actually is.Little of the important matters are resolved in the end, and all you get is this very female oriented payoff at the end of the film. Science Fiction is supposed to be about ideas, ideals, and the such challenged with radical changes in society and technology. That's what films like ""Planet of the Apes"" or ""Outland"" or any of the classic 1960's Star Trek episodes are all about. If you want to tell a soap opera, then go see one of the old standbys like ""General Hospital"" or ""As the World Turns"", but leave my genre alone.I truly wish I could write and say more in this review, but again I'll get slapped by the powers that be for potentially ruining the film going experience for anyone inclined to go anyway after reading what I've written here.Oh Roger Ebert, where are you when we need you...",,Anonymous,Mystery
So 35 years of wait is finally over... Was it worth the wait???,"This is my updated review as I feel I did not do the movie justice and I have also increased my score of the movie...
I was one of the lucky ones who got to see an early preview.... And the more that time passes by and the more the story of Blade Runner 2049 sinks in the more the gravity of the story hits me... First of all it really was not what I was expecting... I had watched many trailers and interviews and I feel like I had done quite a successful job in staying away from spoilers.... 
And....
Without spoiling it for anyone else and giving too much away.... Whatever you think you know about the film... well, forget it.... You're way off the mark... 
The best advice I can give though is however dark you think Blade Runner 2049 is.... It's darker than that.... It's much darker than the original... And the original was quite dark.... The cinematography is beautiful... it really is stunning... but the film itself.... did I mention it was dark??.. I think this is amplified (excuse the pun) by the movie's soundtrack... The work of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch was for me... at times.... malevolent... And perhaps if the music wasn't so dark and hostile the movie itself wouldn't come across like that also... But then what do I know?... That's not to say the music is bad... It was for me.... like I said malevolent.... As for the movie itself... Again without giving too much away.... It's a story of loneliness.... A story of wanting nothing more than to be accepted... It's a story of desperate hope and anguish... Wanting for a better life.... Replicants being more human than humans, being more perfect than humans.... but not being human and wanting nothing more than to be human... even for all the faults the human race has and the perfection of the replicant race... Still the desperate hope and anguish of wanting to be human.... Are you keeping up??... And this whole time living in a dystopian world.... where the future of the human race is a lost cause and Mother Earth has never looked so heartbroken.... 
Speaking of heartbreak... again without spoiling the story... be prepared... the whole story is a story of heartbreak and literally at every turn Ryan Gosling is having his heart broken.... whether that be his relationships with others or his life in general... For me Ryan Gosling has a knack of playing the lonely leading role... and he has done this on a few occasions now.... both in the movies - ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"".... which I hope he doesn't end up being typecast in... but saying that... I don't think there is an actor alive today who can play the role of being totally isolated from the rest of the world better than Ryan Gosling.
Blade Runner 2049 did have some nice surprises... which again... I won't spoil... 
In closing.... Ryan Gosling is excellent... It is Harrison Ford's best work for years.... This overall review may sound like I'm being negative about Blade Runner 2049... But I'm not... I'm really not...I should also mention the performances from the female leading acts in the show. Ana de Armas, Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks are all very, very good and each and every one of them. Including all the crew should be proud of such a beautiful sequel.As for where it stands next to the original... I never thought I'd hear myself saying this but I think as years pass by it will stand next to the original Blade Runner quite easily.... It's not the same movie as the original but it is as good as the original in its own right...
I think Ryan Gosling said it best in an interview
The film is incredible... it's.... haunting...
With this in mind a few days have passed now and I am still left with a feeling of being haunted by Blade Runner 2049.... 
So much so that I want to see it again and I will go and see it again... and again... and again....
Just like I did the original...
Blade Runner 2049 ""is"" incredible....
It's...

Unnecessary but Exquisite Sequel,"When I had heard the news that there was a sequel to Blade Runner in the works, I thought it was a ludicrous idea. But with a fantastic and proven director attached and with the original director producing I decided to give it a shot. Of course the trailer blew my friends and I away with its stunning visuals but I remained hesitant. Once I saw the movie I went in expecting disappointment. Fortunately I was terribly wrong to be so worried! The movie was perfect. It had a compelling plot, creative story-telling, and beautiful sets and CGI. Settings were unique and characters were interesting. The movie keeps your eyes glued to the screen and guessing til the very end.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too long and consequently loses its impact,"I have to start this review by admitting two things: 1) I wasn't a big fan of the original 'Blade Runner' and 2) I very rarely enjoy films based around AI (Artificial Intelligence). I find that they too often ask you to care about a robot and I simply find that very difficult to do. After watching the original recently I gave the sequel a chance hoping it would be a very different film since it was made 35 years later. And while it is different in a lot of ways (and undoubtedly a better made film in my opinion) it still suffered from similar flaws.First of all the film is far too long. Nearing 3 hours is just ridiculous considering very little actually happens in terms of story development. Compare it to a film like 'The Dark Knight' and the incredibly complex story arcs that it possessed and it still managed to come in at 2 and a half hours. For a film to be this long the pacing has to be immaculate and while it wasn't terrible in 'Blade Runner 2049' it certainly couldn't justify the runtime it had.I was a big fan of the cast. Harrison Ford was the stand-out. He was captivating to watch in every scene he had. I knew he wasn't a happy man on the original's set, but this time around he put his heart and soul into his performance and it showed. Jared Leto was also a nice cast addition, however he wasn't in the film anywhere near enough for my liking.There are some really great moments interspersed in this film and with a little more of those the film could have been something truly special. The scene with the two girls combined into one (that sounds weird, but you'll know what I mean once you've seen the film) and the final shot of the film were both masterfully done and very special moments that don't deserve to be forgotten. Who knows though, maybe they'll make another cut of this film one day and turn it into something great.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
2049: Do androids (still) dream of electric sheep?,"After a 30 years gap, this continuation answers almost all the questions remaining at the end of the first episode (you'd better watch it before or read a good abstract in order to understand...), but it opens even deeper existential interrogations!Compared to 1982, it introduces some newer technologies (drones, holograms, augmented reality) and suggests some present themes (racism {against androids}, gender and clothing issues, human food {from insects}, bees dying, possible loss of digital memories {total blackout}).It uses some audio archives and a short sequence from the original footage, which allows a key character to make an incredible come back!

"Excellent, Intellectual Science Fiction","This is an amazing piece of work. It has incredible artistry. As a visual exercise, it is breathtaking. I thought the original was way ahead of its time in creating a milieu, a dystopian world, full of disease and commercialism. Given the wonders of modern times, the world where this takes place is nonpareil. Ryan Gosling is out to eliminate the old replicants because there is a secret which needs to kept. The hierarchy is doing what it can to keep a world event from eliminating the awful world they have created. Goslin has memories, but they could have been implanted in him, so he is continually torn by dealing with details that may or may not be true. He needs to return to the place of his childhood. Harrison Ford reprises his original role of Deckard, now old and living in the ruins of Las Vegas. Evil is in control, but there is hope. The final scenes are incredible and puzzling, but it is a great challenge to the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Did not ruin the image of Blade Runner - hardest thing to achieve,"Beautiful image, very good acting, good story with powerful symbolism and bad music. That sums up the movie. For excessive verbosity and self-important attitude you can read other reviews below.Stayed true to the original in many ways and that's important for fans of the original BR. Remember that the original BR had a pretty cold reception in the early 80s. Who knows how this one will be perceived a decade from now. And yes, I do miss Vangelis; the movie really came to life when they played pieces of his original music. Zimmer just didn't seem to understand the project.Those who complain that the movie is long and slow clearly have the attention span of a 5-year-old and should probably stick to Fast & Furious.Blade Runner 2049 could have been more but it could have been a lot less too. Thankfully enough it wasn't. I'm not ecstatic, but not disappointed at all and I realize that my expectations have been incredibly high. I will go see it a second time for sure.EDIT Oct 13 after seeing the movie a second time (in 3D). I'd like to upgrade my rating from 8 to 10 if y'all don't mind. Blade Runner 2049 is a 150-million-dollar gift to a small but dedicated fan group of the original movie. Thank you for that gift. I don't think there's any sequel in the history of cinema that stays true to the original to the point where even the tiniest details - noticeable only by hardcore fans who've watched BR 1982 thirty times - are being transplanted into this new film. And, no, BR 2049 did not make Blade Runner mainstream as some complain here. On the contrary, it kept its secrets open only to the same group of initiates, with the possibility of others from the younger generation to join, if they have what it takes. As many of the reviews below testify this movie still remains a mystery to most people out there, whose ability to digest abstract ideas is unfortunately very low.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Outstanding, long awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 original","Blade Runner 2049 - Arrival director Denis Villeneuve creates a lengthy,yet outstanding follow up to Ridley Scott's compelling sci- fi film noir.For those who have either never seen or, for a good while, haven't seen the original 1982 Blade Runner, it would behoove them to watch it and familiarize/ re-familiarize themselves with it. Sicario/Arrival helmer Denis Villeneuve has forged such a excellent, tightly connected sequel to Ridley Scott's enthralling, and futuristic sci-fi noir, that most elements will be foreign if you don't look back at what's happened before.Notwithstanding, after 35 years of near unbearable patience, the long awaited follow up to a film that has been called, the most compelling vision of the future ever created, has finally arrived. Blade Runner 2049 is thankfully, a direct sequel to it's illustrious predecessor, logically as well as creatively attached to the previous events of the early 80's innovative film.Thirty years following Rick Deckard's running off with Rachel, during the only hope filled, sunlit scene in the original Blade Runner, there obviously has been some considerable changes, in the City of Angels, and our world since then, whereas some have remained constant. Suitable title cards grant us a brief history so all can catch up with what has transpired, picking up in the 2020's up to the present year. This includes a devastating event called Blackout which completely paralyzes all of human society.Because of rebellious ""flaws"" in the Tyrell Corporations Nexus replicants, they eventually went bankrupt, and the company is taken over by blind industrialist Niandor Wallace (Jared Leto), riding in on a proverbial white horse to save the day. He is the brilliant creator of the new Nexus 9 model replicants who are remarkably more obedient than their dissident forebears - and still used for slave labor. His careful study of human history has reminded him that civilizations were built on the backs of slaves. Plus, as he soberly admits, he can only make so many.Naturally, some of the old Nexus 6, 7 and 8 skin jobs are still around, and as always, ""retired"" by Blade Runners like LAPD officer K (Ryan Gosling). During a retirement mission involving Guardians of the Galaxy's Dave Bautista as humble farmer Sapper Morton, he discovers a small metal box buried under the side of a tree by the replicant's house. Upon a thorough investigation he discovers information concerning a certain fellow Blade Runner and female Nexus 6 replicant from 30 years prior.The archaic data has such riveting implications, it eventually leads K to that certain fellow Blade Runner, namely Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard, to find concrete answers to something that could effect all of humanity- including replicants. Something no one, probably not even Dr. Tyrell, could have possibly conceived.Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (based on Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep), was definitely unlike any other film most, if not some, had ever seen, especially the opening fade in of a dark foreboding Los Angeles showcasing a stark array of austere buildings, and flames of fire literally shooting from the tops of incredibly tall skyscrapers. Cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner have perfect sc-fi noir chemistry in re- creating that same atmosphere,notwithstanding a few more hope filled, slightly subdued sunlit scenes to counterbalance the dark ones. Even Han Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's sterling score is evocative of Greek composer Vangelis's haunting music that perfectly melded with the film's disquieting resonance.While it's agreeable to see a fresh young, face, aggressively carrying out his duties of what is still called a Blade Runner, even after 30 years, the most provocative mainstay is definitely the return of Harrison Ford. 2049 simply could not have been done without him. It takes awhile within the 2 hour, 40 minute plus running time to finally re-introduce him to fans. But it's well worth the avid anticipation. Ford's Rick Deckard provides sufficient closure to a story fans have been waiting for since 1982.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing,"I believe the original Blade Runner is one of the greatest films ever made, a real piece of art where everything, story, directing, acting, photography and music blends to perfection. This sequel film unfortunately feels almost all over the place, story is irrelevant and difficult to follow, directing is nerveless and academic, dialogues are riddles, acting is superficial and one dimensional.

A shining neon-glowing sequel.,"This review of Blade Runner 2049 is spoiler free***** (5/5)WHEN RIDLEY SCOTT released the first Blade Runner back in 1982 it was unlike anything before it, it was essentially more than just a film with an impressively compelling performance from Harrison Ford, it was immediately noticed as a technological accomplishment filled to the brim with an impressive collection of special effects – the moving holographic billboards were enough to make your eyes pop, the flying cars which now are more of a fantasy than a reality and a combination humans and robots called replicants. It really achieved higher than any other sci-fi before and even after the time – which essentially is why today it goes down as a masterpiece and perhaps the best that cinema has ever been. However when French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve announced that he was going to do a sequel long time fans were sceptical about it saying that it wouldn't be as good, it would give the predecessor a bad name and won't go down as well.Emphatically now at the long-awaited release of Blade Runner 2049 you can erase your fears as this is by far the best a sci-fi sequel has ever been. We open with Ryan Gosling's Officer KD6-3.7 a Blade Runner for the Los Angeles Police Department who's on a case to bring in any old replicants while on the case he unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos which could destroy everything they have come to know. Set in a world where the Earth is left in anarchy after an event which shook the world and brought the people of the city into fear shattering previous memories everything is left empty seemingly without repair. The film erupts from the opening reel as Villeneuve drags you into the often lonely life of Gosling's policeman who tries everything to repair his life back to the way it was, his character is complex yet cleverly thought out thanks to a script penned by Hampton Fancher and co-writer Michael Green they give his character a simple story but he's emotional too dealing with feelings way beyond his thoughts. And for any of you La La Landers out there Gosling is on top of his game much like Ford's performance in the film's predecessor he's incredible and brings a powerful dynamic to his story and essentially the film would be nothing without him.As an experience it's a must see especially in IMAX – it's loud ominous score quakes around the halls shattering your eardrums from the vibrations, the beautiful giant holographic billboards are enough to make your eyes pop just looking at the colour and the bright city lights and the sci-fi action is riveting and fast paced. Immediately after entering the live futuristic city of Los Angeles it's clear that Villeneuve is right at home here using the same directing techniques he's become accustomed with during Sicario, Prisoners or indeed Arrival using impressive close-ups, stunning long shots and eye-shattering panoramic shots. However at a runtime of 2 hours 43 minutes it's quite a long marathon that you will have to exercise for before stepping into the theatre yet that exercise is worth and is thoroughly paid off.Stylistically it is a Blade Runner film so for long-time fans the environment will be all too familiar and producer Scott who's happy to be back in this territory he makes every collection of images as real as possible bringing Villeneuve's imagination to life it really doesn't get any better than this. Happily when Ford's Rick Deckard comes onto the audience smiles from ear-to-ear. Story wise his character is a bit like Luke Skywalker from Star Wars: The Force Awakens he has been missing for thirty years and there is an extensive search for him. When found, Rick doesn't take to K at first he immediately thinks that K is trying to kill him. Here Ford now 75 years old looks a little worse for wear as if he's been lost aching for a little company which has been missing from his life and he brings this emotion into his character's grief giving him some emotional prowess which thanks to his stunning performance pays off.Happier still, the action is incredible there are only a few action scenes but each one is as brutal as the previous time round – Villeneuve introduces the action scenes as a cinematic thespian adding momentum to the white knuckle punches and a deafening ping from the two characters' blasters which surprisingly look as good as new. The action is relentless, fast-paced and utterly riveting from a wide-eyed opening fight scene with Dave Bautista's Sapper Morton, through electric chase scenes to a brutal final fight scene they are compelling and Villeneuve lets them play their toll painting a shiny gloss to the end credits. What Villeneuve has created in Blade Runner 2049 is an impressive, compelling and brilliant sci-fi sequel that shines with a glossy finish and will still look good with multiple viewings and is an experience that will last for decades to come.VERDICT: An impressive exercise of stunning colour, immersive CG images and incredible techniques Villeneuve's sequel isn't just a movie, it's a technological accomplishment, and is by far this year's best film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job","Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) a young and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studio executives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a rising blockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a serious movie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script and improvise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) a bunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would look and sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most of all, e) a post-Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels like Coppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinvent the language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring at all about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, Blade Runner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breaking stereotypes like ""good guy kills bad guy at the end"" and dealing with existential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within the context of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.Blade Runner 2049 is none of these things. On the contrary, it's the flawed triumph of a next generation of studio executives, who control the creative process by paying millions to the industry's best of the best, providing they will make something that will take advantage of a successful brand name in order to bring profits to shareholders. If there is one word to describe this movie, it's ""replicant"". Not the kind of replicant who realizes that ""all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain"" as he dies, but a sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job that will try to entertain you and if it succeeds will return as a sequel that will eventually become yet another franchise. I spent 160 minutes of my life watching a pleasant and perfectly constructed piece of nothing, and I didn't care for a moment about any of the characters or a storyline that was designed without the intention to question and redefine a single thing. All its moments have already been lost in my memory, while the original Blade Runner remains vivid in my mind, as if I only saw it yesterday.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Surprisingly Worthy Sequel,"As a devoted Blade Runner fan, I was very reluctant to see this film when it was first released in 2017 because of Hollywood's horrible track record of sequels and remakes.
It took me till 2021 to finally watch it and only now am I kicking myself for not seeing it in the theatre. I was filled with relief that it didn't disappoint.
This movie excels in every way. The story, the special effects, and the acting are top notch. Yes, the slow pace and long running time can be a turnoff to most movie goers especially if they've never seen the original but those two factors only allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the film's beauty and be pulled deeper into the characters.
I've seen a lot of terrible reviews for this film and it makes me think of how many terrible reviews the original Blade Runner received after its release. Perhaps years from now this movie will eventually get the praise it deserves This movie is a welcome surprise and a worthy addition to the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Masterpiece of the highest order,"First let me just say that I am not going to spoil any of the plot points of this movie as the director has himself insisted not to and I urge the reviewers to come to respect his wish.Now let me just start by saying the original Blade Runner was one of the most influential sci-fi film to be ever made. Some people may not like it as it is very slow paced and deeply philosophical and I respect their opinion but you cannot deny its legacy. As it so happens Blade Runner 2049 might just fall on the same category.Directed by Denis Villeneuve who directed Incedies, Prisoners(another masterpiece), Arrival, Sicario and Enemy has outdone himself. This is seriously his best film to date. Even though this is a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved in whatsoever he has managed to expand its universe extremely elegantly and marked his directorial trademark in it. I won be surprised if he is put in the same bracket as Kubrick, Spielberg, Tarantino, Scorsese, Eastwood in the coming years.Talking about greatness we have director of photography propelled by Roger Deakins who already had his hands on Shawshawnk Redemption, No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, The Big Lebowski and Fargo to just name a few and to think he has never won an Oscar despite being nominated 13 times. Well this is about to change this year or you cannot ever take Academy seriously because I strongly believe this is his best work. The way he uses color palette is quite remarkable to watch and it might just be one of the best looking film to ever exist.Acting wise Harrison Ford gives one of his performance in a long time. You can just feel he loved working on this film(unlike that reboot on 2015). I have always been a fan of Ryan Gosling since Drive(another Neo-Noir masterpiece) and after watching this I am convinced that he is one of the best actor working today. Jared Leto gives a another stellar performance as expected from an Academy winner. Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas all are impressive with their given role.Another thing that made the original Blade Runner so iconic was the soundtrack. And with this film it is no exception. Though this has Hans Zimmer Benjamin Wallfisch collaborating it feels a individual work like the first one.What else can I say? No praise is enough for what I just witnessed. This is one of those films that will inspire people to be filmmakers, that will make people realize why we go to cinemas and spent our hard earned cash, that will continue to put cinemas as art forms. Just go to the biggest theater possible and witness an piece of modern art put on by extremely visionary and talented people. You will not regret it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is why we watch movies,"As the final scene of 'Bladerunner 2049' came to an end and the credits began to roll I found myself a bit shocked that nearly 3 hours had elapsed.I had spent the entirety of the run-time completely entranced into the world Denis Villeneuve and his crew had masterfully constructed.To be swept up in the imagination and realized vision of artists who take such care with every shot is a fine experience to have in the cinema. 'Bladerunner' 2049' seemingly transcends being a mere sequel and becomes a full fledged film in it's own right. A film that just happens to share a universe with another.While the story and themes of 'Bladerunner 2049' are familiar they are done with such finesse that we can't help but feel empathy for the characters as they struggle to find their humanity, or simply try to make a connection.There are small flaws in the film if you choose to go over it with a microscope, but the best way to watch 'Bladerunner 2049' is to let it wash over your senses and to just experience it.This is why we watch movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Blade Runner 2049,"This is a review I wrote in 2017 for Blade Runner 2049 - the much awaited sequel to the hauntingly spectacular original directed by Ridley Scott.Whilst Denis Villenueve has forged his own path with the second instalment of this futuristic tale of humans and replicants, there were certainly enough nods to the original to ensure that this was indeed a close relative if not 'brothers'. The cinematography was visually amazing - the USA of the not too distant future depicted awash with red dust, almost post-apocalyptic deserted cities and given recent political shenanigans in the real US., possibly not surprisingly, a great deal of Russian influence in the style and culture of the remaining social and architectural landscape.Gosling provides us with the dour yet stoic 'K/Joe', our titular character as the Blade Runner, tasked with rounding up remaining old-style replicants from an Earth which has pretty much been destroyed by humans, most of whom have since elected to live 'off world'. The few remaining humans carry out their day to day life amid a society which is largely occupied by modern replicants who seem to have found their own level or semblance of 'life'.The normally delectable Jared Leto could be criticised for his performance as blind creator of the replicant civilisation, Wallace, but I would disagree. His jarring, slightly wooden and emotionless depiction of one of the highest placed humans in terms of social and economic stature, cleverly illustrates that the most inhuman being in this dark world is in fact made of flesh and blood.The ever-present driving rain makes even the broadest vista seem strangely claustrophobic as our hero makes a life-changing discovery and invites the viewer to question their own life, it made me ask 'what kind of human am I?' 'Am I all that I can be?' Whether intended or not, I feel the message is that life, in whatever form it has been presented, is a gift and it is up to every single being to make sure that it isn't wasted.All in all a stunning film that although may never match the raw emotion of Rutger Hauer's final 'tears in the rain' soliloquy, it offers a simple yet age old message that is creatively delivered and stylishly told.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing... but still worth seeing,"This film had so much potential. It has great acting, wonderful and innovative special effects, lavish and imaginative environments, unique science fiction elements, it feels realistic, the music and tone are spot on, the cinematography is the kind you can watch for days... they only forgot story, and unfortunately that's kind of important.I was secretly hoping that they would have gone back to the source material, the original source material: the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep."" The themes explored in that book are compelling and fascinating and include morality, religion, and what it means to be human. The original ""Blade Runner"" adopted some of these themes. This film abandons them. Because of that, it feels soulless, nothing but a pantomime of the original.I think that the primary plot failing is that ""Blade Runner 2049"" lays itself bare. We know right from the start who is a replicant and who is human. This strips out the heart of what (to me) makes Blade Runner special: the questioning of what it actually means to be human and the juxtaposition of humans acting like androids and androids acting with selfless humanity. Very little of that is to be found in this film.Walking out, I was left scratching my head at what themes they actually were trying to get at here. None are readily apparent. So it ends up being a cool looking, atmospheric action/sci-fi flick. That's makes it a good movie, but doesn't make it a ""masterpiece.""People still talk about the original ""Blade Runner,"" 30 years after it's release. Nobody will be talking about this movie when the year 2049 actually rolls around.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars.,"To be honest with the reader of this review, I had never seen the first Blade Runner however it had been near the top of my ""must- watch"" science fiction movie list in my head for a very long while now and I decided to watch this movie expecting an exciting sci-fi blockbuster with action-packed car chases rolling in all over the place. Surprisingly this film was not the ""good action-packed popcorn fun for the whole family"" that I was expecting and the film actually takes the slower, more patient and realistic approach with it's storytelling rather than a lot of car chases and rushed editing. This is a very similar film to the likes of A Fistful Of Dollars because the main character, Ryan Gosling, resembles the personality of Clint Eastwood's character in A Fistful Of Dollars, the musical score carries away the movie like A Fistful Of Dollars, the pacing remains slow however manages successfully to keep our interest like A Fistful Of Dollars and the film carries an incredibly dark, bleak tone much like A Fistful Of Dollars.I'm glad I saw this movie earlier than most people because then I can write a good review for this movie so that more people can consider watching it before the negative remarks start coming in. Before those come in, let me remind you that this movie is pure, bleak, raw and dark science-fiction to the core that goes with the dedication to telling a story rather than the dedication to kill as much people as possible. It goes with the more slow approach which some people may find a bad thing but others like me will find a good thing. But I think something all viewers will respect here in this movie is the intense cinematography that is common in a lot of other Denis Villeneuve movies and the fascinating special effects as well as the subtle performances by Ryan Gosling who understands the character he is playing and doesn't overdo it. Ryan Gosling's character is an interesting one because although he is emotionless and straight- forward we, as the viewers, can detect that there is more to this character and throughout the movie we slowly start to see a bit more of his own self. Blade Runner 2049 focuses mostly on the main character and if you are going to see this movie expecting Harrison Ford to have a lot of screen time that is similar to the length of Ryan Gosling's screen time, you're very wrong because Harrison Ford only plays a minor role in this movie which is, although important, not the main focus of the movie. Even if someone can view this movie as a science-fiction movie, someone can also view this movie as a character piece instead depending on their preference because of how much dedicated focus is on the main character.When the movie was finished and all was done, despite the reasonably long runtime I still felt that the movie should of been even longer. Because I don't like to be sentimental I gave myself thirty seconds and then I got up from my chair and walked out as the credits rolled despite me still being in a very deep emotional zone however I want you to know that the emotional zone was almost impossible to get out of. As I was walking out I still saw a person watching the credits in his chair and I understood that he was also in a very deep emotional state and people usually do that so that they look cool to their friends, but the person I saw really was in an emotional zone - I could tell. I could also tell that I wasn't the only one that enjoyed this movie in the room and I was relieved because I was a bit afraid that people wouldn't like it because of it's more slower approach than other science-fiction movies. I was incredibly glad that someone else understood the style of the movie.I'm not going to spoil any more of the movie but I will leave a last note to say that Blade Runner 2049 is an incredibly dark and intense movie that is probably one of the best science-fiction movies I've seen that has been made in the last five years so it very much is a masterpiece. If a futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars sounds bloody good to you, then you'd be killing yourself if you didn't pay this movie a visit at your nearest cinema. In my personal opinion, the film was most definitely a masterpiece and it has me even more excited for seeing the original starring Harrison Ford in the main role.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pale shadow of the original,"Great opening, beautiful imagery, powerful and emotive soundtrack. What could go wrong? Well...Pedestrian script. None of the truly existential and thought provoking story from the original. The characters were mostly one- dimensional, never surprising (none like Roy Batty, mass-murderer who in his final moments saves the life of the man who hunted and killed all the people he cared about). To be fair there were some interesting interactions, but they were few and far between.Where the beautiful scenes of the original were poignant and well paced, the sequel dragged them out to the point of being ponderous. I actually started shuffling in my seat through a couple of the particularly drawn-out ones (note: I NEVER shuffle).A lot of ""huh?"" moments - like when Ryan Gosling's replicant runs through a 6-inch thick concrete wall. While they are tough they are still flesh, blood and bone - not the Terminator (for reference Roy Batty stuck his head through a plaster wall that was tiled - still tough, but physically possible). There were a number of other scenes that were not believable or where actions seemed unnecessary (sorry I didn't want to include spoilers).In a nutshell, it's an ""ok"" movie that could be drastically improved with some vigorous editing. Unfortunately the mediocre script and story will ultimately stop it from ever becoming a classic like the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Absolutely, without doubt the worst film I have ever seen","I still remember seeing the original Blade Runner. The theater was empty, and I knew nothing about the film. Yet, even though I was concerned that I made a poor choice, I was immediately drawn to the story, or rather - hooked into it, and could not help but fall in love with that film. What a relief it was to find that over time many others realized that original Blade Runner had a true value - which was missed by most reviewers at the time. Exact opposite is true of the Blade Runner sequel: it gets decent reviews and that only solidifies my belief that all new releases by major studios get reviews ""made to order"". It does not matter any more whether a film is good or bad; the only thing that matters is - how good is your PR campaign, which often means - dirty PR such as buying votes and positive reviews. Why is this film bad? There are many reasons, and I hate to give away spoilers, so I will tread gently. But before I start, I will just say that around 30 or 40 min mark I wanted to walk out. The only reason I did not, is because I had to see this film. But it was way too painful.The first problem with this film is simple: lack of a good or at least watchable story. The film starts with some guy growing some fat, ugly larvae in a pool. Film-making rule #1: do not start a film with repulsive imagery. At least not before you set a tone. Film-making rule #2: make sure you show us what the main protagonist is after - and why. No such a thing here. Even when in the end we find out what is going on and so on, we are never really convinced about the importance of it all. Again, I have to refrain from giving away too much, but if you watch it, you will see. To put it mildly: this film is a ""story"" (for lack of a better word) about some bladerunner who is trying to solve a problem which does nothing for me or anyone else. It is also about 90 minutes too long. To add weight to feather light story, there are looooong drawn out scenes of nothingness, and most of the information is given in little snippets hoping to make it look like the story is smart, only you are dumb. Didn't work on me. The story is as dull as a sack of hammers. And then the worst offense of all: there is not a single scene, action, line of dialogue, or anyone's reaction that is based on proper motivation. Nothing. Zero. Nada. Zilch. The whole thing was written from the point of ""Oh, this is act three, better get the energy up - OK, lets have these guys fight!"" or ""OK, here we have nothing, so lets throw in some nudity!"" At one point someone is a dear guest; next scene, they are about to get killed by their host. Everyone behaves like they are beyond psychotic, and completely alienated. No emotion, no rhyme or reason, no motivation, no goal, nothing. Just emptiness mixed with some boredom for good measure. There are a few films I really hate, and I usually say I would rather watch Miley Cyrus than those films. In reality, I'd probably only pretend to watch Miley Cyrus because I cannot stand her ""performance"". But, in this case, I can say with my hand on my heart that I would truly beg to pay to watch Miley Cyrus in place of this awful thing, sorry - ""film"".",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Loved it, a worthy sequel to a fantastic film","I see quite a few bad reviews, and surprisingly enough, many from people who loved the original, which I find odd. Slow pace and flat characters are the most-heard complaints. That makes me wonder why they think the original was so great. It's even slower than BR 2049 and Harrison's Ford character was very similar to Ryan Gosling's character. Was Ford really that much better at playing a depressed investigator look for answers than Gosling or is it something else? I agree that there is no antagonist on the level of Rutger Hauer in the sequel, but I still like the way they went with the sinister characters of Sylvia Hoeks and Jared Leto. That alone can't be the reason to give it such a poor rating.I thought the atmosphere of the film was spot on. It has the same depressing feel to it as the original but a more industrial look.

A Masterpiece,"I've read the negative critiques and i couldn't disagree more. Those who say it is slow or boring seem to have no concept of patience. The movie has little to no action sequences but it doesn't need them. Every single shot is so rich in details, the cinematography is beyond beautiful, you could propably spend a lifetime looking at all the little pieces that made up each scene. The story is interesting and kept me intrigued, without trying to be pretentiously deep or mind-blowing(the twist near the end was especially good because it did not try to be more than its own part of the story. It is revealed, the viewer and the characters get some time to process it and then the story moves on, just as it should). The acting from every single actor is beyond incredible. Personally, i never understood how people can categorically dislike a movie just for having a long runtime.

Truly one of the best science-fiction films and sequels ever made.,"It's just so good on every level of filmmaking that you can possibly think of. I feel like I'm gonna be preaching to the choir a lot in this review because there isn't a lot I can say about this film that I haven't heard anyone else say about it already.The best thing about this film is it's director. Denis Villenueve has already proven himself, but he has made another visually breathtaking spectacle that has further reinforced my opinion of him as not only a director who can faithfully adapt a screenplay, but someone who can more-than-competently direct a film in general. Cinematographer Roger Deakins also deserves credit for every meticulously framed and shot sequence, as just about every location and set is beautiful and blends seamlessly with CGI. I also appreciated even the smallest visual details like the User Interfaces and the flying car technology in the world.The characters were fantastic and Ryan Gosling delivers such a complex and facinating performance. From a storytelling perspective, there is just so much to unpack in terms of the very real yet science-fiction future that is depicted, along with the very apparent but nonetheless compelling themes of replicants and what it means to be human.It is truly one of the best science-fiction films and sequels ever made that faithfully builds upon and thematically exapnds on it's predecessor. Already I feel like watching it again and I wouldn't be suprised if I changed my score to a 10/10 in the future.(review from Letterboxd).",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Denis Villeneuve... making sci-fi great again,"Los Angeles, 2049. Thirty years have passed since Deckard and Rachael fled the city to make a life of their own. The futuristic cityscapes created by visionary director Ridley Scott were the perfect backdrop for one of the most influential science-fiction films of all time. While the creative team may have changed for Blade Runner 2049, the cityscapes remain for one of the best experiences I've had at the cinema in 2017.When K (Ryan Gosling), a young blade runner, uncovers a long-buried secret that could change the future for both humans and Replicants, he tracks down former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) for answers.It's no secret that audiences didn't take to Blade Runner straight away upon its release in 1982, people not seeing the mark the film stamped in the genre of sci-fi or film history until the years after. Several versions of the film and over thirty years later, Denis Villeneuve brings us Blade Runner 2049, a direct sequel and continuation from Scott's final cut of his original film.Villeneuve, who I'd have to describe as a visionary, is one of the most exciting directors working today and he brings his A-game to Blade Runner 2049. It's always risky making a sequel after such a long time, especially for a film as renowned as Blade Runner however, from the very get go, it's clear that this film is being made by someone who is incredibly indebted to and respectful of the original.This is a beautifully crafted film, visually stunning and utterly engrossing in its narrative. I was worried about how they would take the story forward but knowing nothing about the plot and going in blind worked wonders because I was gripped from the opening shot to the very last. The runtime could have been an issue but when the film is of such a high quality, it ultimately flies by and finishes too soon if anything.The work from Roger Deakins on the film's cinematography is nothing short of masterful, surpassing Jordan Cronenweth's work on the original which is no easy task. Deakins has never won the Academy Award and if he doesn't for his work on Blade Runner 2049, I'll lose hope in him ever picking up the award. The music from Vangelis in Blade Runner was mesmerising and while both Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch ensure this film has an impressive soundtrack, it never comes close to topping Vangelis'.Coming to the performances, Blade Runner 2049 features a cast intent on making this as memorable as the original. Ryan Gosling leads the film with an impressive performance where the subtlety of facial expressions are as important as the delivery of lines, leading to arguably Gosling's best performance to date. The returning Harrison Ford is as gruff as you'd expect as a Deckard who's been in hiding for thirty years, his pivotal role in the film surprising yet incredibly worthwhile.The supporting roles, ranging from minor to major, are filled by plenty of capable actors, whether it be Jared Leto's mysterious turn as Niander Wallace or Robin Wright's authoritative showing as Lt. Joshi. The pleasant surprise was Ana de Armas, who I didn't think too much of as an actress prior to this film.Blade Runner 2049 is a heavy dose of pure science fiction that will leave a lasting impression on the genre for sure. With this and Arrival last year, Denis Villeneuve seems to be on a one man mission to make sci-fi great again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A justifed follow up and technical triumph.,"When you make a sequel to a 30 year old movie, you better do it right. And unlike a certain other sequel to a 30+ year old film(s) that also includes Harrison Ford, Blade Runner 2049 respects it's elderly predecessor while also giving a good continuation of it's themes and expansion of the universe. It's tone and style by way of it's precise filmmaking, music, and diliberate use of color to convey feelings all do an excellent job of immersing us in the Blade Runner setting again and making something great technically . It definitely nails the atmosphere.This sequel takes a slow and steady pace and focuses on a new character K, who has an interesting arc himself with an element of ambiguity to who he is. In fact, all the movie's characters have distinct dialogue and reactions. They all do their part to slowly peel back the layers of this mystery behind a replicants child and the potential for the artificial to become the authentic. It constantly reminds you that everything in 2049 from whiskey to romance, is artificial, grounding you in this silent but incredibly important hunt for the truth. It expands the universe immensely with the idea of artificial birth, if replicants can...replicate, the line between man and machine becomes even further blurred than it's predecessor. I dare say it's themes are deeper across the board. It's clear that Villeneuve respected the Blade Runner name and wanted to add genuine depth to the world. At no point are there attempts to undercut the original.My only criticisms of this movie are very minor. It's been said that the first cut of this movie came out to be 4 hours long. While I certainly could watch something that looks this good for 4 hours, its too long for a standard release and we know that they had to shave off over an hour of footage, which will never be seen again. I think it's a shame that this will (probably) never be released as an extened cut because I think there are some ideas and characters that could have been expanded upon. One example is Jared Leto's character. He puts on a very interesting performance and it would have been great to see more of this and his character's perspective. When every single shot in this movie looks amazing, its reasonable to believe that much of the cut footage looks great too. The actual film that was released is great, but I think it's potential was even higher.If you still haven't seen this film, do it. It's a worthy follow up to the 1982 classic and it never breaks form. It doesn't rely on the original to tell the story and it also does NOT make the fruitless effort to recreate the original story through unnecessary fan service. It utilitlizes the old characters in meaningful and believable ways, and only as much as is necessary.This is what film sequels should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Masterpiece of modern cinema,"The finest film I have ever seen.Yes, a masterpiece of canon, and style, and production. Spare and sensual, with an extraordinary central performance by Ryan Gosling, great plotting and dialogue in an examination of the nature of love, of memory and of identity. The best of science fiction in that it explores who we really are under almost inconceivable stresses.You can feel the love and effort poured into this movie in every second of film. The music evokes and expands on the original, returns us to this future we know so well from so long ago now.Remember: Science fiction has no ceiling.10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You'll be blown away,"Remembering Ridley's masterpiece from 1982 coming into 2017 as new Blade Runner it had a potential that were in creation for 35 years and it was a magnificent picture that will shame even some of the best movies. Blade Runner 2049 tells a story of LAPD officer that is still picking up old Replicants and comes up to discovery of something greater. Words cant' describe feeling that Blade Runner constantly provides you with as it moves along expanding your understanding of Universe where it's placed. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Arrival) comes into this project as a refreshment and brings everything that is so special about his work into this movie with so powerful directing and bring's us to the edge. Alongside Roger Deakins as cinematographer with his ability to capture moments in such profound and beautiful way that will blow even hardest critiques away. Combination of them two and amazing screenplay that they were provided with created this new kind of movie that gives us new insight into film making and how good movies can be. From the start of year with such a great Logan that was dramatic enough to move us all but at the same time entertaining and now with this beautiful masterpiece that is Blade Runner 2049, movies started to adapt and evolve into a pictures that can in every moment be viewed as entertaining and imaginary as much as possible but with emotions and drama is just beautiful to watch. Without any doubt you may say that Blade Runner 2049 is the best movie of 2017 so far and there will be much trouble for movies to top this one. K/Joe (Ryan Gosling) was brought to play an amazing role and he gave an incredible performance proving himself to be a leading man that may lead to being one of the great actors of his class. Deckart (Harrison Ford) returned for his role and as usual he showed us that he can't be forgotten. As for music there is always Hans Zimmer with Benjamin Wallfisch that made a wonderful job in creating certain moods inside movie. You may say Blade Runner 2049 continues to be one of the movies that top it's predecessor and just take off into great universe that it may give. 4/4",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Boring. Just boring.,"I have to ask myself, why did I bother to watch ""Blade runner 2049""? I never liked the first movie, so why bother with this? Quite honestly, I thought that it had better than the first; surely! Nope, this movie is boring, dull as dish water, slow, dark, boring, stupid, unentertaining and a really bad script. Did I mention that it is very boring ? Apart from a few good CGI scenes, this film has nothing, just very slow and uninteresting. Oh, and it is a boring movie. I am no ""movie buff"", but I would advise, save 2 and 3 quarter hours of your life and don't watch it. At least you will not be bored if you avoid it. It is boring.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"30 years later, aged like fine wine","LAPD officer K(Gosling, cynical on the surface) investigates an unusual case. No, sorry, that's all you're getting for plot. If you see someone getting into a lot of detail, avert your eyes. Go into this as blind as Niander(Leto, driven by his cause). Thank me later.This is 2 hours and 33 minutes long, which is not excessive considering how it uses its time. The pacing allows some scenes to go on for a while, however, it's always appropriate. Major props to whoever thought Denis Villeneuve would be right for this. He couldn't be more perfectly chosen. His use of symbolism, exploration of philosophy and compelling themes fit as a companion to the film Ridley Scott created, without merely redoing it(the hints are neat, if perhaps a tad too numerous). This expands upon the issues about Replicants in truly inspired ways(albeit I acknowledge that not all of them were thought up purely for this movie). The acting is sublime. If Joi(Armas, expressing so much with so much forced restraint, for reasons I won't reveal) doesn't break your heart, get an EKG stat, it's stopped beating already. This is not driven by action, rather, the gripping mystery.There is some bloody, even brutal, violence, nudity and disturbing material in this, used well. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys speculative sci-fi. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Striking in every way,"I believe every piece that went into this movie contributed to its excellence-the score, cinematography, script, etc. SO many of the shots were so visually striking that I was often brought to tears. There is so much beauty yet horror in the post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, and I find their depiction of the future as an interesting take on the progression of society today. For instance, the over-sexualization of women (and people in general) has increased to insane levels, with nude sculptures and projections everywhere along with sex clubs out on the streets. The score matched the intensity of the city scene. One of my favorite shots, however, was that of the wastelands with high radiation, featuring a minimalist shot of Joe in the center of the concentrated red/orange atmosphere. The way that it is quickly cut to this image adds to the intensity.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
WARNING: The greatness of this movie does not lie in its story.,"Let me get straight to the point on why you should dismiss critics and appreciate the greatness Blade Runner 2049. I won't even bother talking about the philosophical story or praising the amazing cinematography which should make you enjoy this movie on its own.Sci-fi movies made until now generally fit into these two categories:1. A close future that looks very much like today, but with expected improvements on the tech (ie, black mirror)
2. A distant future that could seem believable from the 50's, 60's or 70's, but does not look like what we are heading to nowWhat Blade Runner 2049 gets really right is creating a distant future that looks credible from today's point of view. While watching the movie and it's characters relationship with tech I keep getting the feeling of ""oh, we could really end up like that"". And feel bad about it.It makes us question if the tech-led way we are living in the 21st is really the best way for humanity. Awesome, go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Pedestrian Labyrinth,"There's no disputing 'Blade Runner 2049' looks good - the vast decaying LA megalopolis, its futuristic interiors and surrounding desert wasteland are all portrayed with beautiful cinematography - but unfortunately the narrative arc doesn't match up to the scenery.This sequel starts off in familiar territory - just like detective Rick Deckard in the original movie, a replicant police officer called 'K' is tasked with terminating unreliable earlier models. In the film's opening sequence he's hunting down a target, and during the operation K comes across evidence of the birth of a replicant child. He's soon reassigned to find this offspring, and K's new mission obliges him to zigzag around the dystopian landscape in his flying police cruiser. He asks awkward questions of important people, and delves into the archives of secretive institutions. Occasionally K stops by his cramped apartment where he carries on an unsatisfying love affair with his hologram girlfriend. The detective work seems unnecessarily opaque and long-winded, even though it's punctuated by some sporadic violence. Clues eventually lead to an overwrought cliffhanger climax - but the lasting impression, despite the film's visual impact, blockbuster budget and continuing references to the Theseus myth - is that it's all a bit underwhelming.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What A Sequel Should Be,"If you take a look at the best sequels out there, you'll find that they don't spend an inordinate amount of time retreading old ground at the expense of the story. Rather, a good sequel builds off of the previous film and, if done correctly, not only reinforces the previous film's themes and message, but adds upon them in a meaningful way.Blade Runner 2049 does this correctly, and you don't even have to have seen the original to enjoy this film.Set thirty years after the events of the original film, Blade Runner 2049 focuses on Agent K (Ryan Gosling), a replicant blade runner tasked with hunting down old models that aren't programmed like he is, namely to obey.He stumbles upon a mystery that threatens to unravel the status quo between humans and replicants for good, and through much detective work, he finds himself in the company of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man living alone with the demons of his past.What the original film did was brilliant in that it explored the human condition without preaching the right answer to our faces, rather it let us ponder the questions it posed so we could come to the conclusions ourselves.This film also poses important questions about humanity, about what qualifies as true feeling, and what the basis for a soul is, but also explores the prospects of science and human ambition, and what happens if it is left unchecked.These themes are explored beautifully by characters on opposite sides of the spectrum, from Jared Leto as Wallace, the man who picks up the mantle of the Tyrell Corporation, to Ana de Ames as Joi, a holographic woman who is K's companion and who longs to be more than an incorporeal image.It cannot be denied that this film is a visual masterpiece, every bit on par with Ridley Scott's original.What faults there are lie with the length of the film (2 hours 43 minutes, and it feels it, especially towards the end) and with the music. While powerful and evocative of the original soundtrack, for every time it conveys an emotional gut punch, there's another time where it's really only there to be a loud noise, and it can get annoying at times. A little more restraint on the horns would have been appreciated.Nevertheless, this film has everything a film buff would want, and even if that's not you, it's definitely worth a watch as an intellectual think-piece to discuss over dinner with friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Visual Marvel!,"A sequel to the cult-classic Blade Runner, 'Blade Runner 2049' is A Visual Marvel, that is a feast for the eyes. No Kidding, This Neo-Noir Sci-Fi Flick reminds us the power of visuals in celluloid & takes you in the future with finesse. Not a single frame falters, in fact, as this visual poetry progresses, the presentation gets deeper & deeper.However, Master Director Denis Villeneuve doesn't succeed entirely. Reason? Hampton Fancher and Michael Green's Erratic & Overlong Screenplay. Sure, the world of 'Blade Runner 2049' requires time, so one can absorb it, but was there a need to drag the film for nearly 3 hours (163-minutes, to be precise), Nope! Despite some terrific sequences & an intense atmosphere, the Writing lags at many a times & takes away a good bit of 'Blade Runner 2049'. While Visually Stunningly & Magnificently Shot by Cinematography God Roger Deakins, this Epic tale needed a crisper & more consistent, Screenplay.'Blade Runner 2049' Synopsis: A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.'Blade Runner 2049' is a tale on humanity, survival, violence & sacrifice. The world here is mix of futuristic dynamo, to utter ruin of waste lands (Mad Max: Fury Road, anyone?), contrasting the effects of human choices & the bleakness of the future, that remains in our bare hands. We follow K, the Protagonist (Ryan Gosling) in this bleak & violent journey, where rogues are hunted down and killed, where the cops hold power until they also are massacred & ruthless leaders who manufacturer rogues with sinister motives. Its all too much to swallow & while some of it went above my head, most of it caught my attention & the visual scenery spoke much more, than most of the dialogue.The first-hour beautifully builds up, offering some sharp action combat sequences & introducing its characters gradually. There is a sense of impending doom, covered in gorgeousness & its all visually poetic. BUT, the second-hour goes for a toss. Overlong & Erratic, the second-hour suffers on length & solid substance. And while there is a pleasure in watching Blade Runner Veteran Harrison Ford reprise his popular role, the film overstays its welcome. The narrative needed to be Written better, given the team that this film is blessed with, on and off camera & also, some editing, by at least 25-minutes. Had that been the case, 'Blade Runner 2049' would've been 2017's very own Masterpiece!And before I acknowledge all the talent here, I must start with the Star of the Show - Roger Deakins. The Cinematographer outshines himself here & leaves you mesmerized. 'Blade Runner 2049' is among the most well-shot films of recent & Deakins' Genius with the Camera, is something to be experienced. Despite the flaws, I would recommend every Cinephile out there to watch 'Blade Runner 2049' for its Cinematography. You'll be reminded, just like how I was, that being, how each & every frame can turn into Visual Mastery. The Academy has to honor Deakins next year, or else, they ain't doing any good!Denis Villeneuve is in great form, yet again. The Master Director has directed this Magnum-Opus with a vision that is easy to envy as well as to inspire. How I wish the Writing supported Villeneuve & Deakins, as their work here is nothing short of astonishing. Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch's Score is fantastic. Art & Costume Design define perfection. Graphics are incredible; among the best I've seen in recent times. Make-Up, also, is very-well done.Performance-Wise: Ryan Gosling as K, makes for an interesting hero. But there are no surprises in Gosling's turn here, its regular Gosling. And that can be underwhelming since his last release was La La Land. Harrison Ford returns as Rick Deckard & adds the much needed punch to the proceedings. Jared Leto as Niander Wallace, the antagonist, is creepy to the core. Leto emerges as a scene-stealer here, despite the fact that he only appears in a cameo. Ana de Armas as Joi, Gosling's holographic companion, is effective. Sylvia Hoeks as the villainous Luv, is exquisite. She stands out! Robin Wright as Lt. Joshi, is first-rate, as usual. Others lend great support.On the whole, 'Blade Runner 2049' is visually empowering, but not as strong as a whole. Its definitely worth a watch, but it doesn't really surpass the expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie even for someone who isn't a fan,"Blade Runner is one of those movies that has a very strong cult following with people who are disgusted if you haven't seen it or don't like it. For that reason I'd stayed clear and being someone born in 1990 it also was past my time (although many people born after the original Blade Runner have of course enjoyed it), many of the strong followers grew up with the original. It also carried with it the uncertainties of what the 2000's might bring in this balance of dystopia or utopia. It's quite a different experience watching the original in the year that it was actually set knowing full well what 2019 looks like. This is totally different from what watching it in the 1980's would've been like. In the same way the movie quality has improved so much that these movies can struggle to hold their own over a 40 year period. In saying that I did enjoy the original, not as much as others clearly have. For many of the same reasons others may have enjoyed the original I really enjoyed the next instalment in Blade Runner 2049. It was much more relatable for my experience and watching it in 2020 rather than 2049 makes a big difference not knowing what 2049 will look like. The music, acting, costume, CGI and world design itself were all excellent. Great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beautiful emptiness,"Production-wise this movie is a masterpiece: scenography, light, some very impressive CGI, music, long and well done shots – it will all make you feel like you're watching better, upgraded version of the original Blade Runner.However this artistic style, the fact that director took his time with every scene – this will only make you feel worse when the ending credits finally appears. Then you will finally come to understand that this movie practically had no screenplay, story so weak that it only makes you wonder ""am I not getting something or what?"". What however is the worse is the main character – another lonely robot with cybernetic soul.This movie is made for critics not for people who love movies. Why? Critics care little about story, or a purpose of the movie. For critic, screenplay is just one point on a long chart of requirements that ""good"" movie should meet. So the fact that spectator is totally detached from the main character makes no impact on technical side of the production. This is technically true.This is 2h 45min of nice views, great shots, some innovative CGI with no reason to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slogging Our Way Through a Dystopian Future,"I felt the same way about ""Blade Runner 2049"" as I did Ridley Scott's 1982 original: it's slow, ponderous, and portentous.The dystopia has been ratcheted up a notch in this sequel set just around the corner. My office can't even figure out how to get video conferencing to work consistently, but we're supposed to have flying cars by 2049? We'd better hustle.Denis Villeneuve directs at a funereal pace to give us one long, sustained note of sci-fi gloominess. This is the kind of film in which characters don't speak lines, they recite maxims. Where scenes begin with some mad genius monologuing in an attempt to imbue what really should just be a pulpy noir with philosophical import. Every single frame of this film is calculated to make its audience feel like there's more significance than there actually is, and it's too self- consciously aware of its own effects, as if you can hear someone off-camera saying, ""ooohhh, look what our visual effects team has done here."" All of the actors have been asked to make their faces as blank as possible and speak in emotionless monotones, as if Villeneuve is daring them to have fun. All of these things were wrong with the original film as well, but instead of learning from the mistakes of the past, Villeneuve has set out to reproduce them. He's done too good a job.Grade: C-",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The film of the year so far.........,"Blade Runner 2049 is the best film I have seen so far this year. Normally a sequel is dreadful compared to its original brother and with this being the decade for terrible sequels and reboots, like Alien Covenant and Kingsmen 2, 2049 is actually great. This film is Gorgeous in the same way as the original and actually stands apart from the original in such a way as to be a completely different film. It tips its hat to the original Blade Runner but stands on its own two feet.The story is a continuation from the original set 30 years in the future. I will not ruin the plot for you in any way as you need to see this film. I will say that the plot does revolve around the same kind of themes that the original does however it's done in such a refreshing and creative way that it leaves you with a lot of questions. It Revolves around what it means to be human as the last one did but also throws in love, revenge, sacrifice and wraps it all up with stunning performances from all but one member of the cast.Gosling is the main protagonist and does an excellent job of portraying the is-he-isn't-he replicant ""K"". In most of his performances Gosling does give quite a robotic performance with a few choice parts of emotion. This usually is his acting MO but unlike some of his other films, where it doesn't work, the robotic acting he does in this film suits his character.The writing team obviously wrote K well and Gosling listened to them and made the character work. The scenes where he loses it and shows emotional sides are brilliant and really enjoyable. Also the love he shows for Joi in their scenes is really affectionate and believable. I don't usually like him but in this I have to say to was brilliant and really took me into his character and what K is feeling and thinking.Ana De Armas is great as Joi, as with Gosling she is amazingly adept at portraying the complexity of a self-aware AI hologram and you feel a connection to her plight of wanting to be as human as human can be. Robin Wright is great as the LAPD lieutenant as she plays a great supporting character who strangely enough is less human than the replicants are but is genuinely human.weird.Harrison Ford was the main focus of the films advertising and trailers however if you are looking forward to more Deckard you will be slightly disappointed. He is not in the film for very long and has little impact on the plot for the first 2/3rds of the film. While some people are b*tching about this and giving the film a 1/10 (which is a total di*k move) for not having Deckard be the main guy, I think it is refreshing to not rehash old characters to death. Deckard does advance the plot along and gives K something to hope for but K is the main protagonist and that is, in my opinion, a good thing.Jared Leto was boring as the ""villain"" in this film. His acting was terrible all of his dialog was weird and did nothing for me. His speech about angels was completely boring and did nothing to advance the plot and every time he was on screen the pacing felt slowed down. His whole character did not feel interesting and I was so underwhelmed. Luckily he is only in two scenes and his replicant LUV is a great character. She gives us a suspenseful, menacing, emotional antagonist who advances the plot well and is actually more human than her human boss.Like the first film the effects in this are beautiful. The use of CGI adds to the story and is very tasteful. The scene where Joi is trying to make love to K is a brilliant example of CGI adding to the story, honesty it is so good I was astonished at how real it looked. The use of colour is very well done as well.Brilliant cinematography, great use of a golden colour palette, honestly the effects department should be really proud, amazing work. The camera work is very interesting with great sweeping shots of the futuristic LA skyline and the First shot of the eye at the start really gets you interested in what's to come and is a unique way to start a film.I listen very closely to the music in films and I have to say that this is one of the best examples I've seen recently of music adding to a film a making the scenes special. The music in this builds suspense, evokes emotion and adds to the characters and their setting exactly the right way.The use of ""soundless"" music is used to great effect, giving you suspenseful scenes without any sound to add to the eerie feeling in the scenes. It is important to use music but sometimes lack of music can be just as important and creative. This film is a perfect example of a great use of music and the sound department did an awesome job.Overall this film the best film I have seen this year and while it does have a few little flaws. The pacing is slow in places, Leto's performance is not great and the nearly 3 hour running time is a hard ask for people with short attention spans. I think over all this film is really good and a testament to sequels being as good as their originals. As I said at the start this film is refreshing and tips its hat slightly to Blade Runner however Blade Runner 2049 is a great film in its own right. I urge you to go see for yourselves.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A rare sequel that lives up to the original.,"When I saw all the negative reviews I was wondering what I was letting myself in for by watching this film. Having seen it however, I can't understand all the criticism. Yes, it is a long film, but it is well paced, well acted and photographed. There are moments of great excitement and tension and yet the story is engrossing and thought provoking. Clearly those who criticised Blade Runner 2049 were expecting some all action, shoot 'em up sci-fi movie and so an intelligent, well crafted film is bound to disappoint them, but that is no reason to criticise the film. I would recommend it to any fan of the original Blade Runner or intelligent, dystopian sci-fi films. This is a movie about humanity: what it means; how precious it is and how much it is worth fighting for. It is also about miracles and hope. There is a lot to admire about it, including the soundtrack, which also drew a lot of cricitism, surprising given that it featured Frank Sinatra and Elvis among others.

A Modern Masterpiece that will (hopefully) have the same reputation as the original,"Having heard all the positive reviews and comments, I already had high hopes. It even managed to exceed those!!!K, the new Blade Runner, is what Harrison Ford was in the original. However stories from the first film find themselves playing a key role in the new one as the two interlink faultlessly.Ryan Gosling plays the character brilliantly. With such a diverse acting resume spanning from Comedies (Crazy, Stupid Love) to Action (Drive), There is no doubt about it he is a talented actor. Acting alongside Ford brings another big action to his growing A list blockbusters.Ford's talent is natural here, adapting into the character he played all those years ago and bringing it to modern day. An actor who doesn't show his age when he runs and gets beaten around!As for the supporting cast, K's love interest Jon (played by the beautiful Ana De Armas) bought an element of necessary romance to the film, carrying and helping our main protagonist along. Sylvia Hoeks, who plays the 'Replicant gone rogue' Luv, brings the majority of the films violence with her. Other stars including Robin Wright as the Lieutenant giving orders to K and Dave Bautista as Sapper providing a famous supporting cast.The visuals here are second to none! From the vast deserts of a 'post-apocalypse' Vegas to the futuristic neo-noir rendition of California, everything is built for purpose. Nothing comes across as a pointless fill in. Everywhere we go, we're pulled along every step of K's journey. When he is isolated, we as an audience feel isolated with him. When courageous, we are pushed to the edge of our seats. It really sets out to give the audience every emotion in the book and, in my mind, I almost found myself wanting to be part of that world (almost)!The score from Zimmer and Wallfisch juxtaposed incredibly here, just as it did for Dunkirk. However I feel that they have gone a level up here and to bring such emotion to individual notes pushes me to confess that it is the best score I've heard yet!OK, I know, lots of positives. No such thing as a perfect film (although this comes so damn close)! I have to admit I wasn't all convinced by Jared Leto's role. His character seemed cool and, as you'll notice, he has a pivotal role in the new era of Replicants. I just thought his character didn't have as significant a role in the film as it needed.I don't want to spoil the plot but so much is happening here that I'd rather you just watch it for yourself. Conclusions are made to questions from the original, however questions that are left felt intentional to bring audience to debate.To sum the whole lot up, it was an honour to spend 2 hours and 44 minutes in this amazing world created by all the cast members. Do I want a sequel? No. This is a film with a beginning, middle and end. Lets keep it that way. Dennis Villeneuve I applaud you for taking the brave step in making this film and pulling it off in such style!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Every scene: Important; Extravagant; Pure Perfection,"A classic in the science-fiction genre, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a slow, mastered piece of film, directed by Denis Villeneuve (debuted in the sci-fi genre with the masterpiece, ""Arrival""). This film is a true masterpiece of cinema and , greater than the original, but not a masterpiece such as 2001 (which attacks concepts and beliefs), whereas ""Blade Runner 2049"" succeeds not only driving the plot, but speeds down the highway, amazing onlookers. Although the film may seem slow based on the trailer, it allows for character development on a whole new scale with twists and turns which will shock you beyond belief! Ryan Gosling (""La La Land"", ""Drive"") stars as K, the new blade runner, replacing Harrison Ford's role as the original blade runner. Ryan Gosling provides a spectacular performance, draws upon all of his acting skills in order to deliver this blank, emotionless protagonist which is necessary for this role. But to oppose K is a violent emotionless replicant, although, personally, this latest addition is not as lovable as Rutger Hauer, but makes a fantastic villain for battle.The film, although visually slow-paced, is mentally thrilling, with an absolutely brilliant soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer (Dunkirk; Interstellar; etc) juxtaposed with some of the most beautiful cinematography of this year. Easily one of the greatest films of the year, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is not only a fantastic film, but one of the greatest sequels ever produced.",,Anonymous,Mystery
8.7 for the sequel when the original only got an 8.2 is a joke,"When you see the original masterpiece only getting an 8.2 rating and the sequel getting an 8.7, you understand that IMDb ratings are a joke. The sequel is a decent effort but nowhere near the original movie. The original movie with Rutger Hauer's unforgettable performance and Vangelis' wonderful score set the bar so high that any sequel was bound to fall short, and it did. From Harrison Ford to Ryan Gosling and from Rutger Hauer to Dave Bautista (!?!) is a long and disappointing way down. Ryan Gosling needs to learn his craft and pick up some acting skills; there's a huge difference between appearing in a movie and acting in a movie. And for those who will think 'come on, he's portraying a replicant - replicants don't have feelings or outbursts of anger or desperation', just remember Rutger Hauer's acting as replicant Roy Batty, a performance forever carved in our hearts and memories and still haunting us till this very day.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Blazing new ground, despite the (now obligatory) dystopian vision","Well, Blade Runner 2049 certainly lives up to the hype, and did anyone mention the soundtrack? Wow. I should, however, expand a little on my recurring critique of dystopian science fiction, since it's about the only kind of scifi you can find at the movies, and Blade Runner 2049 falls into the genre like almost everything else in the scifi category these (unimaginative) days. Dystopian visions of the future abound, but overlook (1) that a lot --- if not most --- of our present problems will be solved --- even in the intermediate future a few decades hence, and (2) that the problems of the future (apart from human nature, which basically never changes) will most likely be substantially different than the problems of today. It's hard to see how a fusion-powered, robotics and biotech-enhanced future is going to be characterized by poverty and homelessness, just for example. Overcrowding? Yes. Few jobs for unskilled workers? Quite obviously. Human nature? The same as ever, as mentioned above. So, despite its slipping into the #dystopiaasusual category, Blade Runner 2049 may possibly be the greatest science fiction film ever produced. Surely there has never been another soundtrack quite like this one, and I'm ready to award the set designers every prize on the shelf. Ryan Gosling is talented enough to carry the lead, and he was very well- supported, including by a re-energized Harrison Ford, who has pulled himself back from the edge of the abyss. Denis Villeneuve has now established that he can do anything (he's now talking about revisiting the Dune narrative; and somebody should actually introduce him to Heinlein and Asimov if he's drifting towards the classics in the genre). So, despite some caveats, this production burns so much new ground that my call is 10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Poor imitation,"In the original, Roy Batty asks Deckard, ""Aren't you supposed to be the good man?"" - which Deckard isn't, or at most ambiguously so. In 2049, agent ""K"" is a good man in a typical Hollywood way, which spoils the concept of the original. 2049 contains several run-of- the-mill fight scenes which the viewer has seen in a thousand other films and add nothing. The much-awaited confrontation between K and Deckard doesn't make much sense, and their meeting is unfulfilling to the viewer. The look of the film is probably intended to contrast with the original, but is unsatisfying. A lot of annoying bright light and white surfaces, and uniform colors. The eclectic look of the original is gone. There is little sign of the thoughtfulness and effort which went into the look of the original. The sound effects are probably the worst feature, loud, grating and unnecessary. Multiple scenes of gratuitous violence and gore add nothing to the plot. There are a lot of assaults on the senses which don't help the movie much, but made this viewer think of drug dealers with bad heroin, who add a little rat poison to provide a kick. There are plot holes: problems with K's motivation, illogical events and an unexplained major phenomenon which is just too convenient for the plot. The film makes a logical extension of the replicant conundrum which does not however reach such dimensions as to capture the viewer's interest. This film is probably best enjoyed by those who have never seen the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When a Blade Loses It's Edge.,"Beautiful and empty Bladerunner 2049 is the needless squeal to the 1980s classic.Set 30+ years after the events of the first film we meet Ryan Gosling continuing in the Bladerunner tradition of shooting robots. Along the way, he discovers a great secret that might change the social order of a world that is made up of humans and they're purpose built slaves.All of that was covered in the first 20 minutes of the film by the way. Skip ahead to the 3rd act, grumpy Harrison Ford shows up and, well, that's about it.Leaving the theatre my wife and I tried to decide just why Bladerunner left us both feeling so indifferent to it's existence. She had never seen the first film, I had, but our feelings were the same. Bladerunner is great to look at and I appreciated the nods to the original, but, it became quickly apparent our apathy stemmed from the fact nothing much happens in this movie.Office K's (Gosling) investigation into a missing person moves at snails pace and none of the people we meet along the way are as interesting as the scenery around them. One example is Wallace (Jared Leto) the new Tyrell and the main villain of the film. His speeches are dull and only go to serve the plot, he leaves all of his serious evilness to his sidekick while he stays home sporting a handicap which must be a desired physical affectation considering how easily it could be treated in his time.The main theme in both Bladerunner movies is one day the slaves will cast off their chains and be free. Sure, there's stuff about love and self-awareness but these are side issues that have been explored elsewhere to better effect. The main focus of 2049 is humanity needs an indentured underclass to do its heavy lifting and either you are for it or against it and that is a pretty thin premise for a movie this long.Late in the film Officer K sits on a deck chair staring out over an irradiated city. He looks like a man lost, not knowing where to go next. This moment is the perfect metaphor for Bladerunner 2049. All of it's surprises are revealed too early on leaving both the audience and characters to mull over the same obvious of choices for the rest of the movie.A wasted opportunity.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
TOP-TIER Sci-fi,"Blade Runner 2049 is visually stunning (no surprise there). It's a very powerful journey revolving around someone who is insignificant in the grand scheme of the film/someone who literally has no purpose. It's an auditory and visual experience that resonates emotionally, and it blows my mind every time I watch it. One of my all-time favourites.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A superior sequel that stands on its own.,"The original Blade Runner I have more respect then fondness for. Similar to Ridley Scott's latter philosophical sci-fi film Prometheus, I admire the movie's ideas, themes and world-building but as a story I don't really care for. Where as the original asked lots of questions about human identity, Denis Villeneuve's sequel explores the answers posed by those questions in very emotional and psychological ways. The answers may not be ones you would expect but show how the famous question, ""what does it mean to be human"" is one not defined by our own creation or sense of destiny. He takes the many common sci fi plot tropes in many blockbusters and constantly turns them on their head. Similar to his previous film Arrival, Villenneuve uses the themes of memories to act as the driving force of the narrative. Unlike the original, 2049 feels fleshed out with compelling characters and multiple unique locations. It goes beyond just futuristic LA, which has gotten even bigger and more hi-tech to reflect how technology today has evolved since the release of Ridley Scott's film 30 years ago. The events and actions of the story are defined more by the impact of character's choices rather then the characters going along with the events. Despite having a longer run time then the first, 2049 feels like it moves at a better pace because more is happening then just a simple detective story. But Villenueve doesn't get lost in the plot of the mystery. He makes this story feel personal by following the blade runner K's journey as a character.There have been a lot of sci fi masterpieces with stunning visuals but I would say Roger Deakins kept stealing the show with the best cinematography I have ever seen. Nothing against the directing, writing and performances but the shot compositions kept me constantly in awe and distraction in an almost hypnotic ways. Not only are the shots and lighting atmospheric but they also feel almost like a character itself as they change to reflect the mood and tension of the scene. And they fit perfectly with the Vangellis-inspired score by Han Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch that makes you feel you are transported to that world.Gosling shows that he is perfectly suited to Villeneuve's style. Similar to Drive, Gosling's performance is very much quite and subtle. His character K does not say much as he does not feel the need to speak his own voice to question or challenge his way of life. But once he is put onto a mission that questions how his world actually worked, his quest becomes one of self-discovery. This leads to his journey intersecting with Deckard's. One of the issues I have with Blade Runner is the fact that Deckard is not really a character that you can connect with or feel sympathy for. One of the biggest improvements 2049 does is giving Deckard a tragic backstory. After a lot of build up to meeting Deckard again, it doesn't disappoint. Ford shows a more broken and human side of Deckard that the original did not. We see his isolation is one not of choice but forced to protect the only really human connection he has in this bleak world. Other great performance are Ana De Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright and especially Dave Bautista who has the least screen-time but probably gives the best performance of his acting career. The one performance I thought lacked subtly was Jared Leto's philosophical antagonist Niander Wallace. His character had some compelling traits but I felt the least connected to.While there have been a lot of genre classics revitalized to capitalize on nostalgia, Blade Runner 2049 does not feel like one that is forced to make you remember the past. Instead Villeneuve uses the original's story as way to tell his own story about choice vs destiny. By the end of this movie, you feel like it has been a satisfying conclusion to what the original Blade Runner started as opposed to being a setup for another franchise or cinematic universe. While many die-hard fans will argue about this, 2049 surpasses the first Blade Runner by giving a resolution instead of leaving it open with another question.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A warning from the future,"Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Hampton Fancher (in collaboration with Michael Green) get things off to a great start by dusting down an omitted scene originally intended for the 80's classic. Ryan Gosling's Blade Runner, Officer K (Dick?), discovers a long buried secret whilst on a 'retirement' mission outside the walls of future LA. This sets the wheels in motion for a gripping, highly intriguing 2 hours 63 minutes of hallucinogenic dystopian wet dreams, as Gosling hunts for the hunter - Rick Deckard, who has been missing for 30 years...So, how far have we come between 2019 and 2049? Well, the mash-up of all things vintage and cyber-punk have been aggressively separated out, finding the former unceremoniously tossed over the city wall to wilt and die in the misty post apocalyptic wilderness. The latter's underclass are forced into the Soylent Green over-crowding of Gosling's dead-end high-rise habit, leaving the overlords to bask in their sleek minimalist creature comforts behind closed doors.The rich/poor divide is breathtakingly realised courtesy of perfectly nuanced art direction (think Gattaca meets Brazil) and Roger Deakins' achingly beautiful DP work. The lighting, design and colour schemes deployed in the perfectly timed build-up to Officer K's face-to-face with you-know-who, has to rate amongst one of the best directed sequences I've ever seen. It's almost like watching the greatest moment Kubrick never made.Benjamin Wallfisch & Hans Zimmer's hammering Vangelis on steroids soundtrack feels less like music and more the organic hyperventilating of the gloomy Metropolis it supports. In fact – and I do mean this as a compliment - it's sometimes difficult to tell where (outstanding) sound design ends and music score begins (and vice versa).OK, that's the gravy. But what really make this outing so enduring are Villeneuve & the writers' commitment to telling a story with characters and themes that are well worth your time. The ideas and threads presented in Ridley Scott's masterpiece and PKD's original source material are built upon quite substantially, juggling elemental symbolism (snow, rain & seawater equating life, death & rebirth) with the big existential questions of what it means to be human and the tragic disconnect that intervenes.Whether it be by design, social-standing, physical-handicap or grim circumstance, every single character here - Gosling's perfectly muted, curiously Roy Batty attired, drone law-enforcer, Ana De Armis' sweet & tragic hologram Joi, Robin Wright's gutsy police chief Joshi, Harrison Ford's meaty, bladey, big & besty Deckard etc – is a slave. Like the original, no one here is in control - not even boo-hiss villains Wallace and his tearful hit-woman, Luv (played superbly by Jared Leto & Sylvia Hoeks respectively). Like everyone else, they too are manipulated by the puppet master society that has been allowed to grow around them, a dark warning from the future if ever there was one.Any negatives? Whilst I honestly can't think of a single scene that shouldn't be there, some moments could do with a trim as Leto's scenes do tend to ramble on a bit. The action too, whilst still sparing, adheres more to the crowd-pleasing variety this time round, with the finale going a tad too good-guy vs bad guy/damsel-in- distress for comfort. That said the fantastically skilled Villeneuve's work behind the camera insures it always remains as credible as anything else he's ever done involving punch-ups and explosions.The pace, like the original, is sedate and deliberate, the mood, a mix of oppressive brooding and melancholic bewilderment. Several passages enticingly emit the same kind of foreboding and dread normally found in the best horror movies, and the outcome retains the same downbeat ambiguity as before. The final moment, is perfect.Was this sequel necessary? I thought it would be nay, but I'm happy to say it's a yay! This Blade Runner may share ticks and traits lifted from its predecessor - and it's too soon to say if it will go on to achieve the same reputation as Scott's signature movie – but thanks to the artistry and craftsmanship of Villeneuve and everyone else involved, the goods have turned up freshly minted with a personality all its own, delivering a tale that resonates loudly with the here and now. It deserves your attention. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Androids dream of wooden horses,"A question I've been asked, given that Blade Runner 2049 is being released thirty-five years after 1982's Blade Runner, is; do I need to have seen the first film? I believe it will make a lot more sense, indeed it may only make sense, if you have seen the first film. The next question is; which version of the first film? Yes, there are seven. For me, and for Ridley Scott, it's The Final Cut version. So before we talk about the new film, trust me, it's complicated. Other preparations you need to make before viewing Blade Runner 2049 are: get a good night's sleep beforehand, use the bathroom and bring a flask and sandwiches. This film is 163 minutes long.At the end of Blade Runner (depending on which version you watched), Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) rides off into the sunset with Rachel (Sean Young), a replicant he fell in love with after ""retiring"" Roy Batty and his mates. Director Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 introduces us to a new Blade Runner named ""K"" (the name given to police personnel who hunt down and ""retire"" replicants), played by Ryan Gosling. K is despatched to the desert to retire a replicant farmer (Dave Bautista). While there he discovers the buried remains of Rachel and a new mystery is born. Along the way he encounters other replicants and eventually, his investigation leads him to Las Vegas where Rick Deckard has been living out his life. Together they embark on solving the mystery.I'm being deliberately obtuse in my exposition because I don't want to give away the plot twists and turns and more importantly, the end.There is a great support cast including Robin Wright who plays K's police chief and Cuban native Ana de Armas who plays K's holographic girlfriend in an emotive performance. Jared Leto turns up as Niander Wallace who has taken over replicant manufacture from the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation.Blade Runner 2049 carries on in the same style as the 1982 film. From the cityscapes to the future it projects, the new film creates a believable 2049, darker and more miserable than 2019 (the time period the 1982 film was set). The sprawling metropolis, the single-colour palettes in the desert, the lighting through water and the framing give a real sense of  the dystopian future ahead. Kudos to cinematographer Roger Deakins. It also continues the central question of the 1982 film: what does it mean to be human? Are just the sum of our memories? Do humans have souls? There is a lot going on. To it's credit, Blade Runner 20149 does not pander to the audience. It assumes they are smart and can deal with these topics without being spoon fed. There is no long exposition to explain the plot. There are twists and turns and Villeneuve knows the audience are intelligent to keep up.Seeing Harrison Ford back in action is a joy. He throws himself back into the role he played 35 years ago with gusto and the film is better for it. He clearly has an affection for the character of Rick Deckard who is probably the most enigmatic character he has ever played. For his part, Ryan Gosling makes an excellent addition to the story line as the new Blade Runner. His expressionless face captures the lack of empathy with which he retires replicants. As the film progresses we see a tender side of him with his girlfriend and his struggling to make sense of dreams from his childhood. His closing scenes, with echoes of The Shining are touching.As a continuation to the 1982 film, Blade Runner 2049 takes the story forward in a thought-provoking fashion while leaving some of the unanswered questions from the 1982 film still unanswered. For example, there was great debate at the end of Blade Runner as to whether Deckard was a replicant himself. Don't be expecting this film to answer that. If you truly want the answer to that, you will need to read Philip K Dick's short story: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? We know they dream of unicorns!An amazing 4.5 out of 5. This intoxicating film will need several viewings and each will be as brain-twisting and as welcome as the first. I look forward to the next instalment. Hopefully we won't have to wait 35 years!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Haunting visuals, thought provoking narrative and amazing production make it one of the best sci-fi movies ever","The original Blade Runner is a must see for any movie buff, it reached cult status due to it's groundbreaking visual style that inspired a generation of filmmakers. The movie wrestled on how to portray the themes and ideas from the Philip K Dick book, and ultimately I don't think it did it justice, not like Blade Runner 2049 did.Not only is 2049 closer to the core themes and ideas of the book it also manages to use the sci-fi setting to portray a warped version of our society, increasingly isolated people, over-reliance on technology, losing the connection and intimacy, over sexualization and cheap sex everywhere, and ultimately its decay and collapse as we see in ""Ozymandian"" Las Vegas . It feels very relevant today in a way that goes beyond most sci-fi and fantasy.The K/Joi romance parallels the Deckard/Rachel romance, but it's better done in multiple ways. The most important being that the idea actually works in the new one. Both main characters fall in love with an artificial woman but it doesn't work quite so well in the original because Rachel never actually feels like an artificial woman. She is a real person, very much human the first time we see her, you would never question her humanity that even if the movie tries to tell you that. With Joi it's a lot closer to what the books had in mind, and it's a lot harder to figure out where her programming ends, where her personality begins, did she ever evolve into something more, was she her own person.I'm focusing on the previous Blade Runner because I'm seeing a lot of reviews that compare the two and I just do not understand the negativity. We got the best possible sequel, by a brilliant uncompromising director and the same writer.I do not think Riddley Scott would be able to the movie nearly as good, judging by Prometheus and Covenant. It even goes beyond the first one on many levels, but few. For example the visuals were not groundbreaking as the first one, but almost no movie is. The soundtrack while it did complement the movie well, doesn't stand out like the original one made by Vangelis.I had some minor nitpicks about the script, and I feel a lot of little details that flesh out the entire detective mystery were cut, but again they're very minor and did not ruin my enjoyment of it at all.See this movie if you enjoy sci-fi, if you enjoyed the original Blade Runner or if you enjoy good uncompromising contemplative filmmaking on a high budget, because a movie like this with that budget doesn't get made very often",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Sequel that didn't need to be made,"I loved the original film, it left me wondering what just happened and where did the story go after the credits rolled, and that was fine for me. The Sequel just never takes off, it spends a lot of time selling the idea of the previous film, before it tries to come up with something new. There are many, many scenes in this film that are pointless and drawn out. They attempt to create an underlying theme but all they do is extend out parts of the film needlessly.Jared Leto's performance, in particular, is over acted and drawn out. His entire story line could be left out and the movie would function exactly the same, and would actually be more enjoyable. One of the scenes later in the film really ruins the legacy of the original. It was a homage that was as awful as the Leia scene in Rouge One.The main story is mildly interesting to a point, but it gets watered down with all the auxiliary re-hashed ideas from the previous film. Where as the original was a believable piece of Sci-Fi, this has scene after scene that leaves you sitting there thinking, ""So that just happened how exactly?""Not worth the trip to the cinemas, glad my ticket was free.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best sequels EVER,"""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017 release; 162 min.) brings the story of K. As the movie opens, we get a thumbnail reminder/explanation of what replicants are and what a blade runner is. The newest generation replicants (in ""California 2049"" we are told) are fully integrated into society. We see K visit a farm outside LA, where he ""retires"" an old model replicant who had taken up farming. On the farm, K stumbles upon a mysterious box that contains the remains of a female replicant who it seems was pregnant and died while delivering the child. How could that be possible? At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the long-awaited (35 years!) sequel to the seminal sci-fi movie ""Blade Runner"", which when it came out in 1982 was light-years ahead of its time and cemented Ridley Scott as one of the top directors of his generation. This time around, Denis Villeneuve (who previously has brought us, among others, the excellent ""Sicario"" and ""Arrival"") is at the helm, and, apparently not feeling the weight of sky-high expectations 3+ decades in the making, Villeneuve takes us on a journey that delivers, and then some. This is a plot-heavy movie, so the lesser said, the better. But a couple of general observations: I cannot easily recall a movie where the production and set design is so integral to the plot, and so remarkable. The production budget for this movie reportedly was $150 million, and it certainly shows. But even more important, it is absolutely amazing how closely this sequel stays true to the original movie in spirit and in tone. If you are expecting an ""action movie"" (as the Blade Runner 2049 trailer gave the impression), you will be wildly disappointed. Sure there are some action scenes, but the movie is slow-paced in the best possible way. Ryan Gosling brings perhaps the finest performance of his career as K. And don't be mistaken, this is a Ryan Gosling movie far more than it is a Harrison Ford movie (who finally appears almost 2 hours into it). Cuban actress Ana de Armas (previously in ""Hands of Stone"" and ""War Dogs"") has a break-out performance as K's virtual PA. Jared Leno has a small but noteworthy role as the replicant manufacturer Wallace. Robin Wright stars as K's boss in the LAPD. Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks (keeping the Dutch connection with the 1982 movie starring Dutch actor Rutger Hauer) is remarkable as Wallace's enforcer Luv. Last but certainly not least, the original score (credited to Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer) is very much Vangelis-inspired and sounds glorious. Beware: at 2 hrs. and 45 min., this is a dense movie which takes its time, but which rewards richly for those wanting to invest their time, interest and emotional involvement.""Blade Runner 2049"" opened wide this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. I went to see it with my 30 yr. old son. In anticipation, we had watched (for me: re-watched) the original movie, and our expectations were high. Even so (or despite that), we were both stunned how good this movie was. We literally couldn't movie from our seats when it was over and we stayed stuck for the entire end credits (which seemingly take forever). The Saturday early evening screening where we saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but by no means was it a sell-out. Regardless, if you liked the 1982 movie, I bet you will LOVE this sequel, one of the best ever sequels in my humble opinion. I'd readily suggest you check out ""Blade Runner"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too slow. Too long.,"Despite the huge recognition by both fans and critics, I did not enjoy the first Blade Runner movie. I found it confusing and too slow. To me, there was nothing enjoyable in that movie. Blade Runner 2019 is a bit of an improvement as the storyline is a bit more clear. It is visually stunning with good performances from the actors. Visual effects and action scenes are extremely well done. However, its sluggishness is a big issue. In fact, they could have easily made this into a 2 hour movie if they cut down the first half in which nothing really happenes. It is disappointing to see that they have not been able to correct mistakes that led to poor box office performance of the first movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Pretentious, slow and boring","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I didn't expect awful. I'm old enough to remember the original movie which was innovative and interesting. Most of the acting in the original was stellar and it wasn't gimmicky. I can't say the same for this sequel (which might just be a set up for a third unfortunately). Ryan Goslings character was interesting, most of the other replicants were not. Jared Leto's character was just annoying. Robin Wright's small but interesting part was maybe the highlight of the whole film. You notice I haven't said much about Harrison Ford who is Indiana Jones old man mode.The most annoying part of the was the visuals and the music (at least I this that's what they're calling it). I though of 2001 Space Odessy but that music was actually good. It was suppose to post-war California but the sets were so dark you couldn't see the characters. In one scene I kept thinking of Mad Max and not Blade Runner. Totally a missed opportunity to make an interesting sequel.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Visual Triumph,"I lived in fear of this film since it was announced having loved the original, a sequel was always going to be a risky prospect. But my fears were slightly quelled when I learned that Denis Villeneuve (""Arrival"") was at the helm. And having now seen it I am pleasantly relieved: this is a memorable film.In 2049 the first-generation Nexus replicants of the original film are still causing problems, and Ryan Gosling is 'K' – a blade runner employed by LAPD lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright, ""Wonder Woman"", ""House of Cards"") to track them down and liquidate them. On one of these missions, K uncovers a buried secret that brings the LAPD into a desperate race for a pivotal prize, against replicant-builder Niander Wallace (Jared Leto, ""Dallas Buyer's Club"") and his henchwoman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). The mission leads to K searching out his illustrious predecessor Deckard (Harrison Ford), who is not keen to be found.Firstly (and most impressively) this is a spectacle to watch. ""I've seen things""! The visuals are just gorgeous, from the junk-yards of Greater Los Angeles to the radioactive ruins of Las Vegas, vividly glowing amber to glorious effect. Hardly a surprise with Roger Deakins (""Hail Caesar"", ""Sicario"") behind the camera, but Adam Heinis (""Rogue One"") and the rest of his special effects team deserve kudos for the effects never feeling overly ""CGI-like"".The music (by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, via a replaced Johann Johannsson) pays suitable tribute to the spirit of the original Vangelis soundtrack. (It's curious though that ""Tears in the Rain"" from the soundtrack is a reworking of the Vangelis original, but Vangelis doesn't seem to be credited anywhere! Vangelis and Ridley Scott clearly had a SERIOUS falling out!).On the acting front, Ryan Gosling is his dynamic self as usual! (But here, somewhat justified). Harrison Ford is given very little screen time, but what he does do he does exceptionally well – his best performance in years. It's some of the supporting parts though that really appeal: Dave Bautista (""Spectre"") is just superb in the opening scenes of the film, and I particularly enjoyed Ana de Armas's portrayal of K's holographic girlfriend Joi. I've seen comment in other reviews that described this relationship as ""laughable"" and a downward step for ""woman's rights"" compared to Villeneuve's previous strong female characters (of Louise from ""Arrival"" and Kate from ""Sicario""). But I disagree! I found the relationship truly touching, with Joi's procurement of a prostitute (Mackenzie Davis) to act as a surrogate body being both loving and giving. And as regards 'woman's rights', come on! Get serious! This is a holographic commercial male companion. the ""Alexa"" of the future. I'm quite sure the male version looks like Ryan Reynolds! Sex still sells even in 2049!!My favourite character though was a cameo by Barkhad Abdi (""Captain Phillips"") luxuriating under the name of Doctor Badger!I was less comfortable with Jared Leto's dialogue which – for me at least was barely audible. In general this film is both a challenge for those aurally challenged (with some fuzzy dialogue/effects/music mixes) and those visually challenged (with 8 point font for the on-screen text that was almost impossible to see on the cinema screen, so good luck with the DVD!).I really wanted to give this film 10 stars. But I can't quite get there. The story – while interesting and having emotional depth – is lightweight for a film of this length (a butt-numbing 163 minutes!) and it moves at such a glacial pace that I'm ashamed to say that my mind wandered at times. The screenplay was by Hampton Fancher (one of the original Blade Runner writers) and Michael Green (""Logan"", ""Alien: Covenant"") but even with this track record, the it's the film's Achilles heel.It's a relief that Blade Runner revisited is not a complete disaster: quite the opposite in fact. It doesn't quite match C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate (what could) but its a damned good attempt.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the full and graphical version of this review.

This is how you make a worthy sequel: by expanding it in every direction,"Blade Runner has long been tough love for me. The first time I saw it I was almost bored to death by it, but since everybody kept saying what an absolute classic it was, I kept revisiting it. Somehow, there was this nagging feeling that I was missing out on something great. Of course I could see that it was superbly made on the art direction level, but I estimate that it took me about 5 or 6 times before I fully grasped the pure sci-fi themes at its core: what makes us human, and what excludes an artificial human from that qualification? Like all truly great art, Blade Runner has many layers and different qualities, and doesn't reveal its secrets all at once.It is not hard to imagine why Denis Villeneuve was daunted by the task to make a worthy successor to this cult movie. It is also easy to see that he succeeded incredibly well: Blade Runner 2049, like Aliens, Terminator 2 and Empire Strikes Back, is one of those rare movies that isn't just a great movie, it's also a great sequel. The best compliment I could give would be that it feels like a completely organic and logical follow-up to its predecessor, a natural second chapter, as if it were already conceived together with the original, rather than afterwards. Both Villeneuve and producer Ridley Scott said they were won over by a great script. Now this is something every filmmaker says before delivering a sub-par sequel (Wes Craven reportedly said the same about Scream 4), but in this case, it couldn't be more true.Good sequels use familiar parts, add some new, and in exceptional cases, they create something that casts a different light on its predecessor(s). Unlike The Force Awakens, Villeneuve doesn't rely on the classic elements from the very start (apart from he close-up of an eye). He opens with brightly lit shots from greenhouses on the countryside as opposed to a dark city skyline, and he even resists temptation to use the familiar sound from the flying Spinner cars. After re-introducing us to the harsh world of the future where humans have de-humanized and Replicants have no rights, he occasionally allows himself some familiar iconography, with sweeping shots of downtown LA, its seedy underbelly and the Tyrell pyramid; even Harrison Ford is sparingly used with maximum efficiency. The makers show remarkable restraint in a film that could have easily ended up becoming a quick re-hash; instead, it differentiates itself starkly by visiting the uncharted territories, both in its story and in the art-direction.The main plot deals with detective K trying to unearth a long-hidden secret, but again, those who read between the lines will see the implicit theme being explored here: is denying a race of Replicants their fundamental rights as beings on the grounds of the fact that they are manufactured instead of born not akin to slavery? Hampton Fancher and Michael Green did a superb job of including two survivors from the previous movie into the story, not as a fan service but as a logical extension of their journey. K (Ryan Gosling) becomes a reluctant player in the story, and part of his journey is finding out what exact role he plays in it. Another part is how K must find his place in a world where 'real' seems less clearly defined than ever. In his delightful scenes with Ana de Armas as his companion Joi, the human side of his stoic persona comes out, and it puts an interesting spin on the concept of 'what is real' when even Replicants seem to struggle with it. Some of the more touching scenes are pleasantly reminiscent of Spike Jonze's 'Her', and themes from Children Of Men, another superb movie inspired by Blade Runner's grim version of a dying future, are also quite overt. It is good to see that Blade Runner's spiritual successors have influenced its sequel in turn.Like true world-builders, Villeneuve and director of photography Roger Deakins show us the stark contrasts between the overpopulated city, the worn-out industrial outskirts and the almost surrealistic remains of Las Vegas. Combined with the slow-paced editing, this creates a sense of immersion that is rare in today's cinema. The sets and surroundings almost become like secondary characters in this set-up. Some might complain a bit about the excessive running time of over 2.5 hours, and in some scenes (especially the ones that focus on K's personal life), the tension sometimes trails off a bit too long at the expense of important subplots. But kudos for a director and a studio who dare to deliver a product much like its predecessor: an expansive, subtle, humane, cerebral, slow-burning blockbuster that feels no need to cater to audiences longing for lean, action-packed storytelling wrapped up in a neat climax. The satisfaction from 2049 not only comes from what it shows, but just as much from what it leaves out; not in the least in its beautifully subdued epilogue.2049 is a work of art that may even surpass the original, although I say that with some reservation, recognizing the amazing groundwork that the first film laid down. It's just that 2049 feels more complete, whereas Blade Runner, despite its many versions, sometimes seems enigmatic in the sense that some crucial parts still feel missing. The ending of 2049 can work on its own, but it could also be an opportunity for a successor that elaborates on the parts that are now merely subplots.The disappointing box office may crush that hope in its early stages; again, it may show that the popularity of a movie reflects the passion of its fans, and not necessarily the size of its audience. The overseas markets may give the film the success it deserves, but even if this is the final word, this makes 2049 a more than worthy companion piece for the fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Satisfying Sequel to a Sci-Fi Cult Classic,"Blade Runner 2049 lives up to die hard Fans for the original 1982 Classic directed by Ridley Scott. I didn't see the original film until it came on HBO or Showtime when I was a kid growing up in the 80's. But, over the years, the movie strucked me and it grew. And after watching it over and over again on DVD since R. Scott's director's cut in 2007. There so many editions of it released on DVD and Blu-Ray. But I have the Directors cut. So let's get to it. This film is brilliantly directed by Denis Villenvenue. When I saw it, I wasn't expecting a fast paced action film. All the elements in the film was what I expected. Yes, it's CGIED up but you have to understand in the Blade Runner world things changed out there in LA. The film is slow paced and it grows through out to the end so the audience could get a sense of what's this new film's about. After 30 years, it's 2049, new Blade Runner Officer K (Ryan Gosling) tries to track down and search for Deckard (H.Ford). And that's it. Gosling's performance was good but while you're watching it, you immediately want to see Harrison Ford and Gosling couldn't hold the film for too long. Los Angeles is different. The setting and the cinematography is outstanding by Roger Deakins. Great acting by the supporting cast. Jared Leto is great as Wallace the new manufacturer of new replicants. Robin Wright is always good in any role she plays as a Police Chief of the LAPD. Actually who steals the film is Sylvia Hoesk, as an evil replicant that will do anything to get what she wants.Overall, the Film is great but you have watch it several times to get a better understanding and all the questions will be answered. Yes, the film is long 2hours 45minutes yet it's worth it. The music is wild and moving by Hans Zimmerman. Visually Stunning and Unbelievable. Rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Would only have been love or hate for me...,"To me there are certain films that should be spared the modern obsession for reboots and sequels to everything that has ever been made. Some films should be left to stand alone, without being expanded upon in a money- making exercise or an attempt to revisit past glories. Some films come together so well that it would be a great crying shame to spoil their memory and their essence by lazily ballsing up the perfect little universe they created. Such, I imagined, would be the case with any sequel to Blade Runner. Ridley Scott adapted Philip K Dick's story into such an atmospheric piece which came together so beautifully in the world created for the screen. It looked spectacular, had a wonderfully appropriate soundtrack, and was cast brilliantly with Harrison Ford's quiet aloof charm offset by Rutger Hauer's menace. I have often thought, right up until the point I entered the cinema in fact, that any attempt to add to this world would end in disaster.From another perspective, I clung to the hope that with the original scriptwriter on board and under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 would have half a chance. Throw in the enigmatic Ryan Gosling and I was really starting to hope that there would be enough talent on board to give this a chance. I dared not expect this to be the case, of course, and was prepared to endure the film in raging disappointment. The one plus side of that scenario would be that I could enjoy tearing it to shreds here.To say 2049 is a slow burner would be a massive understatement. Right from the start, Villeneuve sets a tone for the film which I would describe as beautifully paced, although I'm sure others would use the word 'slow'. I absolutely loved the way nothing was rushed to be crammed down the audience throats. Plot and character development are moved along in a way that felt extremely natural. Villeneuve manages to wonderfully recreate Scott's world, bringing it up to date but not overdoing the use of new technologies. The soundtrack does a fantastic job of evoking Vangelis' original score without making it an updated copy, and this more than anything really does make you think that 2049 is an extension of the original film rather than a modern-day money making sequel.The performances are also top notch. Gosling is well within his comfort zone as the vacant yet inwardly conflicted 'K', battling with what inner soul he may have, but this shouldn't detract from the quality of his performance. Jared Leto also puts in a masterfully creepy effort as the enigmatic and disturbed Niander Wallace, who has taken over the replicant business, taking it to another level. Leto is more than ably supported by Sylvia Hoeks in the guise of his right-hand woman Luv. Hoeks' performance as the replicant striving for perfection mesmerised me. Her combination of emotion (and lack thereof) with brilliant work with her physical mannerisms makes Luv a threatening presence and a great character.It's no secret that Harrison Ford also reprises his role as Rick Deckard. I'm slightly conflicted in this area, to be honest. Ford always puts in a performance of quality, as he does here, but I am beginning to feel slightly sad about watching him attempt to recreate past characters. This isn't to take away from the talent he still has, but watching him return in recent years as Indiana Jones and Han Solo, I have felt that I was watching an old Harrison Ford rather than the characters themselves. To a lesser extent, such is the case here; however, he is able to slip back into Deckard with more success as he is not asked to perform much in the way of action, which he is no longer really capable of. His role is important in 2049, so it is the right decision to include him, but a small part of me wishes it could have been otherwise. This is probably too harsh, and I am sure many will disagree. Just a personal thing.The main plot is not overly complicated, and there are small pointers laced throughout the film, some subtler than others. It is not really that original (a similar plot line runs through the more modern incarnation of Battlestar Galactica) but its simplicity is one of the things that makes 2049 work as well as it does. You don't need to over- complicate things, as there is plenty of substance in the characters themselves. Villeneuve also keeps up the intensity throughout in such a way that keeps you glued, waiting for what must be coming. A personal favourite is the scene in the hotel ballroom, which incorporates some lovely little touches in the sound effects department. You could also nearly watch 2049 as a standalone film, without no knowledge of the original, although clearly certain elements of it will make much more sense if you are acquainted with the background. Certain touches of nostalgia also help carry this along, which fit in nicely and aren't overdone.Not in my wildest dreams would I have imagined a Blade Runner sequel working this well. Villeneuve recreates an atmosphere in 2049 that I was completely swept up in. One personal gripe is that I felt it was one scene too long. I didn't care much for the last twenty seconds and felt it should have ended just before the very last scene, but I may be in a tiny minority here.I can't see how any fans of the original would be disappointed. A brilliant piece of filmmaking, and a wonderful surprise. As good as the original? Maybe not, but it certainly does it justice in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible.",,Anonymous,Mystery

It's not easy to create a masterpiece...,"I just watched Blade Runner 2049, which left me a bit sad and disappointed. Yes it pales in comparison, even though in the surface, Denis Villeneuve did a reasonable job with the film.In the original Blade Runner, the story of Deckard is a mere decoy, a means to justify and support the tragedy of Roy Batty and his friends. The most powerful character is not Deckard but Roy Batty, the Nexus Replicant looking for his creator. Like a human being, he has unanswered questions (inception date, longevity, ) and is looking for meaning. He is a tragic hero. His identity is based on fake memories, and some real experiences, without which he has no way of understanding himself and the world. He fights not just for survival, but to grasp the why of his existence as a slave and to rejoin his creator, his ""father"". Like in the Oedipus myth, he ends up killing his father and while doing so, blinds him (whereas Oedipus blinds himself) - and there is a lot to be said about the eyes, and the giver of the light that comes through them... He knows then that his quest and desire of immortality is without hope, but during this process, he also becomes more human than Deckard (who himself might be a replicant - but that is left for interpretation). Roy is the real hero, the one with whom ultimately we can relate to. When he dies, the story is told. The dialogs are few, but meaningful, well written, and have a psycho-analytical reach (- ""I'll tell you about my mother""), a poetic tone ("" All those things will be gone, like tear drops in the rain""), and often serve to convey a philosophical meaning (-"" Is it a real owl?"" ).Most of the meaning is carried through the images, rich in allegories and symbolism: the diffuse lighting, the reflections on the walls, the giant images of virtual people on the streets, reminding one of Plato's cavern, and questioning the very essence of ""Reality"", (seen through our eyes, or remembered in our minds), and of our own nature.Yes Blade Runner 2049 steals from the first Blade Runner: the visual aspect, the characters, the symbols (horses, toys, unicorns, origamis, giant images in the streets, photos ). But what does it give in exchange or adds to it? Not much. A good Sci-Fi thriller I suppose, regretfully so far from the spirit of Philip K.Dick. Because what I really dislike the most, is that by adding to the original movie, Villeneuve diminishes it. By giving his own interpretation he steals what I had in my own mind, the many meanings and interpretations enabled by the questions intentionally left unanswered by its original creators.In the original and only Blade Runner, there is so much imagination, so much attention to detail, to the veracity of the characters and the depth of personal dilemmas, so many philosophical questions for the spectators to answer for themselves, acting like ""koans"" in their minds, so many symbols and literary references, that I consider Blade Runner a masterpiece. It is still my favourite movie, the one that left me a life lasting impression, and if anything, I suggest you watch it again to feel the difference.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Master Class if Film Making,"Those of you who are expecting a space/science fiction action flick will likely be disappointed, but those that are interested in more of the hard core science fiction genre, those that can appreciate the quietness and build up of a slower pace, those that appreciate the multiple layered themes and character study, and what it means to be sentient or ""human"" will then appreciate this film.The execution of the film making is undeniably astonishing, even if you didn't particularly enjoy the film. You should be able to appreciate the effort and attention to detail that went into making this film. The production design, cinematography, soundtrack, acting, directing, costume design, CGI, ETC. Are pinnacles of film making. Unfortunately, many film audiences have become desensitized because of big budget, easily consumable block busters, and can't really tell the overly reliant CGI, by the numbers production, versus something that is truly a work of film art. Mad Max Fury Road is another film that comes to mind in this category.I am a huge fan of the original Blade Runner. The visuals and the world the film existing in, was just stunning and original. The movie itself suffered from some pacing and plot issues, but because it was so original, that could be overlooked. Now some movie-goers will have an issue with the slow pace of this sequel, but it does not have pacing issues. I don't think most even know what that means, but it is really the transition from scene to scene and how those scenes tells the story without it feeling the story has stalled. This movie is slower paced, but does not have any pacing issues. The movie is long, but if you are invested in the story, it doesn't feel long at all. I've seen plenty of 2 hour movies with pacing issues that makes the movie feel like 4 hours (like some Zach Snyder movies).I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but if you are so inclined to enjoy sci-fi movies like Arrival, Ex Machina, Ad Astra, ETC., then there is a very high chance you will greatly enjoy this movie. For those who didn't like this movie, I hope you that you can at least appreciate the film making that went into it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If the original was a 10 . . .,". . . Blade Runner 2049 is a 6. Maybe 6.5 or 7. First of all, the mission of any sequel is to be as good or better than the original. Most fail, just as BR2049 failed to accomplish it's task. Without going into spoiling detail, let me just say that it was directed by one trying trying to be Ridley Scott. The score was written and performed by one (or twain) trying to be Vangelis. There is sincere flattery in their impersonation but it's not the Real Deal. The original Blade Runner was paced. You can't let a movie pace itself 2-3/4 hours without its seeming to drag. I watched this film because it was a Blade Runner sequel and they promised us Harrison Ford, which we got. Did I like BR2049? It was okay. Would I see it again? Probably, but not soon and NOT in a theater. And I'll probably buy a copy when it ends up in the Wal-Mart discount bin. I'll even throw in a guarded recommendation to those wondering if it's worth the admission. But if you love, love, loved the original Blade Runner you may be more reserved in your praise of this sequel. It is not the 10 star masterpiece some are making it out to be but neither is it the 1 star dog that others say it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Haunting and illuminating.,"A perfect eye and a pale near-void of complex, indecipherable patterns gives way to a sterile protein farm full of empty space; filled with a feeling of deprivation and loneliness. This is how Blade Runner 2049 begins before bringing us back to the wet, ultra-dense, black and neon maze of the super-city we know so well. This is how Denis Villeneuve lets us know right away that this is his movie, one full of reverence for the original, but a film that is much, much more than a mere homage.Villeneuve has always been much more Kubrickian than Ridley Scott ever was. In his best work, Scott was a great visionary and incredible composer, but he doesn't have quite the same feeling with the composition. Villeneuve continues to bring us transcendentally arresting visual arrangements, rather than copying Scott's style. This is an excellent choice because when you're picking up the thread of a work of art 35 years later, it's best to make your production your own.Once or twice I felt the dialogue might be a little on-the-nose to the themes, but I don't feel conclusive about this at all and I won't deduct from my grade. One thing is for sure, Villeneuve is not copying the original Blade Runner to any degree. There are a small handful of nods to the original, but this is such its own. The structure and pacing of this story is not at all a carbon copy of the first, and it does an excellent job of bringing you in sync with its rhythm.This is a challenging film, as it should be! There are many subtleties to the motivations of the characters. In particularly, there is a fight that moves from gunplay to fisticuffs that Gosling's character of ""K"" takes part in which I'm not entirely sure I understand the cause for, but I also don't see any clear break in logic to it, either. There are a great deal of elements to this work which are fine-tuned to evoke thought and contemplation. This is, again, in line with Kubrick's priorities and works.In some ways, this movie reminds me of Logan (2017). Naturally, Blade Runner 2049 was in production before that film was even released, so I would say it's more a matter of both of them tapping into some very classic themes; themes which seem to be very resonant at this moment.Nothing bad can be said about any of the dramatic talent. Everyone is the definition of pitch-perfect. The set work and special effects are all breathtaking. The music was for me almost 100% perfect and amazing, but the very loud and harsh ""waahhh-ohhh"" synth noises in ""Sea Wall"" (the music during the lead-up to the final confrontation) and reprised in the end credits music ""Blade Runner"" were not to my taste. They are anxiety-inducing with their timbre and tonality (probably intended) and also bring bad dubstep to mind, so this was an unfortunate negative piece for me. If they were a little different, it probably would have been much more welcome to me. As much as I dislike it, though, I can't imagine lowering the grade on an otherwise perfect film for a musical element that's only in the movie for not even a minute total split between two instances.Blade Runner 2049 possesses depth and integrality of meaning and emotion the equal of its predecessor, the original Blade Runner. It is a captivating and powerfully moving work of highest art, of the kind that is so very badly needed today. It is my most fervent wish that any further entry in this story maintains this level of excellence. To mar the existing works with a sequel that is anything less would be a crime.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Missing the humanity of the original classic.,"Very average, very bloated, run of the mill sci-fi actioner.
Too many one-dimensional characters (The Joker & his ""Feminator""), stereotypes beamed in from the sci-fi ""Abrams-verse"", that corporate Hollywood churns out these days.
The original still looks amazing and futuristic, this one, not so much. Very bland world, only when they directly copy from the original does it look even remotely interesting.
Harrison Ford continues his retirement tour of his previous films. He's Harrison Ford, so that's good enough, but watching this adds nothing to the character of Deckard. He's simply used as a clumsy plot device.
Ryan Gosling is fine as the detective ""in over his head"", the standard noir character Ford played in the original. He deserved to be in a better film.
There are some cameos that add nothing except to the bloated runtime. The other main characters are pretty cardboard, none of the subtlety & ambiguity of the original.Not as awful as the corporate ""disney-fied"" dross that is modern sci-fi, but still a missed opportunity and not a patch on the classic original.

"Good, nearly great","On paper, this should be my favourite film ever: once I'd heard Ryan Gosling with Denis Villenueve in a sci-fi film, backed by Roger Deakins on cinematography and Hans Zimmer doing music, what more could I really ask for?Unfortunately, Blade Runner 2049 still feels like it's missing a killer edge: comparing it to the almost incomparable Interstellar, a critical eye could have cut some weird dialogue and unnecessary scenes, sorted out the wobbly parts of the story and produced genuine magic. Ultimately, this makes the second Blade Runner film only a good watch, not a great one.As far as image and sound are concerned, there aren't many that can compare with this work: the environments are beautiful, detailed and full of moments to catch the eye. Even in the slightly more minimalist scenes, the quality employed makes them excellent to look at.The music can be described with the same superlatives, a dystopic, vibrating score that complements and dominates scenes brilliantly.Acting-wise, this is also a great watch. You can count Gosling's bad performances on one finger, and the supporting ensemble (de Armas, Wright, Leto, Bautista) are equally well-cast. What I think let me down was the story itself - not on its quality, but the ease with which one can comprehend it, alongside the questions left at the end.A lot of what is relevant is from the original Blade Runner that released almost 40 years ago, and this is a potential oversight in my mind. Further to this, some character motives are still not entirely clear by the conclusion; does this set up a sequel, or is this just laziness disguised as ""plot ambiguity""?These are, however, my own personal grievances: overall, Blade Runner 2049 is no doubt a solid film and worth a watch - I just don't think it is the world-beater I was hoping for.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing (almost),"This film gorgeous as everyone has noted. One of the most beautiful films I've seen in a while. It's not a breakthrough piece like the original but it's a good smart story all the same.I like sci fi and was enthralled for about three quarters of the film. There is a clever play on the question of how we would treat androids that reverses roles in the romantic life of the main protagonist 'K'. So much of the film revolves around the replicants that I felt something akin to culture shock. There's a grimly humorous reference to the anarchic bands of post apocalyptic humans found in so many other future dystopias. The return of Deckard is mostly well done. The interesting question of whether he is a replicant is almost answered but (again) thankfully not conclusively.The film is too long. I thought that was just the complaint of a younger generation brought up on thoughtless Marvel ""sci fi"". But some scenes added time without purpose. And for all that time taken the film ends without much of a conclusion. Maybe that's okay: not an archetypal storyline. But you can feel the producers wanting a sequel if the film does well. I'm not a fan of this contemporary trend that puts box office takings ahead of story structure. Despite its length I felt the film was well paced overall.Perhaps the biggest fumble is the character of Wallace. Unlike the original film this one contains an unambiguous ""bad guy"". He's a straightforward psychopath from central casting. And boring as a result. What's worse, they gave him some quirky robot doodads - a clear cover for the lack of depth in the character. His henchwoman replicant is better, she's got some personality and a more relatable motive.I'm particularly fond of dystopian film futures.

I realized in doing so that a big part of the appeal of Blade Runner was its newness, its brash originality and its boldness. There is nothing like that in Blade Runner 2049 at all. Instead, I got the feeling that the whole world was on quaaludes, a sense perhaps enhanced by the droning, desperate-sounding, yawning musical score.Is the story coherent or plausible?

In order not to reveal the essence of the story, I just want to say that this is a story about how one way or another, everyone considers himself to be special.Director. Denis Villeneuve also brought us a lot of things that humanity is realizing in the near future. In most of his films Villeneuve touches on the theme of children, in this film he also devoted much time to the theme of parents and children. In fact, as some critics noted, the picture is very similar to Tarkovsky's work, the meditative narrative of the film allows us to reflect on philosophical questions: are all our memories real and is man really a supreme being?Music and visual effects. Despite the fact that there were two outstanding composers working on the film (Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer), the music in the film is quite small and it is not remembered. Basically, all the compositions are very similar to each other and create an exceptionally tense atmosphere. A small amount of original music in the film partially compensates for the appearance in the film songs by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Unlike music, the film strikes a visual component. The film implements completely new creative design ideas, thanks to which you experience a real visual pleasure.The Result.

Yes, we certainly are back in the world of Blade Runner.It is 30 years since the events of Blade Runner but the sun-starved, murky, 'dystopian' Los Angeles still remains just to a larger scale than before.This time around, Ridley Scott takes a step back into executive producer, bringing Prisoners and Arrival director Denis Villeneuve to the hot seat.But much like the original, it's the grand design and blanketing sound is what grasps you by the collar and rattles you. The iconic soundtrack of the original 1982 sci-fi masterpiece – courtesy of composer Vangelis – is reincorporated this time around by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch and immediately you are engulfed back into this estranged world.It would be difficult to delve too far into the story-line given the complexity and any potential for spoilers, but there is a definite progression from the original whilst also keeping every inch of quality the Scott's 1982 masterpiece possessed.Nevertheless, Ryan Gosling takes the role of Officer K (or KD6-3.7 to be precise) – a Blade Runner tasked to hunt down bio-engineered humans known as 'replicants'.It's some leap for Gosling to go from all singing and dancing in La La Land to an environment completely unknown to him as he takes on his first sci-fi role. It's testament to this incredible actor that he can indulge his audience in every product he touches through the unique emotion he can portray simply through a bland facial expression.And Blade Runner 2049 is certainly a movie that has its audiences emotionally invested in – it isn't the standard sci-fi action-er that passes by. There's a lot of attention and concentration needed to grapple through the story-line and its characters.This film wasn't made for anyone, but for fans of the original – of which its base grew over time and as a result is now considered one of the greatest movies of its time.Villeneuve is rapidly becoming a genius of our generation and he seamlessly continues this world with all the traits of the original. Blade Runner captures everything that was brilliant about its predecessor, expertly blending the film noir and sci-fi elements almost creating its own unique genre.It's a slow burner, but through the vast panning shots of a vast 'dystopian' universe and the smothering soundtrack, you can't help but be constantly taken aback by this immense spectacle.Another element of the original that remains is Harrison Ford's character of Deckard who although features less than anticipated, is an integral part to the story and Ford nails the performance as expected despite his initial concerns of featuring in the sequel.One red mark against the film would be its length however. At two hours and forty- four minutes, it exceeds the threshold and there are plenty of moments throughout the movie that could be cut just to help make it more comfortable for its audience.That said, this should take nothing away from what an incredibly deserved sequel Blade Runner 2049 is. It is a movie that will live long in the memory of fans of the original and it exceeds expectations with Villeneuve pulling off another masterpiece in his already impressive catalogue of products.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Watch this if you like to think,"I just watched this again in 4K, after seeing the original in cinemas upon release. Blade Runner 2049 is simply one of the best films I have seen, from any genre. The story and script are fantastic, with acting performances to match, and the cinematography is simply stunning.A lot of people won't like this film because not everything is resolved nicely and ambiguity remains. It resists the urge of infantilisation that so many films, especially American it must be said, succumb. This disease infects the story, acting, action theatrics of so many films, that I wonder whether it is a symptom of larger societal ills.Gosling's performance is perfectly reserved because K is never at ease in his own 'skin' and is aware of his precarious position in human society. In this character, the film is saying something deeper about the place of minorities in society. The plight of the orphans left to scramble to survive in the scrap metal wastelands is another reminder. The hellish dystopia of LA life in a world living with the after effects of some ecological disaster is another visage that hits home.Anyway, there is no neat resolution in this film. Could there be another? Certainly there are enough threads on which to pull. I would love to see it, if we could find a script with sufficient depth and nuance, and of course a match for the incredible vision and direction of Denis Villeneuve.This is a complex film in which you must immerse yourself. It is not a film that offers vicarious and simplistic righting of wrongs. Captain America and Ironman don't shake hands at the end, no hard feelings. This is a film that sticks with you long after you see it, and isn't that the hallmark of great filmmaking?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Villeneuve's Sequel is Ambitious and Well-Made,"I really enjoyed both the original ""Blade Runner"" as well as director Denis Villeneuve's previous films, and had been highly anticipating this long-awaited sequel. I thought it was a well-made but imperfect sequel that must be greatly commended for its sheer ambition and aesthetic quality/overtones, but also a somewhat flawed one that does not manage to top the original film in terms of quality.First of all, the film's visual effects are nothing short of astonishing. They are oddly both simple and highly complex in design, and look truly gorgeous on the big screen. Ryan Gosling is excellent as the protagonist, a blade runner named Officer K. Fans of this franchise will also be delighted to see Harrison Ford return to the screen as Deckard. Jared Leto is convincing as the villain as well. While the film's story is generally well-done, the flaws that are inherent in this sequel pertain to the structure and sequence of the story in some way. The film's pacing is not bad, but the film does drag a little bit in the middle. Also, the way the plot is organized sometimes makes the film feel rather dry, and the script cannot quite offset this feeling. I realize that it will be hard to conjure up a scene quite as potent and powerful as Roy Batty's famous ""tears in the rain"" monologue near the end of the first movie, but for a director so seasoned at generating genuine emotion and tension, it's very slightly underwhelming that Villeneuve had difficulty adding some density to the soul of the movie.Overall, this is a solid sequel, although not as good as the original or Villeneuve's other films. Recommended. 7.5/10Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The exceptional visuals and special formatting for the IMAX release made seeing the film on such a screen well worth the additional cost.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Master Mess of a Movie!,"This film is garbage.Over long, muddled, confused, boring, with no likable characters.The story-as far as I can decipher-relates to a woeful future time when replicants/robots seek to destroy earlier models.But of course the film tries to dictate to us that there being no substitute for humans... the problem with that preaching is that it was, I assume, a human who made this total nonsense of a movie!What is just as bad as the blandness of this picture is that many so called professional film reviewers are writing treatises etc., on how wonderful is this film.The fact- as opposed to the science fiction- is that this flick is a disaster and an abject mess:1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely stunning film that deserves your patience..,"Yes, this is a long film without a whole lot of action. This means you should skip it if you don't have a long attention span and expect an explosion every 15 minutes.However, when you're in the right mindset and pay close attention you can see what a huge masterpiece this films is. It can suck you in and never let go. The visuals and the soundtrack are amazing. The story was very well setup in my opinion and it kept you guessing where it was going. Obviously I wanted to find out what happened to Deckard and Rachel. And while the film takes its time getting there, the twist involving K is worth it. The final act is incredibly suspenseful and I couldn't help but fight a tear at the new rendition of 'Tears in Rain'.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film to savour,"When I first heard that a sequel to Blade Runner was being made, I kept my enthusiasm curbed. However as soon as Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director, I was cautiously excited as his previous work has shown him to be an intelligent film maker who doesn't talk down to his audience.
With Blade Runner 2049 he has delivered a thoughtful, brooding, immersive piece of cinema which treats its source material with reverence but isn't constrained by it. He gives the story and characters room to breathe which gives you time to take in this beautifully shot, sharply written and superbly acted film.
If you like your sci-fi to be intelligent and rich, you should enjoy this.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""I have seen things you people wouldn't believe...""","Film is a medium that gets better with age. As a still picture is a form of reflection upon memory, a moving picture is a time capsule as well. While some shine only shortly within their moments of popularity, others grow in that popularity over the years even if they didn't have it upon first release. This circumstance is usually where the word ""classic"" tends to appear. While the term is usually revered in the filmmaking community, it often seems to scare critics. When age is usually a necessity in determining a classic it becomes difficult for a person who reviews the latest movies to use the term when describing something current. A fear of jumping the gun, and a fear I don't have. Blade Runner 2049 is a new classic. It will inspire countless young filmmakers as well as dazzle and delight fans of the original and those who have never seen it. I do not dare spoil this film. The plot is so well crafted and none of the points are forced upon the audience. It treats the viewer with respect and let's the audience put pieces together on their own. This is not to say that it is predictable. I think the biggest compliment I can give this film is that I didn't know where it was going. I was invested in the main characters struggles and that is mostly due to Ryan Gosling's superb performance. A performance that could not have been easy but because of that has now become my favorite of his. The amount of emotions he has to display through every scene is staggering and he pulls it off unbelievably. Aside from Gosling's performance we also have the star of the original Blade Runner; Harrison Ford returning as Rick Deckard. I have been a huge fan of Ford's career since I was a child and with that in mind I have to bring to light a fact that isn't easy to admit. Although he's great in the original as the disgruntled cop who learns to empathize with machines, he is very subtle with his emotions and doesn't often get into the really heavy, feely moments of a film. I am utterly amazed that this film brought out the sadness and pain in this character. Harrison Ford does things you never see him do here. I think it might be one of the best performances of his entire career. I often wonder where the new legends are. Spielberg, Kubrick, Scorsese, all the filmmaking giants that made their waves rise high above the heads of the industry and crash down with hit after hit and classic after classic. It appeared to me before I entered the theater that I had missed out on that era. Not to say that there aren't masters still out there today but they're just so hard to find. I now know that when the name ""Denis Villeneuve"" appears in the credits of a work, I will be blown away. Every film he has made thus far has been of exceptional quality and without a doubt, this is his finest work to date. I feel that he understood what made the original so revered, took it's DNA and crafted the finest specimen that he possibly could. There is another name that I must mention that I hope will soon become a household name just as the other legends that I mentioned previous. The man whose eye for angles and light have become legend to me. This man is Roger Deakins. Remember his name. This is just another passage in the great story that he's telling with his images. The world that has been created here feels so real, so lived in. The original gave us a glimpse into a future where machines were beginning to become more human than human, this film widens the keyhole and shows us the world where that is a full reality. And while I sat back in that IMAX theater, gazing at Deakins' vivid paintings, my ears were sucked in by the amazing soundtrack composed by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer. The synth sounds delighted and excited me. The most intense moments of the film were given that much more life by the music that drove them. What I find to be the greatest thing about this new masterpiece is that, I had so little expectations for it. I walked through those doors with an indifference inside me. Why make a sequel to a film that relied on thought provoking questions that were never answered? A sequel exists to expand on the first, so will it ruin all of the best aspects of the first? What could this film possibly bring? I was so wrong. The questions that existed before are still there as well as new ones that still have me thinking even as I write this now. I can analyze this film for years just as so many have the original. I know that this film won't be loved by all. The runtime will most likely be too long for the average blockbuster viewer, the complex ideals presented will annoy those who came for action, the pace will most likely completely bore them. But I feel those that do have these problems will come to realize something as well...that's exactly what people thought of the original when it was released. Now it is a classic. When I got in my car and proceeded along the dark road to my home, I sat in silence as my mind raced faster than my vehicle could take me. Of all the things that I didn't expect, I certainly didn't expect to see one of the greatest films I've ever viewed in the year 2017. Film truly is an amazing medium. And as I pulled into my driveway and killed the engine, I fretted over the biggest question that I had that evening, a question that still haunts me nowIs it better than the original?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A visually stunning return to the world of Blade Runners and replicants,"Thirty years after the events portrayed in the original film Blade Runners are still hunting down rogue replicants; this time Nexus 8 models who have no expiry date. Newer models are considered safer as they must obey orders. One such newer model is 'K', a blade runner whose existence is thrown into turmoil after bones are found at the home of a Nexus 8 he 'retired'. They show evidence of something thought impossible; something that if made public could undermine the peace between humanity and replicants. He is tasked with ensuring that the most important evidence of what happened is destroyed... in the process he learns more about himself and eventually meets Deckard. He isn't the only person searching; the Wallace Corporation, successors to Tyrell are searching too.I've kept my plot synopsis as vague as possible to avoid any potential spoilers even though some of the main revelations come early in the film. The story is enjoyable; I liked how it added to the original without being more of the same. For the most part the characters are new and interesting as are the advances in technology. Ryan Gosling impressed as K; it was interesting to have a lead character who was undeniable a replicant but still had a degree of mystery about him. It was great seeing Harrison Ford return as Deckard even if the character isn't in the film for as long as one might expect; there was also a fun cameo from Edward James Olmos as Gaff. Of the other characters the three most interesting were all women; Ana de Armas, who delighted as K's holographic girlfriend Joi; Sylvia Hoeks; who was impressive as Luv, an enforcer for the Wallace Corporation and Robin Wright who is solid as K's superior Lt. Joshi. As well as being interesting the film is visually stunning with fantastic special effects and a very impressive design. The film isn't perfect of course; some scenes go on a bit too long meaning the film is quite a bit longer than it really needs to be... still I was really impressed overall and would definitely recommend it to fans of the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's a replicant of a replicant - but it shines,"This movie affected me more than any other film I have seen in years. It took me by surprise because the trailers indicated that they had 'actioned up' the material. Not true - in fact practically every action shot in the movie is in the short trailers! Blade Runner 2049 is in no hurry; but neither is it overblown for its runtime. This is more or less the length this particular story and style needed.I wasn't expecting Hollywood to make this admittedly unnecessary sequel into a spellbinding and dark existential musing that has far more in common with Tarkovsky than Ridley Scott's original work. This is the kind of pace and tone of 1970s Soviet cinema, overlaid with production values those films could never aspire to.Gosling's character in Blade Runner 2049 is one of the saddest cinematic creations since the Kubrick/Spielberg outing; an artificial person so hated by real people that they randomly insult him in his place of work and spray further insults on his apartment door. His good looks just make it worse, since they emphasise his artificial nature; so he lives without friends, talking only to the fellow replicants he must kill, his cold-hearted boss and other 'non-people' on the diaspora of society, such as prostitutes.K's only recourse in terms of companionship is a hologram girlfriend, who he treats well, and not just like the sex object she is advertised as - and who seems to genuinely fall in love with him; all analogous to an isolated and unwanted nerd reading too much into the content of porn chatrooms, longing for something deeper than they offer.If your life was that bad, you might not want to get in touch with your emotions much either. So it's ironic (surely not intentional..?) that the same disassociation now frequently aimed at Gosling was also aimed at Ford in the 1982 movie. And that in both cases, there is a potential narrative reason for it. On the other hand, Hampton Fancher seems to have begun his script with an official list (provided to him..?) of things which must be in a Blade Runner sequel, besides a moribund lead character; such as a superficial misogynyBlade Runner 2049 suffers badly from 'HBO syndrome', throwing in not only a ton of female nudity but a great deal of Game Of Thrones-style physical cruelty and torture.HBO get away with it because they spread it across genders, but there's nothing here for the ladies, who instead find themselves ogled and reduced to perfect sex objects - or vehicles for extreme sadism. That's more or less a replication from the original movie, where neither Zhora's violence nor Pris's social genius stopped critics from accusing Scott of indulging in ugly urban pornographic treatment of women. So from that point of view, the sequel has an ambiguous built-in license to repeat it, I suppose; and even to augment it. But if female viewers find this unappealing, it's no surprise.There is definitely a narrative excuse for it, in both movies, if you can buy into it: these 'dehumanised' women fit very neatly into the central concepts of the source material, even where they are not 'artificial'. Both films are about finding deep connections in a shallow world, so you have to show how shallow that world is. There's one scene in the new film where K stops to interact with a totally naked, giant female hologram; in the context of the story, it's one of the most heart-breaking scenes in the film, and only the full contrast between pornography and true love could probably really illustrate it. But anyone who doesn't see that will likely doubt the film-makers' motives, and that's not surprising.Taking the story outside of the active urban setting into the environmental desolation beyond it is the strongest link to Tarkovsky epics such as 'Stalker' (whilst the examination of artificial life also echoes the original 'Solaris', the source material for which predates Dick's novel).Sadly I feel the movie's box-office has been affected at least in part by the runtime; not only does it mean fewer showings, but it's such a bladder-buster that I decided to wait for home release rather than see it again in the cinema. This is a damned shame, because BR2049 is so atmospheric and engulfing a cinematic experience that it is best seen on the big screen.I don't know how the artists involved could have resolved this, if they simply had to make a movie that long. But since Blade Runner 2049 is so polarising, they really *needed* nerds and fanboys like me to see it a second time in theatrical release. And it is polarising. Look at the reviews in this thread - no-one seems to have thought the movie was just 'ok'. I went with three people; me and one guy were really moved by it; the other two clearly hated it.When I left the theatre for an afternoon showing of Blade Runner in 1982, I felt kind of eviscerated. I had been affected by something apparently flawed and lacking in substance; something imitative and ersatz. Yet that feeling made so much sense, considering the material. I knew I would go back and see if I could find what was missing in Blade Runner. I never found it. Not in about 50-60 viewings of the movie. But that's a lot of viewings for a film you're not sure about.When I left Blade Runner 2049, I felt the same thing; both cheated, and extremely moved. I don't know what it means. There is some worthwhile essence in this new movie too which I know is going to bring me back to it for repeat viewings. And that's not something Hollywood has given me for a very long time.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent but a shadow of the original,"Few sequels match the original. Successful sequels, such as Terminator 2 and Aliens, rarely introduce new ideas. Instead, they build on the original plot - and have good plots themselves. Blade Runner 2049 definitely doesn't introduce any new ideas. New ideas are hard to come up with. A good plot isn't but 2049 doesn't have one. That's the difference between a movie based on a book (Blade Runner) and a movie based on a screenplay (this one). But, in spite of that, I enjoyed this movie. It's at least an hour too long for it's paper-thin story line but it's a sumptuous movie in terms of its cinematography and music. You don't even have to watch it on a huge screen (I didn't) to get drawn into it. I think anyone who enjoyed the original would enjoy this movie. The story line is sparse but, at least, it's serious science fiction and avoids sentimentality and silliness (I'm looking at you Matrix Reloaded). So, not bad. Decent science fiction. Wonderful visuals and music. Weak plot. Wasted opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But if one is looking for graphic art, you go to a museum. Films are for storytelling and this film failed miserably in that department.Harrison Ford appears quite late in the film and I began to wonder if I had misread the poster. Gosling doesn't possess the gravitas necessary to carry the first part of the movie. So the movie floats without legs until Ford enters the picture . . .

A work of sci-fi art.,"""I did your job once. I was good at it."" Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to K (Ryan Gosling)My review will be short today given the printed request handed to each critic before the preview of Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to the Ridley Scott sci-fi classic. Denis Villeneuve, also director of Arrival, asked us to refrain from revealing major plot points and to approach the review as the audience would without knowing what would happen.I'm all for minimalism about plotting in reviews, so this request is a no-brainer for me. However, I wonder if the director has looked at the trailers to see how much plot has been spilled so far. Oh, well, he has a sturdy science fiction sequel to the iconic Blade Runner, and it co-stars Harrison Ford, who adds grit to his youthful turn in 1982. Based on the Philip Dick novel Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep? this sequel is moodier, headier, and darker than the first. All good.Stone-faced K,an LAPD cop 30 years after the 2019 original setting, is a taciturn blade runner whose job is to track down old replicants (near-human androids) in order to eliminate their danger. The oldest and wisest is Rick (Ford), a master evader for 30 years. K's pursuit of Rick would please Dr. Freud. That's it folks for plot, though I wouldn't mind a call from the director so I could tell him how much I enjoyed his Arrival and Prisoners, both artworks with philosophy and humanity.Blade Runner 2049 is a brilliant, challenging sci-fi with more intellectual content than action. I'm usually negative about the abundance of action in contemporary American films, but here, under the influence of a more reflective producer, Ridley Scott (the original director), the filmmakers seem concerned with magnifying the plot, to hell with action. Besides, the basic sci-fi theme of droids seeking to be human is preserved here, albeit multiple other themes preside as well.Cinematographer Roger Deakins makes sure to provide the surreal, dark, and gloomy ambiance that guarantees a brooding story. Signs along the highway are in multiple languages such as Japanese and Hindi while references to Her, AI, and Dark Knight are carefully placed. Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer provide the cacophony of the junkyard future.It all works despite the wretched state of the future California . The incomparable CGI challenges James Cameron's realistic, surrealistic worlds. Villeneuve's success with Sicario promised this dark world, and he delivers. At 2h 43 min you still won't doze; you just may not be able to figure it all out in that one screening.""Nothing beside remains.

Worthy Sequel To A Film Masterwork,"This was a risky venture, making a film that is this slow and cerebral, in an age where social media and cellphone addiction has caused modern audiences to have the attention span (and IQ) of a flea. But ""Blade Runner 2049"" defies the demands and tastes of modern, ""mouth breathing"" audiences, by emerging as a sequel that retains both the mood, and pace of the original. Gosling, in the role of the young Blade Runner, ""K"" doesn't quite have the charisma of Harrison Ford, but his cold, emotionless style of acting fits perfectly with the role he is playing. A detective, hunting down and ""retiring"" older model Replicants, is a manufactured human himself, albeit a more modern and much improved model. But is he in fact, manufactured, or could it be that his childhood memories are authentic, and not just an implanted chip in his brain? And what connection does he have to Rick Deckard? This is the question, and main dilemma in this quiet and thought provoking film. And while not as flawless as the 1982 masterpiece, BR2049 is certainly the finest sequel to come out of Hollywood in two decades. Having the structure and pacing of a European film, it is so refreshing to finally see something of this caliber on the big screen again. That in itself is nostalgic; that feeling of being truly immersed in a movie at the theater, without being disappointed by inferior, rushed features that were so obviously just produced to generate a profit. It's interesting to note that. although this film is visually stunning, it still isn't as gorgeous as a film that came out 37 years earlier. But so many scenes in this sequel are unforgettable, and iconic. The 'return of Rachael' cameo was stunning and absolutely chilling, especially seeing the way they so coldly dispatch her when her image doesn't fulfill it's purpose. Of course without a solid script, this could have been little more than a series of pretty images. Thankfully, the story line is captivating from the very beginning. The mystery surrounding Joe's origins was well executed. in fact it was an emotional journey, as one can feel the character's pain caused by the desire to find his own worth and identity, a timeless subject that so many of us can relate to on some level. The final scene in the snow was filled with such desolation and loneliness, and i was not expecting to be so emotionally moved by a film like this. I cannot fathom the reviews that tear the movie apart and suggest that it is a bad film. I imagine those who hated this had no real understanding of the first film, or they are simply of the younger generation, who obviously possess no attention span whatsoever. BR 2049 is a film that Sci Fi fans will cherish, and want to add to their personal film libraries. It's bound to be a classic. It certainly won't be forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One Of The Best Sequels Ever,"Blade Runner was a film that I thought was... okay. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. I thought it was a decent sci-fi movie. So, going into the sequel, I didn't expect much. Boy, was I wrong. The acting is amazing. The effects are beautiful. The story is magnificent. The world that these films created is awesome.
I didn't know what the story was going to be going into this movie. The trailers didn't tell me much. So, I was very surprised while watching the movie. The movie is almost 3 hours long, but I was never bored. I was constantly intrigued, wanting to know what was going to happen next. I cared about the characters. I assumed the movie would end the way they were setting things up to be, but it didn't (if you have seen the film, you know what I mean). That, I think, is really cool. The movie ends the way you don't expect it to. It took a risk, and succeeded.
This is an amazing work of art. I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very good sequel to a classic,"I am a big fan of Blade Runner and I was excited to see BR2049 but I didn't come into this sequel with too many high expectations, fearing to be let down. I love Denis Villeneuve's work with a passion and when I saw Arrival last year, I was very confident in what he could do with sci-fi.I must admit that from the first frame of BR2049, I was sold. The few callbacks to the original movie you can catch here and here were magnificent. The cinematography is absolutely insane. I saw it in IMAX and it was one of the most breathtaking visuals I've seen in a very long time. The lighting, the set designs, they all brought me back to the feelings I have when I watch the first movie. I've read that Villeneuve wanted most of the props and locations to feel real and thank god he did. Not only Roger Deakins's work is going to earn him a well deserved Oscar, he teams up perfectly with Villeneuve's style and they make magic together. As for the music, I like that it stands on its own, I didn't want them to copy the Vangelis score too much and they do just enough references.I think Ryan Gosling was the perfect leading man for K. Even when he must be cold and serious, I feel that he still keeps his charm and magnetism intact. Ana De Armas was a pleasant surprise, bringing a bit of sensitivity as Joi. I also liked the Luv character, played by Sylvia Hoeks, and Dave Bautista. And let's not forget Harrison Ford, who did a pretty good job playing Deckhard again.You must go into this movie as an experience, not watching a big blockbuster with big explosions all the time. You must know the first story to really enjoy it but you must also not compare it too much. It's a contemplative journey through dark cities, snow and ashy deserts. It's a movie that raises many questions but doesn't give all the answers. Just like the original, it's not perfect. I thought it was way too long and some scenes almost made me laugh because they were a bit ridiculous and predictable. But in the end, I strongly feel that Villeneuve won his bet and he proved without a doubt that he's one of the best directors of the last 20 years.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Even synthetic life finds a way,I really wasn't expecting much from this movie seeing as most sequels or modern adaptations of older movies tend to be pretty poor quality compared to the originals but Blade Runner 2049 is in that rare category of sequels that does exactly what sequels are meant to do take the original movie's idea and source material and do two important things with them number one add to the movies universe and story and number two improve on the visual effects and tie up any unresolved story points left over from the original this movie not only does both of these things but it does them without messing up or ruining anything from the original movie which is considered to be a science fiction classic.The movie follows K (Ryan Gosling) a Blade Runner who is hunting his own kind synthetic androids who are designed to look and act as human as possible while having android benifits like increased strength and speed K is an advanced model that while smart independent and deadly is programed to always follow orders and never run from his eventual fate of retirement/death after hunting down an older model who remained in hiding for 30 years on a protein farm K discovers that a miracle happened on the farm 29 years ago a synthetic gave birth to a child something thought impossible as androids do not produce life but after discovering this miracle he is ordered to track down the child and erase all evidence of it's existence to prevent an uprising by synthetics his investigation takes him on a journey that will test everything he thinks he knows about synthetic life and even his own past while bringing an old Blade Runner legend out from retirement Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford).The movie both looks and sounds amazing with absolutely breathtaking visuals that make the Blade Runner universe look better than ever while still keeping a lot of the original movies designs and architectural elements just with an updated look that uses CGI in an effective way without looking overly flashing or as in your face as most modern science fiction movies tend to do.The movie really is more about Ryan Goslings character than it is Harrison Fords so if your expecting a movie that had a lot of Ford in it you will be disappointed as he is only in the movie for the last hour and his actual screen time is around 30 minutes maybe less but honestly Goslings performance in this movie is amazing he really brings his A game and delivers a unique and interesting performance that actually changed my view of him as an actor and I personally would like to see him in more science fiction movies in the future.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the original Blade Runner and enjoys science fiction movies that tell unique and interesting stories while also having some kick ass action scenes.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An Honest Review,"Did it really need a sequel?It was beautiful. I mean, it looked beautiful...even if there was one part that made me motion sick, but even that part was beautiful. And that, I think, was really more of a lighting thing than a set design thing or a special effects thing.Honestly, you remember the lighting in this. You remember it the way people remember the lighting in an Edward Hopper painting.But did it need a sequel?The acting was great, it really was.There was honestly no real flaw as to how the movie looked, how it was directed, or how it was acted. It was pleasing......but it was also kind of empty. So, did it need a sequel? Questions were answered, but those questions were best left as questions weren't they? The little mysteries that fueled debate that made the first film so...talked about, even if it was initially hated.Why did those questions need to be answered? They were better left as little mysteries to ponder.And the result is the empty feeling you get when a really fun problem is finally solved. There is that A-HA moment of adulation...and than that little depression when you realize the mystery is finally over and you can move on.From now on the questions will be officially answered and as it doesn't hurt this movie, it doesn't take away from the film as a singular entity, it kind of kills the first film.Now we know it all and because of that, the first Blade Runner will never have the same feeling when you watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Long movie but not in a bad way....,"As a regular IMDB user I ended up making an account just to write this review - I just loved this movie.I went into this as a big sci-fi fan but not so much a fan of the original movie, however this continues the story extremely well (some might say more in depth/better) from the original. The main thing is you need to understand this movie is long, but not drawn out or boring which is what I got from the original - this kept me interested and captivated from start to finish. There was even times where I thought I knew where the story was going and it caught me by surprise again.If you enjoy a good sci-fi flick, this is a great film, you don't necessarily need to watch the original if you don't want to - it fills the gaps quite well, however if it's a rainy day outside and you want to get the full backstory - it couldn't hurt :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A meandering sequel that didn't need to be made,"Acting and cinematography is pretty good, though these actors aren't given anything to work with.It all falls apart due to aimless writing and direction. Blade Runner 2049 is long and has some self-indulgent scenes, and yet several plot threads are introduced and then forgotten about completely by the climax, as if they got scrapped to shorten the run time. Was there supposed to be a sequel? Several times in the film, a character is left alive or transported for no apparent reason, the script haphazardly tossed together. Supposedly dramatic and profound dialogue feels cheesy and lacks subtlety. The primary antagonist is boring, one-dimensional, and has no clear motivations or logical end goals despite rambling for scene after scene, while a side character summarizes their entire backstory within two minutes of meeting a stranger. There is no consistency.Blade Runner 2049 is simultaneously both fan-servicey and ignorant what made the first film so beloved. The beauty of the original Blade Runner was that the film didn't explain every little detail about the plot; it was a grounded sci-fi tale. Blade Runner 2049 intentionally spoils the charm of the original's ambiguity, and has a lot of generic action scenes and silly technobabble only there to advance the plot. Sure, there's lot of random homages to other films in 2049, but I'm still not sure what new commentary on technology, themes, or philosophy the filmmakers were getting at. It just threw in some allusions banal current-day stuff like AI, holograms, and climate change. But it's basically just a rehash of old ideas.The original asked simple yet profound questions related to nuanced issues related existence and what defines humanity. 2049 poses stupid moral dilemmas that don't even make sense within the established rules of the world. And that's the larger issue. 2049 pointlessly complicates the canon for no emotional or intellectual payoff.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Most beautiful film ever made?,"Denis Villeneuve is the modern Stanley Kubrick, especially when he teams up with the legendary Roger Deakins. This film is a slow burn in the best way. Every single shot, no matter how inconsequential, is one I would frame and display on a wall, or have as a computer wallpaper. It's a modern sci-fi epic that only uses CGI when absolutely necessary. As a sequel to a classic, it exceeds the original in every way, a feat only ever achieved in sci-fi by T2 and The Empire Strikes Back. Not a single actor or prop feels out of place in this immersive universe. My biggest regret about this film is that I never saw it on an IMAX screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not the sequel I hoped for & not the sequel worthy of the original film.,"It seems that Ridley Scott took a page out of the book of George Lucas to make this busted mess of a sequel, by waiting decades to make the damned thing. And when he finally did it he doesn't even direct it, which, granted, perhaps it had always been his intention to not direct it anyway... For cryin' out loud, he hands it off to to an absolute hack, a guy who, supposedly, is a 'Blade Runner fan', as if that alone magically makes him qualified?! Supposedly, Ridley Scott didn't direct 2049 because of a scheduling conflict with something else that he was doing. Well, I believe that, while waiting decades to make the sequel is a morbidly massive FAILURE, still, 2049 would have been a better movie if Ridley Scott had waited another six months, maybe a year, & he could have directed it himself. Ridley not directing this film is why Vangelis (Evángelos Odysséas Papathanassíou) pulled out of the project. And I am not criticizing the work done on the score & soundtrack by Hanz Zimmer - he actually did a fine job; I just think that would have been better if Vangelis had done this film - and now we'll definitely never know... (R. I. P. Vangelis)There was a number of bad choices made in the casting of the roles for this movie. I don't believe that any one specific casting of any of the cast stands out as particularly horrible and I am not referring to any of the cast returning from the original film. Honestly, though, the acting done by everyone in this film was stale, at best, including Harrison Ford, Edward James Olmos, etc. I really do wholeheartedly believe that they could have done a much, MUCH, much better job choosing a more, demographically, diverse cast. Which, granted, is a problem that the original film faced &, itself, blundered on. It really seems like they knew that just making 2049, & actually getting it released, no matter how good the movie was, i.e., no matter how terrible of a job they did on it, was going to be the only relevant factor in how much money this busted mess of a sequel made; because of the fact that it would ride the coat-tails of the first film and the devoted fans of the first film are the only people on planet Earth who matter, in the context of this film. And, perhaps, that's a double-edged sword; as the first movie flopped financially, initially; only making money in subsequent years with the deluge releasement of the different versions of the original film. Obviously, this movie is, as it has been; doomed to meet the same fate! Perhaps 'the Blade Runner curse' has doomed 2049, too; that seems fitting...It seems definitive to me that the worst thing about this movie is that Scott, Villanueva, the studio executives who stumbled blindly forward in making this poorly made film did not heed Syd Mead's advice about creativity, imagination, foresight, etc., ""Hubris kills!""",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Bold, patient, moody - a worthy sequel","This is a great film, the visuals alone are incredible. But the thing that sets it apart is the same main quality that set Blade Runner (1982) apart - its unique mood. It's not uplifting but not depressing either. It cuts deeply, makes you feel something real. It isn't manipulating your emotions. It really captures that broken feeling of being a flawed human, looking for meaning in your life, lost in a dangerous world full of contradictions.The music is perfect for the movie. It's reminiscent of the Vangelis score for the original but doesn't just repeat it or rip it off. Its a continuation of the previous score, acknowledging it and moving on. A lot of it is loud rumbling or Inception-style BWAAARMS but it feels right. Then there are moments of near-silence. We hear things whirring past, slowly. As if some huge hovering spacecraft is visiting overhead. Is it part of the music or a physical sound the characters can hear? We can't tell, they blend together.There are interesting themes. It's a movie about cyborgs but delves into real questions about the nature of being human. How do we know if our memories are real? If there are gaps, does that mean that our memories are fake? Or do our emotions naturally cause gaps and inconsistencies anyway? If our memories have been implanted, then who are we really? Can our emotional reactions to fake memories be real and does that somehow validate them?Can you love a program? Can you bond with ""her"", become comfortable with each-other developing your own brand of playful banter, miss her when she's gone? Can love be reciprocated by a program? More importantly, does it even matter? Is loving someone really just a way to indirectly love ourselves?Will cyborgs ever be able to feel real emotions, reproduce, be whatever that combination of emotional/rational is that we call ""human""? Is human irrationality a strength or would cyborgs with absolute concentration be superior to humans in every way?The imagery is striking - like a collection of dystopian sci-fi paintings. A futuristic car, a man, a desolate landscape and a deadwood, for example. The film takes its time, letting the images wash over you. If you appreciate the style and the tone of the story appeals to you, you'll be in heaven. Others may start to get impatient. The movie isn't afraid to keep things hidden or vague from time to time, to allow rain to distort images, to dwell for a long time on a still frame before a character finally speaks. This movie exists outside the regular pace and tropes of what we've been trained to expect from typical movies. No one-liners, no obvious final looks or grimaces before cutting to the next scene. More like a loud, ominous build- up of music and then a bizarre panning shot into another scene - this movie has a vision.I saw Prisoners (2011) recently and was impressed by its patience, good acting and willingness to go into dark subject matter. I immediately wanted to know who the director was so I could see more - I could tell this wasn't a fluke, this was made by someone who knew what they were doing. There are too many pointless remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels these days. Numbers in titles become redundant, it's all about colons now. But when I found out Villeneuve was the director of Blade Runner 2049, I was suddenly very excited and this movie truly delivers. He's a serious contender for best current film-maker, second only to Nolan IMO.The acting is good. Ryan Gosling comes across as human but subdued. Not overly excited about the world he lives in or his job but with kindness in his eyes. We feel intimate with him but distant as well. He's doesn't really connect with his emotions. Maybe that's the point. We can sense they're there under the surface. It's certainly something I can relate to, feeling things but not always expressing it or understanding what they mean. Harrison Ford is given a dignified, meaningful role. He doesn't just have a cameo, nor is he merely lending his fame. This movie adds to Deckard's personal story and our fascination with it. Ana de Armas is equal parts sexy, playful, innocent and sensitive. I like when movies capture those universal, timeless, powerful moments in life - like looking into a beautiful girl's eyes the first time - it's a raw human experience and we are dwarfed by its power. In the movie, holographic attractive women the size of buildings tower over the people.Finally, the plot is intriguing if confusing at times. Its generally easy to follow but it can feel like some threads are missing at times. But the plot is secondary to the tone. I do like the mystery. We get to fill in many of the blanks for ourselves and its not too hard to do. It's more about understanding the characters, their motivations and how they're affected by the things they find out. Trying to piece the whole thing together seems unnecessary - there's no grand scheme, just individuals finding their way through the fog. Those expecting a completely coherent, dialogue-heavy movie will be disappointed.This must be a first. A sequel to a one-of-a-kind movie 35 years later which matches or even outdoes it. It respects the original but isn't bogged down in attempts to reference or imitate it. It continues the story in interesting ways. It captures something of that unique mood but in its own way. This is a movie that will age very well for a long time to come. Its contemplative, philosophical, ambiguous and enigmatic. It will only become more relevant as time goes on. But only time will tell quite how far ahead of its time it really is.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Visual Phenomenon,"In the plot department, the Blade Runner sequel isn't always smooth, logical or innovative, but its jaw-dropping, breath-stopping visuals will keep you glued to the screens and will make you lose yourself in its realm at some point. With this film, Denis cemented his reputation of a visual genius, and I do hope that the film will get Oscars for its dazzling visuals and soundtrack. It's imperative to watch it in 3D on as big screen as you can find. I know very few films if any, where every frame is captivating to the extent where film's universe seems more real, palpable and desirable than your own. I much appreciate that the director built up this feeling gradually, giving time to get used to this bleak, near-dead world, increasing tension in the second act, and completely engulfing and hypnotizing the viewer in the final parts. Scenes where K finds Deckard's refuge are visually and stylistically and musically so perfect and absorbing that I borderline had tears in my eyes from the sheer perfection of them. Nothing felt out of place, not even digital Elvis, black&white Sinatra or a shaggy dog, each being a Character as critically important and full-fledged as K or Deckard. Now, how is this possible?

"Not worthy such praises by the critics, but not terrible at the same time.","Denis Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2049"" captures your eye with its visuals from the very first scenes. The overall movie is intensely exquisite. The locations, the angles, the color palette everything is on a high level. That is not the only aspect which makes this movie special. The other things are the idea which the movie tackles and the details. Now the thesis is the same as in the original Blade Runner movie, which is if robots, who have the same senses and abilities as humans, can be treated the same way as them. However unlike its ancestor 2049 stresses that question far more precisely and in a more in-debt manner. The approach to the movie's world-building as mentioned is also fascinating. To evaluate, while watching ""Blade Runner 2049"" one digs into the movie. It shows you the lifestyle of an average future person and a replicant in a very a comprehensive way. All the actors did splendid in their roles, especially Ryan Gosling and Letita Wright. However this movie has got several issues. The main one is the storytelling. ""Blade Runner 2049"" is 2 hours and 43 minutes long and I hold the view that it could have fitted in 2 hours. There is also a line that was supposed to play an emotional part however it did not make me feel a thing. I'm talking about Gosling's and Ana de Armas's characters' relationship. The story does hook you in a few moments though, but the part of the movie is horrifyingly long at times.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dickensian,"One of the things that made BLADE RUNNER (1982) so interesting to me was it was an era when tv and movie sf seemed to be devouring all the genres, and this looked to be a fine melding of sf with film noir's sour, dour paranoia. There were other reasons to love it. If you were one of the fifty thousand people in the world who knew who Philip K. Dick actually was, then you probably knew he was as crazy as -- well, take whatever your saying for as crazy as you can get and double it. We knew he was poor and could use the money. We didn't know he was dying after decades of living in poverty, to top off the irony.Anyway, here we are, thirty-five years later and sf, like Flash Gordon, has conquered the universe, Ridley Scott has re-edited and re-issued the movie several thousand times, none of which I have ever bothered to look at. I did look at Blade Runner 2049 this afternoon and pronounce it visually stunning, and so what?If I want to stun myself visually, I can stare into a 300-watt bulb set to strobe. You want to stun me visually with a movie in a good way, show me some new stuff in a way that tells a story in a novel manner. That's a little tougher here, what with decades of MAD MAX and RED DWARF. There is one sequence that blew me away, the Dickensian sequence set around San Diego, with dust heaps out of BLEAK HOUSE, and tormented orphans hard at work and such. After that, it was musing on the fact that even Tinkerbelle wants Pinocchio to be a real boy and can something be done about Jared Leto? Will some one give him a chocolate chip cookie at least?In the end, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is a good movie not because it tells exactly same story with newer and more obnoxious special effects, but because it tells another story that arises out of the first, and not just one in which the good guys win because the good guy leaks marginally less blood and lives, while the bad guy dies, thus proving that..... good guys have better clotting? Yay for the good guys! No, Ryan Gosling actually learns a moral lesson and does a good deed as a result, for no benefit. Because in the end, if we want to be human, we must behave as humans.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
2049 Film-Noir,"BR2049 received a number of poor reviews here, mostly panning the film for being slow and boring. If those viewers expected relentless action (laser-sabre duels, pod races, and/or starship battles), they were watching the wrong film; BR was never that sort of sci-fi. The film unfolds more like a Raymond Chandler novel than a JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot.I found BR2049 very timely in respect of how a society treats its underclass and de-humanizes slaves. The 'real people' in the film assume that replicants do not have souls, and the replicants believe this, too. One is reminded of a quote from James Baldwin: ""The real tragedy of prejudice is that the victims themselves eventually believe it.""The first BR was very atmospheric, very dark (L.A. always in rain), and the soundtrack was excellent (Vangelis). It gained iconic status for its vision of a dystopian future and set a benchmark for sci-fi films.I don't think BR2049 quite matched that level again; still, I don't think it deserved the many poor reviews it got here. I used to be annoyed that the Bogart version of ""The Big Sleep"" left so many loose ends. Until I read Chandler; the novel is that way, too, deliberately vague about how many crooks are involved and what their motives are. BR2049 has that sort of Chandler-ish feel about it, with so many 'bad guys' trying to hunt down Deckard and clues which lead the replicant 'K' (and the viewer) astray. If some viewers found this sort of detective-hunt boring and slow, I guess they wouldn't like Chandler either.The sequel has some big pluses and a few minuses.Big plus: Ford reprises a major early role and is quite believable in this one. You can read his thoughts and feelings in his face (no dialog needed) when he is confronted by Niander Wallace with a grim choice.The story picks up some of the loose ends from the first film. This is both a plus and a minus: plus for those who watched the first film, minus for those who did not.The film is visually stunning. Big plus.The anclliary characters (Chief of LAPD played by Robin Wright; Wallace's Major Domo the beautiful but ice-cold replicant aptly mis-named ""Luv""; the lovely holo-entertainment-girl also aptly mis-named ""Joi"" whom you can see but not touch) are all very well cast, very well played, and very well integrated into the story.Minus: too much of long looking at ruined landscapes. Yes, these bits were slow and boring.Plus: the film dares to broach some tough philosophical questions: what is it to be human? How do we know replicants don't have souls? Is there something special about having been born and not 'hatched' in a test tube? Replicant Lives Matter.Overall, I'd say the 2049-update is a worthy eight-star sequel to the original ten-star BR.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One in particular with the guy running the orphanage is his coat which looks like it might have been a prop in the Oliver Twist movie, quietly giving this film a timeless quality. If it is intended, it is a little piece of genius and I find it hard to believe with Ridley Scott involved that it's an accident. I like the way Jared Letos voice echoes that of Tyrell in the first movie. Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss. It's bleak beyond description with none of the characters having too much to savour about life in 2049 including the mega rich Wallace who probably won't be happy with anything he can achieve. No doubt it will find cult status like the original because it takes concepts from the first and uses them extremely well with minor adjustments. The audience in each screening i have seen have been small but nobody chatted or complained throughout and despite some box office grumblings, in the long run the studio will recover money and we will still see quality from people like Villeneuve and Scott in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A film that will definitely not be lost in time.,"Blade Runner 2049 is absolutely everything we hoped for and even more. Although I don't love the original Blade Runner, I understand how unique that movie is and why everyone loves it so much. The cold atmosphere, the memorable dialogue, the unique dystopian world, I've seen very few movies that can match the greatness of the original Blade Runner and somehow, Blade Runner 2049 manages to do just that, and most importantly, it goes beyond replicate (pun intended) the feelings of the original movie, it proposes more questions, introduces more fascinating characters, and for me, it is a better movie.The cinematography is gorgeous, not just gorgeous, it's one of the best of this decade, if Roger Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this, there's no justice in the world. The directing is remarkable too, Denis Villeneuve is now officially one of the greatest filmmakers alive, at the same time he creates a masterpiece in style, he creates a masterpiece in substance. Nothing is ever gratuitously on screen, everything and everyone has so much depth, and this is one of the many things that make Blade Runner 2049 so fascinating, it's a work of such passion that even if you don't like it, you have to admit it's absurdly well done.I tried a lot, but I couldn't find a single flaw in this amazing film. The acting is impeccable, Ryan Gosling nails it delivering a character I'd never expect to love that much. The soundtrack is great too, Zimmer and Wallfisch aren't confined to remake the original songs from Vangelis, they do some nice tracks, but like Dunkirk (also by Hans Zimmer, not a coincidence), the music just shines when you're watching it. It's part of the experience, sometimes harmonic, sometimes chaotic, all the tracks contribute a lot to the immersion and even more to the tension, you don't expect a slow movie to be this thrilling.I just can't stop thinking about Blade Runner 2049 since I left the theater, it's a film that moved me deeply and I can't wait to watch it again, so I beg you, if you're a Blade Runner fan and haven't watched 2049 yet, please watch it as soon as you can, and I guarantee you won't regret it. And if you didn't like the original Blade Runner as much as you wanted to, that's your chance, give Blade Runner 2049 a try, and if it works, you'll have an experience you'll never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A simple deep complex poetic masterpiece,"Blade Runner 2049 does a perfect job of expanding on the brilliantly sewn seeds that were planted in the original 1982 Blade Runner. Before watching it we recommend you revisit the first and even read analysis online to get into the juicy juice. Blade Runner 2049 was made for those who are familiar with the story line and is a sci-fi monument and masterpiece. We predict it will win many Oscars — starting with best-adapted screenplay to Hampton Fancher.To supplement the original film Dennis Villeneuve had the following trio of short films to expand on the exposition. They are not necessary to view beforehand as we didn't see them until after.Blade Runner 2048: Nowhere to Run Blade Runner 2036: Nexus Dawn Blade Runner 2022: The Black OutThroughout the film there are numerous references to ""the black out"" — an event which saw the world live in darkness for 10 days and the destruction of any data which wasn't written down on paper. That means bank records, identification documents, even digital baby photos were all lost effectively resetting the world. The implications of such an event are obvious, but what I want to know is, what caused it? Was it an accident? Did somebody bring it about on purpose to hide something?The original Blade Runner ends with Deckard receiving an origami silver unicorn from Gaff with his voice-over ""too bad she wont live, but then again who does."". When Deckard mulled over the Rachel details he fantasized about a Unicorn. Keep in mind that a Unicorn is ""fake"" aka replicant. Moreover, keep in mind a unicorn without a horn would be a horse.Whatever you do — forget about the reviews! One of the ones to stay away from is written by looser want-to-be and failed actor RICHARD LAWSON From Variety magazine. The following was a headline from another article he wrote: ""Who Is America's Most Envied Kardashian-Jenner? We finally have an answer to this most serious of questions.""

"Overall, Great","Whichever user wrote that when Harrison Ford appeared the movie took a turn for the worse should never review movies anymore. Ford was outstanding.If I have one complaint about this film, it's that it's a bit too in love with its visuals, so its pace is too deliberate and plodding for me. When Ford's Deckard character finally makes his entrance the film picks up the pace, and I perked up a bit. But it might be too late for some people.This Blade Runner world is as rich and engaging as the previous '80s film-- complete with dreariness and grayness galore. It has its regular scruffy-looking replicants and even deeper questions about what it means to be human.I like Gosling, but he was usually devoid of emotion in this film. Ford picks up the slack and adds more than enough flesh tones to reel in that slack. The supporting cast is great, and the story is immersive.

'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...',"My memories of Blade Runner 2049 won't be washed away any time soon. More Blade Runner than Blade Runner? No. And yet this is what makes Blade Runner 2049 brilliant. Of course any consideration of Villeneuve's film must take account of the now sacrosanct original, and this is something Villeneuve himself has evidently been aware of from the outset. It is obvious throughout the film, tonally, thematically, musically, and in almost every other aspect that not only the director but the entire cast and crew hold a deep reverence for the original film, in a manner akin to its many fans. Again and again the film draws inspiration from Blade Runner, as the 'feel' of Scott's film imbues this sequel in its entirety, and yet, astoundingly, Villeneuve's production balances indebtedness with independence. Due to skillful and assured direction, emotionally nuanced performances, incisive cinematography and sound, and perhaps most importantly, some truly beautiful writing, this film has the strength to emerge from the shadow of Blade Runner and become its own distinct entity.In Blade Runner Roy Batty declares that it's 'quite a thing to live in fear', and yet Villeneuve's film manages to avoid this traumatic state, dreading neither the weight of the original nor the subsequent expectation upon its shoulders, as it cleverly recalls Scott's film whilst following its own direction. 2049 builds upon the eclectic themes of its predecessor in a thoughtful, moving and sometimes shocking manner, satisfying audience expectations given the arc of the original story - Villeneuve playfully echoes its diegetic and moral ambiguities - without ever sinking into the kind of palimpsestic homage we've witnessed in films such as The Force Awakens.Once again Gosling is on fine form, and whilst some critics might mistakenly interpret his performance as restricted and somewhat lifeless, he in fact offers both the quiet fortitude and humanity that the role demands; you can understand why he was so desired for the part. Stylistic and character based twists upon the original characters abound, and yet in reprising his role as Deckard Ford also excels, whilst the supporting cast are all committed and, crucially, in tune with the aura of the film. Jared Leto's performance is perhaps slightly melodramatic at points for some, however he is integral to some of the film's strongest moments (one very raw scene in particular stands out - you'll know it when you see it).My only criticism would be that at 163 minutes the film loses a little of the focused intensity which contributes to the original's brilliance, however the emotional payoff for this extended length is rewarding and not altogether misguided. In the end such criticisms are largely nitpicking, as the film excels in all areas and stands as one of the strongest releases of the year. Bravo to Villeneuve and co., they can certainly be proud of what they have produced. Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid is that much like Scott did so powerfully in his original (after the excision of certain studio-led material), Villeneuve and his team have produced a visually immersive, gripping and considered interrogation of questions central to not only those in the audience, and not even simply those in the world around them, but also those that will come after Blade Runner 2049's release. Consequently it feels as though this too will maintain its place in popular culture, and in doing so remind us of the power of cinema to understand humanity's past, present and future.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A relatively 'happy' ending to a depressing 163' of film,"BLADE RUNNER 2049's qualities are the acting, direction, unremittingly bleak photography, great computer-generated effects, and female beauty to die for.The film's main weakness is the plot, which rambles on and on and on. Yes, androids want to be more than electric sheep, that was obvious to Philip K. Dick when he wrote the novel that became the BLADE RUNNER of 1982. But Gosling's character's odyssey to track down Deckard (Harrison Ford), supposing that he is his father, is just too far- fetched to make any real sense, even if one appreciates that the android desperately wishes to feel human emotions.The memorable sequences are Gosling's lovemaking with a melding of two women, and Sean Young's brief return to the screen in all her beauty. The disappointing sequence is the climax underwater: In such a polluted world, you'd expect that water to kill you if you came into contact with it. Surviving all that time while fighting killing machines is just too improbable.Robin Wright's talent is sadly underused and the presence of a dog is truly mystifying - unless it, too, is an electric sheep.By the end of it, there was a bittersweet reunion between Deckard and his daughter, making for a relatively ""happy"", if rather pointless, ending.Sadly, by then my life was 163' shorter with very little to show for it.

My advise is to watch it many times because it's a movie with many layers. A Masterpiece in my opinion!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually striking existential science fiction mystery,"Warner Brothers, Alcon Entertainment, Columbia Pictures, and director Denis Villeneuve team up to make this one. . It's 30 years after the events of the first film, as we follow ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) a ""blade runner"" for the LAPD. Blade runners are tasked with tracking down and ""retiring"" (killing) renegade replicants (artificially created humans with enhanced strength). The biggest change is that K himself is a replicant, one of a new type designed by brilliant recluse and ultra-powerful tycoon Wallace (Jared Leto). During his latest assignment, K stumbles upon a mystery that may change the lives of humanity and all replicants, alike.Harrison Ford was featured prominently in all of the advertising for this, for good reason, but his role is very minor, almost an extended cameo, and not even appearing onscreen until 105 minutes in. Gosling is most definitely the lead, thankfully in my opinion, as I'd rather they go at the material from a different angle than simply attempting a rehash with fancier special effects. After watching the film, I'm not surprised that it flopped. It's long (over 2 and a half hours), it's slow by Hollywood movie standards, it's frequently quiet, and it's very deliberate, introspective, philosophical on an existential level, and filled with dozens of small details in the periphery of the screen that allude more than explain. I'm happy to see that the writers decided to make this a future carried over from the first film, rather than making it a future to our present time. That may sound confusing, but what I mean is that there are visual references to a still-existing Soviet regime, and there is little of the mobile device fascination endemic to most modern sci-fi. The character played by Ana de Armas, a sort of ""virtual girlfriend"" comprised of a hologram projector and an AI, is the closest to that, but it's well handled, and helps deliver a good emotional punch or two late in the game.I was impressed with Sylvia Hoeks, an actress I'm unfamiliar with, as the film's main ""bad guy"", a severe replicant corporate type with a violent streak. Small turns by Dave Bautista and Carka Juri are also good, and while I liked Jared Leto's interesting off kilter characterization, it seemed under-utilized. The only one who I had a problem with was Robin Wright, who I normally like, but here something was off. I blame some of her dialogue. The film looks fantastic, with numerous different visual palettes and textures. The only thing that keeps this from being a full-fledged masterpiece in my opinion is a lack of closure on a few story points that seem like they may have been intentionally left dangling for possible future sequels, the likelihood of which are very slim at this point.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Rare Sequel That Lives Up to the Original,"It's not easy to capture lightning in a bottle. Perfectly recapturing the look, sound, feel, and unique blend of elements that defined the original Blade Runner is no small task. Capturing its substance is harder still. And yet this film does it perfectly. Director Denis Villeneuve and the others involved have succeeded in creating the rare sequel that perfectly recreates the style of its predecessor while expanding on its story and themes.Ryan Gosling stars as Officer K, a new model replicant who works for the LAPD ""retiring"" unstable older models. He lives alone, except for his house's holographic interface, who gives new meaning to the phrase ""virtual girlfriend."" Like all of the new models he's very good at his job and never questions orders. At least until a ""routine retirement"" turns up a secret that challenges everything he thought he knew about his nature, and could change the global balance of power- or plunge what's left of civilization into war.The original Blade Runner asked intriguing questions about what it means to be human. 2049 goes a step further, questioning the nature of what's real. Characters struggle with whether their memories are their own, someone else's, or something entirely manufactured. The mutual affection between K and his holographic girlfriend raises the question of whether an AI can truly feel, or if there's any way for her to become a real girl. And the enduring question from the ending original Blade Runner is still very much open.Visually this film is a masterpiece of bleakness. LA is still the shadowy, run down megatropolis it was before, just a little flashier and newer. Endless sheets of rain still pour down on darkened streets as streetlights and flashing signs struggle to illuminate the perpetual gloom and holographic ads offer pleasures of every kind to passersby.Only this time the streets don't seem so crowded as before. Which makes sense given that anyone who can afford to has bought passage off planet. Because if LA is dystopian the world beyond its walls is downright post-apocalyptic. San Diego is a wasteland out of Mad Max; a vast scrapyard dotted with the ruins of old high rises and occupied only by desperate bands of scavengers and outlaws. Vegas is as quiet as a tomb; shrouded in a haze of cloud and dust, its casinos sitting as though frozen in time. And in between is only desolate emptiness as far as the eye can see. And it's all so artfully photographed and exquisitely atmospheric.Harrison Ford doesn't have as much screen time as the trailers might have suggested, but whenever he's on screen it's clear that he hasn't lost a beat. The weariness and slight grumpiness that seems to be his default setting these days serves him well as the reclusive old Deckard, gone semi-paranoid after so many years in hiding. He throws a mean punch for a man his age, and radiates a mix of anger, sadness, and tired resignation as he describes all that's transpired in the last thirty years. Gosling likewise excels in the frequent action scenes and gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as a man questioning who and what he really is.But Jared Leto might make the strongest impression. As ruthless industrialist Niander Wallace- creator of the new generation of replicants- he is a study in contradictions. His manner is eerily emotionless, yet his gaze exudes brilliance and obsession. He calls the replicants his children and speaks of their destiny and need to grow, but treats them as disposable. And his zeal to propel mankind forward makes him merciless to anyone who stands in his way. We're not entirely sure what he is either. He seems to be a cyborg, but it's unclear how far the changes go, or if he might be something more artificial altogether. What I do know is that this performance is enough to redeem him for his overwrought turn as the Joker in Suicide Squad.If this movie has a fault it's that it stays too faithful to the original's grating synthesizer soundtrack, heavy on reverb and distortion. But then again, I suppose that it does fit the film's mood and add to the sense of tension when needed. And while the fights and shootouts are very good, nothing can match Deckard's battle with Roy in the last film. Blade Runner 2049 is not quite the original, but it comes very close. And for a movie like Blade Runner that's high praise indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Could have been worse,"Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) was quoted as saying that he would not be able to make this film as good as the original Blade Runner (1982), and he was correct. This film takes place 30 years after the first one that was set in 2019 and follows Ryan Gosling (Drive) playing a young blade runner who discovers a long-buried secret that leads him to track down a former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who's been missing for thirty years.It may be unfair to compare this belated sequel to the classic original but seeings as it is a sequel I cannot help but do so. The film in it's own right is well made and a step above most things that are going through your Cineplex these days but in comparison to the original it falls quite short in almost every way. Simply where the film does look pretty good, it does not look anywhere near as good as the original, the same can be said for all the design work and costuming which just does not have the care and inspiration of the former. The Music is good but mostly when its touting parts of the original score. The acting is good enough but not as good as the original and certainly the characters are not as good. The film also tries to emulate the slower pace of the first film but ends up being even slower and is so bloated at almost 3 hours which could've easily been 2 hours and been a better film for it with none of the themes or main story beats left out. It is more of a detective story than an action film just like the first was but the detective elements are not as strong or interesting this time around. Blade Runner 2049 does try to go in some new territory in the Blade Runner world but they are all the most obvious boring places to go that have been done before in other films and television (Battlestar Galactica). There are some subplots that have shades of Spike Jonze Her (2013) and there are some other scenes that are an attempt to set up further films in the franchise.It may sound like I am being quite hard on the film but there are things to enjoy, the visuals while a little too dark and lacking the wow factor of the original cinematography from Jordan Cronenweth are still miles above most films from our age. The sound design is huge and really second to none which makes it the one area that is better than the original film. The special effects are good although they do go Rogue One with bringing back one character digitally which whilst it is probably the best it has been done to date it still suffers from uncanny valley.In the end I would say it is a solid hard scifi which suffers in comparison to its roots which its best characters are under-used and is bloated but without any iconic scenes. Remember the scene from the original with the replicant stripper being shot in the back as she smashes through glass walls in slow motion, the scene with Rutger Hauer in the elevator lit up after killing Tyrell or his final epic monologue. The new film has none of the artistry that elevates a film to masterpiece. In short, it could have been a lot worse and it is no disgrace to what now has become a franchise I guess but its far from the suspicious rave reviews that have flooded the market days before release.",,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie dropped me on the floor,"Everybody loves it. It got top ratings everywhere. Man was I disappointed.I fully blame the director for destroying what could've been a worthy sequel to the original Blade Runner, which is a piece of art. The movie is pretentious and tries so hard to be deeper than it is.It sounds like I'm just gonna trash this movie and I'm not. It has a lot going for it, especially in catching up from the original, since its been 30 years. The visuals and the sound design is amazing, the cinematography is top notch. But the storytelling... falls flat.For 97 percent of the movie you stare at Ryan Goslings face. I get it, chicks dig him, but I think his face burned into my eyes and not in a good way. He has the same acting skill as a milk carton and brought no emotion to the character. I guess you could argue, his acting fitted the bill but hey... no spoilers.The movie is extremely long and despite using the screen time it never has a climax. Like... a real one. Im such a huge fan of the original and it pains me to write this split review. I kinda wish this movie never saw the light of day, because once its seen it can never be unseen.Honestly I was just as disappointed when I saw ""The Arrival"" made by the same director, so I guess its his style. He certainly made this movie his own. I just wish he didn't have to take art and destroy it the way he does here. I guess people will praise him for this movie - cause now it can be seen by anyone... now Blade Runner finally became: mainstream.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Better than I had feared, not as good as I had hoped","I'm a huge fan of the original Blade Runner movie and the Philip K. Dick book it was based on, so it was with some trepidation that I went to see the sequel. But the film lived up to my expectations, even if they weren't all that high.On the plus side:The sequel does a great job of recreating the look, feel and grit of the first movie. It looks amazing.The soundtrack music also does a great job of imitating the first film's score, while also sounding more modern.The plot follows logically (sort of) from the first movie, but you don't necessarily have to have seen the first one to follow this one. On the other hand, the movie doesn't spoon-feed the audience, and I overheard a couple people at my showing who had no idea what was going on.The film raises a lot of thought-provoking, sci-fi type questions. Just like the first movie, a major theme is ""what exactly is real, and what rights do intelligent 'artificial' beings deserve""? Some of the new elements in this one seem like they could have come out of a Philip K. Dick story.On the negative side:The movie is waaaaaaaaay too long. I have a decent attention span, and even I thought the movie dragged. It seemed like half the film played out in slow motion. It made 2001 A Space Odyssey (another film I love, but one of the most deliberately paced movies of all time) look like a taut action thriller. They took an idea that would have made a good hour long TV show and stretched it out to nearly three hours. Way too long.The plot, what there is of one, is...kind of hard to buy into. Months ago I saw someone on a movie discussion group predict pretty much exactly what the plot turned out to be, and he was told by everyone else that his idea was ridiculous.The movie redefines what a replicant is, although the ones in this film are later generations than the ones in the first film, so I can kind of give them a pass there.Seemed like there was a gratuitous amount of female nudity. I'm not complaining really, it just seemed like most of it didn't need to be there.Overall I liked the movie. I'll probably watch it again when it comes out on Blu-ray. But it's not really the type of movie that the commercials and trailers are pitching it as, and I'm guessing there will be a lot of negative reviews from people who were expecting more car chases and fight scenes. There's not nearly as much action as the first movie.Oh, and it seems like the last half hour or so is designed to set up more sequels in the future.

"Visually gorgeous, emotionally bleak","For a modern big budget film, this one was OK. However, it failed to evoke any feelings whatsoever. Dissection below.Good things first. The movie is visually brilliant. It is believably rough and dirty where it needs to be, and stunningly beautiful when the story allows more artful scenes. There are some good acting performances (Harrison Ford, Dave Bautista (!), Barkhad Abdi). The basic plot is OK, one could build a very good movie around it. I very much liked how the movie handled the theme of relationships and contemplated to what extent AI could replace a physical partner. And the direct references and links to the original Blade Runner movie were very clever and graceful, they did not feel like fan service at all but natural and integral parts of this movie.Why did it fail to evoke any emotions, then? (Disclaimer: most of the reasons are probably due to personal preferences, very subjective. Your experience may be completely different.)One issue was the editing and pacing of the film. Pacing worked very well in the beginning, but the flow was lost somewhere in the middle, and the latter half of the movie was stagnant on several occasions, losing its grip of the viewer as a result. There were also a couple of occasions where despite the tranquil pace the movie failed to present key plot developments in a clear manner -- what exactly happened, why something was done, or how did we end up in this situation from the end of the last related scene.Second issue was a combination of casting and screen writing. Ryan Gosling is not a bad actor, but perhaps best suited to sympathetic heartthrob roles; in my opinion he lacks the kind of rugged charisma and screen presence that would be needed for playing this kind of role with such vast screen time. However, the role is extremely challenging -- to function as a focal point of the whole movie he should be identifiable, charismatic, memorable; on the other hand he should convincingly portray a machine without a free will whose job is to kill his own kind. Gosling makes a brave effort, but the end result is bland. The antagonists are simply trite. Jared Leto is miscast, stale at best and atrocious at worst; instead of a menacing, wildly ambitious genius he comes off as a fledgling cult leader who is practicing his first sermons. However, the actor was not given much to work with, the whole character is but a dim imitation of Dr. Eldon Tyrell from the first Blade Runner movie. Sylvia Hoeks does better job with what she was given, but again, it was not much: the writers resorted to the cheapest B movie trope and imply that the bad guys are bad by making them use violence as the first and only solution to every problem, and Hoeks' character was not given any nuances apart from a sadistic streak that seems odd in a machine.Finally, there was the soundscape of the movie. This film is practically devoid of emotional music. Sounds consist mostly of thunderous rumbles and shrill synth sounds instead of real melodies; there is also a Shepard tone playing during one key scene. Absence of emotionally manipulative soundtrack could be a positive thing, but it also means that the movie has one less tool to convey and evoke feelings with. The original Blade Runner movie was greatly enhanced by the Vangelis' outstanding score. Unfortunately the monotonous dreary auditory stimulus that is the ""score"" of Blade Runner 2049 makes the many already pallid qualities of the film appear even more vapid.3/5.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Brilliant, Visually Stunning and Worthy Sequel","I consider the original Blade Runner a timeless masterpiece so I was anxious to see what could be made of a sequel (given than Phillip Dick did not write a sequel to his original short story).I must say, the writer, director, and producers did right by the original and honored it's brilliance while producing a movie for this new age that appropriately transitioned from the prior generation. (Very much unlike Star Wars The Last Jedi)Though I am certain no film will ever out do the original Blade Runner this movie does come up a close second.I really enjoyed this flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Blade Runner 2049,"Why are people so harsh on this? Yes it's slow paced at times, but it's not exclusively an action movie. It's an art house film. It's supposed to have a slow burn to it. And by gosh it works so well. All of the actors, in my opinion, do an extremely good job here, and many of them completely disappear into their roles. The cinematography is second to none. It's an absolutely beautifully shot and directed film. Zimmer's score is phenomenal as always, and honestly I find the story enjoyable. Yes there are some odd side plots that don't really go anywhere, but for me watching this, it honestly just helped to flesh out the world a bit more and give more context to why things are the way that they are. I don't think this is an ""unnecessary sequel"" as many called it. Blade Runner was and is still a brilliant film on its own, but I feel that this film just adds more to the world and the story. If you enjoy art house films, or slow burn action sci-fi, then this is a great film for people like you.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Technical Masterpiece,"Oscar Nominations:Cinematography (Roger Deakins) - Winner
Visual Effects (Nelson/Nefzer/Lambert/Hoover) - Winner
Production Design (Gassner/Querzola) 
Sound Editing (Mancini/Green)
Sound Mixing (Bartlett/Hemphill/Ruth)Blade Runner 2049 is a technical masterpiece! And the Oscar awards reward that excellence with five nominations in the visual and aural arts and two wins, in Cinematography and Visual Effects. It is a long movie (2 hrs, 43 min) but the immersive experience in this dystopian world keeps your focus and rewards your attention.Surprisingly, this was the first win for Roger Deakins after 14 nominations for cinematography for movies ranging from Shawshank Redemption and Fargo to Skyfall, Prisoners, and Sicario. Deakins has a unique talent for using camera angles and filters to create a distinct feel for each film. The dark shadows of Prisoners help convey the underlying fear while the long, unbroken drone shots in Sicario brought out the unbroken tension. In this movie, he manages to sustain the damp bleakness of perpetual rain in Los Angeles and the yellow-poisoned air of Las Vegas - futures that seem possible but not pleasant.Blade Runner also took the Oscar for Visual Effects. The visual effects team previously worked on films like Benjamin Button, Captain America, Beauty and the Beast, Armageddon, and Superman Returns. The visual effects run the gamut from CGI to actual stunt work, but in all cases the realism supplied gives the film a remarkable consistency and credibility. These aren't effects purely to stun the senses, but rather they help tell the story in a future world that is already tough to imagine.The production design team has received previous Oscar nominations for movies like Bugsy, Road to Perdition, Into the Woods, and Golden Compass. In Blade Runner 2049 they have created a world that is consistent in its details and striking in its rich texture. The sound editors won the award last year for Mad Max : Fury Road, and received previous nominations for Fifth Element and one of the Star Trek Movies. Previous nominations for the sound mixers include Life of Pi and the Martian. The point here is that the teams working on the technical aspects of this movie are long on credentials, and their work shows in a very overwhelming movie.As is usually the case, even with very good science fiction movies, Blade Runner did not receive any nominations in the directing, writing, or acting categories. And that is unfortunate. Dennis Villenueve, the director, also directed Arrival, another very good sci-fi flick. He also did the two excellent movies, Sicario and Prisoners, both of which manage to create a terrific tension in the audience. In Blade Runner 2049, he manages to sustain a complex story over a considerable length of time and still tie all the loose ends up.Speaking of story, one of the writers, Hampton Fancher, also participated in the original Blade Runner movie from nearly thirty years ago. He has managed to maintain consistency between these two efforts and address some of the big questions that were left from the original movie (i.e. is the Blade Runner (Harrison Ford) a replicant or not?). His cowriter, Michael Green, was also nominated for Logan, however, I didn't like that movie and blame the writer for most of its plodding disinterest.Ryan Gosling plays the main character, K, and he is just perfect in this role. Harrison Ford comes back to play an older version of his original character, Deckard, and brings with it some of the wisdom that comes with old age. Clearly the story is about these two men and the discoveries they make about each other, and themselves.However I think some of the most interesting characters are women. Robin Wright plays a terrific chief of detectives and K's boss. Sylvia Hoeks (Luv) is the main villain and battles both Deckard and 'K' with super-human abilities. Ana De Armas is a fresh, face and plays Joi, K's love interest who isn't exactly real. And Mackenzie Davis is a hooker who, in one of the most intriguing scenes in the movie, merges with Joi. Carla Juri, as Ana, plays a very important figure with some special characteristics, essential to the main story line. In all these cases, the women are playing supporting roles, but the movie is much more interesting because of them.Blade Runner 2049 is a complex story and the viewer has to pay attention to keep from getting lost. But because it is also such a technical tour de force, that is easy to do. The visual world created here demands that you open your senses and the story line rewards you for doing so.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie could be just for you.,"It really depends on what you like. If you like overly long movie, with plenty of extensive and prolonged camera shots on pensive androids which have very little psychological depth to them. If you care for characters, except one, or so it appears, that are androids devoid of soul. If your eye sight is good enough for dark scenes that do not lend themselves well to 3D viewing naturally, if you love romance with virtual reality personalities. Furthermore if you like movies who have little to say yet take themselves seriously, than this movie is absolutely for you. Half way through the movie I was looking for the fast forward button, but in cinemas they are not available, yet. I even considered an early exit. Simply put, Blade Runner lacks total originality, and digitally created worlds have long ago cease to entertain many viewers. BTW, I think that Gosling was a bad casting choice, although he is enough of a professional to keep his chin up.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie,"Do not listen to the people who have problems to understand the film. This is a masterpiece with a high level niveau.

A good film that ticks most boxes but not all,"Notably longer than the original, the visual concepts and acting are first class. There are periods of slowness during the film, and the soundtrack unfortunately does not fit in the landscape (sounds too alien and more suited for Prometheus or Aliens Covenant). Small references to the original film are required for plot but thankfully this film's characters and story stands on its own. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A surprisingly excellent sequel -- I'm honestly shocked at how good this film is,"Sadly, I did not see this film when it came out in theaters back in 2017. I rarely see films in theaters anymore, since half of them are garbage Marvel films or other comic books films that all essentially have the same plot and similar mind-numbingly dull action scenes. I did make the mistake of seeing Star Wars Force Awakens when it came out in theaters and was sorely disappointed. The Star Wars franchise is entirely dead to me. The prequels were like getting mugged and badly beaten, but Force Awakens was the coup de grace, a shotgun blast to the head!What I'm trying to say is that my expectations for science fiction, or really just films in general, has gone dramatically downhill. There has been a lack of good films in the past decade, which explains why my theater attendance is now a rare thing. I stick to watching films on amazon prime or netflix, and occassionaly buy a blu-ray.Last week, while ordering a book through amazon, I began browsing various movie titles and eventually came across Blade Runner 2049. I easily spent half an hour reading through reviews for the film, mostly positive, but with a significant negative minority as well.I made a gut purchase and bought the blu-ray for $13.00. Thirteen dollars is about the cost of a meal at a low price chain restaurant. If I didn't like the film, then it wouldn't be much of a loss.Finally last night I found the time to sit down and watch Blade Runner 2049. I was in for a pleasant surprise! The overall atmosphere and vibe of the film matched up perfectly with the original Blade Runner. The universe in 2049 still felt like the same universe that the original Blade Runner inhabited. The dystopian Los Angeles was as vibrant and futuristically abysmal as in the original film.The main thing that resonated with me was how this film manages to compliment the original Blade Runner so well. These two films are like long-departed twins, different, but identical somehow. That is an incredible feat considering 2049 was released 35 years after Blade Runner!The story in 2049 artfully connects us to the events from the previous film and expands upon it to a satisfying climax. The acting in the film was mostly excellent but I will admit that Harrison Ford's performance was a bit underwhelming and lackluster. The guy is really looking haggard and I felt like he was almost dragging himself though the second half of the film. But the acting from all the other characters was spot on.The visuals and cinematography were top-knotch, about as close to perfection as can be, and the same can be said for the gloomy & booming soundtrack. Maybe one or two uplifting musical pieces could have added more variety to the soundtrack, it almost felt too gloomy.The action scenes in 2049 were done very well and were definitely pleasing to the eye. The plot throughout the film remained consistent to the prior Blade Runner film, it doesn't contradict the original in anyways, thank god. The conclusion to the film, I won't give it away, was very satisfying. A nice humanistic touch at the very end.Overall I was delightfully satisfied with this film because it compliments the original almost perfectly. It was executed extremely well and flows along perfectly with the plot set by the original film. I'm now a little disappointed with myself that I didn't get to see this in the theater.This is definitely worth seeing and is a worthy sequel to Blade Runner.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Greatness Within Reach Goes Unrealized,"Greatness was in reach with Blade Runner 2049, but Denis Villeneuve wasn't quite able to seize it. It's a technical marvel and the film has some truly jaw dropping, standout moments, but in the end it does not coalesce into a coherent, meaningful narrative.The film dazzles when it introduces us to the technology of its dystopia, fixating the audience with innovations that capture the imagination and immediately make sense in the context of its devastated environment. Even more-so than the science, the landscape tells that tale of Earth in 2049. No dialogue is required as we move from a protein farm to the dingy, neon-lit, overcrowded city to an endless wasteland of junk metal and garbage. The sights and sounds convey all the background information that is necessary, eschewing exposition and trusting in the intelligence of the audience.Unfortunately, by the end of its 2 1/2 hour run time, the story arc of our new main characters is sacrificed on the altar of old ones. The ending of the original Blade Runner is a piece of cinematic perfection due to its emotionally powerful climax followed by a conclusion that's equal parts tragedy, hope and intrigue. 2049 has an uninteresting climax and contains no such intrigue in its final moments; just some unresolved plot threads and a heaping dose of sentimentality.Like the story, the soundtrack is hit and miss. It often rises to the occasion and provides a powerful and fitting audio accompaniment to the visual feast on screen, but at other times feels overbearing and lacks the subtlety and ethereal quality of Vangelis' original Blade Runner score.I don't mean to sound overly harsh because I did enjoy this film, especially during its first two acts, but the bar for a sequel to classic cinema is high. Perhaps I'll have a different take upon subsequent viewings, but as I watched the credits roll for the first time, I couldn't escape the thought that the story needed more work to discover its own message and formulate a resolution that reverberated with its many magnificent pieces.----Pros1. Amazing visuals2. Creative technologies that immerse and delight3. Excellent setup that prompts many thoughts / questions4. Setting and backstory feel like an authentic continuation of Blade Runner5. Thoughtful film making that's more show than tell (most of the time)6. Harrison Ford has one really good lineCons1. Weak third act2. Underdeveloped antagonist3.

Plot becomes more muddled near the end rather than more clear7.

"Captivating, Stunning, and Emotional. A Modern Masterpiece","Just wonderful, what Denis Villeneuve did with this movie is fantastic. He did a sequel of the science fiction masterpiece that is Blade Runner, and he did it well. Not only well, but on the same level of the original, without a doubt.This movie tells the story of K, a Blade Runner of Los Angeles that discovers a secret that could bring the whole world to war. This is not a very good summary, but it's better you watch it without knowing too much about the story. Well, the first movie treated themes like what makes us human, our own identity and the ethics of robotics and so. This movie goes even further with this topics and develops them more, introducing many questions about the meaning of the characters and all this things, and it leaves you thinking a lot about it.Ryan Gosling is the main character K, and he is fantastic. I still have to watch a movie where he is not good at. He carried a big part of the movie, and you really connect with his character and his motivations. Then there is Harrison Ford, who reprises his role of Rick Deckard from the first movie, and even if he does not have many screen time, when he appears on screen, he owns the scene. Ana de Armas plays Joi, a mysterious character that I won't spoil anything about, but she has a really powerful performance. Sylvia Hoeks also has an important role in the movie and she is really badass and brings a great performance as the assistant of Wallace played by Leto. And now about Leto, he has a small role in the movie, even if he is in all the trailers, but he is really great. There are also some minor roles payed by some great actors like Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Dave Bautista and even Edward James Olmos. They all don't have a really big role, but they add a lot to their characters and their scenes.Now, let me talk about the visuals. WOW! Roger Deakins deserves the Oscar just right now, because the visuals of this movie are really amazing. Not just Los Angeles city, but all the environments, the deserts, all of it it's just a beautifully crafted shot. This with the magnificent directional work of the great Villeneuve, creates a fantastic landscape that will captivate you for more than two hours and a half and will keep you staring at the screen with your eyes open looking at this stunning movie. Also I have to mention the also captivating and powerful score that Benjamin Wallfisch created with the help of Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack is really near the same level of the one Vangelis created for the first movie and together with the stunning imagery, the powerful performances and the captivating story, you have a really great piece of cinema art, that will come down as one of those classics of the science fiction..I would recommend this movie to everyone in general, but specially to the fans of the original, the fans of this director or the fans of science fiction, because this is truly a great achievement in the genre of the science fiction and in movies in general. Do not miss this one!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Blade Runner 2049 - A monumental feat of genius sci-fi filmmaking,"Let me start by saying that I am fairly new to the Blade Runner universe. Prior to seeing 2049, I had only had the pleasure of seeing the original twice (both times being The Final Cut), and both viewings within the month leading up to the new installment, helmed by French-Canadian Denis Villeneuve, a man who has solidified himself as quite possibly my favorite working director at the moment. So, having been a massive (albeit brand new) Blade Runner fan, does this one live up to the hype? In short, abso-frickin-lutely.I need to see it again now, not because of how much I enjoyed it, but because 2049 requires a great deal of thinking. The plot, the story developments aren't conveyed via words, but rather mainly through visuals. I won't deny that there were several segments throughout the film where I felt about as intelligent as a can-opener, because as an audience member you're forced to sit back and think about what has happened and why. There were moments where I actually had to ask myself if I was an idiot for not understanding why something was happening upon initial viewing, or is this a film that asks you to think instead of explicitly displaying everything you need to know at the tip of your fingers? After some theorizing once the movie ended I realized that it was definitely the latter. 2049 is one of very few sci-fi films that actually forces you to think, not because of plot convolution or narrative inconsistencies, but because of its complex nature.Everything is on point here. The direction is superb, as is the writing. The cinematography is genuinely among the best I've seen from a mainstream film (as is Gassner's heavenly production design). And every actor brings out some of their best performances (with Ford deserving special praise, he truly is a powerhouse here). Blade Runner 2049 represents a monumental achievement in modern-day filming that meets and supersedes the expectations set by Blade Runner (1982), thanks to the undeniable efforts of everyone involved.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth 35 years of wait for us,"I went out as soon as I could to watch it. From trailer it seemed to be very interesting and very beautiful, I also watched the original a week before once again. I truly love the original and I enjoyed the soundtrack for the whole week before, nothing is as close to the eerie original blade runner soundtrack. So I went in on the 3D version.I won't spoil a lot. The movie is beautifully shot, although I'll see in 2D as well, because I prefer 2D brightness compared to 3D. The storyline can stand alone in 2049, although that is something I thought at the beginning. The more film goes deeper into the story the more I felt connected to the original film and I think the goers who have not seen the original or did not loved it for the all the weird reasons, will miss out on atmosphere and emotions conveyed in 2049. I enjoyed the duration, I enjoyed the acting, DP (well everyone is right about it). I had a little trouble to navigate into the 2049 storyline though, but I think it was on purpose, because by the end of the movie I still had (like in original blade runner) this monstrous question over (although different this time), I had a different feeling, I had confusion and I had developed love for the character - I think this would not be possible be it more concrete story, so by the end it helped to give the viewer exactly what he went in for (at least for me).Compared to the original, 2049 is more complex film, has a more complex storyline, but is worth every second of watching it. It is worth 30 years of wait. It is worth everything, for those who loved the original this is a beautiful continuation. It left me crying and as well thinking and as well it still leaves lot of questions. This is truly a beautiful film and Villeneuve has done amazing job on any aspect. Music, tension, visuals, acting and everything in 2049 feels complete, some scenes are simply fantastic both in action, physics involved and of course visually. I'm still in awe from this one, still thinking about it, and still having the emotion that I left the cinema with - and this is definitely something we pay money for.It sucks because I think general audience will not be moved by this dark sci-fi, but it is so beautiful and poetic, 2049 is obviously destined to be another cult.I also assume that haters will be saying how complicated this one is compared to the original but I have to say the complexity just made it more beautiful and let's be realistic making a sequel on the original could not be a streamlined story. Go watch 3 shorts as well on youtube to have some questions filled. If I had only one regret and complain about this film it would be that soundtrack album for this is not as beautiful as the original, but I guess that is what Hans Zimmer means, bringing in Vangelis was a very different thing for the original and bringing generic score composer on this one is well not enough creative I guess (nothing against Zimmer, but I was waiting for something more vulnerable as OST), and I would as well say that dialogues are not as powerful as in original, I wanted ""tears in rain"" moment here too, but I guess that is the result of a more complex storyline, we do not get that obvious phrases, but we get such a dense emotions through interior dialogues of characters and the atmosphere that it is enough.Overall words and review from my perspective is just a ramble, go and watch it and love it and feel it and bleed it - this is such a powerful cinematic piece!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Visuals fine, Story Flat","Visually, I loved this movie, it has moments that are astonishing for my eyeballs. However, for me, to really enjoy a movie, I need a good story, well told. This is where things go flat for me in the current Blade Runner. The Vangelis musical score in the original is magical, this one sounds like many distant mic drops in an echo chamber, and never once adds to the picture. I was especially sad for this, as the original was a near-perfect constant blend of audio, visuals and story.First key item, I think we can all agree that the movie is simply too long, filled with far too many long moments of nothing happening, nobody speaking, actors staring off into space, possibly wondering when somebody was going to yell ""Cut!"". I think honestly, it can be at least 40 minutes shorter, and all elements would remain 100% intact, but audiences would be far happier. This is one instance where I think the final cut version on BluRay should be maybe 90 minutes.Second, I find that this story is told in a very fractured way, daring the audience to somehow stitch the random and poorly sketched scenes together to make an appealing tale. There are so many non sequitur moments, I was baffled by what the screenwriter's real intent was. I loved some scenes just for the visual, but was really not so wowed by the story-telling. Yes, I see the story, but don't be concerned if it doesn't gel for you.Finally, movies are greatly helped by being about something, having an engaging story to tell. Despite being an avid sci-fi and movie fan, I can honestly say I do not know the purpose of this story. I get some story elements, I see how they eventually tie together, but at the end, I can't help but wonder if this was the best way to tell it or if it is even actually there. There are SO many plot gaps and missing parts, I almost felt like making up a few as the story unwound, just so it would be more enjoyable. The original had a powerful story, very well told and acted, but I just can't say that in this version.So, I say seven, but only because some of the visuals are so good. Honestly, as a story, this is working hard to be a 5. This is a very bad trend in modern movie making, lots of flash and high priced talent, but just not enough story and substance to make it worthwhile. For me, the scotch drinking dog was the best story moment, which is not such a great endorsement.I was so disappointed to see this. I even watched the original the week before so I could be sure to correctly appreciate the new version and the complex world it is set in. It didn't help so much.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I left the theater disappointed....,"....but then something magical happened. I don't think any other movie in the past had left me with such a strong after taste. I don't know why, but the themes started jumping out at me the next day, and I couldn't keep my mind off of it. My mind just started to involuntarily unpack all the themes and motifs that this movie had to offer, and even though it has been a week since I saw the movie, it still hasn't finished unpacking.I am learning everyday; people have been posting their interpretations of the movie on Reddit, YouTube, and other social media, and I am just falling in love with this movie the more I hear other people's opinions.I don't know why, but this is one of those rare movies that don't have an immediate impact on you, but eerily grows on you. For all you Blade Runner fans that left the theater rather disappointed, thinking ""What the heck did I watch? Why are people liking this shitty, pretentious art movie?"", just watch the movie at least 5 more times, like me. And watch it in a true IMAX experience, before it gets thrown out the theaters, which it probably will considering its poor box office receptions.I don't have to praise Deakins, his work in this movie speaks for itself, and he has already won an Oscar in my heart. This movie will likely sweep the technical categories. As for the ""real"" categories, I do hope it at least garners a nod for each Picture, Direction, Screenplay, and maybe, just maybe, Supporting Actor for Harrison Ford, because that man has real emotions to express in this movie, that somehow involuntarily transits onto the audience's faces too. Ford has finally made a comeback, and I hope the Academy acknowledges that.I hope Hampton Fancher finally gets a nod. He had been robbed of a nod in '83. His colleagues (Ridley Scott and David Peoples) each has at least one nod under their belts, so it is perhaps time for him too. He, in my opinion, is the master of philosophical dialogue.All in all, Blade Runner 2049 is like reading a novel of high literary significance, and I LOVED this movie. It is unfortunate that not many people are seeing it. Maybe it will become something better than a box office success - a cult classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Beautiful Film,"It's tough these days to find a film that isn't a regurgitation. I love superhero films as much as the next person, but they just can't rival a good sci-fi think piece in pretty much any way, shape or form (bar insane budget).
I think Blade Runner: 2049 is far and away my favourite cinema experience of all time.
The seats rumbling as K approaches the monolithic pyramid of Wallace Corp... it was a transcendent experience.Films have a fixation with overexplaining these days. At spilling their guts about everything. We know the backstories and motivations for every single character, we can't seem to get enough information about lore and world information. Blade Runner 2049 is the antithesis of that. We are given just enough information - but we only get that information if we pay attention. 2049 rewards attention. It rewards you looking at those long, gorgeous shots (every frame could be framed on a wall!), at soaking in atmosphere. It's a simply gorgeous, intelligent movie about the fragility of existence, and how we can act heroically in spite of mundane beginnings - and perhaps mundane endings. There might not be anything special about us as a person, or even our species - but that doesn't invalidate life. It doesn't make life not worth living.I can see how people would not like this film.

The movie should have moved passed the givens, like Star Wars does, and though Star Wars leaves you wanting more, I really don't want to see more Blade Runners, give me an ending or evolve somehow if you're going to do another sequel. One can argue the movie stayed true to itself about future dystopian advertising, but I don't care about that, I would rather understand why having a piece of wood would make you rich or how we got to a dystopia state in the first place and showcase the villain as the state not as a separate entity.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutly brilliant!,"So Before you take in count other reviews claming it has way to many ""plot holes"", consider this, you may not have ever watched the first movie, and still be able to get the story, but if you are craving for knowing what happened in the years between the first and new movie, then there are 3 shortstorys that you can find almos anywhere, made by different artists and comisioned by the director Denise Villeneuve, it covers some important facts between the first and this movie, it´s hard to cover every single detail in a movie (it should have been made a series)

Overrated - and no value in the extra long version.,"Too indulgent for me, such an awesome original film that I have watched many times, to a slow long winded effort. I look forward to the ""less boring"" cut. Soo excited to see this and disappointed with how contrived and self indulgent the direction was, lacking all the clever groundbreaking story that the original movie had. Great visual spectacle, but lacked an equally awesome plot to go with it. Sorry, I read all the reviews before I went, and ... I just didn't like it. Underwhelmed.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb...,"Simply put, if you have not seen the original, it may be a bit confusing. I recommend seeing the ""Final Director's Cut"" of the original Blade Runner before viewing this movie.Having said that, at first I was confused thinking I had it all figured out very early in the movie. Quite frankly I was angry. Then all the loose ends made sense. Reflecting back through the entire movie and the original, this was probably the best sequel I have ever seen in my 42 years of life.I understand now why Blade Runner 2049 had a slow start in theaters - today's audiences expect plots to be spoon-fed to them. I encourage any sci-fi lover to really sit back and take every moment of this film.My hats off to everyone, cast and crew, for making an astounding movie, staying true to canon, making a very cerebral, and most thought-provoking sequel that will certainly please old and new generations.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Sequel that was Over-hyped,"The film was a solid six and maybe a 6.5 But why we have to have sequels that rely on big names and trying to use the things that made the first movie unique. I think was a good movie but as good as Blade Runner? Oh hell no! I'm not a big Gosselin fan but he was good in it and Harrison Ford gave one of his best performances he has had in some time. Being scifi there of course had to have a gorgeous female character, Ana de Armas more that made up for any deficiencies in any other casting weaknesses. She was absolutely captivating as was Sean Young in the original. I believe it could have been much better with some editing that could have shortened the all too long film. Much of the film was visually stunning and the sound track was good. The sound track seemed as if it was more directed to older people like me (I'm 62) Would I spend the money again to see it? Yup even at a 6.5 it was definitely worth a visit to the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Worthy sequel that's very good, not great (just like the original)","Absorbing, but too long, the final action sequence is boring and leaves the viewer desperate for it all to be over. The ending is overly, and mistakenly sentimental. Same problem many sequels have: just too many threads being packed into a story that can't contain it; they didn't know where to go with some of the excess so it just sits there, leaving you to wonder why it was in there. They all make some sense in the context of the film, but looking back, I expect that they're staging a sequel or two (because that's how Ridley Scott rolls).But...absolutely visually and aurally stunning. Same brilliance of the first one, done better. Some innovative CGI--it falters here and there but is well worth the price of admission. They did a great job of referencing the original in many ways without making it a copycat or seem stale.Overall, very successful. Will win the Oscar for Visual Effects for sure.

Gosling does very very good work carrying this movie, that, let's be honest, is 20 years too late in appearing. So much to like, but as Scott says himself, possibly 30mins too long and was in need of scene cuts. I expected Ford to be lazy on this cameo - but he stepped up as best he could (Ford is not a skilled Actor) I would guess this movie is an absolute wonder if seen on a gigantic Screen with great sound.

"Great visuals, disappointing script","Maybe some spoilers!Being a massive fan of the original BR, I was apprehensive about this sequel. In 1982 Blade runner was riveting to watch. Visually stunning and an amazing story full of drama and pathos. Most of the actors where not household names at the time so you were able to really invest in the characters. Now they have to have a well know star to get it made. Ryan Gosling doing the same quiet brooding style he is known for. Harrison Ford had a small part and obviously did it for the money. In 1982 The future 2019 strangely did feel a long way off. This set in 2049 is so implausible that the world will be destroyed like this. One thing that drove me mad was the soundtrack.

A modern classic.,"The original Blade Runner is great in many ways, but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it a lot because of the horribly slow pace. Great world-building, characters and all can only get you so far, in my opinion. The movie dragged on a lot. However, I was intrigued by how one could design something like this, so I was excited for the sequel.2049 was a sequel I never knew I needed, or one that I thought would be better than the original. It expands excellently on the original film's concepts, while also convincing the audience why the sequel was important in the grand scheme of things. Great plot, brilliant twist no doubt, and cinematography that deserved an Oscar, and if Deakins hadn't won that year, I would have rioted. The sound mixing was amazing, too, and the score fits the movie perfectly (my respects to Johann
Johansson, and kudos to Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallsfisch). Ryan Gosling was a great replicant, and provided a chilling, but ultimately heartwarming performance as police officer KD6 - 3.7. Great turns by Sylvia Hoeks as the psychopath replicant puppet of the Wallace corporation, Luv, and Ana de Armas as Joi. Let's just say Jared Leto was great, too, but he took it too far with the whole ""almost blinding himself"" thing.Denis Villenueve has established himself as one of the best directors working right now with this movie. It's fair to trust him with any property, because most likely, he's going to make a classic out of it.

But it suffers from the ""who cares"" curse. This movie is definitely a sequel and fully feels like we're in the same universe but ""who cares"". Why do we have to have sequels to movies that we love? Trying to capture the same thing we felt the first time? Just leave it alone and go make something new.

Masterpiece,"First of all, this film is well-made. The world-building effort really pays off, and the dystopian world it makes extends perfectly from original one's. Also, the cinematography is astonishingly exquisite. The silhouettes and color palettes are so stylish, that I think it deserves an Oscar. Besides, the score sounds breathtaking. Especially the symbiosis between musical sound and visual effect makes a wonderful combination. About the plot, at high level, it is carefully designed. It does not only tie everything together in this movie, but also levitates the original Blade Runner. Although the movie plot rolls out slowly, it can bring you a kind of cathartic joy during watching. The allegorical meaning is not that obvious in the movie, but it does hit the beat of some philosophical view point.Regarding shortcomings, my major concerns are related to the length and pacing of the film. Blade Runner 2049 lasts 2 hrs and 43 mins. Probably that is too long for those causal audiences. Also, the pacing of the film comes way slower than those nowadays. I understand it is intended to play out in such way so this movie has a similar pacing to those in 60s and 70s, and the pacing of original Blade Runner film. However, I really fear this can turn away a large number of audiences. Here I really admire filmmakers' confidence and bravery on sticking to their principles about film making without pandering to the tastes of masses, but it really undermines the possibility of making another such high budget art film in near future.Overall, if you are a hardcore sci-fi fan or interested in art films, I sincerely recommend Blade Runner to you. It is still not clear to me whether this is going to become another cult or legend yet, but I do believe you will not have another sci-fi movie with such high level of quality in years.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Still Controversial,"The original Blade Runner was always a controversial film. Some saw it as a cinematic masterpiece while others didn't see the point of the film. Many years later, the original still brings in new fans whether it was because of hearing that there are 7 versions of the film, out of pure interest, or because of this new masterpiece.Blade Runner 2049 captures the same controversy as the original. Some people love and appreciate the dialogue, every pause, and the cinematography. Others feel the film drags.Blade Runner 2049 is not meant for everyone. It is a film that was made for people to think about, just as the original. Most people leave the film wondering what they just witnessed, and for some this becomes a fascination which makes the film great. Every time the film is watched there are new details your eyes and ears capture. This tends to grow into conversations on forums and Youtube comment sections. Then there are others who don't care and move on. AND THAT'S OK.I thought the film was mesmerizing from start to finish. Just the curiosity of seeing the next shot is something I haven't felt while watching a film in recent years. While the film is obviously meant to be artistic visually, it is the deeper meaning of each scene that boggles my mind.Blade Runner has always been a film ahead of it's time. It attempts to truly capture both your senses. Your eyes and ears are filled with unique sounds and visions that when blended, create a dynamic atmosphere.Some of the themes in the film that seem futuristic and sci-fi like will most likely become more relevant as we head into our future. When you go and see this film for the first time, just go in there and take in the view. Then go back and watch the film again looking for the details within each scene.I do warn casual film-goers that this is not your typical action flick, adventure flick, nor sci-fi flick. If you want to see that, Star Wars is coming out at the end of this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Miracle of Cinema,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a minor miracle. A sequel no one was asking for, it follows up a beloved classic sci-fi film that was genre changing in its own day. How could anyone thing that it needed a follow up?Thank goodness they did, because this is one of those rare instances where the remake, reboot, sequel, soft reboot, re-imagining, or whatever you want to call it, actually turned out to be not just as good as the original, but in it's own contemporary context, as effective as the original in its original context.This film follow K (Ryan Gosling, ""Drive"") as he tries to find a specific replicant which has eluded capture so far. This particular replicant may be the first of its kind, a replicant that was not manufactured but born. Of course there are forces at play that want to stop him, help him, and use him as he conducts this search and unraveling of the various plots at play but the heart of the film is K's search for meaning, since he is a replicant himself.Just as in the first film, the questions at play are really about what makes us human, sentient, or alive. How unique are we? K struggles with this because his life seems pretty straightforward. You do what you were created to do. When he starts to suspect that he may not have been created by a person it brings up issues of destiny, choice, and action. Now that his choices are his own, what will he do with them? Were they always his own even though he didn't realize it? How much of what has transpired was the invisible guiding of another person and how much was his own?Story wise, this film is not that impressive. The plot is simple with a couple good revelation moments but most of the story beats are seen coming a mile away. This is ok, though. The movie spends the most time on what it should be spending time; the character complexities and philosophical questions of the audience watching. Languorous takes, stunning production design, eye watering color, and cinematography with texture give this film a feel that you want to wrap up in as you contemplate your own existence.If I had gone to see this movie with the expectation that I was about to see the next 'chapter of the blade runner saga,"" I would have been disappointed. The world is not much expanded, though some changes are hinted at. Frankly, if that's what anyone went to this movie for, I'd have to ask them if they even saw the first film. It is very similar in tone, pacing, and interest as this one.But, since, what I was hoping for was a meditative sci fi epic which muses on the reality of being, existence, and life in the universe, I was not disappointed in the slightest. This film was everything a cinephile could ask for in a blockbuster summer release from one of the big studios even if it was an unusual one.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the last good movies made,"Look at some older movies that are regarded as some of the greatest movies ever. One you may of thought of just now is the god father. What makes it such a good movie though? Well one thing is it is slow paced, long and patient. People thing that a movie being slow means it boring but it doesn't. This movies is so good because it is just like those old classics. It patient and takes it time with everything. Similar to Star Wars IV. The cinematography is amazing and so it the few bursts of action it has to break up the monotony. And the action is very quick and short so it makes it very gritty and realistic. Another movie I would compare it to when it comes to pacing and patients is 2001: a space Odyssey. I don't want to talk about it too much because I want people to see this movie. I will say this though. This movie is not like say avengers infinity war where it a instant classic that anyone can have a fun time watching. It's a sequel to a cult classic and this film also holds that same title. It requires you see the original. It requires you pay attention and try to see some of the hidden meanings. Overall if you have a short attention Spand you will not like this movie. If you are a smarter more sophisticated moviegoer I think you will enjoy this film. Thank you",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Reasons why the film commercially fails,"It is clear that ""Blade Runner 2049"" underperforms at box office, especially in the United States. There are several reasons for that.First, the film depicts humans as evil and replicants as justice. ""War for the Planet of Apes"" did the same, paying tributes to apes while slashing humans. All the audiences are humans and obviously they don't want such a setting.Secondly, the pace is too slow. You can sleep for twenty minutes, and when you wake up, you can still catch up with the plot.Third, bad editing.

A more artful film would have included more character development. But this movie wants to intrigue at every turn and-- especially if you're a fan of the original--it does so in spades. The hooks to the original Blade Runner are great, yet this movie would stand on its own. The story and acting are great--even Gosling's ;-) The female characters are great. The sets and effects are great. I take off one star for the soundtrack: too boomy, not enough quiet moments listening to rainfall and street chatter, the flying cars (""spinners"") are noisy, and the music isn't musical enough.

Style over substance.,"Blade Runner 2049 is undeniably a visually stunning film, filled with breathtaking shots and a futuristic aesthetic that is hard to resist. With the addition of Ryan Gosling, the movie gets a boost in charm and appeal. However, while it excels in style, it falls short in substance, ultimately leaving me disappointed.One of the film's noteworthy positives is its sheer visual appeal. The cinematography is outstanding, showcasing visually stunning shots. The futuristic landscapes and meticulous attention to detail create an immersive experience that is hard to ignore.Furthermore, the inclusion of Ryan Gosling adds a layer of charisma to the film. Gosling delivers a solid performance, effortlessly embodying the brooding and mysterious character he plays. His presence on screen adds depth to an otherwise lackluster narrative.However, the film's negatives significantly outweigh its positives. Blade Runner 2049 suffers from a slow and plodding pace, making it a tedious viewing experience. Some shots feel unnecessarily long, contributing to the overall sense of sluggishness and making it challenging to stay engaged. The film's insistence on prioritizing visuals over storytelling detrimentally affects its pacing.Moreover, while the initial premise of the movie is intriguing, delving deeper into the story reveals a lack of captivating themes and ideas. The film's main concept loses its initial allure as the plot unfolds, leaving me with a sense of indifference rather than awe-inspiring revelations. Blade Runner 2049 takes itself far too seriously, striving to be a mind-blowing cinematic experience, but ends up feeling somewhat bland and overhyped.In conclusion, Blade Runner 2049 is a visually appealing film that falls short in terms of substance. It offers some good scenes and benefits from the presence of Ryan Gosling, but its slow pace, lackluster story, and self-importance ultimately make it a somewhat tedious and underwhelming experience. While it may be a treat for the eyes, it fails to deliver a captivating and memorable narrative that truly captivates the viewer.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Deeper Feel,"A sequel to Bladerunner when another blade runner years later discovers a hidden past and preserved away from the future.We see a more dynamic and emotional approach to this lead character in a desolate world forgotten by time. This added ingredient to AI emotion to this story brings a more deeper feel and rather if humanity could ever respect and accept it.This film could provide a different meaning as to society of placement, obedience to the core of motive of a human being or replace human error all together and put it in a submissive state where the living can have some liberty.The overall feel of the film certainly stayed true to the beautiful artistic look Bladerunner shown but with a wider lense in this film.Harrison Ford's character gives you that notion of sorrow, anger, and detachment as we learn with his past since the first film.It stays true to the first film but not quite as different as it could be but still a good look.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best movie I've seen in a long time.,"Seriously, this might have topped my favorite movies. The transition from the original is seamless and unprecedented; despite the time that's passed both in and out of the movie it feels as if you're stepping in to their reality, something that feels both magical and close enough to our own to feel tangible. Really such a beautiful movie in every way. The soundtrack, cinematography, dialogue, direction, I literally couldn't criticize a single thing. I can't say enough, especially without eluding to the plot, but I wholeheartedly recommend this film; not just as an adequate sequel, but in my honest opinion, a movie that has surpassed the original. If you can, please go see it in the theater; it really amplifies the beautifully done atmosphere of this astounding movie.That said, fair warning to those with seizure disorders, you may want to consider waiting to view this at home.

I think this might be the best sequel ever, as it manages to continue the story, being faithful to it's essence, but at the same time to stand perfectly on it's own, leaving no room for comparisons. It develops the original's outstandingly unique aesthetics in a totally different way, updating the story visually and acoustically and thus, creating a new world. It's a captivating artwork on so many levels, that absorbs you in a melancholic sense of loneliness, uncertainty and futility, re-evoking and adding to the philosophical questions set in the original.

Remake falls a bit short,"How do you make a sequel of a movie that many consider to be the greatest science fiction movie of all time? Well, that was the task that director Denis Villeneuve was given with Blade Runner 2049. His last movie was the 2016 sci-fi movie Arrival, which won Best Picture of the Year. So, you'd think he was up to the task. However, the sequel falls a bit short.The movie takes place 30 years in the future from the original Blade Runner. Ryan Gosling is the new Blade Runner and he sets out to find the original Blade Runner (Harrison Ford) who disappeared 30 years ago and has never been heard from since. The problem for the former Blade Runner Rick, (Ford) is that he meant to to that. He hasn't been missing; he's been in hiding. It's a secret that K (Gosling) discovers about a replicant that sends him in search of the old Blade Runner.Most of the dark theme of the original movie made it to the remake and the story, although a little bit complicated, is a smooth transition from the first movie to the new one. The special effects are even more amazing, after 30 years of new technology have passed, and if you over think some of the premises in the movie it will really blow your mind. My recommendation is to just enjoy the movie as it plays out.While not as good as the original, this movie comes darn close.

"Slow burner, visually impressive, at times a little bit boring","""Blade Runnner 2049"" is a good sequel, with a solid story, full of twists that you do not expect. It is visually impressive, I really liked the representation of the dystopian future and I think that it is very faithful to the original movie. The cast completely nailed it, a lot of big names are involved, so rest assured that the acting quality is very good.It is a slow burner, building up things gradually, perhaphs sometimes too slowly, there are a lot of scenes where nothing happens: just stills of the main character watching to a detail on the ground, or outside a window. You wonder when there will be some progress in the Blade Runner investigation. Also, toward the end there are some sequences that are unnecessarily long and tedious.Apart from that, Villeneuve managed to create an amazing narrative, with grade A special effects. I liked that he focused more on the investigation side of the story, instead of going full blast on action sequences. I really enjoyed how he developed the relationship between K and his artificial intelligence Joi, that should actually raise some concerns on how romantic interactions are progressing on our society. I liked how he exploited how humans use replicants as their slaves and these, becoming self-aware of their own situation want to free all the AIs. There is a big ideologic fight between these two factions that become more and more violent, through time because of a specific event.The soundtrack is ethereal, very scifi and it fits perfectly with the movie. Hans Zimmer once again does not disappoint and contribute to create a dark mood the whole time. I really liked how he used synths to create a dreamy and mysterious ambience. We are talking about a real master.In the end ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a solid movie, but it could have been much more. A lot of things are not properly explained and sometimes you need to use your immagination, in order to understand what is happening. This is not always bad, but there a few aspect of the story that I wish were explained better. There are a few plot holes, and this is unforgivable for a film that is 2 hours and 45 minutes long.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's an overrated movie.,"I can understand that the movie became very famous because of the popularity of some of the actors in it, but for me it's very different. The visual quality, the graphic resolution, the sound editing and the use of color is fantastic. There is not a single negative thing I can comment on. Yes, that's all the things I liked. Let's talk about what I didn't like. With a duration of over 2.5 hours - and it shows every minute that it doesn't deserve it - it was a movie that consumed my time and made me wish they had made it 1.5 hours. Technology is very advanced, but the script is still based on let's give babies a mother so we can have more robot babies. Leto is a really bad actor or he doesn't accept the roles he can perform. Or who knows? I don't want to express my feelings in words and limit its meaning. What I can say in summary is that if you have plenty of time, watch it. Because it does not have a story that will open your horizons, make you think differently or make you say ""whoa"". Thank you for reading to the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sorry, I don't get it","Why are there bees in the middle of a radioactive desert? What do they live on? Are there some hidden flower meadows, they didn't show us? Or are the bees replicants too? That was about the only question I pondered after watching this, as the rest of the movie made so little sense that I didn't bother. Something about pregnant replicants and a wooden horse. Or maybe the horse was pregnant and the replicants made from wood, I don't remember.Yeah the visuals were kind of artsy but at no point did the fictional world feel as if it could be real, something the original blade runner film managed to pull off quite well in contrast. I didn't really care for any of the characters either, with the possible exception of the holographic girlfriend. She was nice but didn't have all that much screen time.A lot of people seem to like this sequel, but aside from the obvious production value and the fact that Harrison Ford is in it, I don't get why.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You Look Lonely,"The rare sequel that improves upon the original, there are few movies as completely engrossing and brilliantly executed as Blade Runner 2049. It's subtle yet haunting score and aweing visuals could be viewed as art even without the highly complex characters and excellent narrative. Add those things and you've got the greatest piece of science fiction ever created. Forget Ex Machina, forget The Empire Strikes Back, forget The Matrix, forget Terminator 2: Judgment day, forget the original Blade Runner. None of them compare to this absolute masterpiece.Denis Villeneuve is a genius. He took the thought provoking themes from the original Blade Runner such as mortality and what defines someone as truly human, then he deepens these themes by exploring ideas such as what defines true emotion, true love vs. Synthetic love, and most importantly, loneliness. And he does all of this while still presenting a layered and thought-provoking narrative that brings the viewer along as a strange and bewildering mystery slowly unravels, culminating in some of the most tragic and intense storytelling that I have ever witnessed.The cinematography is absolutely stunning. Regarded by many as the most visually impressive movie ever created, I would be inclined to agree with them. It's use of color, negative space, and visual contrast all add to the constant melancholiac themes expressed throughout the film. Every shot feels like it could be in an art gallery, every scene totally awes you with absolute spectacle, but what I find to be the most impressive about the visuals is how real they feel. From the moment the movie begins, you feel completely immersed in this dark, grimy, staggeringly beautiful world, and while you know, deep down, it's all just a movie, you still have hard time comprehending that it's fictional.While the visuals immerse you in the world, what truly makes it feel real are the exceptional performances that come from the entire cast, and a particularly extraordinary lead performance from Ryan Gosling. While he has relatively few lines, the way he presents himself truly illustrates his character as the lonely, broken man that he is. He says more by saying nothing than he could by saying something. He is truly one of the most talented actors alive. However, I'm not discounting the performance given by Ana De Armas. She also gives a scene stealing performance that adds depth and complexity to her almost uninteresting character. If most other actresses had portrayed her character, she would be seen as nothing more than a tool to further develop Ryan Gosling's character. But her portrayal truly defines her character as her person, capable of feeling complex emotions.I did mention earlier that this film is superior to the original Blade Runner, and that's for a number of reasons, but there is one that, in my mind, stands out far more than the others. It's not the deeper themes, the more interesting cinematography, or the superior performances. It's the narrative. While the original uses its narrative almost as a method of expression for it's themes, 2049 allows it's narrative to stand on its own as a riveting and tragic neo-noir with a completely absorbing central mystery. At times, it may confuse the viewer, but it's numerous pieces all fall together in the end, leaving no true loose ends. Not to say it doesn't need a sequel. The fact that it allows it's story and themes to exist separately is the true reason why I consider Blade Runner 2049 to be an improvement on the original.Masterfully told, incredibly executed, and extremely thought provoking, Blade Runner stands as one of the best movies of the 21st century, and arguably the greatest sci-fi movie ever created. I think I'm being a little picky here, so I'm only giving it a 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A technical masterpiece,"Blade Runner 2049 may very well be my favorite movie of 2017. All of the shots in this movie is absolutely perfect. You can pretty much use every single one of them and use it as a beautiful desktop background. It will be an absolute shame if Roger Deakins does not win Best Cinematography at the Oscars this year. Ryan Gosling was awesome as usual and Harrison Ford gave possibly the best performance of his career. Denis Villeneuve proved himself to be one of the best directors working today from such great films such as Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and Arrival. This movie is in almost every way an improvement to the original. I can see 20 to 30 years from now Blade Runner 2049 will be an influential film to future filmmakers in terms of directing, set design, and cinematography. In every way, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Engaging and thoughtful even if the pacing and sudden action doesn't always work,"A very high profile film from last year, with a high profile cast and director to return to a film considered a modern classic in terms of its influence as well as its value as a film. We join the world again after many years, and follow a replicant Blade Runner chasing down older models. The specific case which opens the film leads him on the trail of what appears to be the first time a replicant has reproduced 'organically'. While 'K' tries to locate this supposed child, he is haunted by connected memories; and at the same time another replicant is dispatched by Niader Wallace to get there first.As a narrative the film is interesting in terms of its base elements, but moreso because of how quickly it embraces the central themes which were in Blade Runner; of reality, or memory, of free-will. At first it jarred me a bit by how open it was about who was a replicant and who wasn't, but it made sense and was well framed in this world. It pushes for thoughtfulness and open questions, but manages to make it work without seeming like it is pushing too hard without justification. The pace works against it a bit, and there is really no reason for it to be as long as it is. At times it seems a bit labored in how it hangs around in silence, or spends so long to take in the vast expansion of the future landscape or building design, and it does try the patience here and there.The time spent to take in the view is perhaps understandable though because the film looks great. The design, the scale, and the cinematography combine well. Within this the detail includes plenty of items which extend the world of the original film but yet remind us of how ahead of its time it was - aspects are exaggerated into the future perhaps, but yet remain familiar and believable as only being a few steps away from the near future. The cast are good throughout; plenty of famous faces (which is a little distracting at times) but mostly they are effective. Gosling is surprisingly good; very restrained but gives enough in the detail to offer more. Ford is more expressive than I expected, and Hoeks is a strong presence despite her frame. The cast is probably too big, and again it is a way the film could have been tighter in terms of running time.Despite weaker elements though, it is an engaging film that gets the thoughtful tone right, and offers more than it has on the surface.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece,Stunning cinematography and a certain kind of cold beauty of the world. Yes it is slow at times but that is the intriguing vibe it is conveying.

Slow and boring film,"I tried to like this, mainly because I enjoyed the music in the first hour. But the film is a million miles from the original in terms of story line, acting and script.First, the film's appearance. This looks so bad compared to the original. I don't get it how so many people love how it looks because it is nowhere as beautiful as the original Blade Runner, which was made on film vs the remake's digital rendering. Like most digitally made movies, they try to make up for the medium's shortcomings by giving it an almost monochrome appearance. The original had beautifully saturated color, whereas the remake looks washed out and lackluster. This is a fault of the medium, as digital can't reproduce the saturated colors and exposure range that film can achieve. But it's also the fault of the director and cinematographer on the remake. The first two or three minutes of the original has striking and awe inspiring imagery. That's 100% missing on the remake.The other problem is that the film is far too long, and too much time is spent when it is not going anywhere. The pacing is dreadfully slow. If they had lopped off about an hour it would really have helped.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is a true masterpiece,"I loved Harrison Ford in movies until he played old man Indy and then I became quite ageist (I'm getting on myself...). I just thought he waited too long to make the movie and then was very skeptical going into to watch Blade Runner 2049 given the recent star wars fiasco. I was so pleasantly surprised.This film has an amazing number of twists that you could never guess. It is a masterpiece. Its slow moving like the original (interestingly the original looks so dated now, and isn't actually that great). You almost want to say as you are watching this movie, ""This is making me bored"", but you can't bring yourself to say that. Its just so well paced that it makes for compulsive watching.It dark and moody and yet light and fluffy in some parts. The A.I. ideas where quite interesting and as a technologist I found them particularly intriguing. The look of the movie is so close to the original, but the effects are flawless. Some of the best visual effects since Oblivion.I thought La La Land was the biggest lot of tripe and deserved no oscars, and was concerned about the fact that Ryan Gosling might be poor in the part, but he was absolutely amazing. He pulled off not being quite human but as the movie progresses he becomes more and more human.This movie has one of the greatest cinematic bad guys of all time in my opinion. The voice change of the baddy in some scenes is quite startling and unnerving. They definitely should have received a nomination for their work. Don't want to reveal any more than that. Not giving any spoilers away. Just to say, I'm not talking about Wallace.Even my 16 year old son loved it, which is interesting, given that he turned Blade Runner off after 40 minutes. He found the original so boring and dated. This sequel is definitely worth a watch. And then you have to watch it again to catch the bits you missed the first time.Using my own statistical rule of ""little amount of advertisement = quality movie"", or ""too much advertisement on side of bus=flop"", I have to say, I didn't see any adverts for this movie at all. This is a movie that needs no introduction or overselling. Its a movie that will be noticed over time for the great movie that it is.Definitely up there with Interstellar, Inception, Oblivion, Empire (V) as my favourite sci-fi's of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not only a great sequel but, a great movie","It's rare to find a sequel like this. A sequel to a classic movie that is great also but, a sequel that is able to stand up on its own two feet without needed the help of the original to help keep the audience engaged or interested. This a rare type of movie. It is a movie that stays true to the themes of the original but, it's able to add more to them that add to the story by having it develop the characters new and old. The movie is also able to add to the visuals a new set for a new generation. The movies cinematography is also a stand out. Roger Deakins once again shows us that he is a master of his class with breath taking shots and visuals that you'll probably want to make it the wallpaper on your laptop. The movie is achievement not only in film but in world building for the long awaited second installment for an already well beloved cult-classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the original,"I've committed the eighth sin: calling a sequel better than its predecessor. But Blade Runner 2049 deserves the praise. It's a masterpiece; a fantastic experience of eye-wateringly beautiful visuals, hypnotic sounds, and a fantastic narrative. The pacing of this film is also commendable; despite being intentionally slow placed, and doing a good job at it too, I felt I could watch hours more of it. The story was a complete one; not the sort that left you waiting for a sequel to explain things away, or for a spin off novel (*cough* Star Wars *cough*). Denis Villeneuve outdoes himself, and so do the writers. Obviously, Ryan Gosling is flawless, Harrison Ford is grumpy, Jared Leto is weird, Dave Bautista is actually good (?) and so is everyone else. I implore you to watch it; it's a unique experience, and a richly satisfying one. It's also more approachable, I felt, than the original, without pandering too much. Loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually Awing,"I'll admit it, from certain people I have heard this movie is to slow and doesn't have great payoff, and it's taken me 6 years to get around to watch it and I'm so angry I didn't see it in the cinema as I LOVED it.The story is about a blade runner named K ( Ryan Gosling ) he is in a case and finds remains of a body which uncovers a secret about their kind, he must try and track down an older officer named Rick Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) to find out the truth of a society destroying secret.It is 100% a slow burn but I find there are scenes put in so it doesn't feel dragged out whatsoever and the sheer appeal of Gosling is what held me to the movie.The score is fantastic but sweet Jesus the visuals are something else altogether, I do hope this comes back to the cinema as I'd love to see it on the big screen.I don't know if it's something I could watch over and over but I will definitely come back to it, the mood is very depressing but in a way that's fitting, in a sci-fi future that doesn't seem so far away.Definitely worth the watch, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

While maybe not the deepest most advanced story ever, but you watch this movie more so for it's epic vistas and just the great atmosphere of the dark world of Blade runner.

He tells his LAPD superior Lt. Joshi, played by powerful Robin Wright, that being born gives one a soul. She acknowledges him, ""You've done just fine without one.""

Inadvertently, Luv's reveal cues K to locate Deakard (Ford).In the backdrop, K lives the isolated existence. His love is the sad and beautiful holographic program Joi, played by captivating Ana de Armas. Joi is the sentient program wishing to be human to be with K. This is the weakest movie narrative. The virtual ménage of K, Joi, and Replicant prostitute Mariett, strong pretty Mackenzie Davis, is more a hollow plot device than about human frailty. Too bad.In the telling confession with Deakard and Wallace in his Zen-like lair, Wallace says to Deakard of his deceased Replicant love Rachel, ""Love or mathematical precision?"" What is it to be human? That gets lost at times.As Luv, Hoek's consumed ruthlessness, fierce intellect, and spinning sidekicks provide the formidable match for Gosling's enduring warrior K. Luv's purpose is self preservation of her kind. K's purpose is far nobler. He searches for the truth, and protects those who are weaker. K may not be entirely human, yet he becomes Hero. This narrative thread and the performances make ""Blade Runner 2049"" special. Aside from Harrison Ford, Carla Juri stands out as the gentle brilliant orphaned Scientist who created K's memories. She is bright light with a profound sadness.""Blade Runner 2024"" also has a sense of sadness which is its strength and poignancy. Villeneuve surprises in the end. Then we recall that even in the darkness, ""Blade Runner 2024"" is the Hero story of K and Deakard.

"Simply, a masterpiece","After 35 years Blade Runner is back! This time it's directed by Denis Villeneuve, the man behind Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival. Writer Hampton Fancher returns to the franchise to helm the screenplay along with Michael Green. The film is set in 2049 were a new Blade Runner, officer K (Ryan Gosling), is hunting the few remaining Tyrell replicants. However when a secret is uncovered, K no longer is the hunter. He has become the hunted. In the leading roles we have Ryan Gosling as the new Blade Runner, officer K. He is a brilliant addition to the universe and serves as a very compelling character. The performance by Gosling is also great, as expected from an actor of his caliber. Harrison Ford makes his triumphant return to the franchise and unlike his performance in the original, which could be considered one of his weakest, Ford gives his one of his best ever performances. He is also great when on screen with Gosling. The pair have a good chemistry and are very entertaining to watch. In the other roles we have Ana de Armas, Jared Leto, Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks, all great performances. At the center of this story we have the classic Blade Runner themes, life, death and it's meaning. Those aspects are definitely the originals strength. My biggest flaw with the original has always been it's love story, which is mainly down to the lack of chemistry between Sean Young and Ford. However in 2049 we have one of the strongest and most emotionally powerful love stories i have seen in a very long time. It's fits perfectly and enhances the overall story. Roger Deakins is one of the greatest cinematographers of all time and his work here is perhaps his best. Blade Runner: 2049 is one of the most beautiful films of all time, thank's to the great, Roger Deakins. It really has to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. His work here can only be considered, art. All the above mentioned factors combine, under the direction of Villeneuve, to become one of the truly, greatest sequels of all time and therefor one of the best films overall. I can't find a flaw with this film and therefor i will not hesitate to call it a masterpiece. Is it better than the original? I really can't say. But what i can say is that i won't compare them. Blade Runner 2049 is a complete movie that can stand on it's own and be great. I won't compare the two because they are both masterpieces in there own right.

Simply Stunning,"I just got back, and as many others have already stated, the film is simply stunning. Bladerunner played with the notion of life and death brought emotions I rarely, if ever, have received from a film. The way the film showcases the beauty of the human body and our behaviors was fantastic. Changes in score and aggressive tones were perfectly placed and the cinematography was top-notch. For me though, the real masterpiece here was the story. I was engaged the entire time, and at no point felt any part was unnecessary. Ryan Gosling and Villeneuve are a dangerous combo. 5/5! I cannot recommend this movie enough. I wish I could go back and see it for the first time again, it was that good.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece.,"Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel that measures equally to its predecessor, a masterpiece in its own right. However, it seems much like the original, that Blade Runner 2049 will not meet its status as an iconic sci-fi film for some years to come. This is a visual masterpiece, depicting the most beautiful ruin of a city that has graced a film. From beginning to end in its 2h 44min run-time, it captivates the wonder of a decrepit dystopian world, all of which is shot beautifully by the incomparable Roger Deakins. The cast led by Ryan Gosling who plays ""K"" and Harrison Ford who returns as ""Rick Deckard"", act superbly to create an awe-inspiring film on the big screen. Under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 shows that he is one of the most talented directors and one of the few masters of storytelling in the movie business today.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautiful But Not ""Film Noir""","In essence, its just a pretty average action movie dressed up real pretty. The stroy has little to do with the original. For example, a very traditonal ""good""vs ""bad"" story is in place. This is made so childishly clear by Jared Leto's character Niander Wallace and his pet replicant played by Sylvia Hoeks. These characters are pretty much the stereotypical one-dimensonal bad guys and therefore completely unrelatable.The whole point of the original is that there is no good or bad, its all just a grey mess and were all equally victim of how the world turns. Even Rutger Hauer as the legendary leader of the rebellious Nexus 6's is quite relatable, even though he is a cold-blooded killer. You feel kinda sorry for him and you think: Well, i'd probably react like that in his situation. What am I suppose to do, just roll over and die?If you look up the definition of the ""noir"" genre its says : ""a style or genre of cinematographic film marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace."" And thats exactly what the original is. The remake is anything but that. Its in the end a very generic story about hope and overcoming evil, Its a decent film and certainly pretty, but it has nothing to do with Bladerunner.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best sequels made,"Blade Runner is a cult classic and has inspired countless sci-fi films after it so making a sequel to it thirty-five years later will be worrying to fans of the original. I have to admit, Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels made.Blade Runner 2049 follows K, a blade runner in the year 2049, who unearths secrets that lead him on a mission to find Deckard.Even if you don't like Blade Runner 2049, the one thing everyone can agree on is how amazing the cinematography is. Roger Deakens is one of my favourite cinematographers and the amount of work he put into this film is stunning. I'm so happy he got his long deserved Oscar for this. There are so many gorgeous frames that could be hung up on a wall as a portrait. The visual effects and colourful scenery entrance and transcends you to this dystopian world and keeps you there through its duration. It's an absolute feast for the eyes. The Blade Runner universe has never looked better.Denis Villenueve has impressed me with films like Prisoners and Enemy but Blade Runner 2049 has solidified him as one of the best directors working today. This man has a huge amount of talent and I'm so happy he got chosen to direct this. I honestly cannot wait for Dune adaptation. Hampton Fancher, who wrote the original Blade Runner, returns to write 2049 as well. I think the story this time is more entertaining and Fancher retains everything that made the original so good. Some may say the film is too long but for me this was an extremely fast 2 hours and 40 minutes. I felt each scene had purpose and nothing was wasted.Ryan Gosling continues to impress with his restrained performance here. You can by Harrison Ford's acting whether he cares about the film he's doing and this is one of the best performances in recent years. He clearly loved this script a lot. I loved Ana de Armas in Knives Out and once again she proved herself as a worthy actress. Robin Wright was great and Jared Leto redeemed himself here after Suicide Squad.If you are a fan of sci-fi or the original Blade Runner, I sure 2049 will not disappoint. It's that rare sequel that I think is even better than the first. It's a film that manages to build upon the first one and present itself with extraordinary cinematography, an interesting story and great performances while staying faithful to the original. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The acting was good loved Luv. Thought everyone's acting good except ""gasp"" Harrison Ford. Jared leto does a good job of playing creepy characters. Yes there were flaws in the script but I thought it was better than 80% of things released now a days. I also loved Joy. Seems most the men only liked it for the women. maybe buy a fashion magazine and quit whining. I believe this is worth the watch and Ryan gossling was also good. If you just go in with a open mind and not compare the two I think you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beautifully bleak,"Bladerunner 2049 is a faithful successor to the original in that it doesn't try to appease the 'fidget spinner' generation who need fast cuts and yappy dialogue to sustain their limited attention spans.Its languid, methodical pace allows the viewer to soak up every ounce of atmosphere in each gorgeously rendered frame, to feel totally immersed in the haunting bleakness of it all. As the camera rises through colossal cityscapes permeated with smog and glowing neon, as the synths ebb and surge like waves, there is a sense of desolation and ruin, a consumerist culture turned cancer that has driven humanity to a dark place figuratively and spiritually.The plot unravels slowly, with no great urgency, but it is nonetheless intriguing, as Bladerunner K's world is shaken by the discovery of a replicant's 'miracle birth' and his road to finding the child leads him to experience the emotions and value decisions which ultimately make us human. These existential themes are what Bladerunner has always been about, rather than explosive, pounding action sequences -though there are sporadic moments of action, it's not the emphasis. So if you go to this film and encounter people yawning, chances are they had the wrong expectations.Gosling and Ford are as watchable as always, but the female characters are particularly engaging. Robin Wright oozes authority as the tough as nails Lieutenant Joshi. Ana de Armas has a difficult task in trying to make her character, Joi (K's perfect hologram girlfriend) feel sympathetic, but the innocent exuberance she displays as she tries to navigate the boundaries of her own virtual existence in her relationship with K is affecting. The main antagonist, Luv, played with ice-cold menace by Sylvia Hoeks, is a real standout. Perhaps the first female villain I've watched who doesn't come off as titular, she is a very threatening presence throughout the film. The only strike for me was Jared Leto's performance as the evil Niander, who's lofty haiku dialogue and John Malkovich style cadence felt overplayed and camp.I think fans of the original Bladerunner will enjoy this sequel and even if you are not that engaged with the minutia of the story, there is much to enjoy on a scene by scene basis. For me I was totally lost in the mood and even at 160 minutes, it didn't feel wasted. Of course there are those who will dismiss it as too slow and boring; With the way movies are edited today, it's not surprising, but it is a shame. Bladerunner 2049 is art.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
CGI great!,"The CGI is pretty much flawless, and I'm not joking when I say that while watching this movie, you'll think you're watching a real world. The film is interesting, it's well shot, well directed, it's visually stunning, it's pretty, and the score is very thrilling. But as a whole, this movie is just so god da*n boring.Look, I like slow paced movies, but this film is beyond slow paced. It's brain dead. It's literally like watching a person with no arms and legs try to crawl across a football field. I won't lie, at first I liked this slow pace because it built up a lot of tension, a lot of mystery, a lot of suspense, and I assumed that eventually the film would kick into high gear; it never did. The pace remains constant throughout the entire run time of this movie. It's excruciatingly slow. The movie is almost 3 hours long, and it feels like 6. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, I mean by the end of the movie I expected to look in the mirror and see that I aged 65 years.And also, the film is also overly convoluted. I'm not saying that this is a confusing film, because it's not; in fact, it's pretty straightforward and easy to follow. It just simply felt like this movie was convoluted for the sake of it being convoluted. At the time of watching everything felt important. I had to pee so badly the entire movie but I didn't want to get up because I felt like everything I was watching was super important. However, only after viewing do I realize that there were so many scenes that were totally unnecessary, that were there only to make the movie longer, more bloated, and more self-important.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a disappointment.,"I am one of the biggest Blade Runner fans on the planet. My license plate reflects that. I had no intention of watching another ""Blade Runner"" movie, since, well, it was done. But when I found out Harrison Ford was attached to the project, I knew it had to be something special. He had vowed he would never reprise that role. I wish he hadn't. This movie is a lot like the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"". Things randomly happen for no apparent reason.

Breathtaking. Best film of 2017 so far.,"This is the best film of 2017. This film is a flat out masterpiece of cinema. Entertaining, thought-provoking, deep, and breathtaking visuals are just a few things to describe this film. I will never forget seeing this in theaters. At first I was a little hesitant to see it with the 3 hour running time, but I went anyways, and boy am I glad I did! The cast in this film is excellent. Ryan Gosling gives a compelling lead character in 'K', Harrison Ford reprised his role as Rick Deckard and he was great, Robin Wright is fantastic as K's boss, Jared Leto gives an interesting performance, Ana de Armos as Joi was phenomenal. Everyone did an amazing job! Besides the cast, the story, musical score, and visuals are pure brilliance. While I really like and enjoy the first Blade Runner, I think this film is actually a massive improvement over the first, which rarely happens! The first film, while really good in its own right, slightly falls apart in its last thirty minutes. Whereas, in 2049, it is entertaining and thought-provoking throughout. Also, I would give the first film a solid 8/10, but I give 2049 a perfect score of 10/10. I seriously do not have one flaw with 2049 whatsoever. It's such a shame the film flopped at the box office. I will definitely be purchasing this amazing film on Blu-Ray!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"First impressions, not completely what i expected...","This is not an easy review because i just left the theater and i have some mixed feelings about it. First of all i am a fan of the original Blade Runner, i found it really unique and interesting but when it comes to Blade Runner 2049 even though it had crazy good visuals and sound effects i thought it was a bit dull. For starters i think that the movie was a bit too long. Even though the scenes had many details (which could be a great thing especially for people who don't know the futuristic world that was introduced in the first movie) i think they overdid it a bit which made some of the scenes a bit pointless and it felt like they lead to nowhere. The main thing that was missing in order for this to be a good slow paced movie was the lack of tension. The movie felt a bit flat for the first 2/3 of it(at one point i actually dozed off for a couple of minutes). I really think they should have spent a bit more time on developing the story instead of the visual look of the movie.When it comes to the positive things that i really liked, i think Ryan Gosling did an amazing job as well as Harrison Ford. The acting was definitely spot on. The cinematographer is definitely someone we have to keep an eye on this award season. The sound effects and the whole vibe bring that old feeling from the original movie which is something that i love. Overall i rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A modern science-fiction masterpiece that builds on its predecessor.,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is a sequel to the 1982 cult classic ""Blade Runner"" by Ridley Scott. It's a stylistic film focused on ideas as the narrative follows Ryan Gosling's ""K"" in an investigation that links him to Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford); a former Blade Runner. ""Blade Runner 2049"" may be called one of the best sequels of all time because of it's incredible narrative, astounding visuals, and a memorable and thought-provoking story.Building on the themes of it's predecessor, ""Blade Runner 2049"" asks the audience what it means to be human. What constitutes an individuals soul? Memories? Emotions? Personal conviction? It's a brave picture not afraid to allow the viewer to think instead of spoon-feed information on a surface level. This is large in part due to Hampton Francher's incredible script which he spent over two decades preparing.The director, Denis Villeneuve, has a made a strong case to cement himself as a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. His sleek style is apparent just like it is in ""Prisoners,"" and ""Arrival."" Visually, it's impossible to not mention the mind-blowing cinematography and production design which work work effortlessly together to create a one of a kind fantastical, yet believable world. Every shot is a breathtaking piece of art and much praise should be given to both Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption) and Dennis Gassner (Skyfall, The Truman Show, Big Fish).In the case of editing, many casual moviegoers might not jump on board with the slower pacing and longer shots. Having a runtime of nearly 3 hours probably doesn't help in that regard. After watching the film twice now, I can confidently say the rhythm is pitch perfect (no reference intended). Each shot is just as long as it needs to be and while we still have every opportunity to soak in each beautiful moment, the film still skips over parts we know we don't want to see and gets right to what we want to see. Crucial and tense moments are drawn out while mundane scenes seem to have been omitted in the final product.As expected, performances are top notch, especially from Harrison Ford. While his screen time may not live up to expectations, he gives a layered and complex performance in the scenes he's in. I dare say he tops his original performance in the '82 version. Ryan Gosling gives another cold but thoughtful performance quite similar to his character in ""Driver"" (2011) which may make it difficult to feel deeply for the character. However, this does play into the story so too much criticism on that front may not be warranted. Who really steals the show is Sylvia Hoeks as ""Luv."" Her presence on scene is both exhilarating and terrifying as she presents an antagonist whose ruthless nature exceeds the originals Nexus 6 leader.""Blade Runner 2049"" is a masterclass in filmmaking and science-fiction story-telling. It certainly will be hailed as a classic for years to come and certainly becomes more satisfying to watch with each viewing much like its predecessor. For anyone who has the time and temperament to watch and appreciate this fine film, it is well worth the sacrifice.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

another beautiful film by Villeneuve,"A beautiful, beautiful film. Blade runner 2049 picks up 30 years after the events of the original film, itself inspired by a short story, capturing a similar sense of reflective mood and mystery. But what director Villeneuve (director of ""arrival"", another film based on a short story) brings to the table is a mediative vision that simultaneously captures the alienation (our main character is often alone) and inhumanity of man (human life is a product to be marketed) as well as glimmers of the best of humanity (selflessness, ironically, reflected most clearly by non-humans).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Does the original justice but also dares to be more than just a rehash,"Blade Runner is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It may be my favourite ever actually. So, when after years of rumours it was confirmed that a sequel was too be made I was mostly sceptical. Long overdue sequels fail more often. For every Mad Max: fury road there are a lot more Indiana Jones 4 or ones that fall somewhere in between like Prometheus. When it was announced that Ridley Scott would not return as director some fans probably reacted disappointed, but I was actually positive. If he had really wanted to make a sequel he would have made it earlier. Denis Villeneuve was an excellent choice to take the reins. Prisoners and Sicario were great and I mostly enjoyed Enemy. Then the release of Arrival just made me more confident. I happy to say that Blade Runner 2049 managed to more than live up to the amazing original.What is so great about this new movie is that it does the first one justice while it dares to be more than just a repeat. The story, characters and even the look of the film differs quite a bit from the original. A new filmmaker doing a sequel to a classic might feel pressure to just try and imitate the original creators. But having seen other movies by Villeneuve one sees clearly that he has made the movie like he wanted and not tried to make a Ridley Scott film. I think that even if one did not know you could see that the two movies are made by different filmmakers. The plot is excellent and has the same types of themes as the first one, such as questions of humanity. But the actual story is of a different type than the original. It takes quite a number of twists and it turned out not at all like I had thought it would be. Compared to the first movie this one actually has more plot. The movie has many big actors and they all do great some even with kind of limited screen time. Ryan Gosling is great in the lead. You really feel for his character. Also he is not simply Deckard version 2. Ana de Armas performance deserves mentioning. Everyone knows Harrison Ford is in the movie it's no spoiler. His performance is great and especially it doesn't feel like he's just in the movie for fan pleasing. He seems to put more effort in this role than he has in a long time. The last couple of movies he has felt like he would rather retire. He also doesn't just play Deckard like before but he plays Deckard thirty years later. Things have happened since we saw him last. Enough cannot be said about cinematographer Roger Deakins and his role in the creation of the experience that is this movie. It looks amazing and also amazing in that it's a continuation of the world we saw in the first but still not the same thing again. They have put great detail and thought into the technology in the world. They have really focused on the continuity that the world really feels like the world we saw in the original but thirty years later. I'm so relived that the movie also does not get bogged down in references and call-backs to the original. This movie creates memorable moments of its own not simply by reminding you of all that was great in the first one. I heard there was some problem regarding the composing of the music but none of it shows in the finished movie. Hans Zimmer has created a brilliant score that has the same feel and style as Vangelis but without just reusing his melodies. Some have complained about the length of the movie but that was never an issue for me. There are parts that slow down but I can't see how they could have cut it down without losing stuff and making stuff feel rushed. But some modern audience not familiar with the first one might very likely be bored. This movie is made by people who liked the first one for people who loved the first one. I have already seen it more than once and like the first one it really benefits from more viewings. There is so much more in this movie than meets the eye.OK so finally which movie is the best? Like I've repeatedly stated the movie separated itself form the original enough to be judged just on its own. But if I must choose then the original is still the best. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels I have seen. It lives up to the original Blade Runner while somehow managing the feet of feeling like an amazing movie just on its own.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Perfect mix of futuristic scenery, engrossing soundscapes, drama, action and melancholy","I've now seen BR 2049 two times: First in IMAX and then in a Sony 4k theater. Both times, sound was truly fantastic and imagery was breathtaking. This truly is a masterpiece of futuristic cinematography with matching music and sound.Being a huge fan of the original Blade Runner (especially the Final Cut), I had feared disappointment. But BR 2049 exceeded my wildest expectations. The bleak, rainy atmosphere of future LA from the first movie was rendered beautifully. The landscapes in the other locations was equally awe-inspiring. And the new soundtrack, while somehow understated and perhaps less melodic, reaches a few wonderful climaxes where it reverts back to the original Vangelis themes.I am also delighted by the slow pace. Finally a science fiction movie that gives me time to take all the impressive imagery in. I was engrossed the whole time.I loved how BR 2049 expands on the original story line. Answering questions, while adding a new twist that truly makes us think about the meaning and value of artificial life. And then finally there's the delight of seeing Deckard again.

A worthy masterful sequel to the original masterpiece!,"It was the long-awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction classic, ""Blade Runner"" that grabbed me unlike any other film in 2017. As I accumulated four theatrical sojourns watching ""Blade Runner 2049"" I found a deeper and richer experience with each viewing, one that, to me, even surpassed the original as serious art. The reason for this was undoubtedly due to Scott entrusting the renowned Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve (who had made ""Incendies"", ""Prisoners"", ""Sicario"" and the previous year's ""Arrival"") when making his version to honor the original film's world and philosophical themes while laying claim to his own poetic vision and personal style.Taking place 30 years after Deckard and Rachael had emerged from the elevator to leave the smog and overpopulation of 2019 Los Angeles, this new film follows a recent model replicant (with a normal human lifespan) called 'K' (played perfectly by an appropriately imperturbable Ryan Gosling) as he investigates a growing uprising when he unearths the remains of a once-pregnant replicant, something that leads him not only into mysterious territory in which he discovers the now reclusive Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford in one of his most nuanced performances), but also leads him through a journey into his own identity. Darker and more sparse than the original, ""Blade Runner 2049"" dives into a more nihilistic milieu where the earth's digital and technological systems have been wiped out from an ecological disaster known as the Blackout, and the air and water have become toxic, plants and animals have gone extinct, and there has been mass migration to urban centers with the rich moving to off-world colonies. Even sunlight is only visible through thick layers of smog and clouds, and various cities like San Diego have become large garbage disposal areas. Villeneuve, now at the peak of his directorial powers, moves us inexorably throughout this elaborately-detailed world for a full 164 minutes, something for which the film's cynical detractors have criticized, but I praise him for having the courage to allow its story to develop in a carefully measured fashion, taking the time to allow its willing and patient viewers to be engulfed into its world view. I liken it to turning over one's self to the listening of a Wagner opera like ""Parsifal"" in which time seems to stop as one is encompassed completely by another place, another time -- and after its long viewing I seemed to awaken as if having submitted to a dream, emerging somewhat reborn and more enlightened with knowledge of the human experience. And that is what this and the original film are really about. Underneath its marvelously detailed science fiction trappings with its state-of-the-art production design and special effects (often eschewing CGI for authentically-constructed sets and realistic miniatures), and heightened to a level of unmatched beauty by the cinematography of Roger Deakins, the film is really a thoughtful meditation on what makes us human.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I think the most impressive thing about it was its commitment to building on the mythology set forth by the original. It managed to expand on the original and give us answers to what happened to characters after it in ways that felt clever, fresh, and still faithful to it. It manages to be about the continuation of certain events in the first film while creating a new fascinating character at its core and manages to tell the new character's arc brilliantly. To reiterate, it's very well written, managing to avoid the clichés that usually transpire in films like this. Villeneuve has quickly become one of the best filmmakers currently working and this is only another example of his talent. However, the original was much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Science fiction gold.,"Denis Villenuve was tasked with the impossible-seeming feat of refreshing and revitalising Blade Runner, considered to be an untouchable classic. And goddamn, he did it.As I've expressed before, I adore the original Blade Runner, and I was interested as to how you could make a sequel thirty years later and still keep the story new, interesting whilst simultaneously cohesive and clear. It's a completely different era now, and Blade Runner was the film that kicked off most of modern science fiction as we know it, as well as revitalising the neo-noir genre, in my opinion. Needless to say, the bar was pretty high, and this film surpassed every single one of my expectations.One thing that I'd really like to congratulate Villeneuve on is the use of miniatures. This film was released in 2017, in an age where it's so easy to just slap a green screen somewhere and call it day, and leave the VFX artists to deal with it Blender. While of course, there were obviously some parts that were CGI assisted (and done incredibly well), I really love that in a true testament to the original, the 80's processes and techniques were employed to create that same effect as was first created almost forty years ago.I like 2049 because of the way that it takes the original concept of Blade Runner, which, to start with, is quite simple - replicants, ""more human than human"" - and takes it in directions I would have never anticipated. The original was a relatively straightforward, new-noir plot, but the way that the plot here was fleshed out, keeping you guessing at every moment and never revealing quite too much, all while simultaneously never keeping it too complicate to the point you lose it - that's quite a feat. By revealing information at the same pace that protagonist K learns of it, the film always keeps us just a little bit in the dark, always guessing, and always thinking. Yes, it's long. But if it was shorter, a lot of that story would have been left on the cutting room floor and therefore resulted in a rushed and confusing mess. And just like the original, it obviously takes its time. But like I've said before, I think that by doing so, it allows the viewer to take in the visuals even better as well as considering the story to a deeper level than if the entire film has just been snappy action.If the original was defined by black, 2049 moves into a more colourful direction. At first, this might seem jarring - how can you have Blade Runner without rain-drenched Los Angeles? - but upon viewing the film, you can see that once again Roger Deakins has worked magic. The oranges of hazy Las Vegas, the pinky-purple of the street-sized holograms, the muted yellows of the archives, and every shade in between, bring a fresh spin on Blade Runner whilst simultaneously, somehow, keeping enough balance with the dark blacks to still make it *feel* like a neo-noir film in spirit.In conclusion, I've got to say, this is a rare instance of a sequel being jus as good as the original, and I think it's 100% worth watching for fans of the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A slow burn but phenomenal,"I totally get the mixed reviews. I watched this movie twice. The first time shortly after its release. I was bored stiff and slept through most of it. The second time was two years later. I had even forgotten that I had seen the movie before but remembered shortly after the early scenes. For me, the major difference the second time around was that i caught the early explanation about replicants so i watched the movie with greater context. With that clarity, I could follow the absorbing storyline while appreciating the fantastic set, the sci-fi effects, and the minimalism of the dialogue (sparse and slow but weighty). It is truly a phenomenal work; I'm not surprised it won an Oscar. If you were one of those disappointed, I would advise watching again from the very beginning and taking time to savor the movie as a cohesive artistic interpretation not a shallow action movie. You may be surprised how much enjoy the movie once you have the right frame of reference.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Sci-fi masterpiece,"From the first opening boom till the last moment this film looks stunning and just puts you in a grim, depressing and nasty world. Visually it looks stunning and the soundtrack is really helping the mood of this film.I always felt one of the most important themes of the first movie was love and love not knowing boundaries. I think this movie is about compassion and humane treatment. Rare themes these days in blockbuster movies.Sci-fi movies like this are rare. No predictable action sci-fi plot here. Blade Runner 2049 is a great sci-fi novel in a movie format.Some people have complains about the length of the film. This is one of those films where every scene just has to be there with a pace that fits the film perfectly. I watched it twice and both times I just lost sense of time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Almost Perfect,"It's often been said that the greatest problem with the internet is that morons can go forth and share their opinion and have it circulated and shared just as widely as geniuses. The problem is definitely abundant in the reviews for Blade Runner 2049.2049 is a long, deep film. If the depth of your entertainment derives only from what is on screen in any given frame. This movie is not for you. The quality of 2049 is that the entertainment occurs in your own mind and is only stimulated by what is on screen.What could it be like to think and feel just like a human being, but know that you are invalid; synthetic? If a person thinks and feels just like a human being and yet is manufactured, where is the soul? What then does it mean to be human, if anything? What are the implications of a love so sincere that can be cloned and repeated with scientific exactness an infinity of times? These and many more are the questions you'll be confronted with - if you are predisposed to think at all - during the run-time of 2049.While the original was an 80's action flick with the mere slick perspiration of philosophical depth, 2049 reaches the true potential of the high-concept original. 2049 can afford to be slow. It is all the better for it. 2049 envelops you
in to a believable, detailed construction of the future and and affords you the time and space to mull it's trappings and implications.Technically it is a masterpiece. Visually and aurally the movie is pitch-perfect. The flat affect of Gosling was an appropriate and insightful choice. Each actor plays their role very well. There are a couple of weak moments. Particularly the sexy scene.. but for as long as humans make movies there will be flaws in movies. Relatively speaking, the movie is a 10.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A choppy film with unfulfilled promise,"Moments of meaning and brilliance interspersed with indecipherable, seemingly random scenes. In parts, this seems an intentional device to create confusion with the promise of clarity in later scenes - a common device in Sci-Fi and Fabtasy films. At other times, the confusion betrays itself as a loss of direction with no real point. Silence and wandering take up a good portion of the film. In all, I found it to be a ponderous attempt at a sequel story but with great acting and some ideas which never fully develop and are definitely not enough to compensate for pace problems, confusion and contradicting actions.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Blade Rambler,"Extremely slow paced, far too light on action and packed with random, disjointed scenes that bear little meaning to a wafer thin plot.I was expecting something along the lines of iRobot but it doesn't even come close to that. The main character hardly says a word throughout the entire film and spends most of his time wandering around aimlessly.An hour in and I was wondering why Harrison Ford was listed as a headline act, but stick with it because he does eventually appear, albeit very much in a supporting role.The only positive I can take from this feature is some more than decent special effects which do a good job of portraying a distopian future Los Angeles.Unfortunately though all that work is wasted on a film that goes nowhere fast. There are a few muted action sequences but, like hard rain falling on bone dry ground, they punctuate such a long drought in picking up the pace, that their effect is limited at best.I wouldn't go as far to say this is one to avoid, but certainly don't watch if you're feeling a bit tired as you will struggle to stay awake.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A true masterpiece,"I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this. That's what I said about the original Blade Runner.It was long but none of it felt wasted. It held nearly true to the iconic original yet technology escalated the visual aspects far beyond what seemed cinematically possible. The soundtrack all important was equally as mysterious and the brutality of the future was brought to the forefront in a way that didn't disappoint. Harrison Ford nailed it in his sequel roll and Ryan Gosling proved an effective successor to the beloved Daekert. Edward James Olmos was there as well however fleeting, which delighted me. I could have delivered a full 10 if it t were a bit lower tech and there had been more memorable a script. The first delivered more iconic sound bites yet for what this was I am totally blown away by each and every character and each and every gorgeous reference to the original version. A beautiful and thoughtful film and an enormous success no matter how you slice it. This deserves to be watched and studied.

"Meh - if you liked the original, you will probably like this; if not, maybe rent at home.","I watched this movie with friends on the first night it was released in Canada. It was surprisingly not busy at the theatre, but that may have correlated to the weekend also being Thanksgiving.If you watched the original Blade Runner (1982) you are probably going to like this movie but I do not imagine it having the same appeal as the original. I think one of the reasons why Blade Runner was such a big hit/cult classic back in the 80s was because this may have been one of the first science fiction movies to tell this kind of story along with all the ""advances"" in technology so well. Blade Runner 2049 does not have anything new, special, or different from any other sci-fi movie that has been released in the past 10 years.Now I did not watch the original until hours before I watched Blade Runner 2049, and I will admit, the original was mostly boring and it was hard to sit through. This trend also happens in Blade Runner 2049, because, well it's a 2 hour and 45 minute movie! I enjoyed the story, the cinematography, the music was AMAZING, and the acting was good. My one question to the director is, ""WHY DOES EVERYONE WALK SO SLOW IN 2049?"" Some scene's dragged a bit, and the first hour of the movie seemed to be spent explaining the backstory of Blade Runners and the world in 2049; which is OK because I understood exactly why and what was happening. For those that are expecting an action-packed, adrenaline rush, non-stop gun fire and on the edge of your seat actionthis is not for you. It may be that as a society we are now expecting the comic book/superhero kind of movies that are non-stop action the entire time, with a mush of underdeveloped characters that just end of together someone and become best friends; so if you want something a little more deep and developed, Blade Runner 2049 may be up your alley.Blade Runner 2049 will be loved by a very specific small niche audience, and others may just feel ""meh"" about the movie. I think this movie is good, and I'm glad I saw it, but because it was almost 3 hours long, it may be a stay-at-home kind of movie (where you can pause and go grab a snack, or go to the washroom).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Who would have guessed Blade Runner would get the sequel it deserves.,"But it did, Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel we didn't know we needed.I've been avoiding any media in regards to this movie until i saw it today. I just realized there's 3 shorts for it out, but watching it after was interesting too, allowed me to fill a few gaps, such as who's the blind guy for instance.I went in with zero expectations, I've been so disappointed with Hollywood lately, with these trends of remakes and sequels, I went in borderline cynical about it. It didn't help that just before the movie they played a trailer for the DC ""avengers"" and another pacific rim??From the first frame and the first strings of music of Blade Runner 2049 my eye lids just opened wide, this is one visually amazing and striking movie, so many hidden meanings in the dialog, in the set pieces, in how they light the shots, in the emotion of the music, the nuances of the acting, it's a pretty masterful movie in nearly every regarded for me, apart from minor things.I didn't feel Blade Runner needed a sequel at all, quite the contrary, but you know what, I felt that every person that worked on this film had a huge respect for the original movie, i really felt they worked on this and knew they had to honor the artists that came before them, and it shows.I'm considering going to imax to watch it again if i find the time, some of the scenes here need to be experienced in a huge screen and with a killer sound system. My inner nerd is pretty damn satisfied tonight!Congratulations to Denis Villeneuve, he should be proud he made a masterpiece, don't worry about all the headlines regarding this movie flopping in the box office, because Blade Runner 2049 will sell for 30 years, just like the original did, this is how cult classics work.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Awesome,"I saw the first blade runner at age 13, and it had a profound effect on me. This film manages to continue and expand that sense of wonder. Thank God that Ridley was only executive producer. After his truly awful efforts with the Alien franchise recently, I am glad he was not front row centre on this one. many, many other reviewers have said it : Denis Villeneuve does a really good job at directing this. The cinematography surpasses the first film, and the CGI is restrained and unnoticeable, as it should be. Hampton Fancher's script is well thought out and considered. My only small gripe is that Zimmer's soundtrack is a bit jarring in some scenes, with too much crescendo and fanfare, where more restrained, orchestral overtones would have proved more memorable. But my bias for Vangelis' superb original is perhaps coming through. Otherwise, best film I have seen in ages. Well done to all for not ruining my childhood memories !!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Way to dark and depressing for my taste.,"As a movie this is a very good movie. The scenery, the acting, the colors etc. are of a very high technical standard. To me personally however, this movie is much too dark and depressing for my taste.I cannot say that I am surprised that the movie is dark. The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.As I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.The acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.Unfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.

Every performance is fantastic with the highlight being Gosling. The story was fresh while still paying respect to the original.

Pathetic. Blade Runner for the new generation is as flawed as any other modern Hollywood movie.,"The original Blade Runner was a film primarily about visuals, it was not surprising that in the early 1980s, Ridley Scott had no rival in the visual department. Blade Runner was mostly a visual movie, with little or no character development. It was a rich film about culture and visual aesthetics. The film was pioneer enough to influence several generations of filmmakers, but also about TV series, anime, among others about a futuristic look. In other words, the greatest strength of that film was to insert people in that visual. It is impressive, that Blade Runner influenced several generations, but Blade Runner 2049, does not influence anything. Nothing in the visual department captures the spectator's imagination. Denis Villeneuve fails roundly in this department, everything in 2049 is copied and recycled from other people's works. Here there is no imagination, but purely a copy. Blade Runner influenced, 2049 did not influence anything or anyone. I'll just say one example. The director of the film created a young Sean Young, using visual effects. Ironically, this has already happened in Terminator Salvation with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Another unnecessary sequel to a futuristic film with strong sci-fi elements made in the 80's.That brings up the question, who had the sad idea of creating a sequel to Blade Runner if you can not create something visually interesting and if the movie itself was a box office flop in 1982. The answer is simple, it's about the money. Nowadays in Hollywood, the studios are desperate to create franchises, which can attract people as if they were drug addicts, to go to the movies regularly. Warner Bros. already tried in 2015 with Mad Max Road Fury, and now tries to do with Blade Runner in 2017. It's all about money. Instead of trying to create something new, Hollywood studios try to create franchises, based on pre-existing films, because it's so much faster, easier and there's no financial risk. This is because movie budgets are constantly growing. And of course Blade Runner in its releases for home entertainment, whether on VHS, DVD or Blu Ray, has always had solid sales. Blade Runner was a hit on TV as well. Like The Shawshank Redemption or Fight Club, films such as Blade Runner were a box office flops, but hits in other media. People kept talking about these movies, even after they were released in theaters. You can not catch a lightning bolt twice in a row. This is because 2049 brings nothing new for people to talk about. It's a passable, forgettable film just for making money.This is why, Denis Villeneuve not only fails to create an interesting visual experience. As a film, Blade Runner 2049 crashes in all other departments. Not only that, but Blade Runner never needed a sequel. The story to tell was all told in the first film. Blade Runner never needed a sequel to expand the story, just as movies like Chinatown, L.A Confidential, or Casablanca don't need a sequel. In a sense, this film is almost a remake of the first, done in an amateur way in the sense of modern blockbusters. The film begins with an unnecessary setup between the characters Ryan Gosling and Dave Bautista. From that moment on, Denis Villeneuve began to put the typical gestures and mannerisms of modern movie scripts. I say of course, there has to be the unnecessary revolution/revolt against the system (the similarity that existed with The Matrix), but, unlike the original, everything here is in excess.
That is one of the biggest mistakes in the script of this film, is to transform a male film with a strong focus on sci-fi (sci-fi is not a genre that the female audience is interested) with useless dramatic elements. You know the same mistake that Denis Villeneuve did last year with Arrival, he had the audacity to do with the sequel of Blade Runner. Let's be clear, if I want a strong dramatic film, I see Schindler's List. If I want to see a male sci- fi, I see Aliens, Terminator or Blade Runner. Do not try to mix the two things Denis Villeneuve. The movie loses its tone. Not to mention, the silly lines of dialogue (and what you expected from the guy - Michael Green - who wrote Green Lantern), stupid I know. Despite that, the original film leaves room for the imagination about that universe and its characters (e.g: Jared Leto's character killing a replicant, just to make a point, or whatever). Who was the villain at the end of the first film, Deckard for doing his job or Roy Batty who killed people, however he wanted to live. In Blade Runner 2049, there is nothing to think about, everything is black and white.This new film leaves no room for imagination, everything here is explained, as if it were an equation - at the end of the second act a character reveals to the character ""Joe/K"" that he was not the chosen one (as in many other sci-fi films) and the end itself is only a generic twist and totally out of context (as in Arrival) with a character that appeared only one scene (but do not worry about, the obligatory third movie is already being planned) in the original Sean Young's character was quite a while before the end of the movie. In contrast the film has totally useless scenes that only serve to increase unnecessarily the extension of the film itself.I'm not going to write anything else, about this useless movie, that comment on the final battle between the characters of Ryan Gosling and Sylvia Hoeks. She also knows Kung-fu and says stupid one- liners (""I am the best"" among many, or whatever). Trash lines of dialogue, we have here. To talk about the character of Sylvia Hoeks that does not reach the feet of Roy Batty. While in the original, the scene of the rain had a sense, because the character of Rutger Hauer wanted to live, this is why the scene is soon iconic. In this new movie there is one fight scene, just to look ""badass"". Once again, Hollywood had feminized a great and good villain into a woman to appeal to the female audience (say hello to Ghostbusters 2016). Not only that, the film treats women as sexual objects (the stupid hologram of the woman with pink hair), prostitutes or with violence. A film without its own identity, the film is not meat or fish. Incidentally, not even filmmakers know what they want.

Best film of 2017 so far,"Blade Runner 2049 was my most anticipated release this year so I went in with high hopes. The original is a great sci-fi and a visual wonder, it wasn't without flaws so I felt there was plenty room to improve over it. The sequel is better for the most part. It was an intense disturbing film full of ideas and interesting visuals that bring the dystopian world to life even better than the original.The story is very simple but fleshed out so that the viewer can be invested in every scene. You may be able to see what's coming but the way it unfolds is satisfying. Below the surface you can also see the themes of how toxic the abusive capitalist culture around women, advertising and just about everything we consume is. Its a sad depiction of what could be the future. The main themes of the film stay consistent resulting in an emotional ending that left me very satisfied. My only critique is the villain felt a little underdeveloped which is OK for me because I really don't like Jared Leto anyway (but that's just me). There were also a few moments that had me wondering why certain bad decisions were made by the villains but its all forgivable.I wasn't aware that Jóhann Jóhannsson had dropped out from scoring the film until after I saw it but Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal. The score complements every scene perfectly and conveys the feelings of the main character really well. I'm just a little disappointed thinking of what could have been if Jóhann Jóhannsson had made the score. The visuals are breathtaking with some of the best CGI I've ever seen. I heard models were used for some shots and I honestly don't know what was practical and what was CGI so well done to the effects team. Oscar worthy direction, cinematography and effects for sure.The acting was simply incredible all around, from small parts like Dave Bautista's character to the lead, Ryan Gosling. Everyone gave an astounding amount of depth and commitment to their characters. There's also a interesting if not toxic relationship between Gosling and an AI played by Ana de Armas that could have been terrible but it is truly an interesting look into his character and it's played out well. Armas also does a great job playing the AI, making us wonder what she truly is. Part of me thinks Jared Leto was just being Jared Leto, but again that's just me being bias. His villain is highly disturbing but there isn't much reason behind it, (going back to my critique) so he's actually the least interesting character. But again, the journey of our main character is more important in a film that is already 163 min. His transformation is amazing and will not disappoint.Blade Runner 2049 is not perfect but it sure came close. I find it better than the first and a highly involving film that left me with plenty to talk about with people who had also seen it. The slow pacing might not be for everyone so I'll say that if you liked the first one then I'd recommend it. If you're new to it and interested then I'd highly recommend watching the original first as well. 2049 goes next to sequels like Aliens and T2, a rare gem we only get every few years or even decades.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beyond Blade Runner,"I'm a huge fan of the original 1982 Blade Runner, and as a rule, an even bigger fan of Ridley Scott. I admit I was a bit disappointed when I heard that Ridley Scott's role in Blade Runner 2049 was consigned to Executive Producer with Denis Villeneuve taking the helm. I have nothing against Villeneuve, and I quite enjoyed Arrival, my only prior experience with his films (No, I haven't gotten around to Sicario, yet). My disappointment was probably rooted in my emotional connection to the original, and my fear that no one would honor its core like Scott would. Following the opening sequence, my concerns were allayed. I won't add to the fray as to whether 1982's Blade Runner needed a sequel, but in the age of sequels and reboots representing lack of original thought, Blade Runner 2049 continues the story and expounds upon it with a complexity I never expected. All this is done while still honoring the moral implications, imagery, symbolism, and overall genetic imprint of the original. Frankly, I'm not sure Scott could have made a film like this, but it couldn't have been made without his influence.Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's brooding, yet sometimes startlingly percussive soundtrack appropriately echoed necessary themes from Vangelis' futuristic original while expanding to a complexity deserving of the film. Additionally, while the original soundtrack can be replayed and enjoyed absent from its intended medium, 2049 is so tightly woven into the sound effects, I doubt it will have that same replay-ability. The electronic and artificial nature establishes the brutish impact of the human element on the planet almost before the imagery does. A genius move is the unsettling use of a brief, but recognizable excerpt from Sergey Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. Its having been relegated to little more than an advertising jingle or ringtone. Fragmented performances by Sinatra and Elvis are equally unsettling and alien amidst the dystopian landscape that is clearly a broken Earth.The performances from the ensemble were at the level I expect in a film of this caliber. While no single actor stole the show, there were a few surprises. For one, I had no idea Dave Bautista had this range. While his screen time is brief, it's impactful and effective. Ryan Gosling typically stars in films outside of my preferences, but his performance as a tortured soul trying to maintain his humanity was well done. I was pleased to see Harrison Ford's role being more than a trivial throwback. In lesser hands, playing the role of man who's seen and been through too much but still trying to hold it together, can easily come off as a crazy old coot. Ford made this role believable not as the Deckard from the original, but rather as someone he most certainly was destined to become. Robin Wright did an outstanding performance portraying a hardened cop tightly constrained by bureaucracy struggling to do the right thing---pride, defiance, and defeat moved across her visage in an uncanny fashion. Despite his fabled off-screen method acting antics, I suspect a large part of Jared Leto's performance was left unseen (pun intended). His presence was noteworthy but too brief. It may well have been truncated in the interest of time or possibly to add to the character's mystique. Sylvia Hoeks was unknown to me prior to this film, but I'm surprised I haven't seen more of her. She beautifully portrays a steely cold façade holding back a driven, trembling fury. Her character is likely be defined as the female equivalent of Rutger Hauer's ""Roy Batty"", but she's a bit more unhinged but focused all at the same time. Like other fans, I'd quietly hoped to see more of the original cast in some fashion, but that's why I'm not a screenwriter. As expected there were a couple of ""cameos"" that were unnecessary along with an ill-conceived special effects sorcery stunt that fell short, but nothing on the level of Rogue One's Tarkin and Leia.I saw this in IMAX presentation, and I'm glad I did. I'm usually drawn to IMAX presentations for the expansive imagery, and the 1.9:1 aspect ratio certainly contributed to the expansive nature of the film. However, the sound was an equal draw for me. I've already read about some complaints with respect to muddy dialogue in which the soundtrack seemed to drown out voices. To those I propose your issue is with your theater, as I noticed none of this at the AMC 14 in Tyler, TX. In fact, it's been quite some time since I've gone to a film in which the LFE (low-frequency effects) rattled my chest while I could still hear the male and female voices with exceptional clarity. One notable scene involves the viewer alternating between drowning in a body of water only to surface intermittently to the sound of pounding rain, gunfire and distressed voices---all of which was clear and effectively immersive.The question is who will enjoy this film. Formulaically speaking, a sequel's appeal to its original's fan base is probably largely related to its similarity to the same. In the case of Blade Runner 2049, it's not that simple. This will depend on what it is about 1982's Blade Runner that attracted you, and you may not even be able to define that. It is certainly possible to appreciate Blade Runner 2049 without having seen the original, but it will be a very different film for you. Even average sci-fi fans may take issue with the prolonged brooding and the 2 hr 44 min runtime, while others will bask in it and want more. Time will tell if Blade Runner 2049 endures like its predecessor. I will be viewing this at least once more in IMAX while it enjoys its theatrical run. Then I look forward to a proper home media release in which I fully anticipate a few Blade Runner marathons down the road.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Original Blade Runner was really one amazing Vangelis ""music video""","did you not know that Mr. Villeneuve ;-) An intricate emotional, atmospheric and philosophical journey.Blade Runner 2049 emulates some of the universe, but falls extremely short on the above mentioned elements. It's unevenly paced, poorly edited, like a string of individual scenes from different movies, with only little connection or common thread. Sometimes quiet and then suddenly extremely loud !? Slow scenes can be amazing if you put substance in them that elicit thoughts, emotions or drive the story forward – this was just ""slow doing nothing"" in many scenes and therefore boring and long. Some scenes are extremely beautiful and well-made but others look like they are from another movie.And making the blade runners into ""2D"" killer- or adult robots is just sad. I love Ryan Gosling, but 3 hours of Ryan Gosling playing Ryan Gosling is a bit too much. I just did not care for anyone in the movie!The blatant product placement was like ""flag scenes"" in the 80ties and 90ties, awkward and reminding the audience that You are for sale same problem in Sicario sponsored by the tobacco industry ;-)Please make Directors cut cut cut.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
From Descartes to Kafka,"Iwas very excited about BR2049, especially when I heard that Villeneuve is the director.
He created impressive scenes, full of bizarre and wonderful details like the ""basic test"", the dog and the holograms from the sixties/seventies in Deckards home, the threesome between replicants plus hologram, etc.But something is missing: A good story, not only intellectual and logical but also moving.
The searches and fights of Joe K. in BR2049 leads to nothing and nowhere, 
If Villenueve is brave enough to present us an artificial hero and let us walk mainly in his shoes for over 2 hours, then let him win, give the audience something to be happy about.
This doesnt necessarily need a flat happy ending. In Ridley Scotts BR the replicant Roy shows all his hero abilities in the last scenes: Saving Deckards life , showing empathy, overcomimg his melancholy and accepting his own death.Indeed more human than the humans.
Joe K's melancholy just ends in static depression. He is on a wrong path from the beginning. Maybe the story of Blade Runner was already told to the end in Ridley Scott's movie, Villeneuve needed all his artistic power to squeeze this respectable work out of the given storyline",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The greatest boring visual masterpiece,"A huge sci-fi fan, and fan of the original, I saw it last night after a couple of friends told me it was a 'must see'.I must be missing something, but half way through I was fidgeting in my seat, wishing it would be over soon.It may well be a cinematic masterpiece, but it just seemed to lack any entertainment value, it was overly long, dull, sluggish and too loud at many points.I can watch some movies over and over, even years after release, but once is enough for this one.

Technically A Masterpiece,"Whether or not you agree with a sequel to the original classic or not you must pay homage to Ridley Scott's absolutely incredible use of special effects for their ability to truly create an immersive world for a cinematic experience. Clearly following the logical progression from the previous installment set approximately 40 years prior to this film Scott uses his visuals in such a way as you feel that the world of Blade Runner has simply aged appropriately.This film was billed in it's previews as a Harrison Ford vehicle, however, his role is not nearly at the forefront until well past the halfway mark of the film. Ryan Gosling plays his role perfectly as does Jared Leto in this underappreciated appearance. All subsequent secondary characters are well designed and thought out and the plot, arguably, is quite intriguing.In regards to all the failures in reboots we have seen in the past five years this stands out among the ones that are done correctly and at a time appropriate for their revival.A film well worth watching even at the run time of 164 minutes.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually Stunning Art Film with Threadbare Plot,"No spoilers promise. Others have commented on the excellent direction and stunning cinematography so I won't repeat all of that. I will say that this movie seems inspired by Children of Men, Her, film noir, even Citizen Kane and of course the original Bladerunner. This film does stands on its own. And it's worth your time. The sets are gorgeous and I'm sorry but green screen CGI sucks when it's overused (looking at you George Lucas). Villeneuve understands that you have to give actors a context in which to interact with their environment. Gosling's K is so central to the film that you wish some of the supporting actors were given more time to develop. But you're not going to get too much warmth here. It's a bleak landscape populated by people full of existential angst. Like the original much of the dystopia centers around societal collapse. But unlike the original you don't get the sense that the rich are leaving in droves ""off world"" to Eden planets while the poor remain to cope with a hellish Earth. It's implied of course but there's so much more claustrophobia here and the sense that everyone – rich and poor alike – are all trapped in perpetual shadow and rain. For me the film is at its best when it shows us how technology can isolate us from ourselves and each other. The big weakness here is the plot. A central plot point, revealed relatively early in the movie, is supposed to be so game-changing if word got out humankind would revolt. This plot point drives the antagonist. But it just didn't seem like such a big deal for me. In a world that feels on the edge of collapse the complications revealed in the plot wouldn't seem like much of a game changer were I to live in that world.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolute Cinematic Masterpiece,When I competes my first viewing of us this film I was shocked! I had never seen a movie so perfect and having a ton of replay value. I think I watched it again the same day if not the next. Bladerunner 2049 has everything you need in a great science fiction movie.

The continuation of a classic that should become a classic !,"One of the greatest continuations of a classic , difficult to spend 30 years ( in reality and in fantasy ) and continue a story with a creative script with a lot of originality respecting the entire universe and bringing new ingredients .With a wonderful direction Denis Villeneuve had the great courage to continue a classic, for some a slow film, for others a work with sensational dialogues, delivering everything at the right point, and with for shedule that will become plot twist .A film that deals with the human capacity to ""create"" beings by bioengineering for slavery , commerce or even for their personal pleasures and humanizing them with feelings that touch the public, as in the second and third act of the film where the protagonist goes looking for his father.We have a film with a great soundtrack, with direction and script note 10, but photography is something immense, superior, to fill your eyes with a lot of ambience and depth regardless of where you are occurring, in the cold city full of contrast luminous signs of great marks, with a lot of miscegenation of people and a lot of rain, snow, with vehicle lights making the silhouette of the characters dark or inside the Wallace corporation totally ""orange"" reflections of water ... a film that makes you want to watch several times, a film that makes you want to take random pictures to reveal how you frames and hang on the walls a continuation of a classic that should become a classic!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The 'buzz' you heard about was actually people snoring,The impossible- someone made a boring Blade Runner movie.,,Anonymous,Mystery
A very slow paced disappointment,"Thirty years after the events from the first movie, another Blade Runner makes a staggering discovery which makes him investigate what turns out to be a very deep mystery which is somehow linked to the one from the first installment. Along the way, many secrets will be uncovered although it won't be an easy task, especially when there are several parties which want to know the truth.It's a movie which continues the events from its predecessor but it also does it in almost the same way, which is quite a disappointment to be honest. It manages to maintain its slow pace without any hesitation, making it even more tiresome than the previous movie. The plot is indeed a bit more interesting, but not enough, while the new characters seem to have a bit more depth. You still don't get to care about them, but it is marginally better regarding this aspect.It is also boring for a good period of time, having a tendency to over-extend each sequence much more that it would have been necessary to transmit the intended idea. Thus, it ended up as a very lengthy movie which could have told basically the same story in about two hours, if it would have left behind all the fillers and the exaggerated description of every scene, which can only induce boredom.Visually speaking, this movie is absolutely gorgeous. Its special effects are excellent and play a very important role in creating a very enjoyable dark atmosphere of what it looked like a post- apocalyptic city. Unfortunately, they simply aren't enough to raise this one from mediocrity, as they failed also in the first installment.The actors seem to do a good job but the plot and its sluggish rhythm simply drag it down. It's simply hard to enjoy a movie which seems to be made by a sloth, which bores you to death and then, from time to time, it realizes that it should bring something interesting to wake you up, cycling this way until the end, which, by the way, leaves plenty of room for yet another sequel which I truly hope will not exist.In my opinion, both movies are a big let-down, considering what worlds they had created and how spectacular they look, only to fill them with below average stories, told in the way they are told which simply do not provide interest, emotion or satisfaction.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The first proper ""science fiction"" film with a big budget to come out in a LONG time","Sci-fi is everywhere these days, but real science fiction, the sort that plays with big ideas in a way you've never seen before, is hard to come by... especially in big budget movies. I'm talking about films like the Matrix or the original Blade Runner, which create worlds unlike anything seen before that are built upon scintillating ethical quandaries. There are still shows (like Black Mirror) and books that do this kind of thing, but this is probably the first blockbuster film released in my lifetime to achieve what this on the same scale as the classics. There are a couple of scenes in particular that explored concepts I had never seen before in a way that could never have been done in an earlier or lower-budgeted movie.Speaking of things were done in the film, the cinematography is absolutely outstanding. For those not in the know, the Director of Photography on this film (Roger Deakins) has been nominated for an Oscar 13 times... and has never won. When you watch this film, you can tell he's pushing real hard for this to be the time he wins. Every single shot is stunning, to the degree where you can almost feel the furious determination behind it. Watching Blade Runner 2049 feels like being punched in the face for three hours by an art gallery with a vendetta. At this point, if Deakins doesn't win, the Academy is being just downright cruel. Even funnier than the sheer madness of the cinematography is the critical reaction to this whole situation; the reviews seem to talk more about Deakins than Denis Villeneuve; the director of the film!The movie is nearly three hours long and pretty slow paced, yet I didn't feel a minute of it. I was surprised when it ended; I was sure there had to be another hour at least. That's how engrossing the film was. I think people should do their very best to avoid spoilers because the experience of watching the film unravel for the first time was absolutely brilliant. For once the studio managed to restrain themselves, and not give away the whole movie in the trailers. In fact, I was pleased to discover not only that all the cliché dialogue and moments in the entire film had been put in the trailer, but also that those moments had a much less conventional meaning once put into the context of the film. Ryan Gosling in particular had me worried with his completely bland and emotionless face in the trailers, but the in the movie he showed more range, justified the moments from the trailers, and created one of the most interesting characters in the movie.The only element of the film that I found to be somewhat lacking was the sound design. Vangelis' sweeping soundtrack was one of the most iconic aspects of the original film, creating half the atmosphere of the world. That music is notably absent from this film with one notable exception late in the film. It is replaced by a generic, forgettable, and at times ill-fitting suspense soundtrack with one or two synth sounds thrown in as a vain attempt to recapture Vangelis' magic.In short, Denis Villeneuve has crafted a true science-fiction masterpiece, a film that somehow manages to rise to the level of the original film and stand alone as an impressive achievement in its own right.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A visual masterpiece but fails to be a masterpiece,"Visually stunning and perfectly balanced with sounds effects and music. I like slow movies, especially when the story evolves gradually with a beautiful atmosphere.But I found some parts of the movie unbalanced or unnecessary long... I also have the feeling that the end was wrapped up too quickly comparing to the rest of the movie.It is developing a story for 2h30 minutes and then suddenly in less than 15 minutes things happens in a hurry. I have the impression that the blue-ray version will be longer so the transition between some scenes will be more coherent.It should have been 20 minutes shorter OR 20 minutes longer to be more consistent. I can not give more detail to not spoil the plot.I liked it but I can not give 9/10. As an example from the same director I found The Arrival more balanced.The cast is great.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like tears in rain: Deep and impacting homage to the original,"I have to concede that I was wrong on this movie. I have just watched it for the second time and now am conceding that it is an exceptional film, having at first been disappointed. I guess like the first film you need to watch this more than once to fully enjoy it, but I'm sure there will also be plenty of people who enjoyed it from the first watch.I'm a devotee to the original movie, and a sequel filled me with some dread. Concerned of what they were to do with the sequel, the storyline is admittedly quite heavy. The idea of replicant reproduction and its existential impact on the world is not exactly something I'd ever thought of before. Again as with the original, we are at the coalface of a future world, which in 2049 has destroyed its environment and is held together by technology. The world has progressed, but mankind hasn't.Our lead (Ryan Gosling) is excellent as the lonely man with only his avatar girlfriend for company who as a Blade Runner has stumbled upon a mystery that he has to investigate for himself as much as the authorities.The film is very long, it's very beautiful but give it a chance and you'll be engrossed. Just make sure you make a lot of time for it, as unlike its predecessor it's a long viewing with a lot to try to understand. A myriad of characters in this mostly amoral world who despite having power are emotionally unsatisfied. That's one crux of the film, but you'll find various other themes.It hasn't to date and will not have the impact of its predecessor, but it doesn't appear to attempt to do so. For cerebral viewing, truly it is up there with some of the best in many a year, and that is the best compliment you can give it. Another truly special movie.If you don't enjoy it first time, then please like me give it time to watch it again and you'll soon find that you will change your mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's okay,"Blade Runner 2049. Saw it Saturday night in Xtreme screen at Hoyts Woden. No spoilers.Short: It was okay. Long, slow, with some gorgeous visuals. An interesting plot that extends beyond the original film in a new and inventive way. Ryan Gosling is a terrible actor. Zero facial expressions or emotion. Harrison Ford is old. Musical score is way, way inferior to Vangelis' work on the original. It's a good sequel, but an average film.Long: The story is interesting, and expands on the original film in a good way. My friend found it predictable at times, but I was intrigued for most of it. It's a long film, and I'm not sure that was a good thing. It really fails to build the world that the original created, although there are a few throw-back shots that you'll recognise if you're paying attention. Aside from a few random sparse scenes, you never get a feel for the larger universe. The original did. This one doesn't. It lends itself to a very lonely feel, maybe designed to reflect the main character's state. This is a good thing, but it still feels empty.The characters are a bit half-assed. The main villains are pretty one-dimensional, although their motivations make sense. There's no lines as profound as Roy's final dialogue from the original to be found here. In fact, there's very little depth to be found at all. Ryan Gosling brings no emotion to the character at all. As far as the rest of them, at least one character dies and there's zero repercussions. That makes the story feel kind of slapped together for convenience's sake.The cinematography is great. Wide shots, great colour palette. Looks brilliant on the big screen.The music, as before noted, is vastly inferior to Vangelis' score. This one is loud, chair shaking, a tad instrusive, but also lacks character and memorability.Overall? Yeah, it's okay. It's not great, but not bad either. It'll appeal to some and not to others. I am happy to recommend it, but not enthusiastically. Apparently they're planning a sequel, and if it's good, this will be a great bridge between the two. If not, it's an oddly thin romp through an unexplored world.Finally: Is Deckard a replicant?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fake Reviews are propping this disaster up,"This movie was just awful in so many ways. I had a very hard time staying awake and an even harder time making sense out the extremely slow story line unfolding. I kept thinking the entire time I was watching it that they were just filling time with empty, meaningless scenes. In the end I was convinced that the entire story could have been told in about thirty minutes, with some decent action, and it would have been a lot better.The main way to describe this movie is that, to be kind, the story line took a backseat to meaningless but beautiful HD cinematography. The story was difficult to follow and had an all over the place and meaningless feeling to it. No one in the theater said a word when it was over. They all just got up and walked out looking bored out of their minds.Character development was next to non existent with the exception of a few scenes that pretended to develop the main character.Since I had to give it one star to rate it, I will say that star was for the actors, who in my opinion did as good a job as possible with the horrible, painstakingly slow script they were give.My last complaint is that I have been duped into going and seeing a few movies because the IMDb rating was initially very high, only to end up wasting my time and money. I am convinced that the good reviews are fake and most likely paid for. It is IMPOSSIBLE for people to be rating this garbage a 9 or 10. Perhaps someone who is deaf and just loves looking at HD scenery in movies would have loved it.

Fantastic sequel,"I was lucky enough to see this first day playing in Belgium so I could avoid any spoiler I might read online. So I won't say anything about the story or the plot, just know it's good. A lot better than I expected really. You have to know I absolutely adore the first Blade Runner and know the movie in and out. So scepticism came kinda natural to me.But boy was I wrong. Not only did Villeneuve manage to make this a sequel which can easily stand next to the original, but he avoided the trap of making this movie a fan-service and to put as much reference to the original into his movie to please the hardcore Blade Runner crows. No, he made this movie his own, while expanding the universe created by Ridley without simply copying it. It just works...like the iPhone 33 will in 2049 ;)The visuals are striking, the soundtrack pays great homage to the original while having a more bombastic and frankly dark tone to it, the acting it superb, the way they introduce Deckard is simply fantastic and the way the story unfolds just adss to the whole mythology of Blade Runner.I'm so very pleased to have viewed this movie without spoiling anything for myself concerning either the visuals and story and urge you to do the same.

Style over substance,"Being a fan of the first movie, I was looking forward to watching this one, and I was left very disappointed. The first movie surpasses this one by a mile in about every department. The problem with 2049 is that it seems like it doesn't have any good ideas at all, it's not daring, it's just bland. The production is top notch but that's about it. First the characters, the most important part of the movie. There aren't any interesting or memorable characters in 2049. Only Niander Wallace was slightly interesting but he's so much outside the main story that you kind of forget about him, he appears at the beginning and towards the end. All the replicants in the original movie had a sort of psycho edge to them, they had emotions, they caught your attention. Here they're just like a bunch of dull androids literally, including the main character 'K'. And even the minor characters in the original were all memorable, Tyrell, Sebastian, Hannibal, they were all unique and interesting. In this one there is nothing of that. Second the story and the situations. In the first movie things were happening, slow moody scenes were followed by action sequences and they kind of completed each other seamlessly. You would marvel at the style and then marvel at the action. In this one, it looks like just endless stylish slow scenes that drag on and on. And since they don't get anywhere they become sort of pointless. It all feels incredibly slow. The story itself had some potential but it's not developed properly, where are all the ideas? The 'love story' if we can call it that between 'k' and 'Joy' is just completely forgettable. I don't blame the director, he did all he could with what he had I suppose. When compared to the original masterpiece, 2049 is a complete disappointment on all fronts. As a standalone movie is okish but I wouldn't want to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
All those generic movies will be lost in time like tears in the rain. This is not one of those movies.,"Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel to a 1982 dystopian sci-fi classic Blade Runner. It's directed by incredible Dennis Villenueve (Arrival, Prisoners, Sicario, Enemy, I think I said enough) and stars Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto and Harrison Ford who is returning here. I'm not going to tell you anything about the plot because I find it better going into it blind, so I will get to my thoughts on this.I've heard a lot of people call the first one overrated, but I love each and every cut of it, so I guess you can say I was pretty hyped for this. And with the talent attached to it, my expectations were nothing short of great. And this movie actually managed to live up to those expectations. I've had a blast watching this. I have so much more respect for Sony now because it took bravery to put this much effort and money in what's essentially a big budget art film. Don't go into it expecting an action movie. The trailers might sell it as one, but there is only one longer action scene at the end. I'd say even the first one had more action. But, that doesn't take away from the movie. I just sat there in the theater and sunk into this gorgeous movie. If you love neon lights with a soundtrack filled with synths like I do, just go for it, you will love it. Visually, it's one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen, if not the most gorgeous. It also gave us more of this world that's disgusting and so beautiful at the same time and one that you can just get lost in. Loneliness and isolation are one of the major themes here (as the depression that comes with it) and the world is like a reflection of that. It's very slow, but the slow pace adds a lot of depth here. Honestly, I wish it was longer. There's quite a lot of ambiguity (don't expect to get much answers to the questions from the first one) and some loose ends left in the plot. But they are left by the subplots. And those subplots are not our lead's story. They only helped drive his story and it makes sense that they were unfinished. It might bother some, but it didn't bother me. It's like that for a reason. Who knows, we might even get another one. If they continue like this, I'm all in for it.I wish they make more movies like this. Because this was brilliant and now it left me wanting more. I still don't know if I prefer this or the first one because both are kinda their own movies and I love them both equally in different ways. It's a slow- burn, but a very enjoyable and beautiful slow-burn.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Vapid, Barren, Antiseptic, Drubbed Down, and Dull","The original blade runner had gritty street-scenes that were immersive and set the stage for believing, imagining, and then becoming immersed in the context of a dystopian future.

A big movie,"Finally, a major motion picture for a change.There are very few films that get higher than a 7 out of 10 from me. Hence a rating of 8 indicates films that I highly recommend.The big challenge for film makers these days is that the production levels of TV have gone up so much that a lot of movies seem like just one big episode of a television show. There aren't many films that are able to impress the viewer with the feeling that they're watching a classic big motion picture.Thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 succeeds in putting itself into the Motion Picture category.This is a film that takes you places and makes you think. The acting's nicely done and all homages to the original are subtle enough to come across as sophisticated instead of cheap. There are plenty of nice glory shots in here and the scenes take their time. They even allow the ends of scenes to linger for a while in order to immerse the viewer in the material. This is something that the director of The Empire Strikes Back highlights as an important technique and one that less experienced directors often forget to do. He should know, since he used to teach cinematography. You see this technique also used extensively by Tarkovsky (1972's Solaris).The editing is good and you get a lot for your money with a running time of almost three hours. The pacing is surprisingly well executed, considering the long duration of the movie. It uses a very interesting sequence of scenes ranging from medium to slow to fast to slow again. Seriously, there are meetings that film makers have just to figure out how to properly pace a film and what sequence to put the various intensities of scenes in.Topping this off is a sound track that is true to the original material and also calls back to the 1982 film's score. Nicely done.Something that certainly helps this movie feel enough like the original is the involvement of the director of the original (now in a producer role), one of the producers from the original movie, plus one of the two main writers from the 1982 feature. All of this pays off and is coupled nicely with the style of the new director (kudos to him for handling the material properly).In conclusion if you enjoyed the 1982 Blade Runner movie, then there's a very good chance that you'll like this one as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautiful, Brainy and one of the most dazzling Sci-Fi works of today.","This movie is a complete package. Dennis Villeneuve pulled off a masterpiece. He has proved why he is the most eccentric director to be working with. Ryan Gosling has finally stepped out of his comfort zone and has delivered one of his best performance.The stunning cinematography reminded me of Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey. Visuals are a real treat to watch. This is not your typical go to Sci-Fi movie. The best part is that the movie took it's own time to convey the story one at a time. The beautiful and the elegant dialogue delivery also reminded me of Tarkovsky's epic Solaris. Roger Deakins and Hans Zimmer, hands down one of their best works.The Movie so perfectly delves into elements like emotion, distress, mystery which makes the dialogue delivery even more amazing. Blade Runner 2049 is an instant classic and is already the movie of the year for me.People have to learn to appreciate such movies. Sci-Fi is more than just action and space ships bursting into each other, most importantly it needs to convey the audience as to what's happening.Some of the Sci-Fi scenes are so good that you probably haven't seen in any movie before. People who call it 'Beautiful but Boring' just can't appreciate art. This was more of a Sci-Fi art movie than any action.People, you're in for a treat.Specially, the visuals and the setup is just too good. An ultimate movie experienceI'll never forget Blade Runner 2049",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A near perfect sequel to the original masterpiece,"I'm a huge fan of the original. I'm also a huge fan of Dystopia NF-SciFi. So when a sequel was announced I was both excited but also worried that Hollywood would once again botch a great movie (Yeah I'm looking at you, Star Wars Force Awakens). I have to say Blade Runner 2049 was almost everything I hoped it would be.Bleak, dystopian future. High and low technology intertwined. Soundtrack that pays homage to the original. Wonderful scene-scapes. The storyline was great - thought provoking but not the least bit convoluted. The story also seamlessly continues from the original, even though it could be a stand alone.Yes there were some 'slow' parts in this movie; but these were perfectly fine and IMO added to the overall atmosphere. I really enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere of the movie, it was a visual treat.I do agree with other reviewers that a few scenes could have been cut without harming the movie, but they weren't completely pointless.My only disappointment was I feel there was a missed opportunity for the iconic line ""Time to die"", but whatever.Overall I loved this movie, well written and directed. A real treat for dystopia sci-fi and Blade Runner fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Greatest Film Of The Decade,"Following into the footsteps of one of the most influential films of all time is an intimidating assignment in itself but to surpass all expectations by delivering a story that's even better than the original in all aspects is the rarest of feats. And that's what Denis Villeneuve's latest is: A work of perfection that isn't just the movie of the year but also the filmmaking achievement of the decade.Taking ideas & inspirations from Ridley Scott's neo-noir classic to carve its own original path, Blade Runner 2049 is a fascinating blend of old & new that pays homage to its predecessor, smartly builds & expands upon the universe the first film created, and is sturdy enough to stand on its own.

Ryan Gosling as K was WAY too underplayed and I found him very boring.

Perfect cinematic accomplishment worth 35 years of waiting,"First off, I did my home work and re-watched the original movie a day ago. This really helped with the sequel as no references were lost on me (or so I hope). Highly recommend for everyone to do the same, as it has been a while since the release of the first one. Secondly, I watched this film in IMAX, to get 20% extra experience. I am glad I did both, as I was rewarded with cinematic sci-fi treat of highest grade. I've seen some reviewers complaining it being slow. Well, I did not even notice how 2.5 hours passed. I was waiting for more. So, if it is slow - it's in a good way - giving a viewer a chance to savor every scene. There is not much else that can be said without spoilers. This is an old-fashion sci-fi that does not rely on CGI visuals to carry the story. The visuals are great, but they are what they should be - backdrop.

The Visuals are stunning the world built in the movie is beautiful staying true to the original Blade Runner while adding a neon flair to most scenes in the movie creating an atmosphere that will stay with you far after your viewing, While not having quite the same emotional impact on the audience as the original had, this movie should be seen as an extension to Blade Runner not a sequel, an extension that serves the original much credit to its basis and atmosphere.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent acting by Ryan Gosling, who goes through a whole range of emotions, ups and downs, surprises and shocks. Very tight script and full of intrigue.

Of course this newer film is more in tune with the politics of its time, yet retains the hologram adverts corporate images of a rainy noirish LA from the original. The deserts and landscapes outside of this urbanism is barren and otherwise windswept and post-apocalyptic bleak image of a dystopian future.Gosling as K is suitably moody and melancholic, unsure of his own identity while Hoeks is blank and malevolent, almost a female version of a Terminator.

It could be our future.,"When the original Blade Runner came out in 1982 the movie was something totally refreshing. A vision of the future with a lot of very good visual effects for that time. Now 35 years later Blader Runner 2049 is also full of visual effects, a look at the future like I could imagine it. The original was better because it was a new thing but this one is certainly not bad. Harrison Ford does not have the leading role this time, but the least you can say is that he ages well. He has a much smaller part but he still got it. Ryan Gosling is this time the leading character and he did a good job. The story is good, just a bit too long at my taste.

Blade runner officer 'K'(Ryan Gosling), uncovers a crucial secret that could change everything, forever. 'K' sets out to find former blade runner Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford), who has not been sighted in thirty years.Blade Runner 2049 is an outstanding film. Director Denis Villeneuve has done complete justice to the 1982 cult classic.

However, Blade Runner 2049 did not require multiple views for it to become an instant favorite of mine.

Amazing film for film lovers!,"As many have said, this film is amazing! All the actors are good, all the set designs are great, the camera shots are great,the atmosphere is cold and wonderful, the story is interesting, and the musical score was great! Even though the film is almost 3 hours long, to me it didn't feel like it. I didn't want the movie to end. Its a cold and dark sci film with perfect pacing to grab you in the story. Some say its boring or too slow paced...but the pacing is what gives it it's character. Having certain lights and sounds go over certain areas of the set take you into the world. It's the little things and that attention to detail that the cast, crew, and director use to bring the audience into the story and the world of Blade Runner. This sequel definitely honors the 1st blade runner film, ten fold. You can't cut scenes and dumb it down to just action, jokes, and explosions...and make the movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes...we have too many movies like that already. The 1st movie proved there is an audience for this type of film. And some say that the 1st film was boring....well that 1st film happens to be a cult classic among many others. This movie will go down the exact same way...as a classic film experience. Not everyone will get it. Some people like deep meaningful films....even some films where there is no dialogue at all....but they still get pulled into the film, and escape in the story. I have about over 3,000 movies in my collection, and I love movies. I've loved movies ever since I rented them in the 80s on beta cassette tapes as a kid.

Blade Runner 2049 is an astonishing film.,"The original 1982 Blade Runner remains to this day one of the masterpieces of Science Fiction cinema and stands right along side 2001 A Space Odyssey in my firm view for it's ability to take you to a highly possible future.Now 35 years later, FINALLY a sequel 'Blade Runner 2049' is here and why it hasn't busted cinema block buster records is beyond me. 'GO AND SEE IT BLADE RUNNER fans!!!'This movie captures the look and feel of that gritty possible future to absolute perfection. It literally looks like a seamless extension to the original classic. Best of all with no holds barred they have made the movie extra long to avoid unnecessary cuts. My partner exclaimed that she was amazed it actually went for the length it did because it didn't feel like it. We both still wanted more.What set's Blade Runner apart from other films is the way in which you feel like your viewing a day in the life of this person. You relate to there emotions and understand why the characters are the way they are. While it's possibly not a movie for people who need an explosion every 5 minutes, this film is for those with minds that enjoy thought provoking films besides which there's certainly plenty of action.Like the original the story is told by the interaction and actions of the characters and you want to see where the adventure, into this strange world takes you.A sensible use of real life props and people has made this movie fit perfectly with the original and I honestly couldn't fault it. Everything makes sense and fits with the Blade Runner legacy.The most important aspect of Blade Runner for me has always been it's overall story which is: 'here's what's going to happen to the world if we don't act now to change the way we let greedy corporations run our lives.'Some of the scenes shocked me just as the original did when I first saw it and present the question: 'Is this really what we want for the future?' Compared to how people treat one another and the sad slavery that goes on, the replicants do seem to present themselves as more human than the actual humans and you can understand there desire to be better and want the same freedoms and liberties afforded real humans because by and large they actually seem to deserve those rights more than the real people. (Possibly a nice topic for debate that one.)On the other side of the coin, there are of course the psychotic replicants but then they exist as real humans as well.To conclude a stunning thought provoking sequel that answers a lot of questions but once again throws a couple of ultimate unspoken questions. 1. Is this what we really want our future to look like if we are not more careful to put measures into place to prevent this? Can it be prevented? 2. When does a machine stop being a machine. When does the grey line become a white line?GO AND SEE IT. Denis Villeneuve should receive an academy award for his directing. It's also the best Ridley Scott production in a long time, far better than the recent Alien movies that's for sure and I'd certainly love to see a possible third film to give the Blade Runner universe a trilogy. (The finale could really cause some major stirs and add even more thought provoking questions and incites into this scarily possible future world.)PS. I watched the movie at the cinema in 3D. It was worth it as I get a buzz from 3D and felt even more drawn into the scary but amazing world of Blade Runner. That said the 2D will not disappoint and I've had several friends comment they absolutely loved it also.PPS. Check out the reviews and ratings for this film. They are not lying. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS IF YOUR A BLADE RUNNER FAN. IF YOU HAVEN'T seen this film yet then you absolutely must rectify that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I get it, it's a dystopian tale of survival and searching for meaning, but I went into it confused and was left with a lot of questions. Seeing Harrison Ford and Sean Young together again was a real treat, but it was brief.A Blade Runner sequel should've been a game-changer, but I can't see myself rewatching this over and over like the original.

"Not What I Thought It Would Be, But Wonderful, Nonetheless!","The movie was not what I expected, but it was captivating. It was, complex, intriguing and mesmerizing - keeping my attention focused through the entire 2 hours and 44 minutes. I felt the movie left the viewer wondering if they plan on a third installment - they certainly could go that way.The one thing I felt sorely lacking was the music. The soundtrack in the original Blade Runner was an integral part of the ambiance; the soul and heart of the film. When I hear the music from the original soundtrack, I am immediately transported to a scene, a moment seared forever in my memory, another place and time surreal to our present world. The original soundtrack by Vangelis was haunting, unique - it was the heartbeat of the movie, like blood flowing through the body, the music flowed through the film, imbuing it with a life of its own.Acting was top-notch.

I was mesmerized and in awe of the powerful support this gave to the plot. The audio montages and foley FX were right up there in quality leaving me in no doubt that I now have to admit that the original BR has been displaced as my all time Number 1 movie by this stunning, elegant production.

The only color in the movie occurred for about 30 seconds when green leaves were shown as a memory flashback. The gentleman next to us also agreed he was glad it was over.

There's only one adjective to describe it: Kubrickian,"Since I saw Blade Runner 2049 (in the IMAX format) a day ago, thoughts of the film gave been unable to leave my head.The larger the denominator of a rating, the more room there is to discuss error, so let's keep it to a simple four-star rating.Out of ****, I give it ****.Blade Runner 2049 is certainly not the same as the original, and fans looking for secure familiarity may find themselves lost in the future. This is a film that is harrowing, dark and emotional; however, it is also beautiful, true and pure. The film tells questions what sentience (or perhaps ""having a soul"" is more appropriate) really means. It does this over 163 minutes of unparalleled beauty, thanks to the striking, yet pensive work of director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins. In contrast to the heavily stylized look of the first film (legendarily done by Jordan Croneneweth, and which I consider to be one of the most beautiful films of all time), the team behind 2049 have found something new, but equally powerful. Blade Runner 2049 is filled with imagery that finds natural beauty in the oppressive world in which its characters live. It is a film full of rain, fog, snow and dust, all visually striking.The characters are wonderfully fleshed out and the story starts slow as we are guided around future Los Angeles by Officer K (Ryan Gosling, in arguably his best performance - one which never stops developing over the course of the film). The pace may seem strange to some, but this is not an action-packed thrill ride. It's a noir, or neo-noir if you're a purist. These characters live lives, and that is shown at a realistic pace. One other performance deserves mention and that is the fantastic work of Harrison Ford, who has perfectly created a character that has aged thirty years, in body and mind.The sound design and score is reminiscent of Morricone's accompaniments to Serio Leone's westerns or Carlos's work on A Clockwork Orange, in that it compliments and completes the world of the story perfectly.The editing is quiet, and I didn't mention it on first draft of this review, but I feel that it must be noted, for bringing together the events of a whole world onto the screen.The audience that I saw this film with behaved in a way that convinced me that they felt as I did upon the final frame of the film. Some left, in complete silence; others stayed, lost in thought. Few films' endings are quite as emotionally complete as this ending. It's difficult to review this film in parts, because each emotion we feel is justified by the end, so that what we feel is fulfillment. The story has ended, but the world lives on and we are filled with wonder.My final notes refer back to the title. This film does indeed remind me of the work of Stanley Kubrick. It's a compliment that I have never given before, but I feel that here it is appropriate. It is not my place to say whether Kubrick would have liked this film, but I can assure the reader that this film is one of the decade's (if not the century's) finest and that its very existence is the kind of miracle that makes me love cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Best Sequel of all Time...,"To call this the best sequel of all time may sound a bit too hasty. It is October 7th, and the movie came out yesterday. However, after viewing this movie TWICE within that time frame, I can safely say that Blade Runner: 2049 is my favorite sequel of all time. Is it my favorite movie of all time? We'll see.To avoid any spoilers, I really just want to talk about perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie, besides plot: the cinematography. Holy cow, does Roger Deakins deliver with his photographing skills. I couldn't name a single shot in the film that you wouldn't want to hang up on a wall. From filthy streets to smoggy skylines, audiences feel immediately in awe of Ridley Scott's dystopian hellscape. Not only are these features inspiring, but they are also incredibly immersive. Perhaps more than the first film, you feel like every bystander and every individual in the movie has some unique personality and history. Numerous long takes pan throughout, and viewers have plenty of time to soak in the admittedly emotional scenes throughout. Impatient viewers be warned: this film is slow and contemplative, just like the original. Those who readily watch the film, however, will surely be rewarded.I could go on and on about other aspects. The soundtrack. It's different. It's not Vangelis. Hans Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch deliver an original, emotional, and powerful score that coincides with much of the equally powerful ambiance. I could talk about editing too, though, the long takes reduce that tactics necessity a bit. This isn't an action film, at least a ""traditional"" one. With takes lasting upwards of what seems like ten seconds each (with exceptions, of course), scenes play out with limited cutting. You won't have trouble taking everything in setting and props. In fact, paying attention to these things is crucial to understanding the film. Villeneuve won't hold your hand, but he certainly won't make it difficult to follow, either.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Great Sequel,"A good film will take you someplace you have never been. ""Blade Runner 2049"" is set in a dystopian future that is very convincing due to its superior production values. At the same time, the film harkens back to ""Blade Runner"" in numerous ways, providing a foundation for the millions of loyal fans who long for a continuation of the original story. Echoes of the past are achieved, variously, through music, scenery, common actors, and an atmosphere and tone that evoke Ridley Scott's seminal prequel.The storyline of the new film is quite good, maintaining a consistency between the films, yet advancing the action into a future that has evolved beyond. K (Ryan Gosling), like his predecessor--Rick Deckard--is a blade runner tasked with eliminating replicants (androids) that are deemed dangerous to society. Basically, this is a police procedural dressed in stylish garb.The film provides plenty to chew on relative to the power structure of society and, more importantly, the nature of man versus artificial man.The wonderful cast is blessed with some meaty roles. Robin Wright plays Lieutenant Joshi, K's superior officer. Ana de Armas is Joi, K's unusual girlfriend. Jared Leto is Niander Wallace--a man so rich he effectively makes his own laws. And Sylvia Hoeks is Luv, Wallace's attendant and enforcer. Hoeks channels a ruthless energy, a detached efficiency, and a physicality that could remind one of the ""Terminator"" franchise.""Blade Runner 2049"" is an impressive accomplishment by director Denis Villeneuve and his team.

"Ryan Gosling is still trying to be ""a real human being""","The best part about Blade Runner 2049 is how visually engaging it is. The editing has a steady, rich pace. The film did feel very long, but this never distracted from the slow and occasionally ambiguous plot. The direction and composition holds your attention on the world of the film.Although the visual effects are consistently realistic, the environments aren't as imaginative nor as atmospheric as the bulky retro L.A. in the original Blade Runner, which was bursting with character and life. Some places in BR2049, such as the farm and the orphanage K visits, have a believably unique design; other places, like the memory manufacturer, er, don't. The art design on Denis Villeneuve's other sci-fi films (i.e. Enemy, Arrival) should give you a good idea of what to expect. The costume design is brilliant - possibly better than the original's.The biggest problem is the plot. The original BR had two narratives building at the same time - Deckard's hunt for the escaped replicants, and the replicants' hunt for their creator - and as the film goes on, we develop empathy for both parties. This is crucial, as a key theme in BR (and especially the book) is empathy; it separates androids from humans. We can empathize with all the characters' actions, even the immoral ones. Everyone feels human, which might, y'know, have something to do with the whole theme of the film? Y'know? In contrast, BR2049 has a polarizing ""good vs. bad"" plot. The goodies escape from the baddies. Not much to contemplate, really. The protagonist is asked to find and kill someone, which could be an opportunity to explore some complex morality; but the film never takes the time to expand on this, because it's so caught up in it's own ""goodies versus baddies"" plot.Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks play villains as forgettable as the fifteen billion other film villains exactly like them. But at least Hoeks is able to breathe some personality into her role, delivering some intense scenes - Leto's performance had next to no character. Neither come close to the brilliance of Steven Berkoff.In fact, with BR being an atmospheric and human film, the only excuse I can find for BR2049's complete lifelessness is that it was done on purpose. Maybe it's a metaphor for how it feels to be a slave android, with no free will? If that's the case, it's not a rewarding one. Villeneuve is notorious for ambiguous plots - my man Channel Criswell argues that ambiguity is the genius of Villeneuve's craft(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NJYnoNxLek)- but whilst films like Enemy (which has very similar themes to BR) are so confusing that the viewer feels almost obliged to work out what it all meant, BR2049 feels cold and detached. This is partly due to the acting.Ryan Gosling isn't a good actor. He is a guy who smiles slightly. That's all he does. He can only pull one face. Has anyone else noticed this? Because he seems to be getting a lot of roles recently. In which all he does is slightly smile. Enemy makes a good comparison: Jake Gyllenhaal plays a man going through an overwhelming psychological struggle, and his brilliant performance expresses this. The struggle is completely internalized, yet we still understand; and if we don't, we want to. Gosling's character contemplates things throughout BR2049, but we can't possibly work out what he's thinking. Narration and flashbacks have to be used, and even then it's unengagingly confusing. The other performances were fine. Mackenzie Davis was impressive, and Harrison Ford held up.The film was an entertaining pair of hours, but I doubt it'll stay with you, because I'll probably forget about it soon. It's not the ind of film I want to think about, nor had enough action scenes to warrant a rewatch.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Slow Burning Sequel emphasizes mood and feel over story,"Blade Runner 2049 pays worthy homage to its parent film with use of similar color palettes and mood inducing music that effectively draws the viewer into this dystopian and somber future LA. Ever dark with incessant precipitation properly sets the tone that the earth seems to be mourning its current fate. Replicants, seemingly devoid of a soul, have so populated the landscape that one must sometimes question, ""Is that dog real?"". I found the world building efforts by set and sound design wonderfully successful. Different places take on unique color tones of black, mustard brown and gray. They represented to me a journey of awareness for our primary protagonist ""K"", the LAPD officer, established early on as a replicant himself, performing the same role as Rick Deckard from the original Blade Runner. However, in his role, he locates an odd, out-of-place, flower that leads to the discovery of replicant bones and a mystery begins to unfold that sets him on this quest. The quest will lead him to begin to question whether or not replicants can, in fact, have souls. And if so, does he.It's a simple plot line. Where the movie may lose people, though, is the pacing it uses to get from point A, to B, to C. Perhaps, there are tangential issues being wrestled with by our main characters. If you've seen Westworld on HBO last year, you may think these issues have been explored. I did. And perhaps, the pacing is intended to demonstrate it's never an easy quest. In fact, we are given examples of what, sometimes, must be lost to gain this insight.I found the sequel worthy to its predecessor. It revisits certain questions the original asked, without tying an obvious bow around them. I liked the imagery, the sound, the characters (and acting). I think Harrison Ford does some of his finest work here. If I were criticize, I'd say choices could have been made for economy's sake to shorten the movie a bit. Some of the methodical and brooding shots of Gossling walking through a set could have been shortened or even eliminated. Sure it builds a picture, but it doesn't have the payoff necessary to justify its place in the film.Still B+ Recommend to any sci-fi, Blade Runner, PKDick fan.

This Movie is a Replicant of a Film,"The movie is a ""replicant"" of a real film. Not to say that we should retire it. It is a sci-fi movie chock full of cool effects.But where is the Noir? Is there soul?The original Blade Runner had an enigma that kept viewers arguing for 30 years. This one left nothing unanswered that viewers could discuss 30 minutes later.It is a cool FX sci-fi entertainment, with superhero, ""kung-fu"" robots.Certainly are plenty of pretties in this. I could be wrong, but should Film Noir be populated exclusively by models?Certainly are plenty of ""female nudity"" in this: robot breasts, virtual breasts, statue breasts, small, medium and giant. I expected the credits to say, ""Dedicated to the memory of Hugh Hefner."" Perhaps this was an exploration into the difference between artificial breasts and the human breast. Perhaps it was pandering to the perceived interests of the stereotypical porn-surfing fan boy. ""I only watch this movie for the articles,"" is like what they used to claim about Hefner's magazine.It had very cool technologies from the future, especially flying cars with built-in drones.In the casino, it's too bad the actors were upstaged by lip-syncing Elvis and Sinatra impersonators. I have no recollection of what the characters did there, but the hologram singers stole the show.Can't wait for the DVD with extended scenes. Ha, ha, just kidding.

"Say it ain't so, Joe","Greetings again from the darkness. Ridley Scott's original film was released in 1982 and based in 2019. The highly anticipated sequel from Denis Villenueve is being released in 2017 and based in 2049. So we have 35 years between films, and 30 years between story settings. Expect that to be the most complicated part of this review since we were mandated by the studio to follow many rules – write this, don't write that. Such rules would normally be frowned upon (and even ignored by many), but in fact, this film does such a masterful job of paying homage to the first, while enhancing the characters and story, that we are eager for every viewer to experience it with fresh eyes and clear mind ... no matter how tempting it is to talk about!Obviously, the massive fan base that has grown over the years (the original was not an initial box office hit) will be filling the theatres the first weekend – even those who are ambivalent towards, or adamantly against, the idea of a sequel. The big question was whether screenwriters Hampton Fancher (maybe every writer should begin as a flamenco dancer) and Michael Green would be able to create a script that would attract new viewers while honoring the original film and source Philip K Dick novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" The answer is not only a resounding yes, but it's likely even those who usually shy away from science-fiction may find themselves thoroughly enjoying the nearly 2 hours and 43 minute run time (it doesn't seem too long).The cast is deep and perfectly matched, and there are even a few surprises (no spoilers here). Ryan Gosling is fun to watch as the reserved K, an expert Blade Runner who tracks and ""retires"" old model replicants – the Nexus 8's have been replaced by the more- controllable Nexus 9's. An early sequence has K in combat mode against a protein farmer named Morton (played by the massive Dave Bautista). With all that is going on in these few scenes, director Villenueve is training us to lock in and pay attention, lest we miss the key to the rest of the movie and K's motivation for most everything he does from this point on. Robin Wright plays K's icy Lieutenant Joshi, who administers ""baseline"" tests to him after every successful mission – just to make certain he is still under her control.Jared Leto delivers an understated and mesmerizing performance as the God-like Wallace who not only managed to solve global hunger, but also is a genetic engineer creating new beings. Somehow, this is one of Leto's most normal roles (which makes quite a statement about his career) and yet his character is so intriguing, it could warrant a spin-off standalone film. Wallace's trusted assistant is the ruthless bulldog mis-named Luv, played by Sylvia Hoeks. Her scene with Robin Wright is one of the best on screen female duels we've seen in awhile. One of the more unusual characters (and that's saying a lot) is Joi (Ana de Armas), the Artificial Intelligence/hologram companion to K, whose presence is cued by Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf notes. Other support work to notice comes in brief but crucial roles by Hiam Abbas, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Barkhad Abdi and Lennie James.Who is not listed above? Of course it's Harrison Ford (as seen in the trailer), who reprises his Deckard role from the original. All these years later, he's a grizzled recluse who doesn't take kindly to home visitations. Mr. Ford offers up proof that he still possesses the acting ability that made him a movie star (even if his best piloting days have passed him by). It's such a thrill to see him flash the screen presence that's been missing for many years. And yes, fans of the first film will mourn the absence of the great Rutger Hauer, yet there is no need to dwell on one of the few negatives.The story leans heavily on philosophical and metaphysical questions  just like every great sci-fi film. What makes us human, or better yet, is there a difference between humans and machines that can think and feel? Can memories be trusted, or can they be implanted or influenced over time? These are some of the post-movie discussion points, which are surely to also include the cutting edge cinematography and use of lighting from the always-great Roger Deakins, and the production design from Dennis Gassner that somehow fits the tone, mood and texture of both the first film and this sequel. The set pieces are stunning and sometimes indistinguishable from the visual effects – a rarity these days. My theatre did feature the ""shaky seats"" that work in conjunction with the sound design  a gimmick I found distracting and more in line with what kids might find appealing.There was some unwelcome drama a couple of months ago as noted composer Johann Johannsson dropped out and was replaced with Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. The resulting score complements the film without mimicking the original. Ridley Scott, who directed the original BLADE RUNNER (and its numerous versions over the years), was involved as Executive Producer, and to put things in perspective, the first film was released the same year as TOOTSIE and TRON. Denis Villenueve was Oscar nominated for directing ARRIVAL, and he has proved himself to be a superb and dependable filmmaker with SICARIO, PRISONERS, and INCENDIES. He deserves recognition and respect for his nods to the original (Pan Am, Atari) and ability to mold a sequel that stands on its own  and in my opinion, is better than the first. Hopefully stating that is not against the Warner Bros rules.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unfinished plot,I rated both the original Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049 with 7/10. I do think that the plot of the original movie was too simple and that the plot of the 2049 blade runner is overly complicated and illogical at times. We are left with an ending which is neither a happy ending nor a finished plot. The movie asks many questions but fails to answer them even though the movie takes almost 3 hours.Conclusion: Overly complicated movie with an unsatisfying ending.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Doesn't hold a candle to the original.,"The original Bladerunner was a sci-fi noir classic, it had a mysterious and magical aura about it. Everything from the plot, sets, the classic Vangelis score and the meticulous level of detail was just sublime.This *cough* sequel *cough* is not even in the same ball park stylistically, story wise or in any other way. It felt cold and lacked the originals ambiance and magical tone,moved like molasses and the overly convoluted and sleep inducing story made me stare at the walls and other patrons to see if they were still awake.Hollywood has lost the plot literally and figuratively and it just goes to show that bigger budgets and fancier CGI do not make a superior film.They just don't make em' like they used to.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Is Denis Villeneuve a Replicant?,"What I have just seen in my nearby theater was what I think is one of the greatest films of all time. Denis Villeneuve and his crew have created a film so artistically and visually beautiful that there's no way this movie was made by humans.Roger Deakins has not won an Oscar. Think about that. One of the most renowned cinematographers of all time? Screw him. Well, not anymore. He WILL win an Academy Award for this cinematography. There is no denying that.Villeneuve has made some of the best films of this decade, and this is just another one. Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and Arrival? He is one of the best directors working today. This film is the best he's ever done. This movie is a true masterpiece of cinema.Everything that was cool about Blade Runner was made even better in this Big-Budge sequel. There are many surprises waiting, and trust me, you will be surprised. The visual effects in this film are comparably revolutionary to Terminator 2's.They are spectacular and realistic. The crew held true and payed plenty of homage to the original 1982 classic. But this film is better in every way.Not many people can make a FILM this amazing today. I might see this in theaters 12 more times. IT IS THAT GOOD!

Incredible,"Let me just start off by saying what I thought of the original Blade Runner. It's a really good, not great, film that has its problems but is definitely worth watching and re-watching. It's visually amazing, has really good music, and solid performances. Sadly the pacing is what I have a problem with, it feels 30 minutes longer than it really is.Now to my opinion on this film. This is an incredible, beautiful, and just overall well made film. Roger Deakins should finally win the academy award for best cinematography, there is not a single frame I didn't like in this film. The acting was fantastic, everyone did a great job but the stand-out performance for me was Ana De Armas, her character was very interesting and she did a great job portraying that character. The music is fantastic, it never feels like the original score but it's not trying too. This score stands on its own, and so does the film. The pacing never felt bad to me, it's a 2 hour and 43 minute film and it feels like one in the best possible way. I did not have a single problem with this film, it is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A surprisingly sensitive sequel.,"Very early on, the film reveals something that sets it apart from the original. But without giving anything away here, it finds a way to maintain its own suspense and mystery. This is the film's strongest aspect; a film about identity that firmly establishes one of its own. This is no pale imitation of Blade Runner.3D is effectively used to add another dimension to the cityscapes and high rise vistas that otherwise look authentically Blade Runner. It's worth seeing in the cinema as the 3D feels integral, not a gimmicky add on.A solid 9 and a film best seen before reading too many detailed reviews... so I'll end this one here.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Had a hard act to follow, but, still good","It's good, but not great. A little convoluted and gets a little too tricky with assumptions and suspension of disbelief, but its worth a 7 out of 10. This is a case of a movie that could never live up to the original, due to the great effects that were made for the original and its dated time frame. it's a practical impossibility to follow up a classic, thus an impossible act to follow. However, it is definitely worthy to call itself a good sequel. In my mind. Very very rarely, is a sequel equal to the original. Examples are the Godfather part 2, and, coincidentally, a sci fi film starring Harrison Ford The Empire Strikes back, can be said to be better than the original. Ryan Gosling is somewhat wooden in this role. I get that he is essentially portraying an android, but a more inspired actor could have done something better with it. It was a treat seeing Edward James Olmos ,though you have to wish for something more than an extended cameo. Overall though, it's definitely worth the watch, and I highly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Cerebral, rich and gorgeous to look at, Blade Runner 2049 doesn't disappoint - but it doesn't really excite, either.","Who in their right minds would even contemplate creating a sequel to Blade Runner, easily one of the most influential and iconic sci-fi classics of all time? For all its flaws (from a glacial pace to a tendency to favour style over substance), Ridley Scott's 1982 film remains a thoroughly original experiment that deftly juggles genres (sci-fi, noir, thriller) while serving up philosophical musings on humanity, identity and authority. It was groundbreaking, and has served as the template for countless movies and television shows since.To be fair, Blade Runner 2049 actually makes a pretty compelling case for a sequel. Its pedigree is fantastic: Denis Villeneuve, director of complex and arresting films like Sicario and Enemy, is at the helm, with Scott's full blessing. The screenplay is co- written by Hampton Fancher (who dreamt up the original script almost four decades ago) and Michael Green (Logan). Harrison Ford has returned to play Rick Deckard, alongside some of Hollywood's best character actors like Ryan Gosling and Robin Wright.The resulting film, however, is... a mixed bag. It's clear in every frame that the creative team poured their hearts and souls into it. Their efforts are rewarded by the moments in Blade Runner 2049 that hum with the electric spark of old ideas made new again. Unfortunately, these don't happen quite often enough to justify the film's staggering running time. Unlike its predecessor, Villeneuve's movie too often feels like it's playing rather than changing the game.The world of Blade Runner is one marked by grey areas of the literal and moral variety. 35 years on from the first film, the increasingly self-aware androids created by the Tyrell Corporation – known as 'replicants' – have been refined by industrialist Niander Wallace (Leto). Unlike troublesome models of generations past, K (Gosling) is dutiful and apparently devoid of human emotion and entanglement. Indeed, his job is to serve as a blade runner – a cop who 'retires'/de-activates rogue replicants – for the Los Angeles Police Department. But, when he uncovers a buried box of bones on a seemingly routine mission, he's led on an odyssey of self- discovery... one that leads him to a blade runner who's long since gone off the grid: Rick Deckard (Ford).For the most part, Blade Runner 2049 does a decent job of channelling the spirit of Ridley's film without coming off like a completely soulless retread. In effect, it's exploring much the same territory – what happens when artificial life takes on emotional reality of its own? can androids be more human than humans? – with some clever twists on the ideas and moods that added such colour and depth to the first film. K's existential crisis takes us through the very heart of this dystopian world, as the audience begins to see how he has been weighing his own identity against his programming all along.There are moments in the film that work quite well, mostly in depicting the almost devastating loneliness of the human – and replicant – condition. There's something truly heartbreaking about K's encounter with Dr. Ana Stelline (Juri), one of the world's top memory designers. Immuno-compromised from a young age, she's lived most of her life in a sterile, isolated environment – but nevertheless creates memories for replicants that fairly explode with colour and comfort. The inevitable clash between K and Deckard, played charmingly by Ford in full gruff hermit mode, affords this resolutely grave film a few welcome beats of levity.The trouble is that Blade Runner 2049 borrows its air of philosophical mystery from its predecessor, but doesn't manage to sustain it. The film ends up laying practically all of its cards on the table – including some that stayed hidden from view in Blade Runner. There remains some ambiguity about Deckard's metaphysical condition (thank goodness!), but little much else. The questions it raises are uncomfortable ones too, altering some of the more intriguing dynamics in the first film - not necessarily for the better.It doesn't help, either, that Blade Runner 2049 is arriving in cinemas in a media landscape that has been so indelibly shaped by its predecessor. The inner dreams and lives of androids and artificial life, so thought-provoking in the first film, are now the stuff of popular culture. More than once, Blade Runner 2049 tries but doesn't find much more to say than the likes of Spike Jonze's Her and HBO's Westworld, which have explored the same themes with greater sensitivity and insight.At least Blade Runner 2049 has adopted a marginally more progressive approach to its female characters this time around. It's not great that they exist primarily to serve as catalysts for K's journey, but at least they're there – in the roles of mentor (Wright as Lieutenant Joshi), muse (de Armas as Joi), antagonist (Hoeks as Luv) and more.If there's one element of the film that deserves unreserved praise, it's Roger Deakins' absolutely jaw-dropping cinematography. Blade Runner 2049 is the most visually stunning film you'll see all year - every frame is composed with an artist's eye for the sublime, drawing beauty even from the bleakest of urban wastelands. Hopefully, his work here will finally win Deakins an Academy Award (he's been nominated 13 times and not won once).In Hollywood history, only a mere handful of sequels have equalled or bettered their predecessors. Blade Runner 2049 is not one of those select few. It's incredibly well and thoughtfully made and, thankfully, doesn't disgrace or destroy the franchise to which it now belongs. But, if you're looking for bold, brainy sci-fi that's quite unlike anything you've ever seen before (like the original Blade Runner), you'd be better served by Villeneuve's own modern classic, Arrival.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A disappointment, to be sure...","An unnecessarily long movie. A fact which would have probably passed me by if it was any good. The plot was diabolical. Sci-fi movies NEED a believable plot. Movies about paranormal horror, or real-life movies are allowed to break that premise, but all good sci-fi is based on a BELIEVABLE story. Amazingly sophisticated androids – believable. Used as slaves – believable. They rebelled – believable. A task force was assembled to eliminate them – believable. All that was B.R.2019. ""Plot of B.R.2049"" - simply unrealistic! Now that we have established you need to put your brain to one side lets carry on the evaluation. The acting was sufficient. I think Gosling was good. The scenery & effects were very good. The atmosphere was faithfully represented. But there is only so long these things can keep you fixed to your seat. And 3 hours is well past that mark. The last fight is, indeed very good. But your interest in the characters in minimal and you are fairly tired by then.Finally I think they have used ""infrasounds"". Those inaudible sounds they use in horror movies to unnerve the viewer. And the audible bits were too loud and of such low frequency the whole auditorium was vibrating. Frankly painful.Overall I would say it got right: scenery, effects, atmosphere. It got wrong: plot, length, noises. Which gets it 6/10. A disappointment, to be sure!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Almost there...,"I was surprised Ridley Scott wasn't going to direct 2049 but Villeneuve proved to be worthy of the task. The cast is spot on, the photography is excellent, the sound effects are chilling, the universe is splendid, it is almost there. It is hard to pinpoint an obvious flaw in the movie and that's why I still rated it 8 out of 10. But there's not enough of Jared Leto, the streets of Chinatown are not packed enough, the pod where K lives is too much inspired from the 5th Element, the pace of the movie is quite random and for a film that long you expect more tension, some lengthy western confrontations, well just a bit more. You want more inventions like in the original one where every single object on stage was a specific design. Villeneuve respected the sets of the original, very good, but maybe just a bit too much, he should have owned this new universe. And honestly the new Nexus have no extra features and they can even get trashed by a human bare handed? Tiny bits of frustration all consolidated by the obvious clues that a #3 is already in the making. You don't enjoy a movie as the ultimate one if you feel that the end of the story is in a sequel. And when one respects a movie enough to wait 35 years before the next sequel... it defeats the purpose to make the audience feel the next one is much closer than that.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Easily in my top 5 favorite movies,"My expectations for this movie were not all that high. I went to see a late showing in and empty, cheap, and rundown theater but instantly regretted it. Blade Runner 2049 deserves the best and I have already planned a second viewing in IMAX.The most outstanding work came from on the art direction. I fully expect this team of artists to earn Blade Runner 2049 a sizable collection of awards. The use of color is extraordinary and the sets are extremely well done. Much like how Mad Max: Fury Road gave the new generations a schema for the post apocalyptic landscape, Blade Runner 2049 defined what is Cyber punk. 2049 has all the advantages of 30 years of tech that gave the movie the ability to do things Ridley Scott could have only imagined in the 80s.The costume design was also spectacular. It's a tall order to try and portray the fashions of a retro-future, now-noir, and dystopian sci-fi film. Renée April stepped up to the challenge and delivered perfectly. Unlike most of the film the costumes had a muted palette but that didn't stop them from standing out in a film packed with exceptional aspects.Finally, the acting. There were no weak links in 2049. Everyone came out and delivered solid performances. The full cast did a great job of portraying the awkward and unsociable personalities of this dystopian world. While to me none of the performances stood above the rest I will note that Ryan Gosling was a perfect fit for the main character.In conclusion I would give this film a 9.8/10. Just to nitpick the sound effects at times felt a little overbearing and there was a single line I think didn't fit. Despite that it well earned the round up to 10/10. I can not recommend enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What does it mean to be human?,"A breathtaking sequel to perhaps THE greatest sci-fi film of all time. The original Bladerunner, aside from its revolutionary impact on science fiction films in general, explored the idea of artificial intelligence by diving into the emotional element-- and what better way to explore the human condition than through the lens of an artificial being manufactured to mimic every human feature, including self-awareness. For human perception naturally involves self-reflection, which in turn creates internal and external emotional responses. The greater the emotion, the more powerful the memory. To be human is to find our way down the path of life and to negotiate the joys and sorrows that are experienced along the way. One can use emotional responses associated with memories in order to help bring understanding to the ultimate question-- what purpose did the path serve, if any.Bladerunner 2049 explores these same fascinating questions, including original elements from the original title to expand the scope and add several new dimensions along the way. The main villain from the original movie played by Rutger Hauer, who famously improvised the last ""tears in rain"" line, is a tragic character in some sense. Rutger, unlike Gosling, was a true villain out to kill humans (and many he did), as he struggled more with self-awareness due to lack of implants. But despite these differences, both characters are indeed tragic. The difference??? When Rutger found out the truth about his maker, he gouged out his eyeballs with his own hands. When Gosling found about his maker/true roots, he decided to save someone. Wait, that sounds familiar! The touching part about these movies is that in the end, life is found to be what is most precious, underscoring the reality that appreciation of life is indeed what makes us human-knowing how we came into existence (makers/parents) and the ability to comprehend our own mortality. In the end, both Replicant's finally come to this realization and commit the most human act one can make-the sacred act of saving another human being's life.Bravo Ridley and those who worked this film. Very well-done sequel. And most importantly, THANK YOU HANS ZIMMER.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

No Magic,"On the deepest level, Blade Runner (the original) magically reduced the most daunting questions of our existencewhat are we.who or what created uswhat is consciousness, memory, identity, empathy, love..to characters and relationships on screen, mainly Rachel and Deckard. Their moments together were beyond precious. The stars had to align for this to work. No such thing happened for this sequel. It is a good film and I will see it again but the two should not be confused.It's interesting that in 35 years the visual effects could not be appreciably improved..probably because we've passed the point of diminishing returns in hitek digital slambam. What is left is the story and acting and both did not overly impress. The death scene on the steps is an unoriginal mimicking of what is for me one of the greatest scenes ever.a soaked dying Rutger Hauer on the roof with the white dove. The music likewise was a poor wannabe of the original Vangelis.To have your heart, soul, and mind be touched deeply, powerfully and increasingly with each viewing by a film is an unforgettable experience, and when a film operates on 2 levels simultaneously, as a great action film (for most viewers)and as a spiritual experience for some, it becomes transcendent, a very rare thing for films. Such is Blade Runner for me. An example of another film of another genre which operates for me the same way is Somewhere in Time. For most, just a deceptively beautiful, schmaltzy love story. I've seen it countless times as I have Blade Runner. It triggers the same profound reflections on our being.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't watch. Completely waste of time.,Movie is too long. Story is way too simple. Maybe the director think there is twist but it is definitely not.

A modern classic,"Finally saw the new Blade Runner, I was very impressed. The story is smart, dark, mysterious, and pure steampunk Noir. The film constantly gave you just enough information to know what was going on and keep you interested, but never enough to spell everything out for you .I love that this film doesn't talk down to its viewers and it requires an active viewing experience. The setting and the futuristic world presenpresented in the film was amazing. The CGI was truly breathtaking and didn't feel fake at all.Acting wise Ryan Gosling did a outstanding job. He really did a great job playing the stoic silent role. He constantly used his mannerisms and his eyes to emote his feelings to add a extra dimension to his character.Despite how much I enjoyed the film it was not perfect. There were a few loose ends by the end of the film that would have been nice to tie up. I personally enjoyed the length of the movie and the pace, but I can see some viewers becoming overwhelmed. I overall really liked it 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Glorious,"I have been a fan of Blade Runner since the 1982 original, my favorite movie of all time.

actually a really good sequel (for once),"I agree, often there are many unnecessary sequels of popular or classic movies made these days, but! this movie definitely does not feel like a money grabbing big hollywood sequel that lacks any substance. The Director Villeneuve is a pro and truly makes art as is the case with this film. It feels carefully made and I feel it honours the original but still stands on it's own. I wouldn't want it to have too big of an impact on the original story and it doesn't, it fits in well and has just the right amount of connection to the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Llacks the passion and desperation of the original.,"Blade Runner is a cult favourite, with its futuristic visions and the way it asked questions about humanity and being human. Equally riveting was the pace and plot. As Deckard fought for his life against physically superior replicants.Then, there was the romantic relationship between Dckard and Rachel, the beautifully cool replicant.This 2049 version is merely an extension of the original film. Stylistically and creatively, it does not break new ground. Though there are clever ideas and a great deal of detail.In terms of human interest, I found it hard to empathize with K because it didn't have enough of an inner life. Granted that K has an interesting relationship with a virtual girlfriend.Other weaknesses include the lack of a terrifying killer replicant like Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer). The mad genius played by Leto just does not match the mania of Joe Turkel's Dr Tyrell. Nor the other interesting characters populating the original film.The bottom line is that the film has a great deal of creative input, but lacks the passion and desperation of the original.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wait a minute, replicants can do... WHAT?","In science fiction the viewer must believe in a certain fantasy in order to enjoy the story that will be presented. In Back to the Future you must accept the fantasy that it is possible to travel through time. In E.T. you must accept the fact that aliens from other planets do exist.In Blade Runner 2049 the main story is all about a certain ability the replicants seem to have - and it's a totally absurd and unbelievable one. That and a few plot holes almost wreck the whole movie.In the end Blade Runner 2049 is saved by the incredible visuals and the love director Denis Villeneuve has for the original. There are many big and small scenes that refer to characters and situations in Blade Runner 1. The film brings back two characters from the original (beside Deckard) and the second one is actually very well done. The now famous Vangelis soundtrack also plays a major part at the end. The first encounter between Gosling and Harrison Ford is an absolute delight, just like the performance of newcomer Sylvia Hoeks (who makes us Dutchies very proud). The film is long - almost three hours - and could have used a shorter cut.Blade Runner 2049 certainly does not surpass the original, but it's a courageous effort that's worth seeing in the cinema, especially in 3D IMAX. Only time will tell if it will also become a classic.7,5 / 10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Exactly the sequel I have been waiting for...,"Though the original Blade Runner is over 30 years old, I only discovered the sci-fi masterpiece about 10 years ago, and I was instantly captured by it. The movie was a visual and audible spectacle despite its sharp and harsh tones and dreary dark settings. The plot was thick and rich, required real attention, and even a second look to really understand the depth of the story, largely due to jumps in chapter without the filler explanation material we normally receive. I loved the story so much, I bought and read the book, and then other Phillip K. Dick stories.Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel I have been hoping for since the end of the first story, this movie is unique as sequels go because it not only does justice to the original film, but to the book as well. The expansion on the story line is perfect, just unusual enough to fit the style of the original author, but not so much that it tries too hard. The plot is deep and follows the same style of the original, still offering plenty of surprises. The characters are true successors to the originals and the return of appropriately aged characters from the original film are on point and an integral part of the story line. There are a lot of negative comments about Ryan Gosling's performance, lacking emotion and style, but I believe that his character is exactly as dry and stoic as he is supposed to be in the dystopian future where he resides. The performance of all the actors and actresses was excellent and left nothing to be desired. This movie adequately answers many (but not all) questions that arose after the first, and effectively puts the story line to bed. There is not much of an opening for another sequel, so I genuinely hope that no one attempts it.To the naysayers of the film, the Blade Runner story is more than just a film, it travels much deeper into the writings of the original author, and to find films that truly project the style and vision of the author onto the screen is rare, but it happens here. I urge everyone to look at the film from a greater and more global view, with the book and two movies being equal parts of a whole experience. I for one, was thoroughly satisfied with the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Still Not Grasping the Love For these Movies,"Having not been a fan of the original, I went into 2049 with an open mind. I was hoping to have a truly epic sci-fi experience that honors the original but also stands on its own. While 2049 does that, it still isn't resonating with me the way I think it does with most people.I honestly can't pinpoint the reason why I'm not connecting to these films. Great performances, beautiful cinematography, visceral action (in the limited action sequences), and a director at the top of his game, and I'm still not connecting the dots as to why these movies are viewed with such high regard. Granted, Roger Deakins' cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. Gosling, Ford, and the rest of the ensemble all fit perfectly with their characters (see - Jared Leto for example). Villeneuve proposes some fantastic story beats that definitely separate this film thematically from the original (which was a worry I had), and yet I'm still not all the way there.I think the thing that kills me with both films is the pacing. It's not like I haven't seen science fiction films with slow pacing that I liked. Heck, Villeneuve made a great one just last year with Arrival. But there's something about how slow these films play and the material that drives them just doesn't resonate with me. Whether it's the overabundance of A.I driven sci-fi features that I've seen before these movies, the bleak tone, or the fact that I just don't really care whether or not Rick Deckard is a replicant or not, Blade Runner just isn't for me.With that said, I can always appreciate when a film is sharply put together. Just because I'm not a fan of the material, doesn't mean I can't see when a film is something special in the technical way. If there was ever a guy who should win the Oscar for cinematography, it's Roger Deakins. The man has gone on long enough without a statue. And there's nothing I can knock too much about Villeneuve's directing, even with an incredibly slow burn way of telling a story. I thought Gosling and Ford played well off each other, and gave some of the more emotional turns I've seen from either of them in quite some time. And the eerie but lively score from Ben Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer are among this year's best.However overall, I can't see myself sitting down for a second viewing. I'm perfectly content with letting other people enjoy this series. I won't blame anyone for calling this or the original a classic. But I'll pass.7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Very Long and Boring Film,"Sometimes I really don't get people. This movie got excellent reviews and was ranked very high all over the world. Can anyone tell me why? There's hardly any story, and the little there is, well, it's not enough for such a long movie - a 30 minutes movie would have covered it. The music is terrible. I usually don't notice, but it's just so obvious. It is loud and screechy and over-dramatic. In general, someone thought that adding lot's of rain over a window at night, plus dramatic music, plus actors making mysterious faces is going to be enough as a movie. Basically, that's how you make a soap opera, and that's what we ended up having. The Story itself is downright ridiculous. All the characters are doing things that don't make any sense, and sometimes go against there own interests. I gave the film 3 just because I like Harrison Ford and because there were a few nice frames in the film - there's nothing else really.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Magnificent. Simply Magnificent!!,"I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's 1982 epic masterpiece, Blade Runner. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say that although I've watched hundreds of movies, without doubt, it's my favourite movie of all time.So when they announced that they were producing Blade Runner 2, I was a little apprehensive, to say the least!! Were they going to reuse Harrison Ford, as a geriatric Blade Runner with a remote controlled walking frame or try to make you believe he still had the strength of a 20 yo, like in Indiana Jones - the Crystal Skull?In the lead up to the release of the film, producer Ridley Scott said that Harrison Ford described it as the ""the best script I've ever read"". Yeah. Exactly what I thought. A pretty big call.Just saw it yesterday. At the IMAX. In 3D. In Jordan (of all places).Wow! Just Wow!It's a tad over 2 hours 40 minutes, so make sure you don't drink too much before stepping into the cinema, because you don't want to have to make the choice between peeing in your drink container or missing 3 minutes of this incredible movie! It really is a whopper of a movie!Ridley Scott toyed around with a sequel shortly after the (delayed) success of Blade Runner, but never got round to making it. It was always on his radar, apparently. This time round, he came back as a producer, commissioning Denis Villenue (who did Sicario, Prisoners and Arrival) to shoot the film.Denis said this about the making the film, ""I know that every single fan will walk into the theater with a baseball bat. I'm aware of that and I respect that, and it's okay with me because it's art. Art is risk, and I have to take risks. It's gonna be the biggest risk of my life but I'm okay with that. For me it's very exciting... It's just so inspiring, I'm so inspired. I've been dreaming to do sci-fi since I was 10 years old, and I said 'no' to a lot of sequels. I couldn't say 'no' to Blade Runner 2049. I love it too much, so I said, 'Alright, I will do it and give everything I have to make it great.'"".He was right. Any hardcore fan was going to be watching carefully. Very carefully.Not only does it feature Harrison Ford, but it stars brooding young Blade Runner cop ""K"" (presumably after the late Philip K. Dick, the author of the original sci-fi story, upon which the original Blade Runner film was based) is played by Ryan Gosling along with Ana de Armas (""Joi"") and Sylvia Hoeks (""Luv""). Incredibly, there are cameos by Edward James Olmos (""Gaff"") (with a sentence or two of ""Cityspeak"", which EJO actually created himself as a blend of English, German, Japanese, Hungarian and Japanese) and also ____________ (at the end of the movie).The movie is set 30 years after the original Blade Runner. Eldon Tyrell is, of course, dead, and main bad guy behind the scenes is Jared Leto's character, Niander Wallace. Blade Runners are still around, but this time, they're out to hunt Nexus 8 models who were created to have a longer than 4 year lifespan that the Nexus 6 replicants had (in Blade Runner).True to the original, the cinematography is breathtaking, but the scenes aren't as dark and broody as the original. The CGI is incredible. Every scene is different and it seems clear that they've spent a lot of time thinking how a scene will be shot to bring out the perspective of the seemingly massive sets. As in the original, it is actually quite immersive.There's also some subtle and not so subtle homages to the original which are well documented elsewhere.Hans Zimmer along with Benjamin Wallfisch composed the electronic music score in a similar vein to Vangelis, but Vangelis still has the edge. The music seemed a little too refined compared to the grand opera statement that Vangelis makes.In terms of the plot, it's fantastic. I won't give anything away here, but to say that the incredible special effects don't overshadow the story line. The penny may drop earlier in the movie for some acute watchers, but it's still thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. It really is a detective film which does keep you guessing how things will pan out, nearly to the end.Weirdly enough, there seem to be some visual cues to Ridley Scott's Aliens movies, too. I guess it's not surprising, given the fact that Ridley Scott is the producer.Ryan Gosling was absolutely custom made for this role. The guy just looks fantastic in the overcoat and reminds me of a James Dean type character, but with a more sensitive edge to him.Harrison Ford is incredible as well, particularly in the interview at the end! I knew it was coming, but it was great how they incorporated him into the story.Well, it doesn't beat the original. But that's not to say it's bad. It still kills 99% of the films out there. And that, even as a sequel.Hope you get to enjoy the film as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The first was correct, the danger's to forget","I use IMDb and am genuinely troubled by the high rating of this movie, which is the impetus for writing this.I was born 8 years before Blade Runner came out, and may have seen it in one of its forms 20 times, or maybe twice that many. It has by now become a part of the luminous, cyclical geometry of my spirit, or as close to sacred as I can define.The three golden threads of the original- identity, memory and mortality, have either inspired the themes of my introspective path, or the latter is the reason I keep coming back to the work of art.Before watching the sequel I watched the original last night on my wall, and like always, it opened like a fractal. Revealing a new dimension in a familiar scape.So it turns out that Blade Runner was, besides anything else, a prophecy. At the dawn of the digital it saw the failure of memory to sustain our human flame. It proposed that machine or flesh are besides the point. It is remembering, in the face of our end, that saves us. We are real to the degree that our memory moves us (enter Vangelis). But memory itself was a delicate thing (enter Vangelis), and must be guarded. In other words, finding real emotion within, the artificial has found itself. This was done so subtly (enter Vangelis), and the film's magic was connecting the viewer with her own nostalgia as if it were Deckard's. When he finds the origami unicorn his reaction is, in so few words, ""so what"".Well into the digital now, propelled this way and that by cloud based identities, the new film makes a different proposition. That machine or flesh are besides the point. Emotions, when they arise, are deviations whether you are android or man. Were there any humans in the movie? I can confidently say barely. This is art in the age of digital identity, not memory. Certainly not Memories of Green. If identity exists at all, it is by selection. When K thinks the horse is his, he breaks down not cathartically but in seeming vexation. When he realizes it isn't his reaction is, in so few words, ""what now"".Less abstractly, and in the vein of several other grounded reviews, the film is boring. It really starts when Deckard beautifully says ""Rachel"" and ends with her actual image from the original a few moments later. A few moments after that in proper Transformer fashion a drone departs a flying car.. A good two hours or more into the film. It is 2017, so add a healthy pinch of martial arts and guns, and guns. There is a story, I think. K is searching for... Wallace is attempting to... Deckard is hiding from...Nothing really. They've mostly forgotten.The music is painfully bad. Sorry Hans. You are one of the greats, but there are no electric sheep without Vangelis.There is some beautiful art direction and cinematography, but towards the end it is absurdly overdone in an apocalyptic design that throws everything into the hat, looking like the Vegas Luxor on mushrooms.The acting is a mixed bag, with a lot of potential brought low by mediocre writing. He failed, but I still think Gosling was a perfect choice. His psychopath nemesis, whatever her appearance signifies about how we see us and technology, was an interesting performance.I've exceeded my allotted portion of attention. I was afraid, I think, of loving the new one as much as these reviews suggest I should. I can now forget it and go back to loving 1982. To remembering. Has this film jumped to the 51st best within less than a week because of an army of bots? Or because we have forgotten something? Either would be appropriately cyberpunk.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Did NOT get the hate for Blade Runner 2049. At all.,"Blade Runner 2049 was gorgeous. That much, no one can deny. As someone who was only generally understanding of the first Blade Runner film, I have to admit that I had a lot of catching up to do. However, after some research (and a genuine pledge to finally watch the original in its entirety), I can thoroughly say that this movie does not deserve the hate it has gotten. I have honestly never written a movie review.From start to finish, the movie was beautiful in its essence, using many geometric shapes, and also overlaying environments with different elemental patterns. I was entranced by just about every scene. Usually, a film can handle doing this for a few consequential scenes, but the fact that Blade Runner 2049 seems to do it so artistically and seamlessly in every scene seems nothing less than magic.For all the viewers lambasting that the only true lure is the feminine form, and that they are likely to only think of the female characters as eye-candy for their later self-gratifications... Ew. Methinks most of the fault in this area lies in the fact that you view almost all women as objects in movies. The women in the movie (while very idealistic, but hey, they are REPLICANTS) serve very important roles, and do not merely fall to being props. I was happy with the roles they served.The story, while a bit drawn out, is nonetheless full of emotion and feeling, making it easy to stay with. It may not have been a very fast-pasted, easy-to-understand sci-if story, but it was extremely fleshed-out. The questions I was left with didn't seem to be pointing toward a sequel, but rather a need to re-watch. Plot-holes that some users have pointed to in the fact that 'K' COULDN'T have denied his programming and lied to his superiors because he's a replicant is completely moot because that is what Deckard in-fact did. And also why the whole idea that created beings cannot deviate. A central theme in the original as well.I could go on and on about the complaints that I've seen, but I honestly think it would fall on deaf ears. This movie was sooo soooo well worth the cost of renting. I hadn't expected much after the dismal reviews, but I was oh, so pleasantly surprised. It's rare that I find the reviews to be oh-so completely wrong. But I'm glad I took a chance. Everyone involved (especially Ana de Armas!) should be so proud of what they created. All the creepy weirdos who subscribe to the ""if I can't see myself having sex with it, it isn't valid!"" school of cinematography, no need to review this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Blade runner 2049: Harrison Ford is still the Ultimate Blade Runner,"I was (and still am) a big fan of the iconic 1982 original. The grey, dingy, unattractive visual appearance has influenced the look of the 'future' in almost every other sci-fi film since.The original plot has had audiences discussing the 'is he or isn't he' Deckard character for over 30 years. I anticipated something special, but surprisingly felt a little let down. My spontaneous reaction is that besides the very noisy soundtrack and overlong run-time, it's hard to pin-point the reason for the lack of magic, which the original had in abundance, as there's nothing wrong but nothing very special either.2049 sequel won't endure in quite the same way, probably not worthy of a second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

And for God's sake, what's the point of the ending?? Is this all from the sequel of a masterpiece: to die for the good purpose? Really? It's so weak that it hurts. The only positive thing about the movie that it tries very hard to respect the first one, that's why I gave two stars.

"A review of ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017)","Denis Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017) is indeed a worthy sequel, even if it cannot equal Ridley Scott's seminal 1982 original film. (And this is absolutely understandable -- I opine that Scott's dour, challenging ""Blade Runner"" is arguably the greatest movie of all time.) Some of it worked, and some of it didn't -- but I sufficiently enjoyed this movie to rate it a 9 out of 10.There is a lot going on here in terms of plot. I won't be specific about what I liked and what I didn't like, because I want to avoid spoilers. (There are definitely some surprise plot developments, and this is a relatively recent film that fans have waited no fewer than 35 years to see.) But I'm happy to report that ""Blade Runner 2049"" satisfies by being a direct and logical follow-up in terms of character, plot and setting.I do think that this would be a stronger standalone story if it had included the material that was relegated to the online short films that serve as its companions. (You can find all three of them at Open Culture right here.) The first one, ""Black Out 2022,"" is probably necessary to understanding the feature film's story and ought to be required viewing.The visuals were vivid and arresting, the action sequences were generally satisfying, and the acting across the board was quite good. Harrison Ford was predictably perfect. Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks are suitably intense and make terrific bad guys. (I've always loved Leto's work -- even his criminally underappreciated, spot-on interpretation of DC Comics' ""The Joker."") And Carla Juri nearly steals the entire movie with her mesmerizing performance in a supporting role.What I liked best about ""Blade Runner 2049"" was how surprisingly well it captured the ... vibe, I guess, of the first film -- its existential angst and the surprising tragic nobility of its characters. Simply put, this film got the feeling right. For me, this was best evidenced by a poetic subplot between the characters played by Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas. It's great dystopian science fiction -- a fusion of troubling futurism and genuine human emotion. And the mood was greatly enhanced by an evocative score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch.There are were a couple of things that I didn't like -- they were plot points that I won't detail here. The pacing also felt too slow, at times. (This is a long movie, at two hours and 44 minutes.) And the the climactic fight scene felt just a bit claustrophobic and awkwardly executed. (It's a far cry from the epic feel of the original's rainswept rooftop confrontation.)I'd still cheerfully recommend ""Blade Runner 2049"" to fans of Scott's film. I'd caution them to sit down with it with as few expectations as possible, though, and to just enjoy this second chapter on its own merits. It's mostly great stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Best Sci Fi Film Since the First Blade Runner,"Films will have the influence and staying power of the groundbreaking original but it's clear from the beginning that this no mere piece of nostalgic fan service. Denis Villeneuve and his team are remarkably ambitious, using the topics raised by ""Blade Runner"" to continue the conversation instead of just repeating it to make a buck. To that end, they have made one of the most deeply philosophical and challenging sci-fi films of all time, a movie that never holds your hand as it spirals the viewer through its gorgeous funhouse of the human soul. Villeneuve and the team at Warner Brothers have asked critics to be incredibly precious with spoilers, not even revealing things that the film does mere minutes into its running time. It's been decades since the action of the first film, but the replicant-destroying Blade Runner is still a profession, personified here by Ryan Gosling as an agent known as K. His duty now is to track down old replicants who have gone into hiding, living long past their originally-programmed lifespan. In the film's opening, Officer K tracks down a replicant who is just trying to live a peaceful life as a farmer (a spectacled Dave Bautista. Spurring K to solve a mystery about his own past, the history of replicants, the power of memory, and what it means to be a human being. Robin Wright, Jared Leto, and Harrison Ford co-star. In that sense, It's a fantastic performance, and Villeneuve draws great ones from Sylvia Hoeks and Ana de Armas as well. The film did drag a little for me near the end of the first hour when I wanted it to pick up the pace, and some of the characters feel like they do things dictated by plot necessity more than believable behavior, but that's a criticism that could fade on repeat viewing.""Blade Runner 2049"" answers one of its own questions about what it means to be human-to have free thought-and how vital it is to appreciate art so clearly designed to enrich the soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A replicant of the first one,"It's been hard not to think of how this one was going to go if you were a film fan this week. Yeah, I know the reviews have been glowing and it's based on something that is so visually iconic. But it's also so perfectly imperfect.Yes, the 35 year old film has that China Town setting and the Deckard apartment is such an architectural marvel and the film at it's core speaks to the cruelty of giving a consciousness to something that will never be seen as having anything to do with humanity.Just there is something to that uttered expression most people give after seeing it for the first time, which is ""that was slow"". And it does lack urgency, the performances, even from human characters, seem robotic, and while there is stuff for the brain and the eye to take in, the heart just seems missing.In fact while there are many similarities visually and story-wise to A.I., I would say A.I. just grabs me more because it just hits you right here (heart).And you've probably heard this before but i'll say it again- if you loved the first then you'll love this. If you didn't like it, well the nearly 3 hour run time here won't help. Why? Because it's basically the same movie.Ryan Gosling is now the Blade Runner, basically a cop charged with taking down older version androids in future Los Angeles. In 2049, there are all types of different tech including holograms, new slave androids, and apparently even one android who managed to get herself pregnant.That later thing is what starts the Gosling character off on a mission to find Harrison Ford's old Blade Runner Rick Deckard. His travels take us through dreary off world territory used for farms, trash dumps, and child labor camps.The visual artistry here can't be denied, from the neon signs adorning most of Los Angeles, the vast orange and blue colored wastelands surrounding it, or just how cold the city has become, cinematographer Roger Deakins has never made L.A. look more un-inviting.Just as we go on this investigation it becomes pretty clear that a Blade Runner sequel, while not exactly boring, is not exactly necessary and also that director Denis Villeneuve was given way too much leeway as far as the run-time is concerned.And i'm not just saying this because it feels like it takes forever for it to finally have some urgency, it's also following a lot of similar stuff from the first movie.A main character with a mystery surrounding what exactly he is, another character who has some type of disease that leaves them isolated and creating a life of her own through technology, thematically we're still asking the same question of what is real, what feels real, and why giving consciousness to anything only to take away free will is a dick move.In this approach I mean i guess you could say the cast does OK, although I thought everybody from Gosling, Ford, and Jared Leto playing the barely seen head of the new company creating replicants, were all a bit one note.So I mean this is a tough one for me to score since I like the first one well enough but at the end of the day I just don't feel there was enough new here to really warrant a recommendation.So I go 6 out of 10.

The pictures that this film creates are incredible! The story makes sense from beginning to end, is somehow complex, but somehow not. The new figures fit perfectly into the Universe and everyone has a purpose and a place.

The best movie cyberpunk of 2017 and in general last 5 years,"The best movie cyberpunk of 2017 and in general last 5 years. Yes the sequel is much simpler than the original. In general Denis Villeneuve the excellent director, has perfectly reported the atmosphere of the original, but after all the first hour of the movie is tightened and in general almost doesn't bear important semantic loading. Jarrett Leto has perfectly played the antagonist, will be sure continuation soon and he will be revealed completely as personnel. And the main thing, is an ending. She has a little disappointed, after all there is a wish to see the complete final, let and open, but complete.

Better than the first.,"First things first...this is by far superior to Blade Runner (1982) in every single aspect. It's acted better, better dialogue, better visuals, better sound design, better plot, and slightly better pacing. But it's that SLIGHTLY better pacing which makes me rate this one higher.The overall story and premise of the film is not that interesting at all, and has moments where scenes absolutely drag and drag for no reason whatsoever.I really enjoyed the romantic story with ""Joe"" and Joi. Romance between the protagonist is done significantly superior in Blade Runner 2049 than Blade Runner (1982).The stuff with Deckard was a mix, and his entrance was a bit cringe, as if he just stood there waiting for the American audience to stop cheering and clapping 😂Better than the first, but not enough actually going on.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

As amazing imagination for the future as the original film,"""Blader Runner"" shook the world in 1982 with the amazing futuristic images, including the streets in blue light, pouring acid rain, vivid neon ads on the towering buildings, and vehicles flying among them. ""2049"" is no doubt qualified as the sequel, because it has done the same thing for the audience of 2017.I was very overwhelmed by the creators' imagination all along with the film. Designs of devices, interiors, and landscapes are excellent. Wallace Corporation seems as if a very modern library and an ancient ruin at the same time. A newborn replicant drops out of a plastic bag just like a packaged food. The memory artist Ana creates a birthday party scene just like a game creator placing some NPCs.The best thing among them is Joi, the pretty hologram AI girl. I find it interesting that a home devise advances to a mobile version, and Joi herself is very happy with that. I believe she has a sincere love for K, and it's sad to see her image break down with noise when disturbed by some failure.The plot has a clear center: the unprecedented replicant child who was born from a mother 30 years ago. Joshi, Luv, and K, each seeks the child with slightly different reasons. It becomes further exciting when some clues suggest K himself is the child. We see then the mystery lead to the aftermath of the original film, the love of Decard and Racheal (So it is recommended to watch the original film first).Like the original, the light, color, and misty effect work well. Basic colors are blue and orange, the former is mysterious and thoughtful while the latter makes you feel as if you are getting close to the end of the world.As the only flaw, the tempo is unnecessarily slow. But the other good things easily offset it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Will bio-engineered humans take over the future?,"This is the sequel to a cult classic of the early '80s. It is the next phase of a dystopia that was created on earth due to the depletion of natural resources. Bio-engineered humans developed to a level where they can now reproduce themselves, instead of just providing slave labour. What established Blade Runner among hard core fans is the artistic perspective this dystopia is based upon. It creates vivid and mixed human responses including fear for the future, sadness for the current quality of life and short-term hope, according to the technological advancements like the flying cars or the ability to enable the space travel.The main evil character is Wallace (played by Jared Leto), a man that tries to re-enable the ability of replicants to reproduce themselves just like normal human beings. The actor is very successful in his role due to the devotion he showed. His words contain poetic expressions for communicating the views about replicants and their purpose, to the audience. This is a peak moment for the story since this psychic person is a fundamental aspect of the story. While trying to be more realistic, he didn't protect himself from exaggerations though. He blinded himself for a short period of time just to get a better understanding of his role. This is a false reaction since the main purpose of an actor is to emulate a different personality, not to try becoming one. He has no real experience in this state (as a blind man), so he has more chances to behave inconsistently.The basic weakness of this movie is the wooden way the actors play their parts. This can give the reason of the low financial earnings during the first availability to the public. Replicants are not robots, they are humans. There is no reason for them not to behave like typical human beings, showing feelings and vivid behaviour (bear in mind the first Blade Runner). The mechanical way the actors portray their roles (like 'K'), leaves the audience in a state where they cannot connect to the protagonists by observing their character development. For example, 'K' is a completely different character from the female hologram which is coded to show vivid human behaviour. They don't breathe the same way and this looks non-functional to the audience.The complexity of the script and the long running time are not show-stopper factors. There are many successful movies that approach the 3-hour timestamp and are complex as well. The viewers don't get bored due to the duration, but they do so when there is no connection to the main characters. The so-called slow pace (have you seen European independent movies?) is not show-stopper either. It can be considered as part of the art. It leaves time to the viewer to assimilate the environment and become one with that.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A flawed masterpiece.,"Blade Runner 2049 is a fantastic movie filled with brilliant performances great characters, near perfect cinematography that make up for the sub-par story and writing. 
It's exiting to see that there are still filmmakers that have both a unique style and the bravery to do something different. While Dennis Villeneuve doesn't have the most distinctive style, he still is one of the best directors working right now, making unique and interesting films that are pushed forward by stellar performances, and 2049 is no different. What Villeneuve does with the world of Blade Runner is expand the scope, and this pays off amazingly. The original Blade Runner (based on Philip K. Dick's book) is a movie that is flawed but still good, having an amazing production value and a world that feels realistic yet is brought down by a mediocre story and a bland main character. 2049 takes this elements and makes the better in almost every way, introducing a new main character that is both complex and interesting. Yet 2049 still has a pretty mediocre story, having a sub-plot at the end that has no real pay-off and some voice over that is there to spell things out for viewers even though it's pretty clear to begin with.
The movie has some cool symbolism with the character of Luv.
The movie also has what I consider to be, Harrison Ford's best performance yet, considering how mediocre he was in The force awakens.

Neo-Noir Perfection: Blade Runner 2049,"Blade Runner 2049, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is a visually stunning and intellectually profound continuation of the original 1982 classic. Set 30 years after the original, the film follows K (Ryan Gosling), a replicant ""blade runner"" who uncovers a long-buried secret that could destabilize society. With breathtaking cinematography by Roger Deakins, an evocative score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, and powerful performances by Gosling and Harrison Ford, the film explores themes of identity, memory, and humanity. Villeneuve masterfully expands on Ridley Scott's dystopian vision, creating a mesmerizing and thought-provoking experience that solidifies Blade Runner 2049 as a modern sci-fi masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A worthy sequel but nowhere near as monumental as Blade Runner.,"This movie provided closure I didn't ask for. One of the main thing's which is wrong with this film is that it panders to the modern trend of providing the audience (spoonfeeding, moreso) unnecessary closure - leaving no stone for the imagination to turn over, and more felt like a cash-in, sadly, than something which was organically -already- -there- in Ridley Scott (or whoever's mind)While not doing anything better than the first, it was still pretty good.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A welcomed expansion to Scott's universe,"Back when I first saw the original sci-fi classic ""Blade Runner"", I never thought I'd get to see a sequel to it. Slowly times were changing and sequels, remakes and reboots were at the front-end of Hollywood's production line and by looking the quality of said sequels, I feared that a continuation of ""Blade Runner"" would be a bad idea. Well, I am glad to be wrong! Not only ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a masterpiece of film making, it's also one of the best additions to the science-fiction genre in the past decade.Denis Villeneuve's class is remarkable, after his first stab at a sci-fi with ""Arrival"", the French-Canadian director manages to push himself even further and re-imagine the dystopian universe created decades ago by Ridley Scott. Partnering up once again with famed cinematographer Roger Deakins, the two expanded Scott's neo-noir classic to greater distances, sweeping up an abundance of awards just for cinematography alone, include an academy award.The story takes place 30 years after the events of the first movie, where a young Blade Runner, played by Ryan Gosling seeks out the truth about himself, leading to the search of Rick Deckard, played by the same tireless Harrison Ford. Having Ford on board was crucial to the development on the script, proving that his grouchiness was essential to the character's current beaten down state of mind.
Another solid point is Dave Bautista's knack for playing supporting characters who won't steal the show, but will add plenty to the scenes they're in.""Blade Runner 2049"" has a long running time, almost reaching 3 hours and yes the pace was slow at times, but that should not make you leave the theater or fast-forward the movie at home. It's not surprising that it didn't perform beyond expectations at the box-office, slow paced gritty neo-noir aren't for everyone and certainly not for the ""Transformers"" era of cinema.While it does top it's predecessor, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is an example of a sequel done right, just like ""Terminator 2"" and ""Aliens"".",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not a big Ryan Gosling fan,The movie was beautifully shot and captured the dystopian future brilliantly but it just wasn't for me. I'm not a big fan of these types of dystopian futures.

To be fair I didn't watch the first one before this so I'm sure that would have added some value to it.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"SciFi as Art. Possibly, a generation-specific film?","It's a faster moving world these days, and some viewers seem not to be satisfied without a continuous feed of gratuitous action. Films that take their time in delivering their story, seem to not be capable of feeding the adrenaline needs those viewers. Some viewers complained that this film was too long, and ""could have been"" tighter. If you are someone who wants the plot points ""quickly ticked off"", scene after scene, so you can get to the final outcome, then this film is probably not going to satisfy you. I should also say that if you didn't find Blade Runner compelling, then this sequel is probably going to be a non-starter.As background, I saw Blade Runner when it first opened. It was stunning, both in its beauty, and, albeit dystopian, its view of the future. Everything about it was captivating, and when I left the theatre, I had a feeling similar to the one I had when I walked out of Star Wars, roughly five years earlier. I knew that I had seen something that would still be special, decades later, and I ""wanted more"" from that same universe. I obviously didn't expect that, in the case of Blade Runner, it would be a 35 year wait for that to happen.The spoiler-free version of this story, assuming you are familiar with Blade Runner, is that (per the title) this takes place 30 years after the original. The original film ended (depending on which ""film cut"" you saw) with Deckard and Rachael attempting to run away to ""somewhere"" that they hoped to be safe. We see nothing of those intervening years (acted out) in the sequel, but instead, find ourselves in the middle of what starts out as a police activity, but, purely through a chance discovery, quickly is recognized as something that has ties to the final moments of the original film. Suffice it to say that several different factions (at least three) quickly become interested in the implications that result from that police investigation, and the rest of the film plays out with its main character, pretty much caught in the middle of those factions. The film does, sometimes directly, and sometime indirectly, provide some closure to the fate of characters from the original film.So, what is good (in my humble opinion) about this this film (and why I never get bored re-watching it)? Denis took his time ""painting"" this story. He didn't just rush through the new film's plot points, in an effort to ""tick them off"", in order to squeeze them into another, standard, box office ""two-hour"" movie. The original film was as much about ""look and feel"" as it was story. If you were sitting in a theater (or a dark room at home), you ""soaked in"" Blade Runner, just as much as you watched it. My ""impression"" is that Denis recognized that he needed to create that same feeling in the sequel, and that there were points in the film where he could have simply ""jump-cut"" to the next scene (i.e. the ""next destination"" for that character). Doing so would have saved a truck-load of money in VFX, but instead, Denis choose to paint a tapestry of the same (albeit 30 years newer) dystopian world, and allow the viewer to ""simmer"" in that dystopian soup, as the ""character at that moment in the film"" made his/her way to their next destination. As with the original movie, there are many visuals of this world, both from the ground, and from the air, where you are given the time to absorb its unique appearance. Some are fantastically futurist, and others depict the dystopian mess that exists ""just outside of"" the ""better places"" to live. In short, it attempts to continually be every bit as visually compelling as the original, so that you always feel more like you are in those places, instead of simply viewing them. And lastly, the film score, albeit a new score, attempts to adhere to a similar ""electronic"" feel as the original, which, from the very beginning, also serves to evoke the feeling that this is one continuous story. (Not unlike how John Williams' Star Wars scores instantly tie those films together, even before you see the first scene.)Again, to avoid spoilers, it is hard to say much more. As stated earlier, if you wanted more of the Blade Runner ""universe"", then I would be surprised if you did not really enjoy this sequel. If all of the special effects movies of the last two decades have put you in a place where a viewing of Blade Runner left you wondering ""what was all the fuss about"", and/or, if you just don't care what happened after that original movie ended, then you might as well spend your time viewing some other film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Breathtaking cinematography,"""Our lives mean nothing next to a storm that's coming. Dying for the right cause. It's the most human thing we can do.""So I watched this movie for the first time on the plane. Haven't seen the first one, I was hecka confused about what I just watched. So this time I watch the 1984 final cut first. Honestly, except the last monologue, I thought that first movie was a snooze fest. 2049 improved a lot more than the 1984, but still I thought the pacing was a bit too slow.What's significantly better was the story, which was more intense and harder to predict than the first. There was also more characterization to the main blade runner, played by the subdued Ryan Gosling. He had to figure out his past, and the twists and turns made his journey much more interesting than Deckard in the 1984 movie.The cinematography was undeniably top-notch. Almost every shot was breathtaking and gorgeous. Ana de Armas looked out of this world, just like she was in No Time to Die.Overall, I wasn't entirely onboard with the story, but I definitely enjoyed the beautiful look of the dystopian world. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Visual and philosophical masterpiece!,"A bioengineered android detective navigates a mysterious case while also trying to come to grips with his own existential crises. Blade Runner 2049 could be viewed as a re-imagining of Pinocchio in a cyberpunk future by Denis Villeneuve, who continues his streak as a true visionary director. The movie is both visually flawless and mind-bendingly philosophical, with deep examinations of identity and what it means to be a person.Fans of the predecessor might hate me for saying it, but I think this sequel is much better and can probably be viewed without seeing the first. With a longer run-time, the universe and characters were able to be explored in a more satisfying way, and a much stronger connection of empathy and emotion was established (not just talked about) early on. There seem to be clearly inspired moments from the likes of Her and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with beautifully intimate depictions of love, loneliness, longings, dreams, and memories - a few of which that stand out as some of the most iconic and impressive scenes I've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Blade Runner 2049 (2017),"It has been a while since I've seen it, but the original Blade Runner is a fantastic sci-fi film and up there with some of the best of all time. Ridley Scott used to be such a cutting edge filmmaker and the themes and visuals of the original Blade Runner still resonates well all these years later. When I heard about Blade Runner 2049, I was mixed- but only for a little bit. I love Ryan Gosling and Ana De Armas is stunning. The trailer looked like a visual feast and the attachment of Dennis Villeneuve heightened the hype surrounding the picture. Having seen it on opening night, there are many positives albeit some problems and concerns I had.The film takes place decades after the first film where K (played by THE GOS) is a newer modeled replicant who is also a blade runner tasked with taking out older models. He stumbles across a mystery of a replicant giving birth, which was previously thought to be impossible. He is tasked with finding that child but must also stave up the forces of Wallace, who is a prominent creator of replicants. K also unearths information about Deckerd who has gone into hiding since the events of Blade Runner.The first thing I have to praise is the absolutely eye-popping, crisp, and vivid cinematography. The scenes are phenomenal. The sheer gorgeous nature of the picture is worth seeing it in theaters all by itself. This is expected with the legendary Roger Deakins and Villeneuve at the helm. The bright lights and barren landscape of the future are just stunning. The CGI is some of the best you will ever see. The soundtrack is loud and at times jarring but very effective in mood and tone setting.I actually loved seeing Ryan Gosling's K in a relationship with the computerized but very intelligent girlfriend, Joi. I love Ana de Armas and love that she's getting more work after Knock Knock. Sylvia Hoeks, who I really enjoyed in The Best Offer, is also ridiculously compelling as a menacing villainous henchwoman to Wallace. I had problems with Wallace's motivations. His dedication to go after the child born from a replicant doesn't seem strongly motivated. He's also speaking too prophetically and metaphorically a little too often. The writing has a few holes in it. Its not perfect, but is acceptable and is complemented by stunning cinema display and action.The film is very long. I think 20 or so minutes could have been condensed to make the film a little more succinct and effective. It was always going to be hard making a sequel to Blade Runner. Was it necessary? Absolutely not. Does the film deliver? Yes, its one of the best visual films I've ever seen. Is it great? Almost. It seems like the type of film that could use a re-watch to let the plot and and character displays really sink in. Its still a really admirable effort from Villeneuve, who is one of the top filmmakers going today.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Blade Runner 2049 Review,"While Blade Runner 2049 boasts a visually stunning world and a high IMDB rating, it fails to capture the magic and depth of its predecessor. The film, unfortunately, is a hollow shell, devoid of the compelling narrative and emotional resonance that made the original a cinematic masterpiece.The pacing is sluggish, with scenes dragging on unnecessarily. The plot twists, while executed well, are not enough to salvage the overall experience. The film's thematic exploration of humanity and identity, while intriguing, is hampered by unexplained plot points and unanswered questions.The original Blade Runner was a product of its time, a bold and innovative vision that pushed the boundaries of cinema. It was a raw and gritty exploration of existentialism, wrapped in a stunning dystopian aesthetic. Blade Runner 2049, on the other hand, feels like a corporate product, meticulously crafted but lacking soul.It's a film that prioritises style over substance, offering a visually impressive but emotionally shallow experience. Despite its lengthy runtime, it fails to leave a lasting impression, unlike its predecessor.In conclusion, Blade Runner 2049 is a disappointing sequel that struggles to live up to the legacy of its iconic predecessor.

Blade Runner 2049 molds an alternate dystopian future thirty years after the original classic,"Being a fan of the original film I was not very optimistic that the sequel would be another cult classic. I also doubted that this would leave me feeling like I'd want to see it again just to understand what had gone on in its dark, mysterious and grim backdrop, as I had after seeing the original. Even if you have not seen the first film, movie goers can watch this and still understand what is happening and keep up with the storyline. It certainly is a joy to watch and well worth the 2 hours and 45 minutes viewing time.What began with Ridley Scott long ago has been vivified with new sharpness by director Denis Villeneuve.The last film I watched directed by Denis Villeneuve was the action-thriller 'Sicario' a film I enjoyed thoroughly and was visually excellent. Here he has directed a film that is just superb in every aspect from the acting to the visual effects and storyline, and leaves us thinking for days after watching the film. There is no doubt the cinematography and visual effects here are certainly draw dropping and stunningly gorgeous - there should be no doubt that Roger Deakins will be a shoo-in for an Oscar for best cinematography. I felt myself hooked from the get go even in scenes where there is no acting or storyline - just the backdrop and stunning visuals of the futuristic city make a truly awe-inspiring film.I don't want to get into any plot details at all and spoil the movie for you, certainly we would be here a long time and would reach no actual conclusion or 100% understanding of everything! However this is what made the first Blade Runner film what it was and again the director makes this a science fiction sequel that is also placed on that higher pedestal and would take some beating if there was ever anybody with the guts to make a third Blade Runner!

Do sheep dream of organic androids?,"Blade Runner 2049 in not a bad film per se, it's a decent replica reminiscent of the original, but unfortunately it's as shallow as it's hollow. A contradiction not all that unlike to the film itself. It boasts great visuals yet this time with a sole purpose to look cool, rather than to support the story. The grimy and gritty world does not exist as it did in the previous film: dark, noiresque, full of life. This time around the grit feels superficial, sterile even. And not in the infertile kind of way. A lot of beautiful scenes but with no real purpose. I guess that's why a lot of people recommend watching it in 3D, so at least that way you'd get at least some of your money's worth.Talking about pointlessness. Mixed in with the run time. There are a few scenes that should've been dropped either because they make no sense or are just pure unnecessary exposition. Why they're in the film? Guess they felt they needed to insert one specific action scene out of nowhere just to keep the viewer from falling asleep. And obviously they needed a scene for just the bad guy so that the audience would know that he's not just regular household evil bad dude, but a few steps extra. Etc.Which brings me to how magnificently cliché ridden this film is. One would think 2049 stands for the number of overly overused solutions in storytelling that they've included in the new Blade Runner. You can rarely escape from the hurricane of clichés. I guess these days it seems to be the criteria for the Hollywood's mass produced, mainstream mental-detainment. Thinking back now, I hope I am mistaking, because I can't remember a single original or unique moment in the whole film.Perhaps it's also one of the reasons why Blade Runner 2049 lacks the depths the first one took a dive into. Sure, it tries, but its attempts are feeble. The ideals or aspirations don't resonate because, well, they seem manufactured. Pardon my pun once again.Despite all of this, and make no mistake, I am no fanboy of the first film either (though I do think it's objectively better), you can still go for the ride and enjoy it. Even if it's going to be a bit jarring because of the overall pacing, but that also gives you time to repress some of the dumbest moments and imagine what else could go on in the world like that. Because the universe in Blade Runner is by itself pretty damn cool, just a shame the second film did not improve upon that.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredible piece of art,"Without watching the prequel Blade Runner I jumped straight into the 2049 version. And to be honest it's one of the better movies i've ever seen and I can't wait to see the first. An incredible piece of art that uses fantastic movie techniques with an incredible play on colors throughout.Hearing about this movie, watching the trailer and seeing small clips on social media left me incredibly intrigued. Upon watching it i had no idea what the story was only that it was a movie with gorgeous colors and good actors.What first caught my eye in this movie was how amazing the effects were. Everything looks realistic at the same time as the entire dystopian society the movie is based in looks amazing. The colors the director use for different scenes is gorgeous with an incredible use of them that not only looks good but also creates a mood and incredible play on psychology.The acting in the movie is great at the same time the amount of characters is small making it easy to remember all of them and getting some kind of empathy for all of them. Even so you get to follow the main characters character development which makes you more and more interested in him and the story. It's one of the better characters ever written.My only real downside to this movie is the length of it and also the intricate story line. I'd say the length is not that big of an issue, 2h 43 min is standard but it's still a long time. Even so the movie is not slow there's alway something interesting happening. And intricate story might have been solved by me actually watching the first movie...In conclusion you need to watch this movie!

The Ultimate Cyberpunk Distopia,"I am a big fan of the cyberpunk aesthetic, and for me, this film captures that theme better than almost anything else. It does so on a level I've only experienced in Cyberpunk 2077 and Akira. The result is an incredible level of world-building, with stunning visuals and exceptional sound design.The acting is generally very strong, though Ryan Gosling maintains one facial expression throughout the entire movie. While this doesn't detract much from the film, it does result in a few meme-worthy moments. I particularly enjoyed Ana de Armas, who delivers a brilliant performance and fully embraces her role.Although I haven't seen the original Blade Runner, this film stands completely on its own. I didn't feel like I was missing anything, even without that context.The story is solid, but the movie's real strength lies in its flawless world-building, which immerses the viewer deeply into its universe. I often found myself feeling like Officer K, navigating this gritty, harsh world-sometimes more than I wanted to.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually Stunning 👙 and Had A Great Introduction....But Ultimately it Went Nowhere,So Disappointing.Visually The City Is Both Beautiful and Gritty which makes it A Fantastic World and it had some great ideas with the New models arresting or executing the Old Models and the New Corporation taking over the Old Corporation.The Story had a Build up to something but in the End it was Too Disappointing.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dull pointless movie,Proof that Hollywood has no new ideas. It has been evident for a long time so why did I bother with this over long boring non story that in no way adds anything new to the brilliance of the 1982 film. Characters are all non relatable. Story is thin and unclear for the most part. By the time any of it became clear I no longer cared. Visually it works but with no plot to carry you through scene after scene everything turns stale. Gimics and old pop culture references do not make it any better. Acting was placid but the roles required little emotion anyhow. Very disappointing because it could have been an interesting extension or continuation of the old film. But yet again we are served up some half baked story over sprinkled with glittery CGI. They should not have bothered.Thanks for the FF button. Had to make much use of it.,2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent. Futuristic Cinema Noir. Gosling is perfect.,"If anyone rates this less that 8 stars, they either didn't understand it or they don't like movies.Denis V can do no wrong.The movie is dark, compelling, has many nods to the original, and the actors are fantastic. The music and sound effects are brilliant and every shot is well thought out-gorgeous even in a dystopian future.One part Blade Runner (OG), one part China Town, and one part sci-fi. Cells interlinked within cells interlinked into one stem.Gosling is perfect and Leto is enigmatic.Watch it, then watch it again. I dare you.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sequel done the right way...,"One of the rare occasions when a sequel surpasses the original. And all the more difficult in this case, since the original is a cult classic. Denis Villeneuve was the perfect choice to direct the sequel and he did not disappoint, rather he exceeded expectations. No one could have played Mr. K better than Ryan Gosling, who is yet to deliver a poor performance. But the standout of this film is definitely is the cinematography, by Roger Deakins, who at least deserves a nomination if not the Oscar itself.The movie follows a similar vibe to the original in terms of lighting, pace and storytelling. There are no pointless action sequences or unnecessary exaggerations. It is rather pretty grounded for a sci-fi. It is a proper noir film where one thing leads to another in an investigation undertaken by the protagonist. There are no pointless dialogues and forced comedic scenes. The plot gains depth in such a subtle manner, you won't feel that you are being filled in with too much information in such a limited time frame. Despite some of the characters having limited screen time, they're purpose is well understood as they are constantly mentioned throughout the film. The only drawback is that there are a few build-ups that lead to nothing.All in all, a phenomenal movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and will probably be a classic in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing!,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film.
It was indeed beautifully shot and all the digital effects are well done,, but beyond that there s nothing.
You definitely have to see the original first. If you don't , this film doesn't make a lot of sense because a lot of things in the original movie are needed here.
Also, is everyone in the future dead sullen and speaks in quiet deliberate voice.?
Is everyone the future void of emotion or something? Wow. 
Sorry, but this movie just didn't do it for me.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Masterpiece,"Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is a natural progression from the original film in terms of tone, themes and narrative. It deepens and expands on the original's narrative template to dizzying levels and in my book this is a much better film. From the opening establishing shots coupled with Hans Zimmer's intimidating score, I was awash in a bubble of déjà vu and 35 years whizzed by just like that (snap).There are many ways to tell a Blade Runner story – it could have gone by way of a regurgitation of the same old ideas or simply a re-boot, maxing out all the elements that made the original an enduring classic, but Blade Runner 2049 organically furthers narrative elements in the original to a deeper and philosophical place, making one contemplate over the theme of what makes a human being a human being.Like the original, there is a Neo noir element tied to the proceedings, and Ryan Gosling takes over where Harrison Ford left off. Gosling's deadpan expression is inscrutable, but behind the facade lies vulnerability. Some of the best scenes involved him and his virtual girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas oh la la). Watch out for a sex scene involving a surrogate that betters the one in Her (2013). It is at once scintillating and tender, but also profoundly sad.Harrison Ford returns in his original role and right now at his age he plays it marvellously, grumpy and tired, as it should be. His return doesn't feel like sentimental fan service and is woven neatly into the compelling narrative. Unlike, A Force Awakens, Ford does put in a shift.Narratively, Villeneuve doesn't pander or pays homage readily, meticulously forging his own mythology. Does Villeneuve even know how to make a bad movie? Characters speak little and mistrust in relationships is the glue that binds. The story feels opaque, filled with enigmas. The world is as bleak as the one 30 years ago, but updated to show a deeper sense of social disconnect. The CGI is outstanding – for nearly 3 hours, I was transported to a world that feels ""it could happen"". Cityscapes and landscapes, I have never seen before in all the countless sci-fi movies I have seen. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is breathtaking – please tell me this is his finally his year.The near 3-hour runtime does offer pacing problems, but I find it so easy to luxuriate in this emotionless dystopian world and look for fleeting instances of hope and glimpses of humanity. If there's another weakness, it is in the villainy of Niander Wallace's character, played by Jared Leto. He just isn't bad ass enough, but thankfully there's his bodyguard Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) who kicks ass.This is easily one of the year's best films. It aims for the sky and lands up in outer space, way beyond my wildest dreams. This needs to be experienced in IMAX and I don't even use the word ""seen"".",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No good deed goes unpunished.,"One can say that maybe this film closer to Dick's tale than the first. If you delete all the scenes and dialogs related with the bots uprising, It's like a screenplay done by a psychotic writer with two personalities, one is a man who likes dark stories about humanity, ethics and sentiments, other is wrote by a personality dominated by a producer wanabe that wants a blockbuster. Hard job for the director to join that two personalities in a good looking and half of the time interesting movie, with characters acting divided into boring and interesting depending on the storyline told.One story is deep and inspiring, yet sad and desolating, the other is just another rise of the robots nonsense that could be a great action success. I Hope that one day the director does two final cuts, one with the sad story and one with the action movie. They could be very good movies, but together they lack sense, a real pity.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
KISS,"Not as memorable as the original, but good. Here are some reasons I wasn't super impressed. Also included is a basic guide to who is what.
1. Seems to be a paucity of flying cars unlike the original which had them practically running into each other, now most of the movie you just see the one. Same old poor science of vehicles making swooshing sounds (whether in the near vacuum of space or though the air on whatever planet). Never did figure out the propulsion system - oh well, details.
2. The movie's secondary theme was for the new Replicant ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) to dispatch the old replicants, but you don't see a cohesive storyline on that. K's killing of one of the last of the original Replicants (Sapper) who has spent the last 30 years just being a lonely farmer of protein for humanity didn't make any sense, and left a bad taste since he was a good guy. There are creative ways to deal with this situation, but the writers took the cheap way.
3. Another secondary theme was Mr. Wallace's (bad guy) purchase of the Tyrell Corp. (the old Replicant makers) so that he can build an army to take over. Luv is his Replicant assistant that does the dirty work.
4. The primary theme of the movie is K's search (as well as Mr. Wallace & Luv) to find the daughter (and/or son) of a union between old Deckard and old Replicant Rachael thus giving insight into a potential new human/replicant super race. Unfortunately the tale of this mysterious offspring and Rachael's later re-animation (which was an incredible bit of CGI) received little story/movie time. Also not explained is how the biology for this union would have even the remotest possibility.
5. Not clearly written or played out was the subplot of a 6-10-21 labeled toy horse (and labeled tree) that belonged to the perhaps dead son of this union and is now in K's possession or is it in the ashes of a furnace?
6. Also not clear were all the Biblical references as if the regular audience should ferret them out in span of a couple of hours watching. The original film had a more thematic impact that was clearly understandable with less obscurity.
7. Storyline left hanging was the new Replicant potential uprising near the end of the film, and Deckard/Rachael's daughter now living in a bubble (right under baddie Mr. Wallace's watch). Also left hanging is K's demise (or not)?
8. True to the original there's lots of rain; neon lights; overhanging tall buildings, and no sunny skies.
Conclusion: The original had more thoughtful impact.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Future of the Future,"""Blade Runner 2049"" is before anything else, an astonishing technical achievement and it should be celebrated for that alone. It is also a bold continuation to the story and the mystique of the original Blade Runner film directed by Ridley Scott in 1982. The main difference consisting in the fact that this new movie is heavier in the cyberpunk element and lighter in the classic noir component (I would argue 2049 is more of a thriller). I would assume Hamptom Fancher has read both Philip K. Dick and William Gibson in equal measure in order to find inspiration for the story, which also reminded me ""Children of Men"" in its humanism. In this film the line between human, replicant and A.I. is blurred to the extreme, to the point that after everything has been said and done, you might be left wondering if there had been actually any human in this movie at all. I won't say that this is the case, but it would give you an idea of how deep this movie delves into the allegorical and speculative implications of the basic concept of an artificial being who can actually be convinced that he is ""real"" and maybe the other way around. This is a long film, but the world building is so fascinating and realistic that you don't really mind the characters and camera lingering a little bit too much along urban landscapes and dilapidated buildings. The script has some problems in the form of excessive exposition and over explanation, but Dennis Villeneuve's direction is so assured that he manages to overcome these problems with the sheer power of his cinematographic language end emotional punch. The ending is appropriately ambiguous and bleak, and is open to discussion and interpretation. For sure a movie that needs more than one vision in order to fully appreciate every nuance and artistic stroke.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Slow movie, but worth the patience—has to be seen in cinemas","As a fan of the original, I was skeptical with the new Blade Runner. Although Denis Villeneuve is a very skilled director, Blade Runner does have such cult status, almost sacredness... so people naturally had lots of expectations about this one. I think in the end, the new installment certainly delivers!The atmosphere is super thick and the movie makers went a lot in the world building direction, using the story to put in a lot of important sci-fi / cyberpunk ideas that should definitely inspire you and that definitely ask some deep questions, just as good sci-fi is supposed to do. The cinematography is indeed stunning, it's a one-in-its kind thing that you won't see in anytime soon. Hyper-stylized, yes, but distracting from the apparent realism of the world, no. As a fan of electronica, the soundtrack stood out to me in particular. It managed to be modern and unique while at the same time staying true to some of the tunes of the original.Now, a lot of people are complaining about the movie being slow and the story perhaps not living up to the visuals. I see where these folks are coming from as the movie is indeed slow—but that's in part at least because modern audiences are used to rapid plot developments and quick cutting sequences. In fact, let's remind ourselves that the old Blade Runner was really slow as well, and perhaps some things are better not be updated!If you have the patience, I think you are in for a really emotional ride. Perhaps even more so than the old Blade Runner, this one is filled with sadness. Ryan Gosling does a perfect job at balancing his calmness with this intense feeling of pent-up anger and despair. There's existential dread without an army or a massive fight. The big themes discussed in the movie hit on the theme of identity and one's purpose in life. Each character is struggling with their identity or purpose in some form or another. I admit that I cried at the end of the movie as multiple of the themes and metaphors that were explored throughout the movie converge on what I see as a beautiful conclusion to a truly epic story.So, expect a slow ride, expect to be sucked into a truly compelling word, and don't miss this one while it's running in the cinema—it's definitely not going to be the same on your average home screen. Go and watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Visual Feast,"I'm perplexed by the few low review ratings for Blade Runner 2049. It was an incredible film that brought just the right ambiance and visual quality that made the original intriguing. But here, Deakins and Villeneuve catapult this sequel into a beautifully artistic film.Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as 'K' and Harrison Ford's return as Deckard is a vital component in the storytelling.The movie has deliberate and sustained pacing at 2 hours and 43 minutes but I never once checked my watch and the pacing made the experience that much more special. It is visually breathtaking and DP Roger Deakins, who is long overdue for an Oscar, deserves it 10-fold for the perfection he creates in Blade Runner 2049.Ana de Armas is exceptional as Joie. Watching her attempt to define and transform herself beyond K's submissive hologram makes her the heart of the film.Go, settle in, and let the movie take you in.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Amazing visual, Good sequel Blade Runner !","I already saw other reviews and i just don't understand who gives rating below 5. I watched this movie and i really enjoy it. They give us many amazing visual, cool futuristic technology with some inspirational touch in it. It reminds me with other movie that has similar amazing visual, Valerian. But this movie is much better !No doubt for the main actor : Ryan Gosling who already has Oscar award, Harrison Ford the senior actor who has been the main actor too in the first Blade Runner, and Jared Leto whom known as Joker in Suicide Squad. They collaborate each other in this movie perfectly. The other point is about the story. Maybe some people prefer faster story telling, but i think this movie gives us something different. I can say it is slow but detail and amazing. And for someone who loves plot twist, it wont disappoint you. You wont expect it at all ! So, i think Blade Runner 2049 just has his own style and i really like this movie. Overall, this movie has been added to one of my favourite movie in 2017 so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Crime-Noire Runs The Show: Not A Thrilling as I had Hoped,"There are plenty of movies in Hollywood, only some of which ever reach legendary status that seals their place in history. These sacred films were usually ended in a manner that didn't require a sequel, but leave it to the big studios to not leave things along. Tonight, Blade Runner 2049 premiers to the public, alongside some high review scores and plenty of praise. Despite the decades long gap, this movie holds promise to be just as good as the sequel. Robbie K is here to share some thoughts on the latest flick and help guide your viewing pleasures.LIKES:True Sci-Fi Crime: The trailers don't lie when they say Blade Runner 2049 is a crime noire film. It opens with the reference back to the first film and soon uncovers a mystery that will run the course of the movie. As this occurs, the other parties are seeking ways to hinder our ""hero"" (Ryan Gosling) from uncovering the truth. Like a glorified episode of half the crime-dramas on television, Blade Runner 2049 is all about capitalizing on a prolonged crime and mixing as much drama into it to help add character development. All of this is nicely wrapped up in a science- fiction spin, integrating the floating ships, robots, and large computers as the theater it unfolds in.Emotionally Artistic: The thing that many reviewers seem to appreciate is that the movie brings a lot of emotional punch to the audience. Our directors managed to interject a lot of feeling into Gosling's supposedly emotional character. As his story continues to unfold, you'll be submerged into the psychological nightmare he is forced to face. While the traumatic stress is certainly enough to pull some heart strings, it's the artistic portrayal of determining one's self that adds fuel to the fire. Self-Identity, a thing many struggle with, is well-addressed in this film, trying to uncover the truth about his self, all while solving the crime. Throw in a rather deep, albeit weird, romance story and you will round out the emotional plot lines many seek.Acting: A character is only as good as the actor who portrays it to life and Blade Runner 2049 is a shining example of quality acting. Gosling as the lead was a good choice, his ability to play a man with an identity crisis is quite believable, primarily in the way he seems to stand on the border of sane and psychopathic. While not his best role, I enjoyed seeing the anti-hero part played by him again. Harrison Ford reprises his edge well enough, but I felt they didn't utilize him as well as they could.Ana De Armas: I was happy to see more of Ana in this film, seeing her branch down some more emotional pathways, all while driving the character development of Gosling's character. Yet, I can't lie, that she was beautiful in the various outfits she shifted into during the film. I got the best of both world in this film, and appreciated the costumes that she sported in her awkward scenes.DISLIKES:Not so thrilling: The first Blade Runner had some suspense to it, the constant thrill of the chase as Ford tried to hunt down the rogue androids. It kept the pace going, all while integrating the elements I mentioned in the likes section. Blade Runner 2049 though wasn't that thrilling to me. The action was rather bland, the emotion with it almost as flat, and had little suspense outside of how much torture some of the characters could take. I expected a little more spice to the mix, but don't let the trailers fool you, the thrills were more like spills.Long: If a movie is going to be nearly three hours, it needs to either move, or have an exciting climax. I found neither of these elements in this movie, but instead a very drawn out movie that seemed to drag. While the message and artistic license are appreciated, the editors could have really dropped half the footage to get me out of the theater faster. Perhaps if the ending hadn't been predictable I would have been more intrigued, but I found myself fighting sleep at times because from these elaborate, and often unnecessary details.Predictable Story and Under Utilized Characters: Blade Runner 2049 might have been a well- built Sci-Fi Crime story, but that doesn't mean it wasn't predictable. Most of the ""twists"" I got in the first hour, leaving me nearly two to go until they revealed it. In addition, my expectations of where the story was going were also shattered as other characters were underutilized for more sappy looks and near depression. This especially goes for Ford and Leto, who I felt got the short-end of the stick in this film. Throw in some of the loose ends, more like bait for the next film, and it left me unsatisfied with where the story was going.Loud: Many films are loud in a theater with blaring music and special effects to make the seats shake. This movie though, just had obnoxious sound effects that were high-pitched groans, mixed with a soundtrack that while unique was not the most pleasing to me. Brace yourselves for this interesting sound soiree, because you are going to hear it a lot.The VERDICT:Blade Runner 2049 is artistic, a visual display that is packed with emotion, Sci-Fi charm, and a crime noire element. It has much of the same feel as its predecessor, but I felt it lacked the suspense and thrills that the trailers promised back in the teaser. Sadly the predictable story, underutilized characters and audio assault didn't justify the nearly three hour run time for me. Don't see this one when your energy is low folks, or you just might be fighting sleep.My Scores:Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Rating: A+,"Before I actually start reviewing Blade Runner 2049, I need to briefly share my thoughts on the first film and also to answer a question that a lot of people have been asking me: ""do I need to watch the original to enjoy and understand the sequel""? Important fact: I re- watched Blade Runner: Final Cut (1997) and a few hours later, I was standing in an IMAX theater waiting for 2049 to start, so I'm pretty sure that I was the best-prepared person in that theater to watch Villeneuve's movie.After a lot of thinking and analysis, I concluded that I love Blade Runner. The cultural influence that it had on sci-fi and how it changed filmmaking, makes it a masterpiece, even though it has some flaws. From the incredible, profound and intriguing story to one of the brainiest unconfirmed mysteries of cinema, it's one of Ridley Scott's greatest films. It's one of those rare movies that gets better and better with time (extremely underrated when it came out), but it's still mind-blowing how well a film stands 35 years after its release.I would give it an A, due to some issues that I can't overlook. The romance between Deckard and Rachael (Sean Young) feels very forced and the pacing isn't well-balanced. However, the amazing story, the well-developed characters and the beautiful cinematography, plus an excellent performance by Harrison Ford and an exquisite directing work by Ridley Scott, elevate Blade Runner and make it one of the most influent sci-fi movies of all-time.So, my answer to the pertinent question at the beginning of this review is ... Watch the original! I'm not advising you to watch it because you'll not understand the sequel if you don't, but due to its importance and how it molds 2049 as one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen.I don't think this movie is for everyone though. I don't think an occasional film-goer will understand how mind-blowing Villeneuve's movie is or how influential it will become. Some people will feel extremely bored during the first half of the film, some might even leave. Others might enjoy the second half of the movie and end up being satisfied with it. People like me, who LOVE movies and LOVE the art of filmmaking, will leave the theater jaw-dropped and tearily happy for having experienced such a stunning masterpiece!Villeneuve requested film critics to not spoil any plot point that could ruin the movie. I'm overjoyed to honor that request because this is a film that you NEED to watch at the best quality theater, with the best looking screen and with the best sound speakers. Roger Deakins' cinematography is beautifully perfect. It's just perfect. There's not a better word to describe such flawless and stunning visuals. If he doesn't get every single award for this category, I'll give up on caring about Oscars or Golden Globes. Congratulations on being such an inspiration and on elevating every single movie you're in, Deakins.Denis Villeneuve reinforces his position as my favorite director working nowadays and as one of the best directors of all-time. His unbelievable imagination and wonderful way of grasping every single moment and turning it into so much more than it actually is, either by adding asphyxiating suspense or overwhelming dialogue, are just two of many phenomenal skills that he possesses.Michael Green and Hampton Fancher's writing is worthy of all attention and some more from the audience. Every single word matters! Every line of dialogue is filled with so much depth and meaning, which setups so many surprises that Villeneuve brilliantly executes with the help of a memorable soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Every single technical aspect of Blade Runner 2049 is an epic example of how to produce a film. I have no words to describe how PERFECT the work behind the screen is ...Ryan Gosling deserves every type of praise and so much more. If he got nominated for his La La Land's performance, he's definitely going to win everything this year. I mean, he has to! His characters' conflicting memory and heartfelt story are extremely well displayed by Gosling in the first half of the movie, the half that most people will have a grudge with due to its pacing, but not me. The deliberately slow rhythm is so magnificently compensated in the last half that I don't even consider it a minor issue. In addition to his great performance, Gosling also has the best dialogue scene in the entire film, which I can't wait to watch all over again hundreds of times.Harrison Ford has his best performance in years and he also might get some nominations. Once again, his characters' past is as mysterious as it was in 1982 and the surprises are jaw- dropping. Robin Wright (Lieutenant Joshi) and Ana de Armas (Joi) also achieve great performances, as Jared Leto (Niander Wallace) briefly shines in his few scenes.Finally, the story is what gives this movie the feel of epicness. It truly justifies the long runtime (even if I agree that it could have been 10-15min shorter), but it lays those reasons on the audience, expecting us to wait ... and wait. Patience is more than a virtue in this film, it's a necessity. These are the only pieces of advice I'm giving to people: watch the first movie and WAIT for the second one to blow you away. That's as far as I'm going with the plot, I want you to enjoy and have the same spectacular experience that I had.Undoubtedly, Blade Runner 2049 is my favorite film of 2017 and it's going to be extremely difficult for any other to surpass it, as Denis Villeneuve's flawless masterpiece surpassed Ridley Scott's original. Denis' technically mind-blowing directing, Roger Deakins' jaw-dropping cinematography, Hans Zimmer's memorable score, Michael Green and Hampton Fancher's incredibly tricky and meaningful screenplay ... All of that, plus heartfelt and compelling performances from Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, elevate this movie and make it an EPIC MASTERPIECE.I'm filled with tears of wonder and joy ... Go see it so you can be too.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Beautiful Visual Feat,"Blade Runner. An 80's futuristic film noir that some filmgoers revere as one of the all-time great films.. with a caveat. Which of the endings did you see? The right one? or the really bad happy ending? Few films give the viewers their own personal ultimatum for the characters, but the first Blade Runner was that indecisive. So is it then, wise to give Blade Runner a 35 year old sequel/reboot? It apparently is. It turns out that Denis Villeneuve was destined to make it and truth be told, if you never saw the first Blade Runner, never fear. This is a film entirely of it's own.Blade Runner 2049 is the best looking film of the year. In terms of it's cinematography, it is a masterpiece. The production design brings us back to the incredible world that Ridley Scott introduced us to, but expands upon it exponentially. Our world is almost entirely replaced by holograms. 2049 focuses in on the idea of a society completely removed from humanity, where perfect virtual realities and artificial romances take the place of the human condition. Villeneuve and Roger Deakins work wonders on the ideas and the mis-en-scene that surrounds them. What we get is a film, though bloated in run time, fascinating from beginning to end. You will spend nearly three-hours in the theater, but entirely fixated on the image. You don't want to keep your eyes off of it. I know I didn't.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The biggest problem for me was the length. It seemed to go on and on just to have time for another twist. Remove a good half-hour and the film, I think, would have been better.

"""I want to be real for you""","To be able to do a sequel of a film that is well known since 1982 and it ends up being as great as the first one (or even better for some) is INSANE. And there is one person who can do that and his name is Denis Villeneuve.Denis Villeneuve was put in a very difficult situation. Because he had to make a sequel for one of the best (if not the all-time best sci-fi films ever) Blade Runner (1982). A film that a whole generation grew up watching and after many decades they get to see a sequel of it and the most important question was will it be good or will it ruin the whole ""BLADE RUNNER STORY""? Denis gave us what many might call ""the best sequel ever"". He proved to everyone that if in the future you see that title ""directed by Denis Villeneuve"" don't worry at all and be sure that it will not disappoint. The directing is one of the strongest elements in the film. It's full of details and ideas that aren't just crazy or unique but they will make you ask ""How is it possible for a director to do that?"" And ""why and how didn't anyone think of those ideas?"". The visual effects in the film are going to blow your mind. They are so unique and different.The cinematography might be the strongest element in the film. Roger Deakins deserved an Oscar FOR SURE. The camera movements and angles were able to capture the beautiful, futuristic, (sometimes dark/depressing) world of Blade Runner in an unbelievable way that I have never seen and will never forget. Every shot in the film will stick in your head because of its beauty.The production design worked perfectly as well alongside the cinematography to capture the futuristic world of Blade Runner.The music that was composed by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch was perfect and did fit every scene. And the great thing about the music in ""Blade Runner 2049"" is that you can hear some of the beautiful work that Vangelis did in the first film ""Blade Runner"" as Zimmer and Wallfisch did use some of them and mixed them with their work and they gave us a beautiful/futuristic result.Many people complained about the story and said that it isn't as interesting as the first one and to tell that story in 2h 44m is a lot and could've been shorter especially that the build-up was so slow. Now I agree that the film is long and the build-up is slow and for those who hated the film I totally get their point and I could see what they are saying. But, in my opinion, there are many other elements that really saved the film and made us (me at least) forget about the long runtime the film has. I also saw the story as very interesting and was very curious to know where it was taking me scene after scene. The characters are really interesting as well and the acting of each was well done. Ryan Gosling as K was more than good. Ana De Armas as Joi gave the film a different atmosphere (especially her character). The dialogues and energy between Joi and K were beautiful and sometimes even deep or dramatic. And that's thanks to the chemistry between Ana De Armas and Ryan Gosling. Jared Leto's performance was so good but unfortunately, his screen time was short. But, for him to be able to give us a great performance in such a short time means that he played his character perfectly. And like I mentioned, the rest of the supporting cast was great as well like Mackenzie Davis as Marietta, Sylvia Hoes as Luv, Dave Bautista as Sapper, and of course Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard.To me, Blade Runner is a true and entertaining masterpiece that I enjoyed from beginning to end. I wouldn't argue with those who disagree with me and totally get their point. Great film, great cast, great cinematography, great music, and most importantly great directing.My rating is 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Visually Stunning, languidly paced","I'm gonna get right to it - BLADE RUNNER 2049 is a visually and audibly stunning film, re-immersing the viewer into the fantastic world that was introduced in Ridley Scott's 1982 film, BLADE RUNNER.  Director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival) takes Scott's original vision in the first film and - using the technology available to him in this day and age - deepens and grows the world building to fantastical, heretofore never seen heights.  Every frame of this film is like looking at an Art Masterpiece.  This film will win just about every major technical and design awards come Oscar time.But...is it a good film?Picking up 28 years after the original, Blade Runner agent ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) is hunting down ""older model"" replicants for extermination.  In the course of his investigations, he uncovers some evidence that will ""change the course of civilization as we know it"".If only that were true.Calling the pacing of this film ""deliberate"" is doing an injustice to the word ""deliberate"".  Villeneuve, for obvious reasons, chooses to focus his cameras on the world and the effects - plot, character and plot developments be damned.Gosling is the perfect choice to headline this film.  He isn't flashy, doesn't call attention to himself and services the goals of the filmmakers (the effects) well.  Is he good?  Well...he's good enough.  It's not a spoiler to say that Harrison Ford shows up, reprising his role as Deckard from the original film.  He has the requisite ""world weariness"" required for his character in this time (much the same way his Han Solo in STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was world weary).  Joining Ford in reprising his role from the original is the great Edward James Olmos as GAFF (in a cameo).  All are welcome faces on the screen.Joining them is Robin Wright as ""K""'s boss (I would have liked to see more of her and her character), Jared Leto in his usual ""unusual"" turn as mega-billionaire Niander Wallace and Mackenzie Davis as ""hooker with a heart of gold"" Mariette and Sylvia Hooks as the ""bad guy's henchman"", Luv.  Like Gosling, all are ""fine"" they service the plot and the effects well.  Only newcomer (at least to me) Ana de Armas as ""K""'s girlfriend, Joi rises above and is someone to look at - and be interested in - on screen against all of the magnificent visual and audible artistry.The sound, music, editing and cinematography of this film brilliantly match the vision that Villeneuve has for this world, making it a magical, immersive and fascinating place to go.  Just make sure you take a nap before you go to the theater.  Based on the amount of snoring I heard during the quiet moments of this film, the languid pace and pretty pictures could lure you to slumbertown.Letter Grade A- (knocked down from an ""A"" because of the ""so-so"" plot and slow pace)8 (out of 10) stars - SEE THIS FILM IN A MOVIE THEATER with the largest screen and best sound you can find - it will be worth it!And you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There's a lot of good here,"Sequel to the philosophical scifi noir masterpiece is a fairly worthy successor - more of a biblical story where as the first one dove deeper into the subject of humanity. Loved the score here, some of the cinematography, and the mostly brief action bursts are done in an impeccable style. Villeneuve was definitely a good fit to direct the film. I would've prefered that there wasn't a link to the original's story and altogether it's not a bullseye of a film for me. It could have been a deeper affair and it sometimes looked too polished, but it's definitely recommendable.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Visual gem, uneasy topic.","This last opus of Denis Villeneuve, my fellow countryman from Quebec, does not possess the intelligence, fineness and sensibility of ""The Arrival"" which ran for the Oscar in 2016. The rendition of a futuristic and doomed world is absolutely stunning, troubling, credible, aesthetic. This is in my opinion reason number one to go watch this movie. All along the film, one wonders ""Is he/she a replicant?"" There is a thin line between artificial/natural intelligence, a very fine boundary impossible to be crossed. These are in my opinion, the two main assets of this visually stunning movie. However, keep in mind this movie is all about artificial life. Therefore, there is no artifices. Replicants are boring characters. Dialogues are unnecessary cryptic, a polite expression for ""bad"". Storyline is complex. Like many pieces of art, to be seen more than once.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Little Long But A Very Good Sequel,"Like a few others that wrote reviews, I too re-watched the original for about the 50th time just a few hours before going to see this film. This movie has stunning visuals that compliments the original without going overboard with the CGI, wonderful hues that helped differentiate locations that weren't needed in the original film because it was only dark with beacons of neon, or dark and raining with beacons of neon, because it was set in pretty much one general location of the city.The story expands beyond the city where a replicant Blade Runner with a nomenclature of ""K"" does what Blade Runners are supposed to do, retire replicants without having any emotions interfering with the task at hand, until a dying replicant cryptically mutters ""you've never seen a miracle"", that and a out of place item on the ground triggers a search that leads to the bigger story of what happened to Deckard and Rachael and the possible effect of their mysterious departure.The original Blade Runner set the tone and style for many movies and TV shows that came after it, just like Night of the Living Dead set the tone for almost all zombie movies after it. It was good, dark Sci-Fi without peers when the alternative was buying Reese's Pieces and making jokes about phoning home.Jared Leto was underused in this movie but adding more screen time for him by cutting scenes may have caused story continuation issues while trying to meld the past to the future, and probably couldn't have been done easily without lengthening the movie considerably, but his character could be central to a potential sequel.Blade Runner 2049 has a lot more action than the original but it's not a mindless slug/slogfest like so many movies that have little time for storytelling.One of the small things I did enjoy was a tip of the hat to the scene in the original where Deckard was magnifying the photo of Zhora and the scene in BR2049 when the lab was trying to find a serial number, the flick-flick sound of magnification seem very similar. Also, bringing Edward James Olmos in for a cameo as Gaff and watching him from the waist up, not seeing his hands, but taking an educated guess at what he may be doing, and being half-surprised he's moved up a level from match figures.The only drawback of seeing a film like this in a theater is you're unable to pause or back it up when something happens that takes a little time fathom or put into context with everything else, just like the original Blade Runner it'll take time and multiple viewings to decipher all you've just seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Blade Runner 2049 more than I could have ever hoped for,"1 of the most rewarding, intelligent and moving movies I have ever seen in my life. After last night's view I am still in shock and astounded by the masterpiece I had the privilege to witness. I am absolutely delighted how Hollywood allowed Deni Villeneuve to direct his work without inserting formulaic shallow mindless action clips to satisfy the new ADD generation. Firstly the cinematography alone is worth more than the admission price, if Deacons does not win an Oscar for this then he never will. The casting and performances are superb beyond words, K's brief moments of emotion explosive in intensity. This is an incredibly sad story with strong messages about racism, humanity and the pointless cycle of violence. As violent as 2049 is it is visually quite mild compared to Scott's BR, revealing Villeneuve's disdain for gratuitous such. Non the less it does not make the scenes of violence any less intense as he is a master at conveying atmospheres of terror without patently showing it. I don't even know were to begin at just how multi layered and complex the story is, even at the generously slow pacing I at many times struggled to keep up and process all the information. The scenes of death and conflict explode with such intensity it's heartbreakingly visceral. In many ways I can see in this work what Ridley Scott so wanted to film but was restricted due to technical and budgetary constraints, noticeably K's retirement of Sapper at the protein farm. No dialogue wasted in this script and each fragment of info revealed vital to understanding the story. This will be a frustrating movie for any casual viewer hoping for some spoon fed escapism, action and wit. Box office sales ratings mean nothing here, see Emoji movie, enough said. BR 2049 so good it made me cry...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Blade Runner 2049The downside to having a robotic lover is that your romantic baths always end in electrocution.Smartly, the Blade Runner in this sci-fi thriller keeps his sex-bot on his frontal lobe.K (Ryan Gosling) is an engineered human employed by the LAPD for the purpose of tracking down and liquidating maverick replicates.

That said, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is great movie, simply wonderful one. On almost every level.Its impossible to distinguish on thing that makes this sequel great. Its the amazing cinematography by a legendary Roger Deakins to start with. It the great story and solid screenplay. Great acting by everyone involved, and great directing by a great Denis Villeneuve. Set design and special effects were simply... true - it literally takes you the place, not to mention amazing music by legendary Hans Zimmer. Take all these talent and result is very clearly seen.Overall, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is simply a great movie, the one that in my opinion surprised the great original.

One of cinema's most unlikeliest of sequels is one of the years best,"With one of cinema's most unlikeliest of follow-up's, walking in the footsteps of its forefather 35 long years after its initial release, Blade Runner 2049 gives us one of the 21st century's most accomplished of sequels.The year's most original, risky and downright beautiful blockbuster (just give Roger Deakins the Oscar now thanks Academy), Denis Villeneuve's lovingly crafted new addition to the world created by Ridley Scott in 1982 is a film that pays respectful acknowledgment to its counterpart, all the while carving out a mysterious, engaging and most importantly, an emotionally charged continuation of what has come before and what is still yet to be uncovered.Focussing its attention this time around on Ryan Gosling's blade runner K, a man with a mission very similar to Deckard in the original, that being the ""retirement"" of runaway replicants, 2049 is a film that deserves to be seen with as little knowledge of its story as possible, as Villeneuve and returning screenwriter Hampton Fancher alongside Michael Green have produced one of those rare modern day blockbusters where there is genuine intrigue as to what exactly is happening and where our final destination may take us.Fans of the original will be pleased to know that 2049 tackles just as many big question's as Scott's adored adaption of Philip K. Dick's source material as it journeys on its way, as by expanding the universe of a futuristic Los Angeles and this time its outer surrounds, Villeneuve has enabled himself to be able to delve even deeper into the questions of what it means to be human and what separates man from machine.It's always a tough task for films of 2049's nature to pay homage to the aesthetic and life of the original while creating a vibe and world all of its own but Villeneuve and his team have balanced out the scales brilliantly here.Seeing more of the landscape of this futuristic but not unrealistic world only heightens the sense of wonder, Ana de Armas's role as Joi will be a great talking point for many, Jared Leto's somewhat overacted and underdeveloped role as new replicant king Niander Wallace will still demand great debate while Roger Deakin's work behind the camera capturing this visually incredible production makes every single scene a work of visual wonder, a blockbuster production that is pure art instead of pure popcorn eye-candy.The other key elements to 2049's many successes are the performances of its two poster men Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford.Without talking in depth about how the roles of characters K and Deckard playout through the film, both performers acquit themselves brilliantly to their roles. Gosling who has the most to do here delivers one of his most memorable turns yet as K, it's a role that requires both restraint and moments of rage and Gosling handles it all with aplomb, while it's great to see Ford invested in his return as Deckard with the aging star doing a lot more than he can be prone to do in some of his usual phone it in performances.Just like it's much talked about original, 2049 does have issues that rear their heads throughout the film and do hold the film back at times from the greatness that it often touches.Most glaringly is the films runtime, at 160 minutes in length Villeneuve's film doesn't always justify its near 3 hour existence, some scenes feel like they could've been both shortened and cut and it wouldn't have adversely affected the final product, while some of the films middle section in particular does cover similar ground for an extended period of time.The other more cosmetic letdown is the films soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, that fails to match the grand heights of Vangelis's classic 1982 score. With music playing such a key role in the universe of Blade Runner, it's a shame this one feels a little tacked on, which it was, when the composers came on late in the picture replacing original choice Jóhann Jóhannsson after ""creative differences"" between himself and Villeneuve.Final Say –Not made for everyone and far removed from the usual blockbuster fair, those seeking sci-fi action kicks from Blade Runner 2049 will be left wanting but Denis Villeneuve has crafted that near impossible sequel that's respectful to its original, all the while moving forward in brave new directions. 2049 is a ponderous and meticulously crafted production that's not only the year's must-see science fiction event, but one of the year's best films regardless of genre.4 ½ Elvis holograms out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Our new friends are electric,"It's a long slow burn. Some might even say it's a bit boring. Although, the scenes are quite beautiful. Very dystopian. The music is good. Although, it's mostly just a lot of sound effects. The acting is phenomenal. The story isn't the most exciting, or interesting. However, the writers and director do a good job of keeping you guessing until the end.It's best to not compare it too much to the Ridley Scott original, and try to appreciate it for what it is on its own. They are nowhere close to being similar. That's complicated by the fact that they are continuing the original storyline, somewhat. Being set in the distant future helps to create just enough distance between the two, though.That said, it's impossible to not compare the two, at least a little bit, and I think the original was a landmark. It's genuinely inimitable. So, I think they did a good job by not trying too hard to recreate the former. However, the innovative tech and societal situations in this one make the whole world feel distant and unrelatable. Unlike the original, I didn't feel like I could live in this world. In fact, it's not any world I'd want to even explore, at all. I guess, it IS a dystopia, and so it makes sense that one shouldn't want to visit there. Who knows if that was their intention, though?The story and events simply didn't move me the way the original did. Scenes and dialog do tend to stick around in the mind, but there's none of those awesome one-liners, like the ""tears in rain"" monologue. Also, this one lacks the iconic 80s ""style"". Plus, it wasn't based on a book, and the writing is nowhere near as good.I still enjoyed it, but it's not the most rewatchable movie. The original is so classy, stylized and iconic that it's impossible to NOT want to see it over and over again. This is one that you might watch a couple of times, but it gets old quick. Even the Chronicles of Riddick had more rewatchable quality, and better lines.I never realized how robotic Ryan Gosling's acting was, until now. He fits right into a world full of androids, doesn't he? Also, it's a good thing Ford managed to not kill himself in that plane crash, because they couldn't have made this movie without him. He adds that necessary touch of life to an otherwise cold synthetic world. The movie would feel even more robotic and soulless without him.Frankly, I'm not too keen on where they took the whole story, because I love the universe it's set in, and am dying to see more movies set in that universe. However, I don't want them all to be about the same thing as this one was. That would be too boring and predictable. Give us some scenes of attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... would be awesome!Another thing this one lacked is the rhythm in the dialogue. The original was like a song. It sounded like instruments playing when people spoke. This film completely lacks that attention to detail. The dialogue feels weak and forgettable. It's also nowhere near as sexy as the original. They wind up banally flashing nudity in front of our eyes instead of that special chemistry between Deckard and Rachael. In fact, even though they avoided the fool's errand of chasing the masterpiece, the whole thing still manages to feel like a cheap imitation.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So dull I fell asleep,"The original had a story that was clear and a driving narrative. This had effects over story and even the music was a copy ... of Vangelis. It was just plain dull. I kept wondering when Harrison Ford would appear and live up to the posters ( the last 10 minutes ). A lot of directors have made the mistake of concentrating on Ryan Gosling's face in the belief that the camera can see him think. He's no Eastwood, or Jimmy Stewart. Another fault of sci-fi films are the lengthy speeches about the state of the the outer quadrant, and the reasons why Tharg must be destroyed etc etc. This was no different. There was the Robin Wright character, Jared Leto, et al. I liked the abandoned casino set. Something for the eye to rest on and take the whole story in. The original had much of this. This hadn't. The use of original footage was gratuitous, and by then I had stopped caring. So many movies this year have had good posters but poor product:The Dark Tower, Kingsman, And now this.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually stunning. Emotionally Brilliant.,"Making sequels/reboots of the famous movies can always have a risk factor of its own. Especially if the first movie was a decade ago or much older. Only Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a successful example of such case in the recent times. But it was heavily backed by some good publicity and loyal fan following. Blade Runner 2049 came with huge expectations and it risked it all. Although the first movie had a cult status, it didn't necessarily have a great storyline. But the sequel stands out to be one of the best movies of the 2017 (also a critics' favorite) with hard hitting screenplay and brilliant storytelling.Come 2049, the whole scenario around the replicants and humans have changed again. As the new Blade Runner, K a replicant himself is on a mission hunting down old replicants. However K, has a bit of his own feelings too although he tries to avoid them most times. Things start to take a turn when K digs too much deep into a case on his own and starts discovering some unusual things. As the Replicant making corporation Wallace (yes, its not Tyrell this time) and LAPD try to hunt K and also look for some answers things start getting messy. In his quest for answers, K meets the former Blade Runner Deckard who is living isolated and does not trust anyone. Many answers and some shocking truths reveal themselves as the Wallace corp continues to hunt K and Deckard. It might seem like a regular revenge action plot as K and Deckard meet, but it is much more than that.Running for almost 150 odd minutes this movie is quite lengthy for modern day standards. However there is an absolute attention to detail given to every frame of the movie so as to make it look very intense and beautiful. The movies shows no matter how futuristic the technology can be, the problems that everyone has deep down is very human. The movie resembles the tone of the old Blade Runner initially with the location and cinematography but after a while the movie slowly catches onto a different tone. Ryan Reynolds completely drives this film with his stunning performance as the Replicant/Blade Runner, K. This character is tailor made for someone who doesn't need to express too much but can still convey a lot of emotions. Other top billed actors Harrison Ford, Robin Wright and Jared Leto do justice to their roles. But it's the two different female characters which steal the show along with K. K's holographic girlfriend Joi played by Ana De Armas and Wallace corporation's Assassin/assistant Luv played by Sylvia Hoeks. Both of these characters are very different in their own way and are very well written and exceptionally performed. Hats off to director Denis Villeneuve for creating such an emotionally sound masterpiece.Blade Runner 2049 is a must watch if you are true lover of the cinema as an art and appreciate every little detail of it. It is not just another action sequel of a previous blockbuster, but it is cinema craftsmanship at its best.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best movie sequels ever made. And I'm not exaggerating,"*Just to note, ""Do You Find This Review Helpful?"" doesn't mean if you agree with the reviewer's opinion or not, but rather, it means if the review actually describes the film, and what are its pros and cons. So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Blade Runner 2049, as most of you may have already know, is a sequel to a beloved sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner (1982)'.And just to warn you, like its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 isn't fully consisted of action. It's more of a sci-fi mystery filled with action-packed scenes and serious tone. So don't expect lots of action when watching this.But really, this movie isn't much of a sequel. It's actually a story of its own with some plot points that continue from the first movie. And I respect this film for that!And Denis Villeneuve knocked it out of the park once again! The style and feel of the world the film takes place feels kind of dystopian, dark, and mysterious, the acting is superb, and the cinematography is top notch!And thank heavens, the movie's plot isn't the same as what it seemed to be from the trailers that portrays this film as another one of those ""to save the world"" films. It has a story of its own, and it does its job telling this story excellently.There are still two flaws that didn't actually bother me, though. I just find these points flawed for other people to watch.As stated, the trailers had a different feel from the film. And it made the movie look as if it's a sci-fi action film. And that's going to be a problem with other viewers, since what they get is different, though they get what's better than the expected product.And lastly, this film wouldn't probably please normal viewers. The runtime is too long, the other people in the theater I watched this movie at were yawning at some parts, and those same parts would feel slow for normal viewers.But hey, I enjoyed the film a lot. And I rate films depending on how much I've enjoyed them. And I surely enjoyed this one.Overall, I think Blade Runner 2049 is a great soon-to-be classic sci-fi mystery film that will be always remembered as time passes by. It's a cinematic achievement for being visually stunning (like its predecessor), and being one of the best movie sequels of all time. Please go give this film a try! It's flopping at the box office last week, and it deserves more attention!Final rating: A+|10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Methodically paced and beautifully shot; will probably get even better with repeat viewings,"First off, the less said about the plot the better. I feel like I can say as much as I can about this movie without mentioning any plot details. And maybe that has something to do with the fact that I really can't say a whole lot about the movie just yet, not after a single viewing, at least.Blade Runner 2049 was overwhelming, but in a good way. It's long, dense, and even close to exhausting. I was in a bit of a daze walking out, and it took me a few minutes to collect my thoughts and try to figure out how much I'd enjoyed the past (almost) three hours of movie. What I did know for sure though was that I liked it. It's hard not to get swept away by how gorgeous this movie looks, how interesting the score sounds, the strong performances all around, and all the really cool sci-fi stuff the film throws at you (which I also wouldn't dare to spoil).However, I can't say I absolutely loved this movie, not yet anyway. Even if there's not really anything in particular that I find easy to criticize. I feel roughly the same way about the original, which I also might have to watch a couple more times to fully get my head around and process. I think ultimately that's a good thing. There's not many movies this long that I feel a desire to revisit almost immediately, and I could easily myself taking a second trip to the cinema to see it again (insane movie ticket prices be damned).With Arrival and now this, Denis Villeneuve might well be the best sci-fi director we have at the moment. This is a seriously impressive film he's crafted, and far from the cheap cash-grab/ reboot I initially had some fears a sequel to the 35-year-old Blade Runner could be. There's not too many big budget American films that are paced this way, or so long or dense with ideas and things to look at and think about. Absolutely worth a watch, and don't be surprised if you end up feeling like going back. I know I almost certainly will, and won't be at all surprised if I come out of a second viewing even more enthusiastic about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A really good sequel,"In order to judge a film, you compare the direction, the acting, the story and the production values to similar movies from the same category. How nice that we have just such movie in the original Blade Runner. On each of the above metrics, this is a much better film.One of the few things that Blade Runner had better than the sequel is the supporting characters. As Deckard goes around following replicants and growing as a character, so do the replicants themselves. In the sequel, Ryan Gosling does an amazing job, but the focus is mostly on him and very little on the other characters. That's not to subtract from Ana de Armas' acting, which proves (again?) that she is the perfect woman in every respect. And if the original film had to invent the visuals and even explored the world a bit, 2049 does little to improve on that, even takes some away (only a few scenes have more people and vehicles at the same time, the rest being ridiculously empty for something that should happen in the future, for example).Acting is great, direction is great, the visuals are impressive - and this is one of the few movies I believe are worth going for in the cinema or at least having a nice sound system at home when you watch it - the story is both intriguing and well paced, the sound and mood are perfect.Perhaps the villains are the ones that are the least interesting; they almost hurt the movie. I can't explain it without spoiling too much, but at some time there are two factions that kind of want the same thing, but act like bitter enemies. There is a scene where Edward James Olmos is brought in for nothing other than nostalgia and Dave Bautista may not be the greatest actor in the world, but what was he doing in just a few scenes? Did he ask to be put in the film because he loved Blade Runner? And Jared Leto... I believe he terrorized his mates with this method acting a lot more than he actually acted on screen!Bottom line: I think it is important to watch the first Blade Runner before you watch this. Don't even rely on memory, just rewatch the original first, then see this one. An almost perfect film that makes you feel something other than ear pain from explosion sounds. Plus it has a sexy scene with Ana de Armas and Mackenzie Davis overlapping. That's got to be worth going to watch the movie in full 3D!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Couldn't Get Through To It,"After hearing about this movie for a while, I finally gave it a chance. I didn't now the movie's references, so I was not familiar with the prequel nor the references and that could've biased me, but here's my review.Thirty years after the events of Blade Runner (1982), a new Blade Runner, L. A. P. D. Officer ""K"" (Ryan Gosling), unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos. K's discovery leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former L. A. P. D. Blade Runner, who has been missing for thirty years.As a movie alone, it feels somehow poor and a little bland. There are big periods of time where the character don't talk nor even interact. It feels slow and, from time to time, kind of boring.But, with all being said, Ryan Gosling brings up one of his most iconic characters in a 10/10 interpretation. Dennis Villeneuve creates an immersive world that screams pain due to capitalism. It's the pure essence of cyberpunk. This is all the genre itself.It's well put together, coherent, interesting and makes you want more. Both the leading actor (Gosling) and director (Villeneuve) put an amazing effort in creating something so beautiful yet so obscure, this is indeed pure Sci-Fi.So, don't make the same mistake as me, watch the prequel, get envolved with the universe and then come watch this movie. With that being said, it's still worth watch it alone by itself, but I'm sure the experience will be richer if you do as said. Nevertheless give it a try.I'm looking forward to do as I said and come back here with a (hopefully) more positive and new review.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertains but falls sadly short of the original, rather drawn out too.","Blade Runner (1982) was for me an absolute classic. I was enthralled the first time, and have seen it many times since, including the morning of the day I watched Blade Runner (2049) in the afternoon. The whole 'feel' of 1982 conveyed something original. The 1982 Vangelis sound track is superb and creates the perfect ambiance, the cinematography is dark and surreal, and rain is just ever-so- slightly featured! Sure, 1982 has the odd 'cheesy' 1980's content as viewed now, but back then the whole was utterly brilliant.Die-hard fans of the original will appreciate the huge amount of careful detail that has been brought over from 1982. It is very obvious how much effort has been made to re-create the same atmosphere. Sadly, 2049 just doesn't quite make it. The film contains an unmistakably firm nod to 1982 (eye at the start, city, rain, dark, cyclists, road crossings, electronic billboards, 'Chinese' culture, etc.) but despite significantly better imaging quality and technology, doesn't quite communicate the underlying grim portrayal of the 'grime' of 1982.I will also say that unless you know your 1982 narrative and characters there will be large amounts of 2049 that you'll either simply not notice, but more frustratingly, simply fail to comprehend. Unlike, for example, I Robot (2004) that stands alone as a complete film (you don't need to be familiar with Isaac Asimov), 2049 relies to a large extent on the 1982 premise. The film does start with several statements that attempt to contextualise the circumstances, but for most non-1982 fans these statements won't help that much. There is a 'story', but those who don't know 1982 will most likely struggle to keep up with it.1982 moved along at a reasonable pace, well, at least engages throughout. However, 2049 is very much laboured. I love Sci-Fi, I'm a huge fan of 1982, but I actually found myself yawning during some parts of 2049! Overall it's worth a watch, especially as you get 'value for money' - almost three hours long! Soundtrack is great, not a patch on the original, but still firmly of the same genre.Would I watch it again? Not paying, no, on TV in several years, maybe. As a sequel it disappointingly fell short.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worthy of the Original,"I think that judging Blade Runner 2049 simply on comparison with the original is off the mark. The 1982 movie, among my lifetime favorites, needed no sequel. Going in I thought it would be impossible for any sequel to match the blend of romance and suspense that the original gave us. Yet, the key romantic elements in 2049 are just fabulous stuff; warm, real, believable, unique and moving. Remnants of hope and human spirit and love in the midst of dystopian life experience. The movie also didn't cheat us of great suspense. Saying more than that would make me a spoiler, so I won't go there. Blade Runner 2049 draws on the original story and style without being copycat. The visual and auditory experience is no less than stunning. When I watch it again I'll experience it more with eyes closed. The soundtrack is that good. Character development is compelling. The storyline great SciFi! Every acting performance spot on and commendable. Though the movie is long by some standards, I appreciated that as with the original, we weren't rushed through the movie. I wanted to get to know the characters and to watch the story develop, and was not cheated of that experience. I never once checked my watch, but instead was engaged to the very end. Ryan Gosling's performance was outstanding, but no surprise there. The guy's a fabulous actor. Harrison Ford was great too, believable and consistent with his tough yet sensitive 1982 persona. I can't think of a weak link in the cast. Ana de Armas is like, Wow! Sylvia Hoeks and Mackenzie Davis also just amazing! Robin Wright so solid and on point. Jared Leto, outstanding. One could mention the entire cast person by person. Very enjoyable. I look forward to seeing it again, many times, just as with the original.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Good,"TBH I'm surprised at so many negative comments, my guess is there are a lot of people who want an instant fix and you don't get it with this film. You have to stay with it. The visuals and sound are 10/10 and the pacing is good. Maybe they could have chopped 30 minutes off it but I can't say I was ever bored at any time, the story flowed naturally. I'm not someone who naturally gravitates to films like this but I enjoyed it. I'll have to check out the original next.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Snoozefest,"With such a high rating, long running length, Harrison ford and Ryan gosling.. should be a smash hit, sadly it was a snoozefest. The movie wants to show off the world it created, it spends minutes of character standing with a weird look on their face thinking. I did enjoy the atmosphere but it was pushed to much, I kept getting bored and losing site on plot details.There is a typical action story that is interwoven throughout the movie but is added in with so much extra it's hard to stay into it. There were a few violent parts which I thought was nice, kind of like an r rated starwars. And it had some interesting ideas with robots and holograms, but it just wasn't for meShorten all the filler scenes and this movie would have been better imo no where near an 8, I wouldn't watch this again or recommend it personally",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Las Vegas is not what it used to be,"The ""hero"" of BR2049 is detective K, a replicant that chases other replicants. Why? It does seems a stupid idea, but apparently the new, Nexus 8 replicants are more ""obedient"" than their predecessors.K kills an escaped replicant, only to discover a big ""secret"" that the humans want to cover up at all costs. K is then chased by the human police and by the replicants' producer. He also starts to question his memories (as in Blade Runner) to discover a disquieting truth (as in BR, but in reverse...)Finally, K starts searching for Deckart, now living in Las Vegas with a cute dog. Deckart and K have a completely useless chase and fight scene that takes place - guess what? Just like in BR, in a huge, empty building. As a treat, we get an holographic show with Elvis, compounded by an holographic Sinatra, a couple of scenes later. That was the highlight of the movie.The plot is wrapped up by one of stupidest plot devices: the underground's fighters group, that manoeuvres K behind the scenes. Pathetic death scene, ripped off from BR, but with snow instead of rain and you are all set for another sequel. Not me, though.As an open question I'd like to know why I should root for the ""brave"" replicant underground resistance. They want to be more like humans, but humans are evil, so replicants want to get more evil... or something... whatever...I usually avoid ""sequels"" (AKA: commercial operations exploiting movies that were even only slightly successful), but Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies, so I caved. However, all stories must have an end and now I know that BR stands very much alone. I wish I could erase BR2049 from my memory, because of its offensive stupidity.It could have been just another bad Sci-Fi story, but the manipulation of nostalgic crowd probably proved more successful.I give half point to the dog and the other half to the holograms, which were cool.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Loved most of it!,"I'm a big fan of Denis Villeneuve so I almost had a coronary when I heard he was directing the new Bladerunner sequel. The first thing I loved about 2049 was the atmosphere the filmmakers managed to create, which carried on nicely from the first movie - the connection was almost tangible. The imagery was breathtakingly beautiful and I thought the sound design and music were incredibly impressive. Ryan Gosling fit the main part perfectly and I loved the aura Villeneuve managed to create around him. The only two little criticisms I had was 1) the Jared Leto character was a tad boring and 2) as a young woman, I found the hologram scenes hard to watch at times (but this is possibly just my taste and not necessarily a fault of the film itself). All in all, it's a very good sequel - certainly one of the best I've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Visually magnificent drama with complex narrative,"Most of the SF movies I've seen so far don't put enough emphasis on what an everyday life would look like in the near or far future. Blade Runner 2049 is different. Besides developing a story suitable for academic debates, Villeneuve really draws you in the futuristic world with punctilious detail. Depending on how much you're able to notice and appreciate those details will determine how much you get to enjoy the movie. And depending on how much you're able to scrutinize philosophical elements in the narrative will determine how much you appreciate it in the long run. So, if you want to get a full experience of BR 2049 you first have to carefully watch it and afterwards give your self some time and think about the story and problems it raises. That explains why there are so many cursory reviews with bad rating here on IMDb. Let's face it: this movies simply isn't made for the masses.BR 2049 is slow-paced, dark, visually absolutely stunning SF drama set in Brave New World type of setting. Story is of course connected with the original so despite others claiming otherwise, it's important that you first see the original. And that's all you have to know about it. Let me only mention that a lot of debates concerning neuroscience and what is called neurophilosophy are in front of us. That being said, this movie is only going to be more and more relevant plus we can expect more movies like this one. If you're interested in those topics, equip yourself with patience and be sure to give this movie a shot.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant,"Brilliantly shot, directed, and acted- Blade Runner 2049 may not live up to the hype as one of the greatest sequels ever made, but it certainly a worthy sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi classics of all time. Ryan Gosling leads the film as the Blade Runner referred to as K. Through Gosling's great acting, as always, and the deep insight to the characters life, the performance doesn't just seem like a standout but truly one of the greater characters portrayed in a sci-fi movie period. Harrison Ford also returns as Deckard Shaw, but his part is smaller than I expected, and seemingly pointless. At times, the film can seem a bit tough to follow, which can be even more troublesome considering how long it is (around 2hr and 45 min). But despite the overstuffed story, the film does delve into some great conversations and worldbuilding that makes the film ever the more interesting. The cinematography in the film is fantastic, with more great shots than I could count. Denis Villeneuve again provides excellent direction, and brings the films to new heights, that are both fresh and quite compelling. In the end, Blade Runner 2049 can be a bit hard to understand at times, but is full of fun twists and turns that are more than interesting. The sci-fi worldbuilding in the film is phenomenal, along with its cinematography, and performances. The film feels very real, which is tough to do, considering the already stellar circumstances of the first film, but it nails it. It may not be quite as compelling as the original,but for fans and many more, it still deserves a place in our hearts.

Approval from a Blade Runner marriage,"I saw Blade Runner (2019), with my wife to be, in the opening week (Fulham Odeon, 1982). It became part of our marriage - we can refer, shorthand, to the movie, and both get the emotional reference - 'Tears in the rain'. Every time we pulled into the drive it was 'home again, home again, jiggity jig'.I remember, as a technologist being impressed by both the high tech and the obvious tech failure of this dystopian near future. Even today as I see the giant TV billboards suspended in Canary Wharf station, I am reminded of the Blade Runner blimps with their messages of a brighter and better world, as I scurry across the grey concrete landscape of that station.I have seen glimpses of negative reviews for the new movie, but this time it was with our 22 year old son we saw the movie, and we all enjoyed it, in his case this is compared with 'Guardians of the Galaxy', in ours it was compared against the original.I thought Ryan Gosling made a great successor to Harrison Ford, and it was good to see them together. I found K's relationship with Joi the most interesting and probably prescient aspect of the new movie - as AI in real life enters our homes and begins to offer us unjudgemental conversation, where will the future of love and companionship take us?The future in 2049 is even worse than 2019. Humans exist by eating protein grubs grown in vats, on superfarms, in a world with no green left at all. Global warming has led to huge sea walls protecting the city. The tech in the movie is still by a considerable margin ahead of reality, and in some respects, not least the need to invent anti-gravity - not achievable.Put pedantic doubts aside, both this movie and the original centre on the question of what it means to be human, to have feelings, to think, and love, within a dystopian world, which is actually our real world. I would hope we have a future where the human race is nicer and kinder than the AI's, but it is hard to find the evidence.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Too long, too boring","It is difficult to continue a unique masterpiece. I think director Villeneuve did very well. He also added his own elements. However, the film fails in my eyes because of its extreme length and lack of tension.The first hour, like the original, is very slow and too boring for my taste. It starts in the second third of the film at the latest. Hardly any action, but a little more excitement and unique pictures from cameraman Deakins.All in all a much too long film.

Absolute masterpiece!,"Just returned from the cinema and under fresh influence wanted to wrote few lines about the movie. With more than 60 watching of the first movie and countless hours of soundtrack studying I was very afraid of this sequel.The movie is absolute more than I expected to see. The atmosphere is identically deep, dark and wide as in the first movie. That was the main thing that i was afraid of being missing in this sequel. Even from the beginning you became aware that the movie is huge and deep. The real BR fans will know what am I talking about.Complete story is good shaped and slowly developed through entire length. It really gets you inside and overtakes your perception to the maximum. In moments I noticed that it got me as some sort of VR experience. Cant remember when for the last time I have watched every single frame of anything in cinema.From the technical aspect this is the most complex and most beautiful movie I have ever seen. As sound engineer I really must point onto most realistic surround i have heard in years. Everything, from vocals till sound effects is polished till the limits of present audio technologies.This movie will for sure reshape the actual SF community.

Mediocre and Overrated,"This is my first review, so excuse me for not being as proficient and detailed in writing reviews as many many others here. I was excited to see Blade Runner: 2049 as it is so well-rated so far. I didn't read the novel nor saw the first movie, maybe I should do that before judging this one, but I'm gonna do it either way: Is this movie bad? No, it's not. The conveyed moods are a good fit, the graphics are really good and the topic is intriguing. I haven't seen too much of Ryan Goslings acting before and I liked him, a disillusioned, melancholic figure searching for love and purpose in this f**ked-up world. The cons: The music (I know it is supposed to mirror this technocratic dystopia, but please, God, kill me now!); the length is ridiculous, why would it take 2:45 hours to paint this picture?; the story is, as I said, intriguing, but it does not offer anything innovative. I don't know what else to add and maybe that's the worst thing about the film: there is nothing out of the ordinary. There is this horribly destroyed, deserted, concrete world, the figures in it are suffering from themselves and their surroundings and everything else is 2017 graphics (at its best, admittedly).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Beautiful,"In a word, beautiful.A single word isn't enough of course.I'm a huge fan of the original, I was too young when I first watched it though and remember thinking another word – boring. At 12 I suppose you don't want to watch a movie that ponders deep philosophical questions, you just want a good guy, a bad guy and some action. As you get older, naturally, the complicated philosophical questions gain more relevance, black and white blurs into shades of gray...This is long film but the time flashed past in an instant, no scene was unnecessary, poorly written or badly acted. Some scenes stood above the rest though including a gorgeous 2-on-1 love scene that wasn't actually a 2-on-1 love scene at all, a brilliant conversation with a 'creator of memories' and the long awaited re-introduction of Rick Deckard in a fantastically realised derelict 'future Vegas'.This is also one of the most visually stunning movies that I've ever seen (Roger Deakins must win an Oscar) the soundtrack is wonderfully minimalist (I only missed Vangelis a little), and the acting is everything that you could ask for.Why not 10/10 you might ask?

Ryan Gosling's performance was especially laudable, as he has literally carried the story through his glowing presence in almost every frame of the movie.

Wonderful imagery but overly long and vague,"This movie came highly recommended by a friend, but it unfortunately did not live up to expectations. While the cinematography was excellent and the portrayal of the future dystopia highly believable, this did not make up for a slow-moving plot in which many details were unclear. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, the movie seemed to drag, and to make matters worse, the ending was anticlimactic. Also, despite watching several scenes multiple times and reading up on the plot afterwards, many elements still remained unclear to me. The storyline is simply insufficiently fleshed out and leaves the viewer desiring more.

Art in Films Done With Perfection,"This is a film that I would describe as an art-film, but rather being an art-film (like ones that are made for a niche audience), it presentations and narrative are so fantastic that I never found myself bored of the screen.I never really liked the original Blade Runner, I think it is one of the most overrated pieces in cinema. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography and world-building was nothing but impressive for its era. However, the story is slow and the narrative just doesn't make any sense (eg. what was up with that unicorn scene? Why does every single performance seems like they just want to go home?). Regardless of how much I didn't like the first film, I could appreciate its influence and production design. Blade Runner 2049 improves every single thing about the original.The plot was amazing. For once I was able to understand the character's motivation, what their goals are and so on. It explores many themes like perfectionism, life and death and every single of these themes are explored throughout the film like a sacred text. There were so many details and so many beautiful imageries that I could not imagine that these were made this movie by actual people. Everything in this film is perfect. I could see anything wrong with the film. Every single shot feels emotionally impacting and the last scene was me gripping me on my seat cheering for the main character. This is what an art film should try to accomplish. It is a film that tells life through art and art through life. It is not made for a niche audience, instead, it is made as a representation of the future possibility of the human race. These possibility seems so real in our world that I would imagine myself living in this fictional society. The CGI was perfect, the cinematography was bloody incredible. The story was amazing.There were so many things done right for this film that I am comfortable calling it a 10/10.

"Visually Stunning, But Running on Empty","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Eye-popping visuals a-plenty, but the film delivers little for the mind.SYNOPSIS: A ""blade runner"" searches for a missing person in this sci-fi epic.JIM'S REVIEW: I remember seeing the original Blade Runner back in 1982 and being transported to a strange new world. The starkly lit visuals, well staged action sequences by Ridley Scott, and the macho Harrison Ford made the movie-going experience quite memorable. The plot, however, was a confusing mess and I truly never understood the rapturous cult adoration that followed.Now, after 35 years, comes its sequel, Blade Runner 2049, and oddly, the overall effect of this new replica about replicants is mostly the same old, albeit quite dazzling, but a bit more boring and a lot more addled this time around.In truth, Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most visually arresting movies of the year. Now at the helm of the film is Denis Villeneuve, a very skilled director. He brings his powerful images to the forefront, but over intellectualizes the film to the point of confusion. He is taking us on an epic sci-fi journey, the mere length of the film, clocking in at nearly 3 hours, wants to indicate its greatness, as if size really matters.Yet the film hopelessly meanders from one tedious plot point to the next, with many scenes that cry out for some judicious editing and characters in need of better clarity. As the film relies on a convoluted script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, it tries to construct an involving and coherent narrative and never really succeeds. It is the woeful screenplay that needs a major reboot as it continually short circuits all the artistry on display.The absolutely stunning photography by the great Roger Deakins pays perfect homage to the neon noir color tones and stark lighting effects of its predecessor and his lens captures an array of contrasting places, from the dusty amber sandstorms of a dystopian Las Vegas to the urban squalor of Los Angeles with its giant female objectified holograms showing the chaotic future. Wonderful production design by Dennis Gassner adds to the film's visual look...absolutely gorgeous. The CGI by is stunning also.The film is very well cast, with Mr. Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard with the needed gratis. His presence immediately legitimizes the project. Ryan Gosling, quite convincing as K, a tough shamus trying to solve his case, is very strong in his role as well. There is a nice chemistry between both actors once they cross paths, which unfortunately takes nearly two hours to fulfill that cinematic promise for avid moviegoers. Also giving fine support are Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, and Sylvia Hoeks who makes one mean villain. Only Jared Leto seems out of place in a poorly written role as an evil entrepreneur / oracle figure that want to control the replicant population. He lacks real menace and slows down an already slow story-line.So it is with mixed results that I recommend this film. Blade Runner 2049 is certainly worthy of your attention for its sheer visual accomplishments. Imagine a sci-fi film with touches of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, and a little Terrence Malick pretension thrown in to reach that metaphysical level of awe, and you have the essence of Mr. Villeneuve's eye-fetching film. Beautiful to behold, but the mind longs for more.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A worthy sequel and a truly great film on it's own (no spoilers),"The movie is literally a throwback to the classic era of cinematography.First of all: as expected...visually Blade Runner 2049 is absolutely stunning. The compositions made me smile throughout the whole movie. Nothing more to add. The score/OST is great, but does not surpass/rival Vangelis' excellence. The themes are just not as memorable.The cast and the acting is superb. Ryan Gosling has been really on fire lately. And once again - he delivers. At times he is subtle, but when the time is right - he explodes with emotion and expression. He brought exactly the right amount of flavor to the role of detective K. Though Ryan was exceptional - the rest of the cast impressed me even more. Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Ana Armas, even Bautista (yep...he is a really good actor & I finally see it) but especially Sylvia Hoeks, who gave an ravishing performance as ""Luv (Love)"" and completely nailed her cold-ass character with a perfectionist-drive and a quest for approval. Leto was believable and completely passable, but did his usual kind of crazy. I do not want to talk about the rest of the cast, but there were several surprises here and there.It is a joyful and relaxing experience to see a movie that takes it's time. Especially in times where most movies have rapidly fast cut scenes, overly sharp and snappy dialogue and racing pacing (which can be a good thing, don't get me wrong). There is of course also the danger of making the movie too slow - thus making it unbearably boring. And this is exactly where Denis did everything just right. The pacing is perfect. It is a long movie, but it does not drag. The story and the writing are what you would expect of Hampton, Green and Villeneuve. Top notch.Overall I loved this movie a lot and I think it is the first Sci-Fi movie that might one day be ranked among the likes of 2001 and the first Blade Runner. And let's be real: on this level of quality the higher ranked movies are subjective choices. In recent years only Ex Machina and Arrival had a similar impact on me. Denis' fifth masterpiece movie in a row. What a run.To sum up: - weaker score, some locations/settings are a tad too empty neutral: a passable Leto + everything elseBonus: holograms improved so much since Tupac",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Denis' Incredible Addition to the Blade Runner Universe,"Going into this film, like others around me, I was expecting an above average sequel given Denis' previous works and the golden, holy name that is Roger Deakins and his cinematography. What I was NOT prepared for was a slow and methodical, well thought- out, brusquely dystopian, beautiful, masterpiece of a film. Best of all, it stood on its own weight and did not lean on the success of the first, and more importantly, did not succumb to the obligatory setting up of future installments that so many franchises bow down to today. Many have stated their issue with pacing and plot weaknesses, but for myself, I would rather a calculated, philosophical, noir epic that the first Blade Runner did so exceptionally well. Then again, I have never been a fan of the Big Brosnan Bonds that quench the short attention spans of the star conservative reviewers, who obviously hold an unparalleled and acute taste in filmmaking. Could the run time have been cut down? Sure, but for such a small quip, it firmly stays in the shadow of the gargantuan amount of positives that I believe put this sequel above even the original. 10/10 A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's pretty but..,"I tried so hard to like this movie. Everything about it seemed to line up. Great cast, award winning cinematography, and stunning visual effects. It was beautiful. Too bad the plot is conveluted. After half of a second run through, I reaped this movie is meant to be what it is. Pretty.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterclass on how to honour a classic movie,"Arrival was my favourite movie last year, now this: Dennis Villeneuve became one of the best active directors in my opinion (with Danny Boyle, PT Anderson, Christopher Nolan).The casting on this movie is just perfect, especially when it comes to the women, such strong characters. Ana de Armas, on this, rivals Gal Gadot as the most beautiful human face in cinema right now.If you have big expectations for this, don't worry: they will be fulfilled.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but not great","Okay first of all before l get started about my review on this, l want to say that the first Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie, it's fantastic in my eyes and a real work of art in the Sci Fi genre. As for Blade Runner 2049...I was a little disappointed. Lets go over the positives first. This movie is stunning and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is brilliant! It's truthfully mind blowing and almost worth the price of admission alone. This movie also had a lot of interesting Sci Fi elements that are new and innovative, like Ryan Gosling's holographic girlfriend. I've never seen anything quite like it, it was pretty cool. The actors were all very strong in their performances, so much so that it left me wanting more from certain characters. I really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance, he's pulls off an especially creepy and mysterious character. I wanted more Leto to be honest. Negatives This film is slow and too long! And I love slow movies usually! They unnecessarily stretch scenes out to the point where you're bored....and as a BIG Blade Runner fan it pains me to say that! I'm upset actually that l felt this way about this movie. The movie has pacing issues for sure. I also found the main plot of the story a little thin, it wasn't hard to get lost in this movie and wonder where are they going with this? They tried to throw a twist in, but truthfully when the twist is unraveled or revealed I didn't care, it was underwhelming. For a movie being 2 hrs 40 minutes l actually expected more out of it. Certain scenes were too long and drawn out, and other parts were sorrily lacking depth. The original Blade Runner story is way better in my opinion. Also Harrison Ford doesn't even show up until the last 40 minutes and by the end of movie I thought to myself, ""did they even really need him?"" Overall the movie is OK, which again sucks for me to say, because if the pacing and story was a little bit stronger and things flowed a bit better this movie could have easily been a 10/10 for Sci Fi. To sum it all up it's a good movie with some extraordinary visuals and very cool Sci Fi technology/elements and the acting is strong, but has serious pacing problems, it's too long and the story is average. LOL the first Blade Runner has a faster pace! So to all those people who thought the first one was slow, don't even bother with this one. I would definitely watch Blade Runner 2049 again as I feel I could definitely learn new things and l want to see if my opinion changes to a more positive one. Overall my rating is a 7/10.....barely.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
