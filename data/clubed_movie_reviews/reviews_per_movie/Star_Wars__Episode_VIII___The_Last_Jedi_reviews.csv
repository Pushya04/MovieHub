The death of a franchise.,"The Last Jedi is a well-made film; it's visually stunning and well directed. The problem is that it singlehandedly ruined the sequel trilogy by closing the second chapter with a dead end. There are truly baffling character decisions, awkward humor, useless subplots - it's by far the most frustrating Star Wars movie because of the potential it had. If it were 20 minutes shorter, it could have been something special, but the last act sees our characters in the exact same spot as they began. As a standalone movie, it's watchable. As the second part of a trilogy, it's a disaster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazed by the negativity,"I walked out of this movie with six friends at 3 am, and all of us were WIRED from adrenaline and amazement. And then I checked IMDB and saw nothing but angry fans, proving that there really is no pleasing organized fandom. Everyone complained mightily at how unoriginal and ""safe"" The Force Awakens was, and then a movie comes along with an actual point of view, with incredible style unlike anything that has come before it in the series, that is daring, fresh, and original...and now it's just too different for everyone.Though some of the complaints are fair (namely that one major subplot turns out to be largely a digression), this was so surprising and thoughtful and fresh that it frankly makes The Force Awakens better by recontextualizing it. This movie has something to say if people will take a moment to listen to it rather than getting pissy that it wasn't what they were expecting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's bad. I don't know why people defend it.,"I really want to sit across from Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy and ask them honest questions:1. Do you know what ""heavy-handed"" means?2. In film school, or in any time in your career, did you ever learn about building tension, or making the audience care about characters, or continuity from a previous installment?3. Is this a Star Wars movie or a Marvel movie version of Star Wars?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A beautiful, humorous and magical Star Wars movie!","I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 7 years old, and I even remember seeing Empire and Jedi on the big screen as a kid. Yeah, I'm old. But, I'm a little shocked at so many haters of this movie, many of you have given a 2! A 2???? Seriously?I've given The Last Jedi an 8. It's an epic and original Star Wars movie, with gorgeous cinematography and incredible music from the wonderful John Williams again. Rain Johnson has managed to expand the force mythology, inject some good ol' humour back into the saga, and throw in some wonderful surprises, that I believe, we all needed. It seems like many of you do not like change, or are not prepared to enjoy a Star Wars movie that takes risks. This movie takes huge risks; it dares to offer something fresh in a franchise that is over 40 years old. It also pays homage to the original trilogy in a beautiful and tasteful way. So, no, I do NOT understand the haters out there.Nevertheless, it's not a perfect movie. There are some risks that Johnson takes, that will upset some fans, but some of those decisions have made me ponder the force in a new way. One of the main problems for me was the 'detour' from the main storyline with Finn and Rose. This storyline felt a bit sluggish, 'forced' and feels kind of shoehorned in there, and it also doesn't really serve the greater story-but then again, maybe it DOES. I will need to see it again to decide on this. There were also a handful of 'dumb' little moments, that I won't get into, and certainly at times I was reminded that Star Wars movies were originally made for children, and while we have our darker adult themes at work here (and even spiritual themes), there are also many magical moments for children. Maybe us 'grownups' need to stop taking it all so seriously and learn to be kids again?For the most part, this is a solid, original and gorgeous Star Wars movie that I believe, makes The Force Awakens seem a little bland and unoriginal. Go and see it, it's the best Star Wars movie since Empire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Worse,"I've seen some Star Wars movie lately, 3 or 4, skipped episodes, but they were not as bad as this one. This seems to hit all records, and by this, I mean the bad ones. It's a Swedish buffet with the worst thing you can imagine: poor acting, action, scenes, etc. It certainly doesn't look like Star Wars to me. And I don't believe it looks this way for others either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Star Wars: The Last Jedi can only be surmised, for me, as a disappointment.","I'm not exactly sure what everyone else watched, but this is certainly no masterpiece. I've seen words like risk-taking, bold and edgy being thrown around. Bold? Gimme a break. There's more boldness in the Times New Roman font. This instalment has evidently, looking at aggregated scores, polarised viewers. And I can see why. In this episode, the rebels attempt to flee from The First Order and it's up to Finn to retrieve someone to help them infiltrate their primary ship. Meanwhile, Rey tries to convince Luke to help the rebels and train her in the Jedi religion. That's pretty much as grand as this chapter gets. Where is the grandeur!? Where are the stakes!? Why am I not on the edge of my seat! No matter how aesthetically pleasing the visuals are, the constant feeding of nostalgia and the inclusions of a few memorable scenes...it doesn't make a film great. This episode is weighed down by underdeveloped characters, sluggish pacing and pivotal elements that are rushed. I have no doubt in my mind that Rian Johnson's directing style was glorious, in fact the technical aspects to The Last Jedi are outstanding. Visually I cannot fault the effects that are used and also appreciated the use of puppets and animatronics, particularly the Porgs which are bound to make Disney a fortune. Various memorable scenes, such as a cruiser lightspeeding into another ship, make for some general entertainment. But, I can't shake off the fact that I was bored. It took nearly half the film's runtime to get going and become interesting. Kylo Ren is the most intriguing character with plenty of internal conflict. Adam Driver gives a perfectly good performance, full of emotion beneath his eyes. I can see it! They just didn't explore his character arc or utilise him to his maximum potential. The Force Awakens introduces us to these fascinating bubbly characters that are just utterly wasted in this. I'm uncertain about ""bold"" choices regarding Leia, Snoke and Luke...but even so, I wasn't enthralled enough to care.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
WTF is wrong with you people?! It is a good movie! :D,"Won't post any spoilers, but reading all these bad reviews: I just have to set this straight.First of are any of you fans at all? Do not sound like it, it borrowed from the old movies in a good way, while it was it's own thing.It is visually stunning for sure, the music is of course awesome!It is ALOT better better than TFA.
Think many of these negative review are just there too belittle the movie.
It is cool to hate every movie beyond four to six... You people...
Rian Johnson did not fail, he did really good!Everyone I talked with at the movie theater liked it, none rated it under 7/10.
I walked out of the movie theater more hyped than I where going in.It was creative, it was a Star Wars movie. If you have a open mind and heart when you go see it; you will enjoy itPS: What happen to Luke is a nod to what happens in the original three.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Have an open Mind, This is not your Fathers Star Wars","I should start by saying if you're an unwavering star wars fan who can enjoy the prequels then you will be able to enjoy this movie. Seeing how most user reviews are 5 or below i feel most will disagree with me, but here goes nothing.Leaving The Last Jedi i wasn't sure what to think about the movie. That's not saying that i wasn't happy or pleased with what i saw, its just the movie gives you so much to think about. The tone was great and the pacing felt fine with the exception of one story arc. Most the Humor landed, and some didn't. Some things felt really forced and some felt natural. If you come into this movie hoping to see a remake of Empire then you will leave disappointed. This movie stands on its own legs as it should. It explores new aspects of the force that we've never seen before. But what i really like most is its unpredictability. In multiple scenes my mind was racing with the thought of whats going to happen now. It takes so many twist and turns along with some big risk that I think pay off. So if you haven't seen this movie but you're a big star wars fan id recommend seeing it so you can have your own opinion about it. Not everyone will be pleased with this movie, and again you have to have an open mind about it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Did Rian Johnson watch the other films on mute?,"It is as if Rian Johnson watched the Star Wars movies on mute before writing/directing this film. Visually, the movie is stunning. From the set pieces to the action sequences, ""The Last Jedi"" has some of the best visual moments in the franchise. Unfortunately, the story and a true understanding of the Star Wars universe is lacking.The actions of some of the characters are completely against what we have seen in other films (the treatment of Luke Skywalker is absurd).The new characters introduced are irritating and shallow (Laura Dern's Vice-Admiral Holdo might be my least favorite character in Star Wars history).Force sensitivity is a joke (Leia, Luke, Kylo and Rey).The entire ""master code breaker"" plotline is frustratingly pointless.When I look at the poster for this movie, I think about the epic fight sequences and the daring visuals. This is fortunate, because the rest of the film is frustratingly disjointed from the rest of the franchise.Best Character: Kylo Ren

The worst of the newest installments,"This film's downfall was the screenplay. The writing was all over the place with major plot issues and convoluted scenes. Even the attempted humor was stale. This felt more like a Disney film than a true Star Wars installment. For the long length of this film, the writing should have been tighter. However, still amazing cinematography and VFX, and the directing was OK considering the screenplay was a mess. Not sure how anyone can rate this a 1 (seeing lots of those) without any credit to the visuals. It's a fair and honest 6/10 from me",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fresh new beginning with the potential for a new direction and ideas. Loved it.,"The Last Jedi instilled the same excitement, awe and wonder I first felt when seeing A New Hope back in 1977.I agree with Luke and Kylo. It's time to forget the past and to move forward.I think it telling that the audience demographic who rated this movie the highest is the under 18 crowd. This is the group that will keep the SW dream alive. It makes me happy to see the wonder in their eyes. My grandchildren haven't stopped talking about the movie. That makes me happy.
 
The negative opinions seem to come from old, hard core fans who are never satisfied. They complained about George Lucas' prequels and now they complain about the latest offerings. Frankly I don't think they know what they want.My advice, forget the hard core, impossible to please critics, and see the movie for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The weakest one thus far.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Last Jedi. I read tons of reviews stating The Force Awakens was the worst one while for me it was the best one. The worst one to me was The Last Jedi, it's just much too long, it has an uninteresting story with a lot of unnecessary scenes, the CGI's were good but that's only normal for a Star Wars movie, certainly for a recent one. I just feel the writers didn't know what to do at one point, it was just a bad script this time. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One and The Last Jedi, those I thought were of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the tenth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely five days for me, next one today will be The Rise Of Skywalker, the latest and last one in the hope it will be better than this one, looking forward to it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't listen to the butthurt masses,"This movie was fun, exciting, and expanded the Star Wars universe more. Since when has Star Wars been about answering all of the nitty gritty questions of how the force and the universe work. When people are upset about that, I am astounded that they ""expected more"" explanation from the series. Since the prequels, people have been crying that there was too much revealed, and not enough mystery, as there had been with the originals. I for one am glad that we are introduced to characters who aren't fleshed out here, that leaves room for the imagination and the extended universe to delve into. I've seen some reviewers complain that the movie is too slow, some that it is too scatterbrained, but I think the nuance of the movie outweighs either of these. Also, no spoilers, but I think that what they did with each character felt good, and by no means did I feel cheated by the movie.

Manual of how to destroy a legacy,"Now, let's see how to fill in those 600 words required, while all one needs to describe this movie is one that cannot be written here. This is not Star Wars, this is not Luke Skywalker. I'm still trying to figure out why they managed to totally destroy the original characters, the whole notion of this legacy. Instead of grabbing the opportunity to elaborate and develop them in a way that nurtures our love and nostalgia of them and sets the ground for more exciting adventures to come, they treated them with disrespect. Only someone ignorant, who has never watched Star Wars or dislikes them for some reason, would end up with a story like this. Such wasted potential. It definitely was a very difficult task. That's why it should be handled by someone who really cares and has what it takes to maintain the vision. It's like they sabotaged themselves on purpose.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An incredibly enjoyable film!,"Episode VIII is very enjoyable. It is the type of film you could easily go back to any time, sit down and watch and easily binge watch in a marathon (the way star wars are meant to be watched).Im not going to deny it, some parts of the story line leave a bit to be desired, some acting too is a tad weak in areas and just doesnt feel as genuine as it could. There are characters in this film which just pop up, have next to no development and are suddenly part of the mix and the film acts like we should relate to their feelings. But realistically none of that matters.I have grown up loving the star wars films for what they are and what they are is a great Sci-Fi action movie franchise that makes you imagine and smile and this film does all of those things. I laughed, I sat on the edge of my seat, i jumped and I felt like it was real. This film has great battles, fights, scenes, graphics, tension, sound, music, characters and 100% adds something to the franchise as a whole.I have read about 15 other reviews and they all come back to one thing - its not like star wars used to be. Well im sorry, but times changes and so should the story line of star wars, new concepts have been introduced in this film and its no longer as black and white and previous episodes. All the main ingredients are still there, just put together in a different way and I loved it. Also - dont forget this is the middle episode of three, therefore a lot of the strange story developments in this, im sure will make sense in episode IX.If you love Stars Wars for what it is in itself unique universe or if you want to watch an absolutely brilliant film, with blasters, aliens, lightsabers and some weird force thing that lifts rocks. Watch. This. Film. Its great. I will be watching it again and again, many years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Unique, Epic, Fantastic!","Following the Force Awakens which was both a critical and fan hit, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi had the highest bar to climb, and it manages to go a lot higher than the its predecessor. Rian Johnson's touch has elevated The Star Wars franchise by daring to take risks, and taking our beloved characters to a new level. 
This is a unique Star Wars film in its story telling aspects, in its humor, and in its style. This will drop as many jaws as I assume The Empire Strikes Back originally did. This is also the most beautiful Star Wars movie to date, with breathtaking Cinematography, Fight Choreography and Visual Effects. But Most importantly, all of these technical aspects are only there to elevate the gripping story and character arcs that Johnson has created. 
The Last Jedi is absurdly entertaining, gripping, and is also a mind bender. It will trick you, confuse you and ask you questions, only to pay them off and answer them in the most surprising and satisfying way possible. None of the main characters are one sided, as Rian Johnson manages to make you feel empathy for all of its characters, specially the main Villain, Kylo Ren. He remains a strong antagonist who is conflicted, but driven and you could say the same about our hero, Ray. Luke Skywalker is handled masterfully, and that's all I can say about him without going to spoilers. So much happens with him that is surprising, but fitting to his character. Mark Hammill shines bright, but the brightest star is the Late Carrie Fisher, as General Leia. It is difficult not to feel emotional every time you see her on the screen. She plays her iconic character as well as ever, and could not be in a better movie as her last. 
The Last Jedi has grand emotional gut punches, followed by great action sequences, including my all-time favorite _and for a lack of a better fitting word the most Badass_ scene in the franchise. However just like any film it has its flaws and I can summarize my main problem with the movie in one word: Porgs. These cute birds are only there to be adored and are only there so Disney can sell Toys, which we know brings a surprisingly large amount of revenue to the studio. In Contrast to the Porgs, I loved the cute droid BB_8 because he as so much purpose and he is vital in the story. The story also loses some of its emotional build up in one particular heavy scene towards the end, to throw in a joke which felt forced and unnecessary. Happily these two minor complaints get lost in this fantastic story. This is truly a great film, and you don't have to be a Star Wars fan to love it. Rian Johnson's different vision for this movie, has made me a lot more optimistic about the future of Star Wars, and his original trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Johnson's fresh touch and Hamill's magnificent performance make for a film which is thrilling, clever, funny and heartbreaking at its best moments","I attended an advanced press screening of the movie a few hours ago. It won me over! And bear in mind that I hated ""The Force Awakens"" (honestly thought it was a Episode IV rip-off). Here, director Rian Johnson doesn't play it safe, and it pays off. If I must point out a certain highlight, it's without a doubt Mark Hamill's performance. I really admired his ability to convincingly convey so many different emotions throughout the film; hats off to this guy. I'll be rooting for him in the future.After I had seen ""The Force Awakens"", I figured out I would never like a new Star Wars movie again. Boy, was I wrong. I loved ""The Last Jedi""! This film had clever humour (there was a certain hilarious moment between General Hux and Kylo Ren that I couldn't stop laughing at; you'll totally know when you see the film yourselves), good cinematography and great characters (just see how developed Benicio Del Toro's minor character is) that I could care about. It also had a very good plot for the most part, with many unpredictable and surprising elements. The action was good, and the fighting scenes even better (great choreography).Although the ideas weren't always original, the experience felt real. Therefore, I often struggled to control my emotions. It was the ideal farewell to Carrie Fisher.I mean, what more could I ask for?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One and done.,I did enjoy the movie when watch it first. At least get some new ships. How some of them are illogical. Space bombers fire missiles because they can not rely gravity to make the bombs drop. Most space bombers in Star Wars fire missiles or torpedoes of some kind. Then have what come in the end of the move which question make weapons in the first place. Good seeing first time because not really thinking about it.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm going to keep this short (unlike the film).,"After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough.The reasons for my loathing are the same as those noted in the countless scathing reviews here on IMDb, so I won't go into drawn out detail - suffice to say that the film frequently beggars belief, is massively bloated, defies logic and is full of misplaced humour (the worst moments being the horrible 'steam iron' gag and BB-8's handy coin launcher).3 out of 10, solely for the impressive special effects.

 It sometimes reminded me a lot of the prequels from the early 2000s, so I can not rate this movie higher than 6/6.5!TLJ leaves you not wanting to know how the story goes on from here. I simply do not care since they failed to make the new charakters more intersting!I defently will not watch the next movie at its premiere, instead I'll wait till its out on Netflix!Dissappointing!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not this Disappointed Since Jar Jar Binks,"I love the Star Wars franchise. I was so anxious to watch The Last Jedi especially how The Force Awakens ended and how good The Force Awakens was. I bought my tickets a month and a half in advance in anticipation of episode eight.As the movie started I was dialed in for the first 15 minutes then I noticed this subtle uneasiness in me like a disturbance in the force. It began with the interaction between Poe and Princess Leia. She made a comment and made a decision regarding Poe that I found a little unsettling. ""OK."" I thought. I didn't like that exchange but it's not a show stopper. The subtlety was that Leia was making it seem like the Rebels were in no need of heroes. They didn't need fighters anymore, they needed thinkers (or something akin to that). I took that little shift in philosophy in stride and kept eagerly watching. A couple of other small iniquities occurred but I soldiered forth watching with an open mind because it's ""Star Wars"".Then, there came the interaction between Rey and Luke Skywalker.Luke is part of movie folklore to me. Like many people have the one celebrity they'd like to meet: the one fictional character for me has always been Luke Skywalker. Luke was the first hero I'd seen wear black. He had piloting skills, light saber skills and could do Jedi mind tricks. He was the coolest.Fast forward nearly 40 years and now Luke is an old man. So what I'm expecting is an older, WISER Luke. If Luke is on a deserted planet then it must be for a very good reason. And if Rey found him, much like Luke found Yoda, then Luke will have so much to impart upon Rey. That's not quite what went down. They made Luke a sullen pessimistic old man that was ignorant of simple truths. He offered so little; to the movie and to Rey. He was a shell of his former self, he was only good at being the ex machina. The Luke Skywalker in this movie was NOT the Luke Skywalker I knew. The Luke Skywalker I know was killed in this movie.After seeing my fictional hero relegated to something unrecognizable I actually became bitter while watching the movie. There was almost nothing they could do to save the movie. And they didn't . In fact, it got worse. By the end the movie was more of what I should have saw coming: rebels running from the Republic and figuring out some remote yet heroic way to ward them off. And what added to the annoyingness of this movie is that they didn't know when or how to end it. What should have been the end was followed up by another half an hour mini movie with its own beginning, middle and end.But unlike The Last Jedi I know how to end this post.

STAR WARS: Is it no longer for my generation?,"I'm 49 years old. STAR WARS was the first movie that I ever saw as a child. My mom and dad took my brother and I to the drive-in to see it. That year for Christmas I got a STAR WARS bed spread for my room. I've been a true fan for literally as long as I can remember.My wife and I took our 17 year old son to the movie last night -opening night. Afterward, walking to the truck, the question was asked, ""What did I you think of the movie?"" Our son says, ""That was one of the greatest movies ever!"" He goes on about the fighting and everything. He thought it was too long and a little boring at first but really loved it overall. I tried to be nice and said it was my least favorite STAR WARS movie ever. Then my wife and I start tearing apart every aspect of the movie and saying how much we hated so much about it. The audience said it all really: Not a sound for the whole film. No laughing at the stupid humor, No Ooohs or aaahs. No cheering. Really? No cheering from a late opening night theatre full of adults dressed up like STAR WARS characters? There was nothing to cheer about.I feel really bad. This is no longer my movie franchise. Maybe it will my kid's franchise? Maybe my parents hated A New Hope but just took me and my brother solely for us as kids? Maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut last night. Our son kept saying that we were being such a bummer by talking about how bad it was and what a terrible director and what a terrible story blah blah.What should I do? Pretend I liked it and take my niece and nephew at Christmas and go with my brother as planned and get popcorn and say how great it was and have a great time with my daughters too as we have planned? Should I do what the professional movie reviewers have done and rave about it even though I know it's a terrible movie on its own and a terrible betrayal of the franchise?At least my wife and I can be honest with each other. I feel so bad sometimes for this generation growing up now. They don't know how good we had it growing up, and now they have lost the old STAR WARS universe that we had hoped was revived for them to enjoy. Or maybe I'm just old and they will love the new universe being created?

"Good action, humor, and many exciting moments","In the Force Awakens, it felt like a remake of the old movies. This time the plot had some uniqueness.

If you want to find things in the plot that doesn't make sense I'm sure you can find that as well, but I think it's true for most movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best star wars storytelling and directing since return of the jedi,"When a movie goes against what people think they want and know about the star wars universe, they will complain. That does not change the fact that this is, objectively, the best star wars since the original trilogy. Well done rian johnson. Disney, dont turn star wars into the Marvel universe and pan to crowd pleasing, because that's an impossible task",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A weird feeling: Star Wars The Last Jedi,"Very few times has happened to me that I'm unable to rate a movie. I tend to have a very claer idea of what I think about a movie after I've seen it once, or maybe twice if I'm not sure what to make of it the first time. But after the third time watching this movie and almost three years of thinking about it, I'm still impressed by the unrateable quality of it. As a Star Wars fan I can understand why people got upset about this (although not necesarilly to the level it got to), but I do not see how in any capacity this movie is terrible. It has a number of problems that I consider irredeemable for a movie of this budget and scope, but at the same time it has some of the most interesting concepts explored in the Star Wars Universe. I would watch this over Solo every single time, but I wouldn't blame anyone for doing the opposite.I think the flaws in this movie (represented by the two thirds of the movie that isn't helmed by the main trio) overshadow the very intelligent storytelling going on in the triangular conflict between Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren. Their three different conceptions of the force are a very interesting paradigm to add into the universe and to potencially explore in later films. Their characters work very well within their own separate narrative, Kylo Ren being the standout in my opinion.But this doesn't really take away from the fact that the other fraction of the plot suffers from characters that make decisions with absolutly no impact over the story, esentially being there because the movie wouldn't make sense as a sequel to The Force Awakens. And there is where my fundamental problem with the new trilogy of Star Wars: they have absolutely no clue where the story was going. The Force Awakens is a good set-up movie. It establishes intriguing ideas to explore in the later movies without really moving away from what already existed. That's esentially the best way to resume J. J. Abrams' career, honestly. But in reality, Rian Johnson is a different kind of director, in the sense that he is more of an author. He is interested in the ideas Star Wars can have within the extremely rich world that's already established. But there was two thirds of the story he just wasn't interested in exploring, so he just fell in line and followed orders. I don't know this with certainty (I'm just a college guy with absolutely no conections in the industry), but watching Knives Out, you can tell that he is a great storyteller when he is fully interested in the material (or he is the one making it, entirely on his own).So overall, I'm not entirely sure the hate towards this movie is entirely granted. I think that there's certain parts of this movie that deserve it, but at the center of it, I think there is a very interesting story here. The problem is that there was a specific number of bullet points that had to be accomplished limiting the creator. This is probably the first movie out of the new trilogy that I would go back to watch. I think Force Awakens is fine and the Rise of Skywalker is just awful, but both are just competent and nothing else. The Last Jedi takes risks that other movies wouldn't have the balls to make. In time, I think this movie will be more appreciated as at least an attempt of trying to take the franchise in a different direction. Sadly, that seems to be something impossible to do nowadays without making somebody squeamish.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Terrible Director, terrible technique","Rian Johnson, clearly wasn't a choice for a movie of that magnitude. The movie edition was terrible, jumping from scenes to scenes in a very amateur way that kills all the drama.The movie steal good ideas from other movies but in a way that makes you fell uncomfortable (and sorry) for watch it (Matrix Luke I'm talking about you), and I'm not even talking about the humor relief scenes, which makes me wondering if George Lucas was allowed to add scenes to the movies again.So, I'm not judging it as a Star Wars history, but as movie.

A completely empty movie made for profit on a generic PC hollywood formula,"There is very little good to say about it. The movie is void of any significant story or dialogues, it lacks purpose and vision. Its rather an obvious and obnoxious mix of studio wishes for toy sales and trying to please as wide an audience as possible. So many things wrong dont know where to even begin.First of all, Jar Jar, the ever annoying horrible Jar Jar from previous movies at least had a purpose as a (very poor) comic relief character. The fluffy penguins in Last Jedi on the other hand are 100% transparently there for no reason but toy sales. 
The action trumps everything in the movie. I have nothing against good action but come on. And the characters are so blatantly cliche and repeating themselves. Luke, a seemingly wise Jedi, perhaps fed up with everything but how does that make him a miserable, cold, heartless bast*ard. All of the characters are so black and white, its mind numbing.
A good movie is a good movie, be it a simple comedic Thor Ragnarok or a thought provoking Matrix. But the Last Jedi is nothing of that, its a heartless product almost made by a (quality) hollywood generator machine working based on a formula of most prevalent cliches today and popular ideas/values. Also of course the SJW crowd had to have their say making all heroes,general,admirals whatever women and male hero black. And then throw in an asian sidekick,they mustnt be forgoten,that would be rasist. 
Its pathetic. The race or sex of characters shouldnt be forced,it should serve the story. It does anything but that here. It wasnt story first here. It was the marketing guy, the censor, the SJW representative and toy company. Only THEN came director,story,character.
Expect no sight or smell of anything original, thought provoking, tabboo breaking or good moral quandries.

What?,"I have been a star wars nerd from the age of 6, and this is not my Star wars. Im going to see episode 9 to round things up. But after that i am done with the 'Disney' star wars movies and will only read the legends material. Broker my heart",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is not going to go the way you think.,"First of all, let me alleviate the concern that this film is a rehash of Empire Strikes Back by affirming that it is indeed not. The Last Jedi is by far the most original, surprising and exhilarating Star Wars film since the Disney-Lucasfilm acquisition in 2012. It's also a high point in the Star Wars saga, and I have no doubt it will be remembered as one of the most consequential chapters in the Star Wars mythos in the years to come.Which is why, I must implore audiences to please please please for the love of God, avoid spoilers at all costs. If you're a fan, and if you're reading this before going in, then I can assure you that spoilers will most definitely affect your movie-going experience, as there is quite obviously a lot that happens in this film that has so effectively been kept under wraps for the same reason.The Last Jedi could not have been what it is without Rian Johnson. It's very clear he's a massive fan of Star Wars, and this film is honestly more like an impassioned labor of love. His writing, the way he's directed this film, it all shines as some of the best I've seen this year. This is also a beautiful, beautiful looking film with what is quite possibly the best cinematography and visuals of any Star Wars film ever made.It's also incredibly well acted- Mark Hamill absolutely kills it. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver also perform their roles as Rey and Kylo Ren perfectly. The rest of the cast is sound, and Carrie Fisher in her final role is every bit the Leia we've come to know and love, and then some.The score by John Williams is wholesome. There's really no other way for me to describe it. A wonderful mix of brand-new as well as familiar motifs and themes. Despite the great score and visuals, however, The Last Jedi manages to make your jaw drop several times with some of the most surprising moments in the saga thus far- there's a line that Luke Skywalker says in the film, that is the title of this review and is most definitely applicable to this film: ""This is not going to go the way you think."" And that it is not, Rian Johnson has assured that with this story that's continually unexpected, a story that indeed changes the way you look at these films, which is precisely what it shares in common with The Empire Strikes Back, and that's every bit a good thing.I am incredibly lucky to have watched this movie premiere, but I truly think it's a lucky time for Star Wars fans all over. Watch this as soon as you can and try your best not to be spoiled. Of course, if you're a fan, you won't need convincing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Well that was most certainly a shock! After the phenomenal Force Awakens, The Last Jedi had a lot to live up to, and it most certainly delivered the hype in terms of story, characters and twists. It gave us some excellent development on the existing characters like Finn, Kylo, Leia and Luke, as well as giving a great new character in the form of Rose. The acting is excellent throughout, particularly from the veteran cast members. Looking back, Daisy Ridley as Rey was one of the weaker actors in The Force Awakens, but absolutely bring her A-game in the new film, running the whole range of emotions to incredible effect. As excited as I am for JJ to come back for IX, after this film Rian Johnson deserves to make this new trilogy he's announced.The big worry about this film was the same as the last, being that it was looking too much like other films in the original trilogy which I'm happy to say it most certainly isn't, it's created it's own tight, self-contained story which could quite easily have been the finale. But being the midpoint it leaves a lot of threads open to be resolved in the next film. Without spoiling anything there are three major twists, one of which is going to either excite fans or majorly annoy them. I for one am excited to see the ramifications of that particular twist in Episode IX. It's really difficult for me not to give spoilers, but one minor thing without saying too much is a familiar face comes back and it's one I was really happy to see when things were going downhill for one of the leads. A lovely little surprise!There are a lot of action set-pieces in the film and most of them deliver in terms of excitement, special effects and even some humour. When it came to the quieter moments, talking about the lore of the Force, Rey wanting to find out who she is and the connection between her and another character, the staging and effects reflect that fantastically, bringing a scene very reminiscent of the Mirror of Erised from the film Harry Potter.One of the controversies of the films was Mark Hamill's reaction to where Luke Skywalker, as a character was going, with him disagreeing on a moral level. It's easy to see why he would think that given how the film plays out but given what the character went through with Kylo Ren, I understand the arc Luke goes through and leads to a wonderful climax involving him, harking back to a scene in the very first film.THE BAD
Porgs....so many porgs...Only joking, I didn't mind the porgs, but there were some moments of humour that really didn't need to happen, including the odd line between Kylo Ren and Rey.A couple of characters who were hyped really don't get their time to shine, one from the previous film and one introduced here. They're not bad but definitely deserved more. It's probably the main problem with the film in that there are so many characters we have to care about and some of them get neglected, particularly in the storyline involving the Resistance on the run from the First Order, which runs far too slow for my liking and is made that way in favour of the thread involving Finn and Rose.There's also a scene with Leia that I'm still not sure what to make of, it's a bit of a weird one.THE VERDICT
For this generation's Star Wars it is definitely the most shocking film so far, and an absolutely incredible sequel to the Force Awakens. Do I prefer this film to VII? Not quite, but it's incredibly close. A fantastic film, and a wonderful send off to the late, great Carrie Fisher. We'll miss you Princess.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A very misunderstood film,"This film is one of the most ambitious high budget movies I've ever seen. When it came out in 2017, I remember how polarizing this film was. Some people loved it and a lot of people hated it for being too different from the star wars regime. I have to give props to Rian Johnson for taking a risk and trying to expand the star wars universe and make it more deep in it's mythology and bring out the humanity in it. I thought this film was genius to make Luke Skywalker not the legend we thought he would be. Mark Hamill also gives the best acting performance of his entire career. I enjoyed the progression in Kylo, Rey, Finn, and Poe as well. Their narratives were unexpected but welcome as it helped them not follow the same tropes as the predecessor heroes from other trilogies. Exploring toxic masculinity, learning from failure, and how someone can be special without be related to a big name. Overall this film gave me the unexpected. Something I've been wanting.

So basically ruined a nostalgic character just too promote a feminine Mary Sue. And also Leia supermanning herself back to the spaceship without dying barskinned in space is just B.

Mixed Bag: The Movie,The Last Jedi is one of the most complicated films for me to talk about. On one hand I love where they took some things but I also hated where they took other things. It feels like the director clashed with what was intrigued in The Force Awakens for a new approach to the story that doesn't make as much sense and isn't as good. Some character arcs are handled perfectly and others go nowhere. The Last Jedi's worth will only be proven by time at this point.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not bad at all,"From my point of view, who saw the original trilogy as a kid in german lang. on sattelite tv, and then few years later on VHS in czech hundred times, I say I liled it a lot, it is original, as the original trilogy was. Total problem was the prequels, where GL tried to maximize the universe, too many tricks and robots, that did not work, the acting was terrible, and only last few minutes of first and third movies where worth it. But I loved Ep XII, and I love this episode as well, RJ is not bad, AJ is my favorite director, but he did not do well in Ep IX, the screenplay was terrible in first 30 minutes and he killed all the acting of side actors, he developed only the main character (succesfuly), but he should not try to change what RJ tried to evolve in Ep VIII, he should not return with Palpatine (there is no base story in it), I think that was a biggest mistake, the story was going its own way and that was good, we did not need a remake, but a new SW movies, and in that Ep VIII was excelling. So for me Ep VIII is better than Ep IX.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A New-Age Sci-Fi Classic,"For film fanatics like myself, The Last Jedi is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the originals or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Star Wars films and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this 2 and a half hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why The Last Jedi is a must see as soon as possible.Before dropping you into this world with our characters, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past and what has taken place during the past time. But even though that information is given to you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the first film and remembering the emotional core of it. Rey's character uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Kylo and the First Order while training with Luke. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let's get technical.If not for anything else, The Last Jedi benefits from some of the best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will.Again, without giving anything away, once Kylo, Finn and Poe enter the picture, the way both stories sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Adam Driver, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers mysteries about Snoke. With the addition of Mark Hamill giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Andy Serkis in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was cast to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Oscar Isaac and Gwendoline Christie not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely.In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans and Star Wars fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1980's Empire Strikes Back. I don't say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the previous, it's one of the better films of 2017, and I'll be revisiting it very soon. The Last Jedi is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and film goers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This adventure is full of twist and turn and sets a real exciting space opera of high voltage conspiracy , actions including different space instruments and arms, and overall a composite world of fantasy and drama. Their adventure brings many past secrets to light and many hidden facts are revealed by this.The movie is not absolutely concerned with actions and fantasy but it has a good build up of story around a very good plot and the acting as well as the direction , special effects are reasonably well performed.Those who like to watch fantasy movie will obviously like it.

If you go from force awakens to rise of skywalker and skip this movie, and if no one told you, you wouldn't know.This movie fails to answer any questions from the previous movie and creates more questions to be answered in the next.I'd by no means say the movie sucks but as a starwars movie goes, it's not good. Rian Johnson treated legacy characters like they don't matter and his failure to acknowledge their importance is a major problem.The movie has some good parts like the battle on Scariff but the useless Canto Bight story kills this movie.All in all I think they movie isn't very good and fails to answer anything.

"""Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans.""","I took my father to see this when it came out in theaters. After the movie, I told him that I thought it was my second favorite after Empire. My dad, who raised me on these movies, who has seen each of them when they first released in theaters dating all the way back to 1977, who has seen each of these movies almost as many times as I have, said ""Nah, I think this might've actually been my favorite.""
I just watched this movie again for maybe the fourth or fifth time and I still love it. I think this was honestly my favorite of Mark Hamill's performances as Luke, because he shows so much range. He's a very tortured character, angry at himself, angry at the Jedi, angry at the Sith, and angry at the Force. In one brief moment of weakness, fearing the potential of the darkness in his nephew, fearing that he wouldn't be able to be the mentor Ben needed (the same fear he showed in Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, mind you), he made a mistake, because of course, not even Luke Skywalker is perfect, and that mistake cost him the soul of the son of his sister and his best friend. Without giving spoilers, Luke's arc takes him from the part of a reclusive curmudgeon, reminiscent of what we saw from Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, and leads him to be the hero and the face of hope that the Resistance needs when he utterly humiliates Kylo Ren in front of the entire First Order and the remains of the Resistance.
The only real issue I have with the movie is that I feel the Canto Bight sequence is too preachy for my taste, as I just watch movies to have a good time - not to be given a sermon. But even that sequence has merits going for it, like that little drunk alien shoving tokens into BB-8 (that alien is played by Mark Hamill, by the way). Rose is adorable, and the fathiers are cute and the practical effects used to create them in the stable are flawless.
My favorite part of the movie is the whole last half hour that takes place on the planet Crait. The imagery of the asymmetrical speeders skating on the dusty surface, kicking up the bright red salt underneath is an incredible, unforgettable image. And as mentioned before, that one-on-one final confrontation is so satisfying, capped with that ""See you around, kid.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

There's 3 main story lines which eventually come together to set things up nicely for the final instalment. Some characters like Snoke could've been used more plus a bit of a background story would've been nice. 
There's the usual spectacular Star Wars set pieces and lightsaber action and some of the dialogue is spectacularly cheesy. There are plot holes but hey ho it's not based on fact is it!!!

Remember when Star Wars was FUN?,"The original Star Wars films (""4-6"" as we're now supposed to call them) were FUN. It's that simple. They had action, surprise, and a bit of humor. They were a treat for viewers young and old.""The Last Jedi"" is an overwhelming smorgasbord of dramatic side stories, multiple plots and conflicts, all stuffed into one film. Could the writers not agree on a single storyline to follow?I get it. The film is supposed to be more dramatic, more emotional. Snore... I'm not a fan of emotional dramas. More power to you if you enjoy them. But again, this franchise is supposed to be FUN. Does anyone remember what fun feels like these days?You have the heroes, the villains, and the battle between them. It's a tried and true action-packed formula that has served countless classic films.Take, for example, this movie's long and winding exploration of Kylo Ren's inner feelings. I don't care. I'm not interested in the moody emo villain and his complex emotions. Again, heroes and villains. Action. Fun. Let's go.I miss the magic of the original films.

And after watching it again a few hours ago I wasn't left angry or disappointed or even happy, I was left with tears in my eyes.

Visually stunning but story gets lost,"Overall, I found this film very enjoyable and would rate it much higher had it not been part of a series of films where it undermines most of the main concepts. Sandwiches between TFA and ROSW, it makes little sense that Johnson tried to take this film in a different direction and little sense that Disney let him. A saga this big and important needed consistency and coherence, so the same director should have created all three films.That aside, to judge this film on its own merit, it's fun, exciting, and enjoyable for the most part. A few factors make it stand out - porgs being #1 on that list, and the #2 being the stunning visuals. The throne room, Crait, the split. So many of these scenes could be turned straight into posters - that's how visually spectacular they are.However, Johnson seemed to sacrifice some substance for style. While the film looks incredible, the plot is a nonsensical at times. The jaunt to Canto Bight feels pointless, as does the Finn/Rose romance element and Rey's endless finger-clicking in a hole. Plus, splitting our trio - Rey, Poe, and Finn - takes away potential impact and rapport. Benicio del Toro's character feels improbably created simply to include the actor in the film, and his plotline is arguably the silliest.If Johnson has invested more time in building a better plot and less on making the film look beautiful, more time on continuing what TFA started and less on taking it in his own direction, we'd have ended up with a much better result.Did I still enjoy it? Yes. Will I watch it again? No doubt! But do I wish it had been done differently? Absolutely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The New Jedi!,"I have been a longtime Star Wars fan and I did not care for the prequels at all. I think this was a very satisfying entry in the Star Wars Saga. I have a few issues with the story and some of the plot choices, but overall, Luke's portrayal in this film is one of the best character arcs to take place in the whole Saga.I also like the themes introduced in this film that upend a lot of assumed Star Wars ideas about the Force and the Jedi. I like how Luke has learned as a character from the failures of the past and discovers what he should be passing on to a younger generation of force sensitive persons.My biggest issue with Star Wars has always been its skepticism about redemption. There is this fight between a view of persons who enter the dark side and can never be brought back and those who believe they can. I seems the default in this series is that characters cannot come back from the dark side, except in a rare occasion.I will not talk about spoilers but I will say that my concern I mentioned above has to do with the direction they are going with the character of Kylo Ren.IN SUMMARY: 
I really enjoyed watching The Last Jedi. It takes the series in unexpected directions. Die hard fans may have a problem with some of these choices. But, I think in the long run, we are going to be glad the series opened itself up to some new and deeper ideas about the Star Wars mythos. 
+One of the best lightsaber exchanges in the whole series of eight films.
+Lots of surprising story directions.
+The Force and the Jedi are taken in new directions.
-Kylo's story direction after this film and how people view him.
-Story execution for Finn's character and its effect on the overall pace of the film.
-How they handle the Snoke character.
-How they address the question about who are Rey's parents. (this one is more tentative because of how it is addressed and some ambiguity remains.)As a piece of entertainment, The Force Awakens is better paced. But it doesn't take any major risks with the story and rehashes a lot of Star Wars movie tropes. 
The Last Jedi is a more mature film that challenges you to think of things differently and opens up expansive possibilities for the Star Wars Galaxy!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An absolute disgrace,"It's an absolute piece of trash. By far one of the worst viewing experiences I've ever had.They destroyed Luke, they obliverated all his legacy. Rei is insanely powerful by her own not needing any guidance at all... because god forbids she recieves any kind of guidance from a man.Every sinlge moment of the movie is implying that all that came before should be discarded, that anyone can be a Jedi because they just feel like it., no training at all, no real struggles. Everything from the past is trash and the new is better.It's so insane I couldn't even believe my eyes. I thought that episodes 1, 2 and 3 were kinda lame compared to the original ones, buy having seen the disney ones I must say that in comparisson the prequels are a masterpiece. Disney just takes everything it touches and destroys it's mythos.Kathleen Kennedy and that balloon headed man-child Rian Johnson should give us an apology for what they have done to the franchise.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Star Wars Movie Since Empire,"This is easily the best Star Wars film to come from Disney since their acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012. Also, easily the best film of 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How much did Disney pay you for your ratings?,"I can't believe this movie rated so well. It was yet another re-hash of what's been done before with weak character development, poor acting, pointless love story. Far from the best star wars movie since the original trilogy.The ending was done well enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst Star Wars story ever,"I say worst story ever because this is the worst story as a movie and makes some of the worst Star Wars books look better by comparison. This movie was poorly shot, poorly paced, and poorly written.Rey is the most powerful character ever seen on screen. She is more powerful than any Star Wars character ever written in any book. In four days time she goes from not knowing the force exists to being the most powerful force user ever. I thought the midiclorian idea from The Phantom Menace was an absurd way to establish how powerful Anakin was and what his potential could be. With Rey she was able to become more powerful than anyone in a matter of days. She is a Mary Sue.Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is the most useless and bipolar villain in the series. His mood swapping during the movie is tiring and unneeded. It makes him shallow and childish appearing.Luke Skywalker was not in this movie. It was great seeing Mark Hamill give his all to a performance and I honestly think despite the writing he did an excellent job. But this was not Luke. Luke was the most positive and optimistic person in the galaxy. Rian Johnson turned him into a horrible version of a miserable human with nothing but negativity to guide him.Leia should have died. Mary Poppins/Superman should have been her death. They could have then made Hodo take her place as the leader of the resistance. Instead we are left with Leia in a coma and are told that we need to listen to Hodo without question. I think Laura Dern is a brilliant actor who was written a poor story and given a meaningless death. She should have confided in Poe her plan instead of the strong trust me angle. Poe was one of the most trusted members of the resistance. There was no reason other than a political statement to be made in their interactions.Finn became useless. I have no problem with the racial diversity that this movie provided. I though the original series was a bit lacking as Lando was the only black man in the galaxy. I appreciate strong characters. Rose is not that. What Rose does is kill the interaction between Poe and Finn. She diminishes Finn and he attempt to sacrifice himself but saving him for love. This after the whole movie she has preached that the resistance should come first. So she commits an act of saving Finn when she should have let him die to save the others. Her character is pointless and should have been left out of the story. Now does that mean the actor who portrayed her should have been cut? No. Write her a strong female character and let her have a role worthy of the talents of the actor.A meaningless death suffered by the greatest tactical mind the rebellion ever had the privileged of following. Ackbar died by getting sucked into space. Seriously? What a death by the man who lead the attack on the second Death Star.Why did Hodo not go ahead and jump a ship into the first order fleet when they first were being chased? It makes no sense to wait until the end of the movie to do this maneuver. Do it as soon as the first order gives chase and be done with it. And if you are going to do this idiotic scene make Ackbar the man to do it. He would be the one to have the tactical knowledge to have pulled it off. Instead we have Princess Leia light kill herself.I cannot even begin to list all the problems of this movie. I cannot even begin to tell how much Rian Johnson has destroyed the series with one really bad film. I can honestly say Rian Johnson actually made the prequels look better for me. He is a horrible storyteller. The plot holes are ridiculous. The written is atrocious. His ability as a film maker is shown with this movie. I shall not watch another of his movies. I shall not see Episode IX.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Bold, authentic, refreshing.","After two trilogies' worth of two-dimensional classical nostalgic Star Wars plot, Rian Johnson dares to defy expectations and create something daring and thought-provoking. ""The Last Jedi"" manages to break all formulas and still keep the epicness we're all so fond of. It brings some fascinating character development along with stunning visuals and some of the most amazing soundtracks by our one and only John Williams. No light, no dark, just balance. Just a force.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Different,"""The Last Jedi"" fits into the well-established atmosphere of the new trilogy, but at the same time it is different. Rian Johnson's revenue is clearly visible. Unlike ""The Force Awakens"", where it was set to be more secure, here the director allowed himself to insert entirely new things that make up the big universe of Star Wars.The movie is noticeably darker, as was clear from the release of the first poster, the trailer and the ad campaign.Some fans will be happy because of 2 particular scenes, they've been waiting for years become a reality in this movie. Others will not like it so much, because there are some really unnecessary scenes, also this is not the typical ""Star Wars"" movie.The ""Last Jedi"" answers some questions, but there are many unknowns, that we'll not know until 2019.

The Star Wars movie I like but a lot of people hates,"A couple years ago, Episode 8 of one of the best franchises ever came out and boy did it have serious mixed reviews. I was in my final year of high school and I had a friend who's a serious fan of Star Wars and he told me it sucked, but I didn't listened to him and I wanted to find out for myself. It took me longer to finally watch it for the first time than I thought, I finally watched it in February 2019 when I finally got the DVD for the first time. And what did I think of it? I actually enjoy it.Sure, Finn and Rose's side of the movie and Leia using the force to get back to the shop is pretty poor. But Rey and Luke's side of the movie was actually good.Luke being a broken Jedi from a past event and refusing to train Rey makes sense to me and yet a lot of people are mad about Luke refusing makes fans mad and I just don't get it. Because Yoda did the same thing when he refused to train Luke in Empire Strikes Back and people don't get mad on that.Speaking of Yoda, I was surprised to see him as a Muppet again when I first watched the movie because I was not expecting that and it's been years since we last saw Yoda as a Muppet. And I love the fact that Frank Oz did all the movements than just the voice because he stopped doing that since 2002 from being a muppeteer.So if your interested in seeing this movie and pretty optimistic about it, than your in a great time watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Will never pay to see Star wars again,"This Film, was so off in so many ways, as a Star Wars movie Fan (not books) you will wonder what they were smoking.

Its not any where near its current IMDB rating. If i were nice i'd give it a 5 out of 10, simply due to its polish.It certinly is less than average as a film the only thing keeping it near average is its excellent sound and visuals. Also adam Driver is excellent, shame the film around it makles no sense. It has the Lucas arts polish thats for sure.The rest of it is a stinking mess, insultingly so.

An Honest Review from an Old Fan,"I've been in love with Star Wars since I was 3, and sometimes you love things even though they're stupid. People wanted The Last Jedi to be that same stupid plot they've been in love with since 1977, and it wasn't. People expected Luke Skywalker to hop in his X-Wing, go blow up an even bigger Death Star, and get a medal while everybody claps at the end, and that did not happen. Instead we got a very strong, independent movie that wasn't trying to emulate the success of it's predecessors. While some of the hardcore fans pan this movie for not being the same thing they've been watching since 1977, I think in the years to come it will be remembered as a high point of the series, because this is the movie that broke tradition and let Star Wars be something new.I enjoyed the film, a lot, and if you were a fan of the Extended Universe, you'll love it too, because it feels just like a good EU novel turned into a movie. This is what the Sequel Trilogy should have been from the start. The stakes are high, not because the not-empire has some dumb new even bigger planet destroying weapon to blow up rocks that the audience doesn't care about (thank god), but because every character in the film legitimately feels like they are in danger, as the resistance is brutally chased down and destroyed one ship at a time by the First Order. I absolutely loved the film because it was fresh, the enemies felt dangerous, and it had me sitting on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I know some fanboys will cry today, but I have no doubt that years down the line, barring IX being absolutely amazing, this will be the go-to movie for the trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
DEFINITELY not as bad as everyone makes it seem.,"This movie has its flaws, as do a whole host of other Star Wars movies, but it is not a bad movie.Tonally, it's pretty different from most of the other films in the franchise, but that doesn't make it bad. Star Wars is about adventure and wonder and amazing characters, all of which are in this film. Rian might not have stuck to the formula, but boy was I refreshed at a fresh take on a property that can so easily fall into telling the same story over and over again in the name of ""poetry"" (no offense, I love Star Wars more than anyone).If you liked the characters in The Force Awakens and want to know each of them on a better level and actually grow to care for some of them, see this movie. If you want to know more about the force and explore more of the galaxy than the usual 4 or 5 planets we visit, see this movie. If you like stories that make you think beyond just sitting and consuming mindlessly, see this movie.If you're reading this review to determine if you should see this movie, you're probably not a die hard Star Wars fan and won't be as insulted as everyone else leaving reviews here if it doesn't turn out like you thought, and if you're a die hard Star Wars fan and you are reading this review to determine if you should see this movie, don't let anyone else's opinions on this sway you. It's what you think that counts.Watch it for yourself, and if you like it, great, if not, sorry, but let's not forget the wonder that is Star Wars by getting caught up in the little details. Celebrate. Go see it with people you care about. Love the movie together. Hate it together. Star Wars belongs to each of us.All I ask is that you walk into the theater with an open mind. Try and get rid of expectations, because boy does this movie resist expectations. Have an experience, and don't let a movie make or break your year.

The Last Jedi is an original movie unlike The Force Awakens!,"I want to start with saying The Force Awakens was not just the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. It is the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. So some of you may have bad expectations from this movie because of the first movie of this trilogy. Don't be afraid, it is not going to be a waste of your money or your time. It is definitely worth to see!
During the movie, some of the characters has their own conflicts. We see that it is not that easy to be the bad or the good. Making a choice between two sides is never really easy. I think this is one of the things that makes us human. I loved to see this conflict inside the characters during the movie. 
The story is above the avarage. I don't think this is the best Star Wars story or movie but The Last Jedi has a different style. You will be shocked in some scenes. This movie made me feel very excited for the final episode of this trilogy.

Deus ex machina overuse and a bad script made even more painful by good acting and a lot of wasted potential,"What I found incredibly professional was how serious and well everybody acted in what was clearly a joke of a story, yet instead of phoning it in, every actor did great. Like any force user turned towards the dark side, I felt conflicted, sitting there in the theater, admiring the technical work of CGI artists, actors, set designers and so on, while being taken for a complete retarded idiot by whoever wrote the story. Scene after bad scene, the heroes are stuck in impossible situations, only to get out again and again by means of tricks that make no sense with heroic music on the background. Either an all present, invisible and intelligent robot or a cute yet proud animal or some technology that could have been used three scenes ago with devastating results but for some reason no one thought of it, but at every step something that is no merit of the characters involved had to save them in order to further the stupid plot.And what hurt even more is that in this jumbled mess of childish storytelling, there was a beacon of light, a moment that could have turned the whole franchise towards a better side, one that was neither good nor bad, neither white nor black, but something new, a fresh idea that could have made Star Wars into a greater work and taken full advantage of the talent already employed. In this scene that I don't want to spoil, if every character in it were acting as they were built for several movies and a half, it would have revolutionized Star Wars and made me forgive all the sins of this film. But no, they went completely out of character and it just went downward from there, with a final act that was even more deus ex machinas, saving animals, mysterious blind spots for the enemies that acted like frustrated four year old children, the high contrast good vs evil crap and a return to a tired and really bad canon.I swear, all it lacked to be a complete travesty were a flock of eagles coming out from nowhere and saving the stranded heroes. Like the bland black and white story the film portrays, it is also made of starkly bad versus good elements, but I am afraid in the end it leans heavily towards the dark side.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

1-Star reviews? Give me a break.,"I feel compelled to explain why I think SW: The Last Jedi deserves far better than the staggering number of 1-star reviews and why I think it's genuinely a pretty good movie (though not without caveats).Let me go ahead and give my concessions right away, because there is some merit to all the hate on this film.There are some pretty annoying deus ex machinas sprinkled throughout the film (seemingly unfeasible rescues for the sake of the plot). There is absolutely some poorly written dialogue, and if you're older than 13 you will probably cringe at a couple of lines. I don't think the fan service was at all excessive, but the clear merchandising (what purpose did those cute puffin creatures serve?) was too obvious. I did not find the emotional depth to be at the level we the audience probably expected, and finally, I found some of the characters to be not nearly as likable as they were intended.So what made this movie good? Everything else.The storyline, for starters, was new, inventive, and for the most part compelling. I completely disagree with people saying it was difficult to follow, because it simply wasn't; that's something Disney has gotten very good at. There are unpredictable twists throughout the movie and most of them are exciting and bring a fresh feel to the franchise, to the point to where The Last Jedi FEELS different from a classic SW movie. I think this is okay. People saying Luke Skywalker would never behave the way he did; how would you know? More than 30 years have passed since we've last seen him, and the writers had plenty of creative freedom with writing him which I think they used well. I'm not a big fan of Finn personally, but I still liked most of the new cast, and I enjoyed how they incorporated Leia, Chewy, 3PO and R2 (and a surprise visitor in the 3rd act) into the story.Additionally, the visual FX were incredible, but did you expect anything less? The battles were tense and thrilling, the space scenes are lovely to watch (esp. a particular hyperspace jump), and I loved the many, MANY new creatures introduced, with the exception of the useless puffins. My sense of wonder was piqued, and we even get to see a few new worlds. The musical score was beautiful, albeit less memorable than the older John Williams music. The acting was fine; not excellent, but not terrible.Back to the feel of the movie. Compare the 1980s Mad Max movies to 2015's Fury Road. Or, maybe, the 1960-70s Planet of the Apes movies to the 2010 ones. Do they have the same ""feel""? Of course not. Movies change over time, as do their audiences. I don't watch new SW films to feel the way I do when watching the Original Trilogy, I watch for the stories, the characters, the creatures and the awe, and there was more than enough of that to keep me coming back. I think Rian Johnson and the Disney staff that worked on this film had an impossible task: Create a movie that will please all Star Wars fans. I guarantee if this movie was near perfect, plenty of the angry 1-star reviews would still proliferate, because that's what fans with their own vision of the franchise do.So trust me when I say that this movie is worth seeing. Is it perfect? No. We could have done without a lot of the poor dialogue and obnoxious merchandising. I'm sad that this will probably continue into the next film(s). But that being said, SW: TLJ was epic, riveting, beautiful, and fresh, and it's not going to go the way you think.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Last jedi is amazing,Great movie! Love it so much! I'm so happy with the plot!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thematically misguided sequel that works better on its own terms than as part of a larger tale.,"""The Last Jedi"" is a surprising film, and a disheartening one. Surprising for its willingness to shake the status quo, and disheartening for how it nearly turns Star Wars into a series at war with itself. Surprising for the poignancy it clearly aspires to, and disheartening for casually discarding the goodwill garnered by its predecessor. It doesn't destroy Star Wars, contrary to some reports, and manages to avoid a far worse trajectory towards the end, but nonetheless left me with the dashed hope that we would ever get a non-polarizing installment. ""The Last Jedi"" essentially sapped my enthusiasm for the sequel trilogy.Episode VIII doesn't feel very much like a Star Wars movie. The dominant feeling of hopelessness and despair isn't inappropriate, but it is excessive and, frankly, premature. No room is allowed for build-up before we are thrust into a dire situation. Purely in terms of the action, this is unquestionably the franchise's weakest outing; none of the scant fights or battles are exceptionally exciting. Even the much lauded duel between two primary characters and a bunch of First Order lackeys feels more disorganized than thrilling. What's more, the inordinately widespread notion on the true worth of one-on-one confrontations may have also gotten to the director; apparently, the least important aspect of a fight here is the actual fighting. How else to explain the dramatic and unexpected, but anticlimactic, climax?Rian Johnson was clearly more concerned with giving the series a thematic overhaul than crafting a compelling narrative, and it's this prioritization that nearly defeats the film. ""The Last Jedi"" is carefully constructed to affirm or voice the numerous complaints fans, authors, and online commentators have thrown about for years; resultingly the film denounces or rejects aspects of the mythos from previous entries rather than expand the horizons of the franchise. Why Lucasfilm assigned the director his own trilogy following the sheer cynicism on display here is beyond me.Consider Luke's heavy-handed criticism of the Jedi, with his use of words such as ""hypocrisy"", ""hubris"", and ""romanticized"". Admittedly, the subsequent themes on his personal legacy, the impact of legends, and dealing with errors are worthy ones that lead to some strong developments. But, their faults in the films notwithstanding, the Jedi are a cornerstone of the Star Wars narrative, and the film's unabashedly negative stance towards them is a strident misstep. Never mind the irony on display. For a film that practically boasts of getting the series to grow-up, it has no problem making the immature claim that a millennia old religion's worth is defined by the (generalized) failings of one generation. Rian Johnson had the opportunity to better define and examine this fictional group's history and practices, imperfections and merit. Not only would this have been a bolder route, it might have decreased the gulf in the fandom. Instead, he opted for an approach that sustains some inflammatory commentaries while scolding prequel fans for having become invested at all, delivering some collateral damage to the original trilogy as well (try re-watching those movies knowing THIS is where it's all headed). This isn't just poor business-sense, it's an affront.Another criticism worked into the narrative is that Star Wars has devolved into an elitist fantasy that promotes ""royal bloodlines"" and ""disdain for common folk"", which, for reasons beyond the scope of this essay, is a gross exaggeration. But Johnson seems to agree with it, and thus we have Luke talking derisively about ""Skywalker blood"", the idealistic Rey having an insignificant lineage, and several self-conscious, yet perfunctory, scenes focusing on loyal/heroic Resistance fighters just before dying. Unfortunately, much of this comes across as shallow overcompensation. For example, the notion that the Force ""doesn't belong to the Jedi"", which should be clear from earlier descriptions and moments, isn't expanded upon in any meaningful way beyond stern lecturing. It's also ironic that, despite the clear aim of highlighting the downsides of ""demigods"" and heroism of ""common folk"", the most consistently compelling individuals in the movie are all ""demigods""; it's the ""common folk"" that water down the experience, plagued by drabness and half-baked characterization. And the less said about that groan-inducing epilogue, the better.Gripes on the thematic level aside, the movie fares decently as an entertainment, something I conceded to on the second viewing. First and foremost, Mark Hamill's performance as an aged Luke is excellent, capturing the right mix of world-weariness, remorse, and, surprisingly, humor. He's actually the funniest person in the movie, and the recollection of a key action serves as one of the dramatic high-points. It's also appreciable that someone found a good niche for Kylo Ren as a direct foil for Rey. Their interplay is consistently engaging, though when left to his own devices it's a different story. True to his word, Rian Johnson included several unexpected turns. While there are no Earth-shattering revelations on par with that of Episode V, the legitimate surprises provide a good jolt when needed.Adherents of ""The Last Jedi"" will no doubt sustain Johnson's vision as a necessary course-correction, an antidote to Lucas' approach to mythmaking. But in my experience there's a significant dissonance between the disturbing implications people have extracted from the setting and the actual effects of the movies themselves (a pattern depressingly similar to the nigh-worthless genre deconstructions that have gained traction since the work of Alan Moore). Addressing a few straw-man arguments is a poor reason for casting a gloomy cloud over elements that function finely within the fairy tale parameters of the series. Star Wars will not become greater by mechanically subverting or criticizing its own conventions. Disney seems to have made a habit of this to modernize its latest animations, but have any of these even approached the likes of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""? Whatever missteps Star Wars has seen during its history, it has achieved greatness through its original direction, and I hazard that it will never reach that caliber again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

What I found so enjoyable about this 8th installment was the mash up of fresh new re-imagined Star Wars elements mixed in with traditional Star Wars canon. (I think this is the thing that makes the super fans so angry, but I thought it was a breath of fresh air).Furthermore, one of the best aspects of this movie was the highly intense moments of dwindling hope. There were plenty of moments in the movie where I honestly thought to myself ""how in the world are the rebels going to make it through this one"".The plot was simple, but in my opinion, effective and at the end of the day was entertaining.Some of the jokes fell flat.

He was more right than I ever could have known.The plot is stupid and is full of moments where my friends and I looked at each other and said ""wait, what?"". There are sequences in this movie that simply do not need to exist and provide literally nothing to the story. The technology, previously something I always thought was neat about Star Wars, is genuinely dumb and makes zero sense (why do big laser bolts in space arc like artillery?). I am ashamed to have paid money for this and as a long-time Star Wars fan it hurts to see just how dead the franchise I love really is.All that said, the special effects look and sound great, and it was fun to see Mark Hamill acting again.

Cannot understand the hate!,"The Last Jedi (now my 3rd favorite Star Wars film) gets some much underserved hate, in my opinion. The filmmaking in this film is some of the best in the saga. I feel that the storyline is strong, the development of the characters (Rey, Finn, Poe), especially Rey, is outstandingly done! The dynamic between Rey, Kylo Ren and Luke is so fascinating and superbly written! And, Luke himself...I thought he was awesome! I had no issue with the way he was developed for this story, at all! I felt that it blends perfectly well with the last time we saw him in Return of the Jedi, but this Luke was older, wiser and knew more of the past. It stands to reason that he would be the way he turns out to be here. I absolutely love this film, and still don't understand how people hate it so much!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Flawed But Enjoyable,"I was very torn between a 5 and a 6 on this movie. This movie is like 2 steps forward one step back. Things happen that are very interesting and make you want to learn more, but then something will happen that takes you out of what is happening because the movie is absolutely disjointed at times. Still, it's Star Wars, and that's all you need to say for me to enjoy a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The force is strong with this movie!,"This review is spoiler-free meaning it does not contain spoilers, but I will genuinely share with you how ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" affects me as a movie fan, as a Star Wars fan,.. and whether or not it does what it's supposed to do. Audiences around the world tend to agree with the statement that ""Empire Strikes Back"" is one of the best sequels ever made, well, I think ""The Last Jedi"" can easily take that honor now. This movie is astonishing and spectacular. It pushes many of this franchise's familiar elements to their limits and it really digs deep into the key characters and brings forth everything that stands out about them. Writer/director Rian Johnson is an impeccable storyteller.The story picks up after the events in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" by this time the First Order grows stronger as it corners the resistance to an impossible situation. Poe Dameron, Finn and Rose come up with a plan that could work but time is of the essence. Meanwhile Rey is doing her best to convince Luke Skywalker to join in on the fight, but Luke doesn't want to be a jedi or a master, let alone the resistance's final hope.Ok, so if you're wondering what happens with Kylo Ren, Rey, Poe Dameron and Finn and how they affect each other this time around, without giving it away, what ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" does is essentially flesh out these characters. Not only will you get to know some of their history and their background and what truly compels them, but this time they're also facing some very difficult choices. And the film also lays out judgement on some of them, it puts an end to some parts of the story that doesn't need to be continued anymore in the next episode. And what's brilliant about the story that Rian Johnson has crafted is that it makes you the audience think that each of those characters has their own respective path that they're going on, you expect them to see it through but bam, other plans take over but turns out these new unexpected plans actually make sense to the overall arc.Johnson wants these characters' personal journeys to be a refined in the fire type of journeys. Each revelation, each aspect, brings them one step closer to being the lead stars, front and center of this new trilogy as the old icons take a step back further away from the spotlight. Speaking of whom, it's so awesome Mark Hamill be Luke Skywalker again, he has a bigger role this time, such a larger than life legend, and Hamill actually gives his best performance in years in this one.I know that a lot of fans consider ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to be more or less a rehash of ""A New Hope"" and I don't blame them for thinking that because to a certain extent, it was a rehash. But it's a necessary one because after the super boring parliamentary-heavy prequels by George Lucas. So it was important for ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to remind us that this franchise was once super fun and exciting. So because that problem was taken care of, so now Rian Johnson doesn't need to do such reminder anymore with ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" It is not a Empire Strikes Back rehash. Rian can freely do what he does best, similar to what he did with ""Brick,"" ""The Brothers Bloom,"" and ""Looper, and that is to further explore the possible consequences of the characters' decisions while at the same time amplifying everything you love about Star Wars, it even brings back some familiar faces. If you've always been fascinated with the force, this movie emphasizes the force all the more. If you miss Carrie Fisher, this movie has heavy dose of general Leia, if light speed gets you stoked, there's plenty of those here, and if you're a big fan of jedi mindtrick, boy does ""Star Wars: the Last Jedi"" have a big motherload surprise for you or what!Such incredible breathtaking new locations as well, especially that vast salt land in Bolivia that serves as the backdrop for the planet Crait. The battle sequences in this film are pulse-pounding, explosive and intense. The light saber fights are thrilling, you just get enough of it, you'll be begging for more, you'll want the film to display more of those laser swords in action. The way the new characters integrate themselves with the stories of Kylo Ren, Finn and Poe Cameron is quite seamless. Whatever conflicts amongst them or their collision only lead to some of this film's most heroic moments which are highlighted by the remarkable sound mix and sound editing. This is a movie that entirely looks and moves and feels and breathes like a Star Wars movie with an Oscar level deeply affecting drama that stays with you long after the end credits roll. The force is strong with ""Star Wars: the Last Jedi.""-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One of My Favorite Star Wars Films,"After watching Rise of Skywalker, I decided to go back to The Last Jedi. And yes, it's still great. It's got issues, but as a whole, it's quite impressive what it was able to accomplish. Middle chapters are not easy. But I think this film pulls it off wonderfully. Almost as well as Empire Strikes Back. The acting is brilliant, especially from Mark Hamill. His performance as a tormented and downtrodden Luke Skywalker is fascinating to see. Daisy Ridley is very talented, and I think she killed it as Rey. The rest of the cast is quite good as well. Particular praise goes to Adam Driver. This guy is destined to be the break out young star of this trilogy like Harrison Ford and Natalie Portman before him.This film takes no easy roads. It takes a lot of risks. Some paid off, some didn't. It changes a lot of how we see the Jedi and the force. The special effects are naturally beautiful. John Williams score is beautiful with lots of new tracks and redos of older classics. This film is unlike any other Star Wars movie, and I applaud it for being different, risk taking, and above all, great.However, I can't give it a perfect score. Sadly, certain plot lines don't flow well. Like most Star Wars films, we see multiple plots cutting back to each other before eventually all coming together. All of them have purpose, but unfortunately not all of them were given proper care in the writing process.So yes. I love this movie. What are you gonna do? Sue me? Hey, if you hate this movie, that's fine. I don't really care if you hate it. I love it. I would easily put it in my top three favorite Star Wars films after A New Hope and Return of the Jedi.Also, side note, I don't get the whole ""real Star Wars"" fan stuff. That makes no sense to me. If you love Star Wars, aren't you automatically a real fan? What constitutes a fake fan? If we all just unanimously agreed on these films then where's the fun? Maybe I don't want to watch Empire again. Maybe I'm feeling more like Solo today. I've been a fan since I was 10 and I have never judged someone who loved a Star Wars film that I didn't care for. Its great to be passionate about something, but don't let that passion get in the way of others enjoyment. It's all so silly to me. Love what you love and don't let anyone tell you that you can't.I despise gate keeping of any kind. It keeps people from entering a fandom that they may otherwise love. It's fine if you don't like this movie, but don't be a jerk to people who love it. I won't be one to you. And if anything, a ""real"" Star Wars fan loves whatever Star Wars that they wanna like. Original, prequel, sequel etc. Nuff said.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Moments of brilliance, but messy at times","The First Order is closing in on the Resistance and Rey meets Luke Skywalker.I think it contains some wonderful franchise moments but others that frustrate.The plot almost raises a middle finger to The Force Awakens and the other six films. All that dramatic build up to Rey meeting Luke is unceremoniously thrown off a cliff and the mystery surrounding some characters felt like it had been skewered by a lightsaber. It almost felt like the middle finger on Johnson's other hand was being raised to fan expectations.That being said I quite like some of the themes, particularly its non-elitist attitude towards characters who are force sensitive and the message that anyone can be a Jedi regardless of lineage. However, for the sake of themes, some of the character development not only kills momentum established by The Force Awakens but contributes to the The Rise Of Skywalker being a convoluted mess.There are many scenes that I love, particularly the opening space battle which is one of the best of the franchise and hits you like a cannonball from the end of the opening crawl. I like some of the scenes with Luke and Rey in the middle part of the movie. I wondered how Luke could go through another meaningful arc, but Johnson just about achieves it.I think some sequences and characters are unnecessary and makes the film feel frustratingly long-winded such as the scenes on Canto Bight which just feel like an excuse for some additional CGI and to give characters not used in the main plot something to do. Also the whole chase sequence and conflict between Poe Dameron and Admiral Holdo feels very forced and drawn out.Where things really take off for me is towards the end in Snoke's command room and the beautiful sequence on the salt planet Crait which is full of thrilling and heroic franchise moments. I have watched this part several time and always enjoy.Some characters (and their actors of course) have strong moments, particularly Luke's powerful use of the force, Rey's coolness in battle, Kylo's superbly conflicted performance, BB8's physical comedy and Chewie's epic piloting of the Millennium Falcon.It is disappointing that Finn feels like the writer is finding something for him to do. Personally, I don't think there was enough good material for both him and Poe and the story should have focussed one of them, whilst the other took a backseat. Another option could have been to have them together in one plot, which probably meant sacrificing Rose's involvement. For me Rose is an okay character, but aside from one scene near the end, the rest of her screen time is not hugely memorable. Overall I think too much was trying to be achieved with these three characters and it makes the film's middle section a bit messy.Overall I like it, but it is not without problems.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Beautiful, Unpredictable, Exactly What We Need","A beautiful continuation of the Star Wars saga.Where Episode VII introduces us to the new trio who will be front and center throughout the new trilogy, it is Episode VIII that shows us who they really are. Each character is tested throughout the full length of the film, not only against their enemies in the First Order but, more essentially, against their own flaws and misgivings. We experience these trying moments alongside our newest and oldest heroes and the fascination we learned in Episode VII gives way to real love. As someone dear to me said, it is a movie about meeting our flaws and failures with courage.Almost as critically, Episode VIII upends the questions Episode VII left us with and it does so by providing us with the answers we need, if not the answers some may want. This movie is nothing but answers earned after hard exploration and so the only question it leaves us with is ""What happens next?"" Which is, in a time where predictable twists whose sole purpose is to pander to an audience raised on having their most shallow theories held up as equal to actual creative work, exactly the question a story of this calibre should be leaving us with. It tells us everything and leaves us knowing nothing, with the promise of more to come.Episode VII was a good Star Wars movie, truly a good one, but Episode VIII is the first truly great Star Wars film in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Character driven with strong performances from the cast,"This movie isn't going to be for everyone, especially people who had major head canons going into this. I loved the experience. This movie was way more introspective and dark for a Star Wars movie, but still keeps that Star Was theme of hope running throughout, even when things seem bleak. Also, it was beautiful. And sometimes silly, because it's Star Wars.This is not science fiction, it's fantasy in space, so leave your expectations at the door, because this movie isn't wish fulfillment, nor should it be. It's telling the midpoint of a story, which is going to be the darkest point in any series, so naturally it doesn't resolve every issue (and it never should, does anyone actually remember how ESB ends?).Even as someone who really enjoyed TFA, this movie felt very different and there was definitely more to pick at, character-wise, which was great. But I don't think it's going to change any minds, but some people like to make up their opinions before actually seeing a movie. Don't let other people's perceptions color your own.See it twice. This movie has some amazing shots that are worth seeing in the theater for a second time (when reactions aren't so knee-jerk).I loved the experience, the creatures, the silliness, the introspection, the darkness. It was a lovely experience that reminded me of some of the content from KotoR, which was thrilling to me as a fan. Rian did a great job here; the writing is fun and snappy and he pushes the characters beyond what I'd come to expect from them, which was great to see.

I was not a big fan of Star Wars Series. But now I am!!,"My husband is a fan of Star Wars and he finished all previous 7 movies. I started to watch Star Wars with The Force Awaken in 2015. To be honest, that one did not catch too much of my interests. Still, for my curiosity on those characters' relationship, I went back and watched Star Wars Original Trilogy. Although their scenes were not as vivid as recent years' works, they had a good story. However, I just felt enough with these 3 classics and did not continue on Prequel trilogy.This year, I went to theater with my husband again for The Last Jedi. As a Christmas gift to him, we went to a Fan Events which provided early opening on Thursday evening at 6:00 PM with beautiful card collections. What I want to say is, this time, Star Wars finally caught my eyes and seized my heart. I got the beauty of space travel with all those stunning scenes. Every single frame is a piece of art. I can also feel the chemistry developed between characters. The action scenes are full of tense too.How about plots? I should say it is not perfect but still good. It does have some plot holes but did not too stupid to accept. And I like how the way the story turns. One minute you thought there was no hope. Another minute a door for surviving surprisingly but reasonably opened. When you thought everyone was safe and it was a chance to relieve your nerve for a little bit, desperation caught up again. My heart was tightly bend with Rebel Alliance and care about their ending on this journey. It was so breathtaking that I was not even willing to blink my eyes! I enjoyed my 2 hours in the theater a lot. It is like riding a roller coaster if you watch this movie without any spoilers.I will recommend my friends to the theater for this movie definitely.

As someone who is as obsessed as every other fan boy and girl, I personally feel this new direction and overall feel is exactly what was needed.

Star Wars At Its Finest,"What an incredible ride from start to finish! Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed TFA. However, I was hoping the next two movies in the trilogy would be more unique with their storytelling, and take us to some new places and ideas as opposed to TFA's safe approach. Thankfully, The Last Jedi doesn't disappoint in this regard. Not only does The Last Jedi do some unexpected things with its characters, but it also manages to expand our understanding of the Galaxy, and the role that every person can play in its narrative.Story-wise, it keeps you engaged all the way through. Director Rian Johnson found a way to keep the pacing very tight, striking a nice balance between non-stop action and quieter character moments. It also manages to keep you guessing at what will happen next. All of this is further aided by the fantastic cinematography throughout. This is by far the best looking Star Wars film to date.The writing for the characters manages to be very well done as well. Every character has their moment, and every character has a chance to expand our understanding of who they are. Some of them are taken to places you wouldn't expect either. This will probably also be where some fans find issue with the movie though. Some bold choices are made, and they won't work for everyone. But at its core, the writing is well done and inspired, even if controversial at times. I believe that over time, much like Empire before it, more people will look back in favor of this film's choices.While the movie feels like a success in every way a Star Wars movie should be, it succeeds the most in the themes it tries to tell. It's a Star Wars movie that reminds us that everyone has a role to play in the fate of the Galaxy, no matter how insignificant they seem to themselves or others. And it's a reminder of what it means to keep moving forward, and become more than what we were. Sometimes that means finding strength we didn't know we had. Sometimes that means letting failure teach us. Sometimes that means knowing when to take action, and also knowing when to take a step back.Ultimately, this movie has everything I could ask for from a Star Wars film: Great characters, great action, engaging story, and imagination at every turn. As Luke Skywalker says, ""This is not going to go the way you think."" As it turns out, that's exactly what makes this movie special.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
That good old feeling!,"When I went to watch this movie for the first time, my expectations were very high. Because I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, but also the marketing.
I also assumed it would not be as magical as the first three movies. That is impossible to match anyway.And this movie deliverd it for me! Here are some of the great things about it:the acting was way better than in The Force Awakens;the special effects/CGI were near perfect;the story was similar to The Empire Strikes Back, but had some greatunexpected twists as well. Along with some nice suprises;there were some cool new things I never saw before in the previous movies.For example: I really liked the new creatures (what they did and were used for);the jokes were funny;the music/score/soundtrack gave me a great nostalic feeling;the space battles and fightscenes were hugely entertaining;the old and new characters worked very well together.What I found a little less great:the music was amazing, but for me there was not enough new material. Therewas some, but nothing memorable;some moments were implausible and some made no sense. But hey: it's StarWars! If you want realism, go watch something else;if you are completely new to the franchise, I can imagine the whole thing couldbe utterly confusing. Because reasons.Every great movie has it's problems, so there is no sense in nitpicking and look for other flaws.

Most Underrated Film Ever,"What I love about this film is that it actually has the balls. It makes bold decisions and takes the franchise in different directions. Sure there are problems, but it's just a movie. It can't be perfect, I believe fans expectations for this film were insanely high. There is no possible way that they were going to do anything like Snoke being Plagueis or Rey being a Kenobi. While it would have been cool it makes absolutely no sense, and means nothing to the story. Not even Luke or Leia knew of Darth Plagueis. They wouldn't care, but the audience would. You shouldn't ever be making a movie for the audience, You should make a well made, and good film, for yourself. And it doesn't matter what fans think, but Disney didn't care at all about that aspect.

They keep moving just out of the range of our guns,"The original Star Wars, now 40 years old, was always presented as a complete but fairly sterile universe. We enjoyed the heroics of the first 3 films, but were largely nonplussed by the CGI laden effects of the next 3. Like the last film, this is a return to form.And however enjoyable this romp is, it effectively admits that there is nothing much more that can be done with the franchise at the moment. The film is probably as entertaining as any of the other Star Wars films, and even shows occasional flashes of strong film making. But the fresh stuff cannot quite escape the weight of it's own familiar format.The Star Wars pieces are deftly moved about in grand sweeps, but with surprisingly little outcome. The character arcs seem strangely un-epic.The humour is deployed well, but just serves to reduce the size of the characters, because there is little counter-balancing in tension. At no time do we learn anything new about the Star Wars universe, or anything about where we are today in the real world. It is stuck in a fixed moral code. The attempted theme of renewal splutters along careful tramlines, and just about keeps the show on the road.Overall the film is satisfying, and is more than just filler for the video games and McDonald's toys, but it needs something fairy strong to make it anything more than an echo of what it was.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Moments of Shock and awe made up for some of the weaker plotlines.I really like the Beginning of the Movie, then it kinda slows down...at one Point i was actually asking myself ""where is this going? is actually something gonna happen?"" - well and then it happens. and once you realize you are within the last act, you do not want to miss a beat. the last 45 mins i was mostly shocked or in awe. I can understand why they have signed Rian Johnsen for the next Trilogy.

The writing is good - not flawless at all. First i was confused of the plottwists... by now i love them. It is so not what we all expected (what was a Major complain on TFA for many fans). John Williams is good as usual even so i had higher hopes.
The Visuals - i dont even know what to say. BTW i am not talking about CGI. I am talking about cinematogrophy, directing, the sets, the visual expierence when the Action unfolds. 3 Days ago i could not have imagened something impressive like that.

Don't Believe The Negativity,"You know that old expression, ""don't make mountains out of molehills""? Suffice it to say, a vast majority of the harshly negative reviews of The Last Jedi present a whole mountain range of issues where only molehills exist.Often, when I'm researching whether or not I should see a movie, I rely on user reviews to make that decision. Rarely do I put much stock in what the film critics have to say. This is the first time I can remember in recent memory that, the critics actually got his one right and the fans didn't at all.Having read a ton of negative reviews, I think I could put most of the upset , blatantly negative reviewers into one of four categories; (1) those how cannot see the forest for the trees, and thus get hung up on a few broken and miss the big picture; (2) those who are holding too tightly to the old Extended Universe; and (3) those who maybe thought this was the last Star Wars movie ever and wanted every question answered.The Last Jedi skillfully sparks a newness unlike any movie in the Star Wars series. For the first time since Return of the Jedi, Star Wars feels fresh again. And that's a very welcome change, after being on the treadmill of knowing exactly what was going to happen for the past 5 films (since The Phantom Menace).While this film is imperfect, it's incredibly strong. There are twists you won't see coming. There are moments when everything we thought we knew will be put to the test. There are moments when you'll have to sit all the way forward in your chair due to excitement. Challenging moments, humbling moments, sobering moments, human moments.I think Luke Skywalker himself could sum it up better than I:""This will not go the way you think.""And that's the best possible thing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"90% safe and marketable mediocrity, 10% interesting ideas","I'm not going to tell you whether it was good or bad, this is for you to decide. I will just try to share my experience. Spoiler-free, of course, yet there is not that much to spoil in this episode. The movie was mostly predictable for a sane person.Right of the bat, the first scene of the movie sets up the tone - this is a comedy. Nothing has to be taken seriously. Every strong or dramatic moment will most likely be ruined by a corky comedy scene to lighten up the tone. The studio does not want you to get upset, you know.This also features a lot of improvisation. If you have seen Thor Ragnarok, this comes very close to that movie. I think the director believed that this will make the characters more grounded and real, yet it's just annoying most of the time. You're trying to get invested into a scene, and the movie takes you from your seat and shakes you up: ""remember, no getting invested"". Maybe it just doesn't work for me personally, IDK.As the main plot developed I found myself mostly confused, lots of ""what?"" moments occur, things I could not explain to myself even though I'm not new to SW. It also features a couple of additional subplots only one of which I found interesting, not going to spoil it though. New characters were introduced, mostly to make the movie more marketable and to bring more ""diversity"". You can see corporate decisions behind this - no chances at sexism, racial discrimination or anything trending right now, maximum safety. This is a second installment with the new characters and yet I still can find myself rooting only for the classic ones, and there are not that much of those left. Due to some unfortunate real life events, I'm afraid the next episode will lose those as well, maybe I'm wrong though. It is also interesting how Chewie just doesn't work as a standalone character in the absence of Solo.The acting made me question my understanding of the franchise. Hux, while being Hitler-like character in the 7th movie, now completely turned into a cartoon character or a parody by Charlie Chaplin. Rey's emotions and facial expressions are still indistinguishable, as well as Kylo's TBH. Poe and Finn come closest to having a real character arc and yet the movie still finds a way to throw that to the ground.And this is where my main grudge with this movie lies. There were some really interesting and creative setups throughout the movie when the it baits you into thinking that the movie is going to get serious and do something unexpectedly good with the characters and the story. And then it just falls flat on its butt. Spoilers keep me from giving you examples of what I mean, but I'm sure you'll see those as well when you see the movie.Overall, I wasn't too disappointed, I was mostly sad. If this is the Star Wars for the new generation, I'm happy to stay with the old one. Visuals were pleasing, space battles were well made, but this is not exactly what I'm looking for in SW.P.S. Merch placement got really out of hand in this movie, I get it that these new creatures were made for the purpose of making money, but man they like to shove these into viewer's face.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Last Film Review,"Years ago a sound-man on a Sun Micro corporate video shoot gave me a phone number for a job contact up at ILM. Being a young sci-fi fan and a then aspiring film maker, I was a nervous wreck. I called the number, let it ring three times and then hung up, largely because I had very little technical training and didn't think I would be of much benefit.After seeing Disney's take on mister Lucas's creation, I think I can safely say that that was a good decision.This film is long. It's got tons of contemporary wit. Has several graphic novel (comic book) moments in it. And, most importantly, very much lacks the sense of wonder that everyone experienced back in the 70s and 80s with the first Star Wars' films--a thing that I think even the so-called prequels manage to keep in spite of suffering story shortcomings.Films are meant for social inspiration, and this film departs from the predominantly white cast of the first films, and is a bit more all inclusive. That's a plus. Yet it feels ham-fisted to me. As if it was an afterthought to include African-Americans, Asians, Middle Eastern people, and whoever else, in the character line up. Personally, I don't care. Make the whole cast of mixed parentage from African Pygmies, Native Americans, Amazon tribes and Finnish and Russian for all I care, as long as it's a good story, but if you think that the fan who may have racist feelings is going to be suddenly enlightened, then you have another thing coming. In short, the benefits of a cosmopolitan cast, to me, do not outweigh an extremely iffy plot.This film pays homage to The Empire Strikes back with several scenes that are lifted and yet re-arranged for this new movie's purpose (you'll note the space sequence and ground battle, reshuffled, as well as an ""homage"" to the showdown between Luke and Vader from ""Empire""), but, unlike ""The Empire Strikes Back""'s dramatic and operatic pacing and overall scale, we have a film that's driven by plot and subplot. Those of us who have seen and read the original Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers' serials, that would include mister George Lucas, there was larger edge to the story that made them grander than what they initially were; a relatively low budget series meant for boys and girls. ""The Last Jedi"" tries to placate to the Star Wars' fan, but doesn't understand its own roots other than what was produced in 1977 and afterwards.An hour of this film could have been cut, and it's my personal opinion that the film was unnecessarily fluffed up or inflated for a distinct lack of good story material. ""Empire Strikes Back"" moves because each scene is pertinent, and moves the story forward for both the larger struggle in which the characters are involved, and their own personal struggles as they relate to the cause. That's what made those films so good.The other real pitfall of this film is that we're never given a motive for the bad guys being bad guys. That is to say we don't know why they ""turned to the dark side"", unlike the nebulous yet rather emotionally found reasons explained to us in both Empire and Jedi. There's none the such given here.There is one major positive about this film, and that is it reflects back on a message from the Hospitaller knight from Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and that is what matters is right action. But this is never really underscored nor pushed as a central theme, even though this is the key element around which the movie revolves. Instead the film meanders from one audience pleasing moment to the next, and never becomes fully realized.I trained as a screenwriter, worked as a grip, stage manager, camera operator, and even just as a jack of all trades from the late 80s up through the mid 90s, a half hour south of ILM, wondering if I should have been really kicking myself for not taking that opportunity some three decades ago. Well, again, after seeing this film, I think it was the right decision. I can write a better movie. No joke. I can. Not that I would have ever had the chance to write a Star Wars' film, but to this end, and seeing this film in all its alleged glory, I'm glad I never worked on one. And, further, as much as I loved seeing Star Wars for the first time way back in 1977 on opening days, and subsequent re-screenings after that, I can truly say that this film epitomizes why I never became a fan in spite of being a dyed in the wool science fiction fan.Thanks for reading.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A revolutionary turning point for the new trilogy of Star Wars,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is finally here and this highly anticipated movie does not fall short on good storytelling, awesome space battles, great characterization. This movie is great in many ways, and fortunately tells a good story without having to repeat itself unlike the Force Awakens did with a New Hope. Yes, there are elements in this movie that are similar to Empire Strikes Back but it is not because of a lack of originality, it is to provide good star wars nostalgia for the older audiences, pay homage to great pop culture characters such as Luke Skywalker and also not try to be a new thing without forgetting what came before it originally. The Last Jedi seems to be its own thing in a good way and explore areas of the Star Wars universe that have not been explored before. As always, great acting from the cast especially to Mark Hamill for an excellent performance as Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher (Rest in Peace) who was able to portray Leia Organa in a great way for one last time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Oh Boy,"""The Last Jedi"" is probably the most controversial film in the entire saga. There are some people who truly hate this movie. There are some people who think that it's one of the greatest in the saga. I'm somewhere in the middle. Honestly I could care less about whatever lore ""contradictions"" this movie upsets fans of the series with. Most of the ""new"" force powers here work for the movie. Also, you're complaining about characters projecting themselves across the galaxy through the force in a series where one of the main characters is a two foot tall goblin who can move rocks with his brain. People who are upset with this movie for very minor in-universe inconsistencies really don't understand that they've been doing this since the very first few ""Star Wars"" films. ""Wow, they can shoot lightning out of their fingertips now? Why didn't Obi-Wan or Luke just do that in either of the previous movies?"" Stuff like that. It doesn't really matter. In the end, these movies are all just dumb adventure movies set in a unique and interesting universe. What I will say is that this movie does have quite a few actual issues in terms of telling a competent story. The plot and tone are all over the place. Some of the characters and subplots are extremely rushed and underdeveloped. There's an overall lack of focus. This movie could have been trimmed by about half an hour and it would have been excellent. The bright spots shine, but there is also a lot of fat that should have been cut.""The Last Jedi"" takes place shortly after the ending of ""The Force Awakens."" The First Order has discovered the location of the Resistance base, and our heroes are forced to make a desperate escape. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) leads a bombing run on a star destroyer, but the Resistance fleet retreats as Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) ship arrives along with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The Resistance fleet is pulled into a slow game of cat and mouse, as they are unable to avoid the First Order's hyperspace tracking. Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) make a desperate attempt to contact a codebreaker (Benicio Del Toro) on the casino planet of Canto Bight in order to disable the First Order's tracking. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) meets Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in hopes of receiving Jedi training.This movie has many flaws. The Canto Bight stuff is basically a pointless diversion. Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) is also an annoying stand-in for Leia (Carrie Fisher), who really could have just taken her place in the plot and it would have been the same movie. Rose is a bad character, she lacks any of the charm or chemistry that any of the other new cast members bring to the table. She's not written well at all. The forced humor is even worse than it was in ""The Force Awakens."" Some of the more awkward moments in this movie stoop down to prequel levels of cringe and embarassment.For all of those flaws, I still find it to be a really entertaining and compelling story. The interactions between Rey and Kylo Ren, and the arc of Luke Skywalker, are some of the best character moments in the entire saga. Mark Hamill gives his greatest performance as Luke in this film. Some of the cinematography in this movie is the greatest in the entire franchise. It's a visual marvel and I think that the movie could work well to show off a home theater setup. Philosophically, this is probably the deepest that the franchise has ever gone, with themes of letting go of the past and learning to accept failure.I recommend ""The Last Jedi"" to any fan of the saga. You've probably already seen, and you've probably already made up your mind about it, but I encourage you to watch it again and ignore what the internet mob of angry fans says about it. It's no masterpiece, and there's a lot that still frustrates me about it. But Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren have some of their greatest moments in this movie, and it's definitely a breath of fresh air and something unique to a franchise that normally just regurgitates itself over and over again. Just keep in mind that you have to trudge through some awfulness to enjoy the truly outstanding moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's a Good Film, Just Not a Great Film (Spoiler Free)","Look, The Last Jedi is good, it's just not great.
If you're a Star Wars fan and thought The Force Awakens was a little too close to Star Wars - A New Hope in terms of story line then TLJ is more of the same.
Effects are good, Daisy Ridley is the undoubted star and Adam Driver brings a complexity that is often missing from the main protagonist. It's recommended for the Big Screen and it's no Attack of the Clones (6.6), but it isn't Empire (8.8) either and in the end it falls somewhere between the two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's a good movie...but,I would have done a couple things differently as the writer. Luke should have been happier to see Rey and more willing early on to train her just as Obi-Wan wanted to help train Luke in A New Hope. Some extra light saber battles would have been nice too. JJ Abrams should have done this movie as well as the other 2 to keep the flow and continuity between movies. But overall it's a good movie. If you want bad go back and watch the Star Wars Holiday Special from 1978. It would give you a whole new perspective of what is actually bad.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Could have been great,"I really enjoyed this movie, despite its many flaws. Anything under 5 stars is just neckbeard edgelords trying to be cool.Aside from the prank phone call near the beginning of the movie, most of the humour was great, and got genuine laughs from the theater. The action was fantastic, though, most of the universe's physical laws change from scene to scene, which does get distracting. The galaxy has definitely shrunk since episode 4-6, they cross the galaxy in a matter of seconds rather than days.The plot was far from airtight. Okay, it was a sieve with a few holes you could fly the falcon through, but overlooking that, the emotion and character arcs were what really hit home for me. I think they took too much from Rogue One, however, it felt like they had characters needlessly sacrificing themselves just to get more of a gut punch, but it didn't need to do that, and it started to feel cheap as the hours went on.It's also long. 150 minutes long. I think with the help of a better editor, they could have trimmed a lot of fat, and tightened things up. As it was, my row was a constant stream of people going back and forth for bathroom breaks in the second half and my back was killing my by the end. It also had more endings than Return of the King. This is probably a result of having too many characters, and splitting the party.All in all, it won't stand up to much scrutiny or nitpicking, but if you go into it looking for a fun star wars movie, you'll have a good time. Bring some tissues, too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A pleasantly unpredictable and mature spectacle.,"I'm an old dinosaur who has seen all the original movies on their release in cinemas and still enjoyed the slightly disappointing prequels. Then this new trilogy came along and brought back the magic and nostalgia of the classic movies of my childhood. The Force Awakens was a fantastic introduction to our new characters and a great first chapter of an exciting new tale. 
Now we have the second part of the story and boy, did it surprise me in a good way. The movie opens with a fantastic space battle that provides genuine tension and thrills. Then the story progresses into a desperate fight for survival for the Resistance who have been decimated with the loss of the republic and now only number a handful of ships and crew, relentlessly pursued by Kylo Ren's superior forces. I won't spoil anything but this movie throws many an unexpected twist and turn at you and the results weave a new and refreshing narrative which take the franchise into unexplored territory.
Mark Hamill is great as Luke and we get to see the result that those missing 30 years have had on the man and is dealt with in a mature and realistic way. In fact, all the cast put in great performances, including the newcomers. We get some answers but not all, and are left dangling with some other questions which I'm sure we'll get explained in the final part. The cinematography, scenery, lighting and special effects are all superb, however I am knocking a star off for some slightly suspect CGI in the casino planet section.
Highly recommended and great fun for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"This movie SUCKED, and now I will tell you why.","I'm a huge-ass starwars fanboy, and I will now list everything wrong with this movie.ONE: This was not an exact copy of the original SW saga. I mean, we all loved Force Awakens BECAUSE it was pretty much the script of New Hope copy-pasted but with the character names changed and cooler special effects added. That's the only reason we loved the movie, and of course we expected this new movie to be the EXACT copy of Empire Strikes Back, just like FA was a copy of New Hope. Unfortunately, Disney tried creating something original instead! I mean what year do you think this is, 1977?!? Nobody - and I mean NOBODY - has done an original script in Hollywood in approximately 15 years for a very good reason, and you can see that reason reading all the reviews written for this movie: nobody - and I really mean NOBODY - wants to see original stuff, it makes my brain go hurtyhurt!TWO: Like many have pointed out here, Luke Skywalker is no longer young for some reason. I mean, we all came to see this guy who looks like he has had an ever-lasting hangover for the past 50 years, assuming he would be the same fun-loving adventure-seeking little brat we all got to know and love back in the day. Yet somehow, SOMEHOW, they DARED to make Luke have had personal history, disappointments and even some tragic personal developement over the past decades. HOW DARE THEY?!THREE: We are not told information about useless things that we do not need to know. Sure, when the original Star Wars trilogy came out, we weren't handed much information about any of the characters either. We didn't even know Emperor Palpatine's name until we started reading some extra background stuff. But back then it was okay because movies were about the ORIGINAL STORY, and not so much about what was the exact background and family origin of each character. But nowdays, as we all know, not only are movies supposed to be extremely non-original, they also are not supposed to contain a ""story"", but rather information. When a character appears, it doesn't so much matter what (s)he does in the movie, or where (s)he takes the story, it is more important to know the background and his/hers whereabouts in the past, and his/hers parents as well. And even though I hate to spoil it, we really don't get to know who Snoke's parents are AT ALL! Unless we are revealed in Episode 9 that Snoke's father was really Boba Fett, I really have to say that this all kinda sucked hard.All in all, I would agree with all the other reviewers, that the script of this movie was indeed not copy-pasted from the original saga, and thus this was a very very bad movie indeed.

The day that Star Wars died,"I watched this movie twice before finally making up my thoughts. The more i think about this one the more i felt empty and angry at the same time. You can enjoy this movie if you're simply want to see some space ships fighting, some aliens, thrown in, random politcal correct messages without any connection to the splot, some Marvell humor and no story telling at all.Of course there are quite a lot of bad movies out there, but nobody really cares about Transformers after watching the crap, right? This is different with Star Wars. This franchise connected so many people all over the world from all countries, ethnics, both male and female. What this movie does is to completely disconnect people and ruins almost everything Star Wars stands for. And in addition to this it also ruins it's legacy.I am not a hard core fan, i did not read any books or comics, just saw the movies. I did not really like the prequels, but at least George Lucas tried to tell an original story, but failed in execution. Episode 7 was okay as a reboot and Rogue One was my hope, that Star Wars can grow up into a great adult space epic, since although the story of R1 wasn't that good, the tone was excellent and catched everything i hoped for. Also the characters were believable if you consider the short screentime they had.In The Last Jedi it seems, that they tried to put everything into which needed to be in a commercial sci-fi kids movie, please some fans, include as much twists as possible just to the sake of surprise plus add the most obvious and cheap political correct statements possible. Yes, you can do that, but you need a really good plot, a vision and a perfect directing to match all these things together. And this is where you completely failed, Mr. Johnson.This movie is a desaster in story telling, pacing, tone, character development and also disrespectful to the legacy of Star Wars. It's an insult to both Star Wars fans and good movie makers in general.For me, this is the end of Star Wars.

Returning to the galaxy,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Found myself loving 'The Force Awakens', which to me was the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and more an affectionate homage and universe celebration than the re-hash some have criticised it for. Seeing 'The Last Jedi' with quite high expectations, judging from the positive critical word of mouth, and despite enjoying it and finding a lot to like, the fans' disappointment is understandable (though some of the hate has not only been disrespectful but vitriolic). 'The Last Jedi' is not as good as the original trilogy, not even close, or as 'The Force Awakens', but it is better to me than the prequels.As said, the disappointment is understandable and some of the problems fans had with it are also shared by me. 'The Last Jedi' would have been an even better film with less new characters (with variable effectiveness) and less subplots because while it was never dull it did feel at times too busy and bloated.This would have been solved with not having the rushed and pretty unnecessary romantic subplot, which seemed more an excuse to introduce a new character and give an older character more depth, and doing much more with the villains. With the exception of Ren, the film's most interesting character along with Rey, all are underwritten, especially the missed opportunity that was Snoke. He looks good and Andy Serkis portrays him beautifully but he is criminally underused and even more wronged by a far too easy and anti-climactic defeat.Can also understand the outrage at the rather one-dimensional and out of character, even with the self-doubt, torment and regret, treatment of Luke. Despite Mark Hamill objecting to this treatment, it does not show in his nuanced performance that ranks among his best recent work. As well as some of the humour, some of it was forced and out of place in being placed randomly at less than appropriate times.However, for all those faults, there is also a lot to like about 'The Last Jedi'. It does have enough to satisfy the nostalgic while, like 'The Force Awakens', having its own identity. While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'The Last Jedi' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic (fans will disagree with this and that's fine) at the expense of brains or heart. Of the characters, Rey and Ren are especially well realised and it is their subplot that is particularly successful of the storytelling.For all its unevenness and reservations about it trying to do too much, that it is a richer and more elaborate experience, with a deeper and darker perspective on space fantasy allegory and the condition of humans and aliens, than the previous 'Star Wars' films was appreciated.Visually, 'The Last Jedi' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed and benefits with some very imaginative and energetic visual storytelling. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films.Enough of the dialogue is thought-provoking and entertaining, while Rey's journey, Ren's conflict, the scenes between Rey and Luke and the Rey and Ren subplot are handled very well. The action is thrilling, particularly the knockout final showdown.When it comes to the acting, despite not liking their characters' treatment there is no fault to be found with Hamill and Serkis as aforementioned. Daisy Ridley gives another winning performance and is more comfortable this time round. John Boyega is charismatic and Carrie Fisher's final performance has a nostalgic poignancy. With Ren being even more of a conflicted villain than in 'The Force Awakens', Adam Driver brings more menace and conflicted edge.In summary, good but not amazing. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Has its moments but generally unengaging and dull,"Picking up where The Force Awakens left off, Rey meets Luke Skywalker and tries to convince him to help The Resistance.

Meanwhile, The Resistance are locked in deadly battle with the First Order and, while they have some minor victories, it seems like a futile struggle.I'm not generally a Star Wars fan but to my surprise I enjoyed Episode VII - The Force Awakens. It grabbed my attention from the word go and held it all the way through. A rollicking adventure with engaging characters. Moreover, the blending of the old characters and the new was very well done, with the feeling that the torch had been passed to the new generation.Unfortunately, Episode VIII doesn't come close to the engagement, novelty and adventure of Episode VII. Its essentially one long action-drama, with little in the way of engagement or originality. The Rey-Kylo Ren relationship had potential but went nowhere new or interesting and was snuffed out pretty quickly. Them possibly working together held my attention but the intrigue was short-lived.

I belong to the original Star Wars generation and I always understood that in order to bring the story forward some sacrifices would have to be made.

Rian 'WHO' Johnson,"To take on a movie dynasty like Star Wars was always a daunting task... and when Disney got involved, I thought 'I've got a bad feeling about this'.... luckily with JJ on the case, The Force Awakens was very good, and more importantly, very true to the nature of the saga.Then, for reasons i will never understand Rian Johnson gets the gig... I mean I loved Breaking Bad and The Fly episode was very memorable cos it was so quirky. Then Looper - an ok movie, made ok.. How on earth does this guy then get this gig ?!?!?Relatively unknown and told he can re-write almost the entire script... what do we then get - a very long movie, trying to tell lots of stories (almost all not to a decent standard), a major lack of character development and then well, you get an ok movie which is almost entirely received as meh !Lets hope IX can make amends, please.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Let the Past Die...,"I actually really loved Last Jedi and was prepared not to based on what everyone was saying. People complain about Luke living in exile -- So did Yoda. So did Obi-Wan. The circle from idealistic kid to disillusioned adult made perfect sense. There are a few digressions that maybe don't need to exist in the plot, but that's true of most Star Wars movies. I do find the newer films are a little quippier than the old ones, but it doesn't bother me.If you're not into this movie, that's okay. If it's ruined Star Wars for you, I have questions about how Phantom Menace didn't already do that, but it's also okay.

"Deceptively slow and a bit muddled to start, but stick with it and The Last Jedi will reward you with boldness and brilliance to think and talk about for days.","The middle film in a trilogy is, almost always, a tough one to pull off. Its predecessor gets to introduce characters and ideas and themes; its successor gets to finish off the tale and tie up all the loose ends. Often, this awkward second movie ends up treading water, padding out a story without the benefit of including either its first chapter or its last. For a while (quite a long while), it feels like writer-director Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi has fallen prey to this very syndrome. Fortunately, he pulls it all together in the film's final hour, firing off a series of crackerjack narrative twists that are as surprising, heartfelt and spectacular as anything you'll see in a cinema this year.The Last Jedi opens right where The Force Awakens left off. The First Order remains hellbent on extinguishing the remnants of the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). Attempts to evade the military forces commandeered by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) cause friction among the rebels, as the charmingly impulsive Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) clashes with flinty war hero Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern). Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to drag the legendary Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) out of his self-imposed exile - but finds him broken and bitter following his failure to keep his nephew, Ben Solo a.k.a. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), from turning to the Dark Side.The first 100 minutes are the strangest - and potentially most offputting - thing about The Last Jedi. For much of its first half, the film feels almost as if it's been stitched together from a handful of very different movies. It may open on an exhilarating intergalactic space opera, but it also dives deep into the shifting moods of an existentialist drama (featuring a 'hall-of-mirrors' sequence straight out of a drug-drenched arthouse flick), before landing smack in the middle of an odd-couple road-trip comedy.That's not to say Johnson doesn't handle this peculiar patchwork fairly well. He unearths moments of heart and heroism as his characters wage war amongst the stars, and he quite effectively plumbs the dark depths of Luke's despair and Rey's desperation to understand her place in the world. There are moments of quiet joy and sensitivity, too, on the mission undertaken by Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (charming newcomer Kelly Marie Tran) that otherwise comes across as a bit of an unnecessary detour. Johnson even keeps proceedings chugging along by infusing the film with a sly humour - courtesy of MVP BB-8 and a flock of adorably annoying Porgs.Nonetheless, the film does suffer, at least initially, from this awkward mish-mash of genres and tones. As Rey follows Luke up yet another mountain, or Finn and Rose bond over a stable full of soulful space horses, it's hard to shake the feeling that The Last Jedi is stuck in a holding pattern - busy and yet slow, overstuffed but also sluggish.Thank goodness, then, that Johnson makes it all come together beautifully as the film enters its masterful third act. Suddenly, as the many disparate story threads spin into one another, the movie roars into heart-stopping, spine-tingling life. Choices and sacrifices are made. Alliances crumble in the face of ambition. Final stands are taken. Goodbyes - hard ones, sad ones, final ones - are said. While it's best not to give much more away (this film's most heart-wrenching twists are experiences unto themselves), suffice it to say that every element of it works.Johnson also draws excellent performances from his cast. Hamill's raw, powerful turn as a man haunted by his failures is easily one of his finest yet. He sells Luke's trepidation and tenderness, hinting at a broken heart that's somehow still whole enough to care. Ridley has settled more confidently into Rey's bones, while Driver continues to add shade and colour to what could easily have been a one-note antagonist. Together, they make the moments their characters share, from the distinctly odd to the unbearably tense, believable.There is, of course, a thread of bittersweet sadness that runs throughout The Last Jedi because it is, by default, the final film starring the deeply missed Fisher as the iconic Leia Organa. It's not quite a fitting farewell to a beloved character - the film leaves little doubt that Leia would have taken centre stage in Episode IX if only it were humanly possible. But, for what it's worth (and it's worth a lot), Fisher lends Leia what she always has: a rich, glorious mix of her own unmistakable strength, light and humour.All in all, The Last Jedi is a remarkable achievement. It may take a while to really get going, but the pay-off for toughing it out through every twist and turn is tremendous. Johnson's film doesn't simply make a compelling case for giving a trilogy's middle installment the benefit of the doubt. As it draws to a close, The Last Jedi also explores and explodes Star Wars mythology in ways both reverential and revolutionary. Simultaneously an ending and a beginning, it's going to be a tough act to follow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually Stunning , Emotionally Resonant, Daring Storytelling and Character Development","The Last Jedi is a cinematic feast, showcasing breathtaking visuals that elevate the Star Wars saga to new heights. The cinematography captures the vastness of space and the intimate moments between characters beautifully, making every frame a work of art. John Williams' score complements these visuals perfectly, adding depth and emotion to key scenes
Rian Johnson's direction brings a fresh perspective to the series, daring to explore complex themes such as failure, redemption, and the nature of heroism. The character arcs in this film are particularly noteworthy; Luke Skywalker's transformation is profound, as he grapples with his past mistakes while mentoring Rey. This dynamic not only enriches their relationship but also adds layers to the narrative, making it resonate with audiences on multiple levels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Did Nay Sayers See The Same Movie As I Did?,"Reading the reviews and I see negative after negative reviews for the purists and nitpickers of the universe that left me scratching my ""cabeza"". I have went and see the movie, paid my $10.50, saw it in 3-D with my movie buddy and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was entertaining. I bet that the 'nay sayers' sat there and kept there critical glasses on and ripped apart the movie at every turn. While on the other hand, I and I am sure others, did not have it one and let the movie do its thing and take us on a ride in the Star Wars Universe. I am sure that if they did that, they would have seen the movie for what it is, a masterpiece of cinematic history.Now after that gush, I have listen to the JW Soundtrack that is streaming on Apple iTunes, a couple of times while waiting for my hard copy order to come from B&N, and I have to say that while John Williams uses his old original iconic music to tell the story, it was the glue that really held the movie together. It was a perfect marriage of sonic story telling. If it was not for the music, the feature would have fallen flat, and the audience would have been disappointed. So, Disney had better kiss the feet of Williams for holding the movie together, since John knew enough that he had to incorporate easily recognizable character tunes (leitmotif - a recurrent theme throughout a musical or literary composition, associated with a particular person, idea, or situation.) to help guide the audience as to what to expect. If it weren't for that, then the audience would have gotten lost.To enjoy the move, you will have to understand that it was a variation to the theme of Empire (Johnson even said that). While the story of TFW, JJ Abrams keep the story clean, Johnson kept the story not so much clean, but complex with 3 sub plots merging into one beautiful story line. Put it this way, as TFW was pulp fiction: TLJ was literature. The question of who is the last Jedi is answered by Luke warning the world about the movie, 'it's not going to go the way your think."" Keep that warning from Luke, and just enjoy the film and its music, and kiss the Porg.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most divisive star wars film,"I've finished seeing the film an hour and a half ago, utterly shocked. I could not decide whether I liked the film or was disappointed. I'm serious: this film can really give serious doubts on their capacity of judgement.What I think many people could be afraid of, is whether this film is similar or not to V. 
I did not see many, very little similarities, in fact. More similarities where there with VI, if I must say, but any similarity to previous film dissipated in the final 45 minutes. It is also to note that such similarities are very slight, especially when compared to what seen in VII.Let's start with the technical aspect, which was obviously outstanding. I really liked the overall style and the various choices made by Johnson there. Special effects where great, especially in aspects I didn't expect, that of the practical alien characters. I cannot but praise Johnson's techincal capacity in directing action, in the photography and much else.
I am still not sure about Johnson's capacity in story writing. There was an entire story arc, which, although included some very great scenes, ultimately had quite a few plot holes and unhappy solutions. I'd like to point out that I noticed aforementioned plot holes after quite a few discussions, so it's not that I'm like those reviewers that see plot holes everywhere. But I have to be honest, the story arc that follows the Resistance was not outstanding at all.On the other hand, the backbone of the film was truly outstanding. I won't spoil anything, I will only state that a new light is shaded on the entire course of Good vs. Evil, of the picture you get of the prequels, and much else. Some very bold story decisions where made, unexpected at all. Ultimately, a very interesting outcome is provided for a possibly strong episode IX.Finally, having seen it, I find VIII very divisive. I can understand both those who praise it and those who will hate it. It was certainly better than VII, but I'm not yet sure if it lives up to the OT, even though it sometimes seems even better than aforementioned films. But when it does not do so, it becomes at moments a quite bland film, especially during the arc that focuses on the Resistance. If I have to choose, I'd say it is a good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

And some of the great work done The Force Awakens to re-energise the franchise was just completely undone. You know that incredibly significant and poignant moment at the end of TFA as Rey hands the lightsabre to Luke?

"One of the best, or the best","This came along and blew expectations out of the water. The Force Awakens was too safe, and basically remade A New Hope. The Last Jedi attempts to course correct by choosing a filmmaker who would deliver something original and fresh. Some of the best story beats are removing the dull aspects of the original. The Empire Strikes Back was released to mixed responses, just like Last Jedi. In time it will be interesting to see how this film is received. The backlash came from a corner of fans wanting a simple mythology, and no twists. How boring. This flipped the switch and true Star Wars fans were treated to an original storyline.

Original cast - the return of Mark Hamil really adds to the whole thing for me, though he may not be the best actor on the planet.

Inconsequential storyline dampens what could have been a masterpiece,"This film would have been a masterpiece if it weren't for the completely inconsequential adventure we're forced to take with Finn and a girl named Rose. This detour achieves absolutely nothing in the movie: none of the action or story development is of any consequence whatsoever to the larger plot or themes and to add to the tedium of it is that the settings and special effects in these parts are completely amateurish and juvenile. Honestly, they feel like the prequels. Any producer worth his or her salt should have cut that storyline altogether, thus trimming the film back by thirty minutes and letting it be exactly what it is otherwise: a well-paced story with an awful lot of heart and wisdom graced by powerful performances and breathtaking visuals. The Finn and Rose storyline will keep me from seeing this over and over again.That being said, I'll definitely watch it at least twice more in the theater because honestly everything else is pretty much perfect. Ren and Rey, Rey and Luke, Luke and Ren - the scenes in the throne room. Wow! I loved Poe's storyline and the entire chase between the First Order and the Resistance was spot on.But nothing, no nothing, was ever more beautiful than the ultimate showdown of good versus evil. The final 30 minutes of ""The Last Jedi"" are as perfect a piece of film making as it gets.Maybe I'll just purchase a movie editing software and cut out the whole Finn/Rose adventure altogether. Then I could enjoy over and over again a 2 hour masterpiece instead of a great, but flawed, 2.5 hour epic. Truly, and unfortunately, none of Finn's storyline would be missed in this otherwise flawless film.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

There was old and new, and both served to make this an immersive and exciting experience. This movie made me feel like a child again, stepping into a world full of unknown creatures, characters, and circumstances, wishing I could be part of it.Also, if you want a general sense of how fans felt about it, I will say I've never heard people cheer out loud for a movie this many times before.

Didn't understand the assignment...,"Rian was supposed to create the next Star Wars movie, not destroy the franchise. People wanted Star Wars, not a subversion of expectations. Rian can make a decent movie--I enjoy Knives Out--but Star Wars is bigger than the ego of any one director, so he should have made a film that fit in, rather show his personal take on Star Wars. I, and many other fans of the franchise, do not care about that, so the fanbase was split...I don't put 100% of the blame on his shoulders, however. Kathleen Kennedy and J. J. Abrams played their role as well, Kathleen with her Agenda and J. J. with his low effort ""black box"" approach to mysteries. (What's in the black box? Who knows, we'll figure it out later...

JJ Abrams Needed To Direct This Movie,"I think Lucasfilm and Disney have kind of lost their way recently, they entrusted the Star Wars franchise to Rian Johnson, his last movie was Looper in 2012, someone else who hasn't directed much in the last five years so I can't undertand why Lucasfilm and Disney would entrust the Star Wars franchise to someone like Rian Johnson.The Last Jedi wasn't a bad film but it could have been a lot better, and it has enraged a lot of Star Wars fans who would have liked to have seen Star Wars go in the same direction where The Force Awakens left it, I personally would have liked to have seen Luke Skywalker give the same training he received off Yoda and passed onto Rey, I would have liked it if Luke would have left the Island and to have seen a nice Master and Padawan relationship start between Luke and Rey as they take on the First Order in The Last Jedi and into Episode IX as well.It would also been nice if Luke was revealed to be Rey's long lost father and that she too came from Skywalker blood but there are so many missed opportunities to make The Last Jedi a fan favourite and I can see why Star Wars fans raised money to re-make The Last Jedi.Whereas The Force Awakens in 2015 and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in 2016 were brilliant movies and saw Lucasfilm hit new heights, The Last Jedi in 2017 and Solo: A Star Wars Story seems to be following Lucasfilm and Disney on a downward spiral and I hope Episode IX and the new Anthology films in 2019 and 2020 can revive Lucasfilm's aspirations and plans for the Star Wars franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

All acquitted themselves well. The special effects were far from amateur despite being used in the service of much silly, needless nonsense. The only actor that truly needed to be light-sabered was Domhnall Gleason. Who told him to overact so badly? Disney execs taking the dope left over by Carrie Fisher?

"Not what I expected, but still something to be enthralled by","Rian Johnson goes for his ultimate Star Wars experience, instead of giving us the story this trilogy needed. In the end, delivers some of the most orgasmic space odyssey sequences i have ever seen in the sci-fi genre. And catapults a story (that may be a bit jumbled) but doesn't disappoint in subversion or surprise.I think the movie would've benefitted more from slowing down, honing in (which I noticed right away, was refusing to do). Its more on the level of a mid-tier Harry Potter film than a Dark Knight, Two Towers or Empire that I was expecting. But it's still a journey worthwhile and one I was struck by.If you're let down or mislead in any way by the characters or plot. I didn't think it was in the wrong. It's simply Johnson's angst to juggle too many storylines at once, which made the emphasis of the story difficult (at times) to carry through. But I was able to process it, and see through the flaws and denote (from my experience of watching films over my life) that there's a quality sci-fi film here (in a franchise of already sub-tier films) is far from the worst.The good things that keep this movie afloat are well above most.

No. Is it perfect, no. But shock horror neither were Star Wars or Empire.Rian Johnson brought new aspects to this 40 year old story and in my opinion they where great. I loved Luke in this film, Mark Hamill was amazing and delivered a performance better than any he has given before. Rey's story is great and having a flawed villain is great. This hooked me from the opening to the end and I do agree its losing a bit of traction in the middle but this didn't detract for me. Need to see it again to take it all in.So blame Disney or the SJW or whatever other nonsense you want to dump on the film but do me a favour and stop claiming to be the ultimate fan because that is not the case.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just amazing!!,"This movie, whoa!!! My second favourite movie of this decade sitting just below Andy Muschietti's adaptation of IT released earlier this year. Everything about it was amazing. The director really nailed this movie really well, the acting of the characters especially Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). They both deserve Oscars for this movie, great job!With saying that, I must also say that it was an emotional film, being Carrie Fisher's final film before she passed away last year, and watching her performance made it really sad because it was so good aswellRest in Peace Carrie:(",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's a different Star Wars film,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was a weird film in the franchise for me. There were parts that I really liked, such as, the development of Kylo Ren as a character and a lot of the visuals and fight scenes.And there were parts that I really didn't liked, such as, floating Leia, Raffiki Yoda, Rose x Finn, and the Casino Planet.I still need to do a rewatch (in fact, I've only seen all of the Star Wars films once), but through the first watch, I had a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of unexpected answers from previous questions.""The Last Jedi"" is very much a film that you have to watch yourself to determine if you'll like it or not. Especially if you're a Star Wars fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"At first hated it, but soon come to appreciate it.","In December of 2017, I was visiting my friend at a random evening at a random day. I had no idea the new Star Wars movie was in theatres nor was I interested at the time so my friend asked let's go watch the Last Jedi. I said yeah sure let's go and we've watched it. I don't know how my friend felt about it after that but for me I kind of hated it at at the time. The film was too jokesty, scenes that didn't go anywhere, Mary Poppins ""Leia"", the purple haired woman and her unwillingness to explain the situation, the entire existence of Rose, Finn and Rose plotline especially and their nonsensical dumb relationship that Finn had no feelings for Rose whatsoever, and that scenes of Rose just kind of kissing Finn was sooo.. awkward.As it turns out: Yes! Alot of people did feel the same way and I do still stand some of these criticisms except the jokesty part and Rose and I will explain myself soon:
But as time goes on I've soon come to love this movie and for starters; it's so atmospheric with its beautiful landscapes and cozy, rainy environments as well as beautiful scenes. The island that Rey and Luke trained on, the raining scene with Rey underneath the ship before interacting with Kylo, Kylo's ship, planet Crait and Snoke's palace.These memorable moments still stick with me; whenever Rey contacting Kylo. Everything about Luke, him and Rey's training. Rey's mirror about her past. That unexpected demise of the villian, a wise bold move from the director if I do say so myself because this gets me every time, as well as Luke on Crait.The storyline with Rey is shallow, but pretty good, and should've just leave it at that. She's now training with Luke, Rey's parents are complete mystery and she must accept to who she is. Her getting closer to Ben and try to convince him that his way of thinking is wrong is heartwarming, and Ben's increasing anger when the villian tries to hurt Rey.Quotable dialgoues and memes like ""The sacred Jedi text!"" and ""I want every gun we have to fire on that man!"" and the meme of ""Ben Swolo"".Whenever Luke is around, I personally think Luke's performance is the best it has ever been. He's wise, but grown old and bitter about his actions. You can interpret however you want why he felt this way. But yes that final moment when Luke says to Kylo ""see you around kid"" was inexusably bad, yet hilarous. Why would he say that to a kid who literally ruined his life?Rose recieved alot of hate which that 1. It's way too harsh and 2. That criticism should've been pointed at the director because the actor has nothing to do with the script. Yeah sure she was useless from start to finish but somehow I felt she's just a character to tag along with Fin because yeah that whole casino planet was a waste of time but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't hilarous everytime; when they try to disguise as one of the guards; being fooled by DJ an their interactions with him which by the way that character is AMAZING!The director may have done goofed alot of the parts in this movie but man, I still enjoy watching this movie from time to time. Its hilarous scenes, bold and unexpected plot twists, engaging plotline and real beauty to look at in alot of the scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best move forward,"I'm so frustrated with tros I had to write this review. I love TLJ and I know a lot of people do. But we are not the loudest voice and I don't even believe that is the majority. The majority enjoyed this movie without wanting everything old back or having our own agenda based on childhood and childish memories of how things were and should stay the same.
JJ set up Luke hiding on that island due to his failure in TFA so what was RJ suppose to do with that? Did Luke go to the island to be happy and perky and positive and continue to act like his 30 yo self? No! RJ took the premise of the previous movie and logically built on it. This is the most fleshed out version of Luke ever. People go through trauma and mid life crisises that change them. That is life. I mean look at Mark Hamill now compared to MH from the 80s. He's not the same! But at the end of the day Luke still came back and saved the day. Luke will inevitably die someday. He ain't young. Do you prefer he die of old age doing nothing? Or go out with a bang using the force? I loved his death scene. It was powerful and moving and purposeful. That complaint about his death is so childish. I mean he's done it all already let him go! It's not his turn anymore.
TLJ did nothing that a talented writer could not have taken further. (I do think JJ is talented)
For example RJ gave us such a good set up for the next movie's use of Knights of Ren. He even said he purposedly did not use them in the throne room so that they can be used later. Luke says to Rey that Ben took some of the trainees from the academy and disappeared. There were total of 12 other kids Luke trained so it makes sense the KoR are the other kids Ben fled with. So without Snoke how do you not take that opportunity to use the Knights of Ren as former Jedi trainees and build on that? Develop them and make one of them Kylo's new apprentice/ right hand man. This can be one of the things he ""finishes"" since vadar was alway apprentice to Palpatine. But instead he reverts him back to apprentice to Palpatine in 9 is so lazy. New Ren could of somehow gained Snokes darkside powers when he died making him a strong adversary to Kylo and Kylo can still be redeemed since he's still not actually the darkest bad. New Ren can find out Kylo killed snoke and have a sinister back plan to bring Palpatines spirit back and move darkside forward if you still want Palpatine in a logical way. Or anything else! I don't care just make it follow the previous movie. Just saying there were possibilities to move forward with TLJ's set up. So people who complain that TLJ put JJ in the corner have no imagination or logic.

"Dissapointed and let down, but i can't hate this movie!","This is without a doubt the worst movie in the Star Wars Skywalker universe.I do feel let down and dissapointed, but I have been fair with my score because I still enjoyed it!The story in this one is weak, Luke is lacking in cool, too much is wishy-washy throughout the movie, and too much makes no sense at all????It's watchable and it bridges the gap to the conclusion with some good entertainment along the way.

If you're new to Star Wars you will enjoy this,"This movie looks amazing, sounds amazing, has great acting and a compelling relationship between the two main characters. It is a pity that this was not the first in the prequel trilogy as it has the feel of a ""middle movie"" and the director is wasted only making the daring 2nd part of what ended up essentially being a J.J. Abrams trilogy. This was the only movie of the three that had real substance and, judging by many fans reactions, that is not what Star Wars fans want. However, I have been a huge Star Wars fan since the 80s and I loved this. I think it will be appreciated more in time, when fans get tired of the blatant fan-service of The Mandalorian etc and realise that Star Wars had to change - but Rian was maybe changing too much, too soon for some.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Will Create Internal Conflict Akin To The Pull Of The Dark Side,"I will say one thing for this movie - it will cause conflict within you which will mimic that of a Jedi tempted by the dark side and a viewing of The Rise of Skywalker and reevaluation of The Force Awakens will only perpetuate this. I left the theater happy with TLJ but over time developed more and more issues with it and its arc with Luke. But after watching the heartless shell which was TROS and then reevaluating TFA with this considered I've finally come to think of TLJ as the only one of the new franchise which actually took any risk or spent any time on Luke. whether you're crazy about the portrayal of Luke in the first half or not this movie did spend time with him and allow him to shine bright in the end. I think as years go by this movie will gain traction and come to be appreciated more when compared to the slightly cheesy TFA and the emotionally void TROS. TFA is a fine movie but but even the scenes with the old characters feel a little forced. Love it or hate it TLJ took risks, pushed the envelope and ACTUALLY spotlighted a Skywalker rather than using his as passing fan service. That said I am no fan of Johnson and the many times his ego has shined through in interviews. You DO NOT EVER interrupt or contradict Mark Hamill - the man is the one and only Luke and no one has yet had the nerve to recast him in some one off Skywalker movie. But on that same note Johnson is the only one who let Luke shine on screen for longer than five minutes! The Mandalorian is the future of Star Wars for me but force to pick a favorite from the new trilogy I might have to stir some controversy into that pot and pick TLJ.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Tried hard to like it, but I just can't unfortunately","I watched this in the theatre, convinced myself that it was a good movie. A couple of hours after the showing, I sensed there was something not quite right about the movie. Then it was released on bluray, and I gave it another chance. Same thing happens.. I got disappointed once again,. I tried to watch it with the director's opinions and responses (after the mass criticisms from fans) in my mind, but still something doesn't feel right about the movie. I read most of the reviews here on imdb, and I have to say I agree with most of the people here that rated it low, as their opinions made sense. The funny thing is that a lot of the reviewers here on imdb that rated the movie high, do not state the actual reasons why they think its good. Probably because there is no way to defend the illogical points of the movie, other than that the director tried to go a total different route of what fans expected of the storyline. When you get over your head and try to be too creative with the storyline, this is what happens..plotholes all over the place. And I believe the people who liked the movie, might have overanalyzed it and the director's vision. In reality I do not think he intended such a deep meaning with the storyline, most of it could be coincidence. And his later explanations of intended deep meanings of the storyline might just be based on what other people overanalyzed after watching the movie. I mean, if it was that good and respected storyline from the beginning, Mark Hamill wouldn't have expressed such negative opinions during the productions. You can almost see the man bursting in agony in various interviews, but obviously he cannot speak too freely for some reason. I do hope episode 9 will redeem the damages that have been done..sigh..",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A step in the right direction, but not quite there yet","""The Last Jedi"" truly have some awesome scenes to behold, the opening sequence made me feel like a kid again, something ""The Force Awakens"" never managed, because it was just a remade ""A New Hope"" with lack of direction. There is big differences in these two films. And here i will talk about some things i think separates them.The Acting:
In TFA it was almost like everyone on set had been running around yelling ""WE ARE MAKING A NEW STAR WARS MOVIE WEEEEEE"". And in the massive confusion and joy, someone forgot that they are making a movie. The Entire TFA felt odd, and it didn't help that it's basically a reboot which made the entire film predictable and boring.But in TLJ someone stepped up and took charge. Because now the actors have suddenly upped the ante and are delivering powerful performances. Carrie Fisher for example, completely different here, more believable, more emotions. Same with Daisey Ridley, she is now showing she's an excellent actress, something that was not shown in TFA, which is a damn shame!. Because she was IMO the best thing about TFA. And Mark Hamill might be delivering the best performance of his life here. Adam Driver as well, he suddenly went from Darth Emo to a really scary and unpredictable villain, showing of a wide specter of emotions. And again, this is stuff that should have been shown already in TFA!So when it comes to acting, TFA and TLJ are miles apart.The story:
The story is better in TLJ, by far. But far from perfect, the story itself from where it starts to where it ends up is full of surprises and memorable moments, but it also has a lot of scenes i felt had no place in the film, scenes that either could have been filmed differently, or scrapped all together. Because the film starts off so well, but about 30 minutes in, the story starts to drift, and the suspense and the natural flow get interrupted, which the movie then will suffer for, all the way through.There are times where the story manage to get back on it's feet, but it can't fully recover. Yet still, it has a strong story at it's core, and i must congratulate the staff for bringing the Star Wars universe in this direction, this is new territory and interesting. Or to say it like this, TLJ is something new, TFA was a remake.There are lots of humor in the film, and done more clever than in any Star Wars film before it. This director has a fresh take on Star Wars, and i'm glad Disney trusted in him, Star Wars IMO was in real trouble after TFA, some of it was ""fixed"" with ""Rogue One"" but it was this film that had to really nail it, prove that Star Wars still can deliver, and it almost does, so close.The music is also better than in TFA, John Williams seem to have been more inspired this time around, and has made a score that sounds like the old films, but it also feels new. The effects in the film isn't even worth talking about, it's absolutely amazing of course. And the cinematography is also really good.What dragged the film down a bit for me, was the way the story was told. It became quite boring at times, but for the most part this movie is awesome to watch, with lots of variation in the scenes. It is worth a look. but don't expect a new ""Empire Strikes Back"", we might never see that again I'm afraid. But i do love watching them try.7/10 - Good",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: The Last Hope,"Disney, You should be proud of Yourself - this blatant, mindless and disgusting flick of Yours led me to write my first IMDB review and receive 1/10 rating.You've done the impossible: You've almost killed a very lucrative franchise, with loyal fanbase, with developed Universe, with likable characters that were shining during last 30 years.You know, I've thought that Episodes I-II were just childish, poorly written and bad. Jar Jar Binks, silly racing scenes just for arcade games, all of that. But with Episode 8 You've showed us:We do not care about SW legacy (despite what our PR guys are telling You). All we want is money. We will put undeveloped screenplay to production, even with plot holes at size of the Death Star.We were unable to produce new likable characters the viewer can be linked to and accept them as a new ""trinity"". We will not do character development - only scream and tears on forced drama moments. Grown-ups will act as children during a school show. Damn, we will even fail with R2-D2 and C-3PO moments.We will badly utilize beloved characters and sentence them to the very stupid deaths because we do no know, how to use them properly.Yes, looks like ""Rogue One"" was exception, not the rule.Yes, we will hint You with the main villain during Episode 7, but do not think about some backstory - You will receive none.We will insert shirtless scene just because we can. Why not?We will buy critics or force them to public ""excellent"" reviews.Even visuals and space battles are not so enjoyable anymore. Bombers with bombs a-la World War II? Seriously? X-Wing vs Dreadnought? Sometimes enough stupidity is enough.

A refreshing take on a series that can be guilty of repeating itself.,"In 1981 a Star Wars magazine stopped publishing issues because they couldn't get behind The Empire Strikes Back, they said it fractured the fan base and ruined Star wars.Sound familiar?The difference between The Empire Strikes Back and The Last Jedi, there was no Internet in the 1980's for disgruntled individuals to shake their fists at the clouds (so to speak)Do yourself better, give the film a chance and watch it and judge it on its meritsFor my two cents it's a well made enjoyable film that brings life to a series that can as said above repeat itself.For Star Wars to prosper it needs more films like this.A very enjoyable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Something new that got destroyed by toxic fans,"I reccently watched the movie again after 3 years and I have to say that I was really impressed. I had forgotten how good a movie was. Yes, it totally had flaws but was good. So let's go:Pros:
The most beautiful Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Amazing visuals
Luke's character was more dark and it showed us a more human side of him. I really liked it and how he understood his mistakes in the end and went out with a bang
Probably the sequel with the best soundtrack. The music is amazing
Yoda being funny but wise at the same time. I LOVE IT

If they had continued with this story instead(read Duel OF The Fates script. The sequel trilogy could have been at least good).

Best Star Wars since ESB,"Let me start off by saying that I am one of the countless people for whom Star Wars was their childhood. ESB wins by a landslide as my favorite movie ever. After the most recent reboot, this movie was truly going to be make or break for me. If it took a page from TFA and just gave us a slightly more modern telling of ESB I would have lost faith in the franchise. I would have lost faith that they actually care about the fan base and want to make movies for us and not just to line their pockets. However, this movie truly struck a chord. Was it a perfect movie? Of course not. Did it do something incredibly brave and original that not only hasn't been done in Star Wars, but in cinema in general? Absolutely. This movie has everything, the epic space battles, incredibly choreographed fighting, quotable lines, and scenes that make you want to stand and cheer. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan this movie will have something that appeals to you. And if you are a Star Wars fan then I think you're in for quite a treat. Now, to address the people giving this 1/10 for some inane reason. I keep hearing things like ""This was out of character for Luke"" and ""It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie."" To address the first complaint, all I have to say is, it's called character development, look it up. To address the latter, I say be more open-minded. No this isn't a movie that fits perfectly into the confines of what the previous films have created. But that's a good thing. What Star Wars is at its core, is a risky movie that challenges the norms. 30 years ago when ANH came out, nothing like that had been done. It rewrote what it means to be a good film. Some years later, ESB challenged what we thought a sequel could be. And now, TLJ yet again takes Star Wars to a bold and interesting place. Because of that, it is the truest Star Wars we have gotten in almost thirty years and holds up to the originals. If you don't go see this movie, as a fan or non-fan alike, you are greatly missing out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Deeply, awfully bad","Even more of a legacy-killer than The Phantom Menace. It set JJ Abrams up with the impossible task of making The Rise of Skywalker a memorable, enduring film. So many engaging narratives that were presented in the Force Awakens were tossed aside like garbage. So many amazing possibilities for ushering in a new era for Stars Wars dissipated after day one of this film's release. The business interests in charge of the Stars Wars franchise took a risk in making a non-cannon film that veered from existing storylines and stomped on character legacies, and it did not pay off. This maligned film nearly killed Star Wars as a cultural phenomenon. If not for the Disney offshoots, like the Mandalorian and Andor, Star Wars would be nothing more than a 20th Century memory that people used to love.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Different For The Sake Of Being Different,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a cinematic event unlike anything. The buzz it created from the moment its first teaser went live resulted in a blockbuster release that shattered many box-office records during its theatrical run and gave the fans & newcomers their money's worth of big-budget extravaganza. It was also the first Star Wars film that I actually enjoyed watching.The onus was now on Rian Johnson who was entrusted with the next episode in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. There's no denying that the middle chapter is always the hardest but where many detractors complained that The Force Awakens didn't do anything different from the norm, what Johnson does here is only gonna make them wish they could take it all back.Set in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi) follows two simultaneously unfolding storylines. One concerns Rey who has finally found Luke Skywalker who helps her develop her newly discovered abilities. The other segment follows The First Order that has the Resistance on its last legs.Written & directed by Rian Johnson (best known for Looper), The Last Jedi deviates a tad too far from the course in its attempt to do something different. Full of pacing & tonal issues, Episode VIII is a convoluted mess from start to finish but what sucks about it is that most of its shortcomings were easily rectifiable, all it needed was more refined script & tighter editing.Another issue is that it fails to integrate new characters into its universe. Add to that, there is an entire subplot that it could have done without. The humour is jarring & falls flat most times. There is no consistency between its flow of events. And some decisions make no sense whatsoever. There is nothing wrong in taking a different route as long as it all adds up and in this film's case, it doesn't.Coming to the acting department, the best performance comes from Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker better than he ever did before. Daisy Ridley builds on her last act to deliver another strong performance as Rey, Adam Driver embraces the dark side as Kylo Ren, and the chemistry between him & Rey carries a spark. Amongst the new additions, Kelly Marie Tran as Rose is absolutely cringeworthy.On an overall scale, Star Wars: The Last Jedi fails to make the most of the strong foundation that was provided to it by The Force Awakens, and is a disappointing episode that suffers from Rian Johnson's unfocused direction & unrefined script. Somewhere within this film lies a highly gripping & endlessly riveting adventure fantasy that would've satisfied most. Biting off more than it can chew, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is different for the sake of being different.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As Daring as it is Divisive,"There's a stark imbalance of tone and pace that can make it difficult to reconcile Jedi's light-hearted and action packed moments with those slower and more reserved, and make the film's second act feel as low on fuel as the Resistance fleet. At times more concerned with exploring the moralities of heroism, the consequences often unseen behind them and the grey areas between the Light Side and the Dark, it also embraces the explosive spectacle that made this franchise great; delivering some of the best action and most phenomenal cinematography Star Wars has ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Didnt fulfill its destiny, also better than tfa imo but yep","I was disappointed with The Force Awakens and I didn't have too much hype around The Last Jedi, but obviously I was still going to watch it and with all the great reviews I was excited.Going to begin with the negative. Right from start of the movie it had an awful joke about your mother and from here I had a bad feeling about it. These moments alone separate this film from the original trilogy because the original trilogy had funny moments too but they werent forced and were funny because of the great characters. Jokes were awful, like Marvel joke type awful.Speaking of characters, I was never a fan of Finn and just found him irrelevant. I still wasnt interested in Finn this movie and also his new friend or love interest (what the hell were they thinking) Rose. Honestly I hated them and they had a whole arc in the middle of the film which did not do anything for the plot. Basically it promoted that animal cruelty is wrong but Jesus they didnt have to take around 30 minutes, could have been 10 minutes max. They shouldnt have had that whole Finn and Rose arc in the first place. Snoke and Phasma were awful too.Those are the 2 big things which annoyed me but this movie did have some really cool bits.wouldnt say I hated the plot but I have mixed feelings around it, it was actually pretty weird, almost stupid but this did give us some cool stuff.Something else which I found weird was the force, youll understand when you see it, its pretty, coooooll i guess, not really, i dunno.Luke and Leia were great. There was a cameo of an old character which was awesome. Rey and Kylo were also great and had some good development. Theres a pretty cool lightsaber fight somewhere in there, near the end or the middle.
I was pretty disappointed in the ending but cant spoil.In summary:
Just didn't feel like the star wars i love honestly
Dont care about finn
Wish rose died
Luke, leia, kylo and rey were pretty good
Force is weird
Plot is also weird, there was a twist which I didn't expect but its not like I was amazed by it because it didn't do anything to help the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Heroes inspire others to be greater. I think that is what ""The Last Jedi"" does best.","Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile, the Resistance prepares for battle with the First Order.I will admit I am wired with a with the sense of melancholy sensibilities. I lost track of how many times i wiped a tear while watching Rian Johnson's film. But I'm sure I also laughed hard just as many times, if not more. It is in general mind-blowing, it is emotional and it is filled with surprises. The Last Jedi really manages to keep the Star Wars spirit while being innovative on many fronts. Nothing can prepare you for the emotional ride it takes you on. It's a truly epic journey.Star Wars: Episode VIII had some amazing set pieces. Wonderful cinematography and special effects. the 3D presentation added to the film. The fabulous film score from the greatest film composers of all time, John Williams as splendid.The acting from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are sublime. Tapping into my sense of nostalgia for Star Wars Saga. Daisy Ridley as Rey tremendous. Johnson eloquently deepens his characters in the story long, long ago in the galaxy far, far away. Adam Driver is welcome strength returning as the Dark Side Force's Kylo Ren. The other narrative threads are often perfunctory in the subplot with Resistance fighters Finn, played by solid John Boyega, Poe Dameron, played by intrepid Oscar Isaac, and Rose, played by stellar newcomer Kelly Marie Tran. And how does't like Benicio Del Toro ? Fantastic !The Last Jedi is clever, well-tailored and genuine. Heroes and villains, and those who are somewhere in between. Rian Johnson created a beautiful tale a filmed it with stylistic brilliance and terrific pacing. From the excellent cinematography, snappy dialogues and first rate music, The Last Jedi makes you feel overwhelmed and fills you with odd admiration for the story that is being conveyed. 9/10Director: Rian Johnson

"oh dear, where do I begin?","This cinematic catastrophe, masquerading as a continuation of the beloved Star Wars saga, is an utter disgrace to the franchise and a desecration of everything that once made it great. Director Rian Johnson's feeble attempt to leave his mark on this illustrious universe falls short in every conceivable way, leaving fans and cinephiles alike bewildered and dismayed.From the very outset, it becomes apparent that The Last Jedi lacks any coherent vision or respect for the source material. Johnson takes delight in tearing down the established mythology, tossing aside the profound themes and intricate character arcs that have captivated audiences for decades. Instead, we are subjected to a hodgepodge of convoluted plotlines and laughable attempts at subversion, all executed with a lack of finesse and intelligence that is truly astonishing.Gone are the iconic heroes we once held dear, replaced by hollow caricatures of their former selves. Mark Hamill's portrayal of Luke Skywalker, a character etched into the annals of cinematic history, is reduced to a moping hermit devoid of purpose or conviction. The essence of Luke's struggle and growth, painstakingly developed over multiple films, is discarded in favor of a disillusioned old man who resorts to throwing tantrums like a petulant child. It is a disservice to Hamill's talent and an insult to the audience's intelligence.Furthermore, the new characters introduced in The Last Jedi are equally unimpressive. Rey, portrayed by Daisy Ridley, continues to be a one-dimensional Mary Sue, effortlessly mastering the Force without any training or struggle. The potential for compelling storytelling is squandered, replaced by a tedious parade of nonsensical twists and contrived romantic entanglements. The script is riddled with cringe-inducing attempts at humor, which only serve to further undermine any semblance of seriousness or gravitas.Visually, the film offers little respite from its narrative failings. The action sequences lack the grandeur and precision that once defined the franchise, devolving into a cacophony of meaningless explosions and flashy yet empty spectacle. The once awe-inspiring space battles are reduced to uninspired video game sequences, bereft of any emotional weight or strategic depth. Even the iconic lightsaber duels, once choreographed with elegance and purpose, now feel like nothing more than a choreographed mess of flashy acrobatics.It is clear that The Last Jedi suffers from a severe lack of creative vision, guided by a director who either misunderstands or deliberately disregards the essence of the Star Wars saga. The film's attempts at subversion and reinvention fall flat, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessors. Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is an abomination, an insult to the intelligence of its audience, and a dark stain on the once-shining galaxy far, far away.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
POINTLESS,"Was expecting an excellent and fully fleshed character development and history of the Snoke, Kylo Ren, Rey and the Knights of Ren, but alas none of these burning questions were answered - imagine the plot that could have been. instead, i got 2.5 hours of a cat and mouse chase of the rebellion and the first order. one word describes this movie - POINTLESS.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is Star Wars!,"Everything you are looking for in a Star Wars movie! A must see on a large screen with a great sound system. The directing and cinematography was amazing! What a great end for the new and old characters of the saga. It was such a joy seeing my young son on the edge of his seat with a huge smile on his face as he was watching this movie. Until we back to my childhood to when I fell in love with this franchise. This movie left me wanting more and the sad part is, we have no clue how long it will be until we get another big budget Star Wars movie on the big screen again.

"Much more emotional and comical than it appears, ""The Last Jedi"" is an unusual follow-up in deified Star Wars canon","The most successful, celebrated and cherished franchise of all time is already here brimming with brand new, groundbreaking and laudable proposals, stamped in the story by a potential filmmaker who has achieved the impossible: get the endorsement of Lucasfilm about to conceive another radically different trilogy, with characters, scenarios, approaches and themes never seen before; he calls himself as Rian Johnson and is here to stay.""The Last Jedi"" is titled the latest entry in this huge galaxy. Dynamited controversy arose at the time when it was announced officially and publicly the name of this episode, causing hundreds of suspicions and therefore theories that connected and disconnected hypothesis about whether a possibility would be provided to find more than one Jedi in the tale. Did they allude Luke Skywalker as the last one? End the Jedi? Who are Rey's parents? What has the real reason Kylo Ren murdered his father? Is this movie featuring a new lightsaber color? Will Finn and Poe have a more personal relationship? Thousands and thousands of attractive questions came up on the web daily, Internet-using fans who theorized about the possible course of the second part, in which most of their questions have been solved.Again, we return with Poe Damen as a daring pilot on a suicide mission, undaunted and over-confident along his army with the goal etched in his head: Fade the Dark Side. The first good thing to come to light about this character is that, with respect to the seventh installment, we have the pleasure of witnessing an Oscar Isaac more mature, just as fearless and less superficial, partly thanks to the increase of his time on screen; Resistance well-liked pilot gets the treatment he deserves for honor, although he remains a grateful time inside his spaceship struggling, he has the opportunity to guide the crew momentarily; likewise, Guatemalan actor's performance is human, charismatic and certainly charming. The second narrative arc corresponds to Finn and a brave new rebel played by Kelly Marie Tran. The duo embarks on an epic adventure almost like a buddy movie, fulfilling their function of fighting face to face with the aberrant amount of ships and enemies that stand in the way of the Light Side. It's important to underline the romantic impact that the couple gives, an interesting and fresh play that benefits from the good feeling that each actor permeates their characters. To close the narrative trio and, clearly, no less fundamental, is Rey, exactly in the same place where the previous flick ended. She is there to receive a formal training in order to, in one way or another, be enlighten by mighty Skywalker's force, as well as gets answers and holds the last Jedi's purpose high and proud: Start a new, focused and well-directed revolution. At this point, writer-actor Mark Hamill's character has more weight, teaching Rey the true meaning of the force through directives, keys, and advices that will turn her into the last great hope, one to which the future clings fearfully. Luke's living arrangements and reasons for the choice of hiding in such off-the-radar island are emotionally diffused, also, much of the conflict originated between the light and the dark side is clarified, allowing the introduction of old acquaintances with the aim of breaking down, once and for all, this war in the galaxies, we all know the ending. Although the first and much of the second act Rey shares the screen with Mr. Skywalker most times, there is a portentous narrative technique that connects her, in a very original spiritual way, with Kylo Ren. This pessimistic-thought, morally ambiguous and dictator boy shows an openly unaccustomed human perspective, it's perceptible in his eyes of neglect, loss and sorrow, Ren is stuck in a grey world, his actions are not fully dominated by wickedness and rancor toward Skywalker, in the same way, with the help of we witnessed, he exhibits an inevitable connection with the Light Side that leads him to strike up a certain relationship with Rey, he doesn't know what to do, doesn't know what to defend, however, over time, his heart is in cold, vileness and hatred, while his soul tries to emancipate, be honest and repent, his brain and heart are in full discompassing.Watching Princess Leia Organa on screen for the very last time breaks everyone's heart, with every scene running something inside of me was really happy, but at the same time, something inside me was deeply sad to feel like I was saying goodbye to a loved one. The narrative arc of the princess is still based on women's empowerment, a peaceful warrior woman, in the heart and kindness of an unfading lady. I consider modern audiences will remember her by this last performance, full of hope, power and strength. It should be mentioned that although she's simply perfect within the story, this is not fully closed, IE everything looks as if she was going to be at the close of the trilogy, an alarming signal because Disney confirmed not resort to CGI to bring her back, then what will they be doing?As an advice or a warning, there is a great surprise factor - of the many - that will replace the death of Solo in the previous installment, IE, this flick keeps shocking cardinal events for the course of the story that will leave you on the edge of your seats, with an analogue or more powerful impact that this one of Ren hurting his father's torso with a vengeful lightsaber. What is this obsession Mr. Vader has for killing characters with lightsabers?Regarding the new adds in terms of characters, three roles are those that stand out in importance and presence. The first one is the aforementioned Rose Tico, a three-dimensional maintenance worker introduced in a key point and although it presents absolutely nothing of her past, she stars one of the most poignant and deeply romantic scenes of the franchise. The second one concerns Golden-Globe-nominated Laura Dern, who, thanks to Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, must be placed at the forefront of the Resistance. Her tenacity and courage make this woman a fundamental character for the progress of the story, while on the way delivers a sophisticated, determined and as always superb Dern. Finally and personally the most unexpected participation is Puerto Rican Benicio del Toro's performance. Surrounded by complete secrecy and theories, DJ, the character played by ""Sicario"" actor, is a kind of intergalactic mercenary, corrupt moral, an expert in deciphering ultra-confidential codes. Currently, one of the most potential roles for following installments.Technically, just wide-open eyes. The creative journeys the film proposes are irrefutably evocative, captivating and professionally realistic, enabling a thorough immersion in the voyage. Cinematography doesn't go far from its predecessor, however, it's important the radical change that gives Steve Yedlin for the pictures; Camera angles and movements (characteristic of the films) harmonize different technical components of the film, making a drastic improvement at the cinematographic level, the movements are more intimate and personal, there are a greater presence of close-ups, fast and dynamic movements in the battles and dolly variations or precise approaches in situations where more than two characters are on screen. The costumes keep the trend and the gigantic art team does a neatly magnificent job. It's known that this department designed a catastrophic amount of new creatures, many of which were left out of the movie, however, the few strange-animals seen are peculiar, original, unpleasant and engaging. A film of universal importance in cinema world cannot afford to insinuate the presence of green screen in the pictures, perhaps it's due to my congestion of knowledge a little more advanced in this type of features, maybe yes, however, there were whole sequences where I could only focus my attention on the dissonance between actors and background scenarios, I saw the green or blue screen, not literally, the contrast, in my view, is perceptible, nothing serious, but very detectable.John Williams, the always perfect John Williams. Master in compositions of sound masterpieces, the score manufactured for this film is, without hesitation, one of the most melodic, portentous and powerful of the entire franchise. Staying on traditional strings, the composer manages to beautify each scene with his traditional symphonies, melodies that are masterfully joined with the advance of the story. Ineffably, I had an inexplicable connection with the soundtrack of this feature film, it was something wonderful to listen again the emblematic anthem of the saga at the beginning, that made my heart stop, an act that would be repeated a couple of times later. Bravo, Maestro.Rian Johnson's ""The Last Jedi"" leads the spectator placidly into a legendary voyage of lies, revelations, and transformations motivated by an unexpected comical touch, an important social message, first-class performances and an unforgettable score, sadly, the script doesn't end up being perfect and although it manages to resolve many of the unknowns of the previous installment, doesn't propose others as a substitute, any of them is sufficiently suggestive to keep in suspense the devout fanatics during two years before the arrival of the last movie. With unaccustomed twists in the genre, risky but well-received decisions, Johnson makes his official letter of presentation to the galactic universe, one in view of knowing the new trilogy that is in the hands of the promising filmmaker. Without fear of being wrong, the director will get great things for ""Star Wars"" future, for now, has created and delivered a great Christmas gift: magnificent action sequences, moving performances and a more acute and intimate analysis of the already legendary characters: We love Rey, Finn and Poe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't Believe the Haters,"I cannot for the life of me figure out the negativism in so many reviews out there. I'm a 40 year SW fan and know the good movies from the bad. I swear there must be a Russia-backed fake social-media campaign going on here. If critic and rotten tomatoes scores are high... it can't be a one star movie. If you have criticisms, that's fine, please register a rational 3 or 5 (out of 10), not a childish 1-star. IMHO, This is a good SW movie. Extremely good in fact. That doesn't mean it's without flaws, and I'm sorry if you felt it violated esoteric elements of Star Wars cannon, but get over it. Compared to the Force Awakens, this was absolutely fantastic, especially in that it did new things vs. making a hash out of old themes. Things moved forward. Characters were developed, new locations were seen, old characters gave strong performances (Mark Hamill has learned to act!). Weak or has-been characters were removed. (yes sorry at some point everyone in the original trilogy has to die!) Sorry. Don't be a baby about it. The script is well thought out. The dialog flows and is witty. We learn new things and they improve some old things. Yes there are a few cheap plot devices but please realize they existed in the old movies as well. I and my whole family (age range from 17 to 51) enjoyed it immensely so, don't believe the haters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Man haters hating their fans,"Every male in this movie is a loser. There is obvious intention to shame and humiliate males and lift up females. Rey is okay, but not very likable. She has very limited emotions and mainly anger. They destroyed Luke's legacy by making hin a raving angry, lunatic, hermit, who gave up and hates everyone. Poe is their image of toxic masculinity. His bold efforts ultimately failed, because the man haters want males to fail. Holdo is an amazingly arrogant, pompous leader. Extremely unlikeable. Demonstrated no fear when fear was absolutely necessary theatrical performance under the imminent death she faced. The action scene where the Dreadnought Fulminatrix chased the Raddus's was cringe. Slowest starship battle ever. Boring. The battle was like watching a slow drip from the kitchen sink faucet. How did the Raddus's shields withstood so many blaster strikes? Boring. The original films were successful because everything in those movies was awesome, including likable, charismatic characters that had realistic, dynamic human emotion.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Brilliant, stunning, awesome!","What can I say? I was totally satisfied with the movie. It was exciting to see everything throughout the movie. From the start of first 15 minutes it already was very intense. Apart from some slower pace drama combined with brief action here and there, the rest of the movie was totally awesome. From the middle till the end, it was almost constantly full of action, but not the kind that was making you strapped to your seat, but more like a ""cannot wait to see the next thing that would happen"" kind of actions.Despite not having a jaw dropping surprising twist like in Star Wars: Force Awakens this movie still has some surprises. And that climax? OMG, that was one of the best climax I have ever seen in a movie. Definitely worth the wait. My most favorite thing about this one was the fact that the movie was quite loyal to the original Star Wars movies. In fact I felt there were some similarities with The Empire Strikes Back, especially with the appearance of a surprise character.This time, I got to say that I like the new characters of this trilogy. I love the characters of Finn, Rey, Poe and I loved the new droid BB8 whom I think was very refreshing. I even like/hate Kylo Ren's character. Oh and the new characters in this episode, i.e Rose and Vice Admiral Holdo were remarkable.The special effects by Industrial Light Magic as usual never failed. Those space war scenes and the final scenes were amazing. However, I am a bit disappointed with the creatures effects. I do not know why but those cute creatures in that island seemed unreal and looked really robotic and some of the aliens species did not seemed believable which was quite a let down from the previous Star Wars movies. The musical effect was done nicely and really felt they were made for this movie. The sound effects were good but oddly not spectacular. There were some funny moments that would make us laugh and there were few touching moments before the end.
There was no end credit scene to this movie just like in all other Star Wars movie. It did give you the nostalgic feeling of listening to that special Star Wars music. And there was a brief lovely tribute to the late Carrie Fisher (some of the audience also clapped their hands when they saw this part).Overall, I personally felt that this Star Wars movie was awesome. Though not the most perfect movie, but it is certainly up there. And I really really REALLY cannot wait to see the final episode of this trilogy. I truly recommend all of you who love Star Wars to see this one in the theater as soon as you can.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Why all of the hate?,"I saw TLJ on its opening night, and no one I spoke to afterwards had anything bad to say about the movie, at least not anything about the product as a whole which would lower their initial review beneath 8/10 stars. So, I was very surprised to wake up this morning and read not only in my local newspaper, but across various social media, that the movie was not well received by so many fans. As such, and to defend this very enjoyable movie, I felt the need to write a review for it.In the interest of keeping this spoiler free, I will be as broad as I can with what I liked and did not like. The best thing about this movie is the cast. The acting is enjoyable throughout, and seeing how characters interact with each other in new ways is very thought provoking. The comedy lands well for the most part, some jokes feeling a little different than what we've seen in Star Wars before, but given the attitudes of these new characters I still felt it was fitting.Now, for the plot - I loved it! They introduce some things that will make fans of the series squeal, and leave enough ambiguity in character decisions to make it unclear in which direction our characters may go. It is mysterious, it is fun, it adds to the lore, and it takes risks where it needs to.As for why I gave this 9 stars...honestly, I would have given it 8.5 if I could have, but I rounded up in order to combat the negative reviews I have been seeing. My gripes are not enough to say that this is a bad movie, not even close. But they do exist. The focus of the movie was very biased towards Rey and Kylo. I loved their story in this, it is so fantastic, but other characters suffer from this because I am just not invested in any story that is not revolving around Rey and/or Kylo in some way. Finn and Poe have their moments, and they are still fun and important, but they felt much more like a side story. Also, I felt that there was a scene with Leia really early on that was just weird (you'll know what I mean). I also felt like the ending could have had a slightly bigger finish. And these things did take away from the movie for me, thus not a full 10/10 stars. But it was still fantastic and fun, and definitely is worth watching. Overall I did love it, and I fully recommend it to everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie gave me the Star Wars feeling I hadn't felt since the original trilogy,"Is the Last Jedi perfect? No, it's not. And if you're interested in dissecting it completely with the sole purpose of finding things ""wrong"" with it, while sipping from your glass of vinegar, you'll probably end up with a decent list by the time the credits roll.There's at least one very cringeworthy joke. There are some dumb decisions being made solely to be able to advance the plot. You'll see some underused characters, unneeded character interactions, silly science, and more.But who cares? It's not like even the original Star Wars movies didn't have their own lists of glaring issues. What's left is a movie that's entertaining from start to finish and has everything you'd want from Star Wars; battles in space and on the ground, interesting and exotic locations, a good story.Visually it looks stunning and the musical score is amazing (much better than in The Force Awakens). Acting across the board is good.I was never bored. The movie made me feel like I was part of a journey and that made it very easy to overlook the things I didn't like.

And has so many flaws I cannot possibly list them all.They managed to gut just about everything that made the original trilogy great, more interested in adding whatever they can merchandise, instead of a coherent movie.They dole out force powers like it is candy, the once so mysterious force is everywhere it seems, no longer a hardwon ability that you need to work for. Last Jedi? Heck,everyones a Jedi! Ok, I exaggerate but the feeling is there.Age and wisdom is non existent concepts, and supposedly powerful characters die from the equivalent of slipping on a banana.Sheer marketing is going to make a lot of people see this, and I have no doubt it will be a box office hit.

"Enjoyable Film, A bit long but Hamill nailed it.","In the ever intense world of Star Wars junkies and mere film fans the new Star Wars films sans Lucas are a lightning rod of negativity and second guessing. I liked Force Awakens, but Last Jedi easily blew that out of the water. Is it an amazing film? No, and it did not need to be but it is well written, acted (well outside of Rey and a newbie character) and actually has a designed plot. Were there twists? Yes. Were some predictable? Yes. The answer is did they pull them off? For me, they did, for others, evidently not. The main problem with the film is the middle of the film seems to drag a bit, although it does because it sets up the final act. I loved Luke's necessary presence in the film, the unexpected humor and the script as a whole. Hamill who overall always seemed the weakest actor in the past (despite still being effective) truly here nailed it in my opinion, and where the film may have lacked at times, his presence lifted it high above when they needed that heavy lifting. The latter surprised me to be honest but I thought despite some plot points and pacing that were a bit much, thrown in with a new over the top, annoying character the film was easily the best since Return of the Jedi. Of course, the trolls and die hards will vehemently no doubt disagree, but that is their right.

Thoughtfully humane and visually epic.,"Rather underwhelming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens. None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage, Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connection, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren, etc. The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same. In fact, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones. Still, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic. And the special effects are especially well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs. While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie declaration of bankruptcy to the Star Wars world,"...but certainly not bankruptcy for Disney, seeing how they treat Star Wars only as a cash cow. 
I had big hopes for Star Wars when Disney had announced this triology including the participation of the reccuring cast. Similar to the Force Awakens, the story in Last Jedi is disappointing and weak (to be fair, compared to Force Awakens a bit less weak, due to some unexpected story-twists), the new characters are still not interesting but rather onedimensional and the old characters are used in a very unsatisfying way. There are many elements in these movies, which don't feel they belong in the Star Wars universe - including all those modern, misplaced jokes - which might fit in well with Marvel-movies.In my opinion this movie wasn't written by people who really care or know a lot about Star Wars, but solely by the influence of producers, sponsors, marketers and political ideologies. As a teenager I read many of the well written Star Wars novels, which had fantastic stories and use of Star Wars worlds and figures - it's a pity that none of this creativity made it into these Disney movies.At least Disney gave us Gareth Edwards' Rogue One. Albeit its shallow story, it was a movie which looked and felt like Star Wars. Thanks for that.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It's easy to see that he's approached this gigantic project with love, respect, wit, a healthy dose of irreverence and then through it all that oh-so-tickling question: ""What if...?"" that can open so many unexpected doors. And the result is brilliant.Like the last time around, this movie is recycling some familiar elements from the original three. But, unlike the last time around, this movie takes these and creates not just déjà vu, but something completely new, and then makes it take flight. My problem with The Force Awakens was that it felt more like a computed calculation of how to mix old ingredients in a seemingly new way, but they forgot to throw soul into the equation. The result felt surprisingly hollow. The few emotions it stirred were all linked to nostalgia and familiar characters. The interest it stirred for the newly introduced characters was lukewarm at best, and the new epic conflict stirred none at all.Enter The Last Jedi. And suddenly I'm all wide-eyed wonder. Each time I think I can see what's coming next the proverbial rug gets pulled from under my feet and I come crashing down with all my theories and a thrilling sensation. It's truly a rare treat to watch a story that manages to be so unpredictable at every single turn. Not to mention that it manages to blow your mind several times over. The fingertip scene is my Movie Moment of the Decade - haven't been so mind-blown in ages. And it keeps it up right until the conclusion.Above all, this movie has heart. It makes me care for the people on screen. I find my formerly lukewarm interest for the new characters replaced by fascination. Obviously, character development is easier to achieve when you're already acquainted - but I wasn't quite prepared for this. The dynamics that develop between Rey and Kylo/Ben are among the most intriguing things in the saga yet. And as for Luke, I wholly agree with how Johnson developed his character - it feels logical and right.So, simply put, I fell for this movie - hook, line and sinker. It was everything I hoped it would be, and more. There's this mindboggling moment somewhere in the middle where you realize that absolutely anything can happen. And it's a fantastic feeling when you know that you are in safe hands. And that's exactly what you are with a director like Rian Johnson. All in all, it's a delight.Go see it.

A much Better sequel to THE FORCE AWAKENS.,"Well, the wait is finally over and I must say that this film THE LAST JEDI is a much satisfying sequel to TFA. Director Rian Johnson has taken the Star Wars franchise to a whole new level. Visually Stylish and Very good.
It takes me back when I was 7 years old and my Father took my older sister and I to see A New Hope late 1977. It was a childhood experience that I will never forget. If you are a die Hard SW Fan you will understand this.Now my review, Yes it is a Star Wars Film and I must admit that I was very anxious to the aging Jedi Master Luke Skywalker which was played to the hilt by Mark Hamill. I was feeling sad because this was Carrie Fisher's last performance as Leia Organa. The dialogue and humor was cheesy as with all the SW films as I expected. As for the other actors in the film they were good Especially Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac. The space battle scenes took you to whole new way we watch Sci-Fi Films. Great cinematography. Yet, it is confusing with lots of plots and twists but as I said earlier you must see TFA lots of times. And it raises a few questions and opinions on what's going to take place in Episode XI. So, You must pay attention to this Film. The music is much stronger composed by John Williams. Again, Yes it is long but it is worth it. I know before seeing this film there are critics and Fans already Bashing and tearing it. Lastly, Yes, the film does parallel to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. I liked THE LAST JEDI and I'm looking forward to Episode XI. So, my rating is 8.5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Worst Star Wars movie ever,"I just watched the TLJ blu ray last night. I've read many spoiler-free reviews from IMDB so my expectation was quite low. Gee, they were damn right! Today I spent another two and half hours to read more lengthy negative reviews and this is a far more satisfying than the movie itself! I won't repeat other reviewers' well-thought points. Just add a few lines that I really want to spill out:I am Chinese and I enjoyed the presence of Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen in Rogue One (a far better movie by the way). But in here the Rose character is totally unnecessary and the story arc involving with Finn and her is pointless at best. My feeling is that she was simply put there to satisfy the inner SJWs of the film makers.As a long time Star Wars fan (you can tell that from my alias), this is by far the worst Star Wars movie to-date.

Get along with the idea that this is a good movie!,"I really don't understand how some people dislike this movie. The only weaknesses I can think about are the characterisation of Finn, who is actually a useless character in this movie and the movie's length (the picture could last 20 minutes earlier).Guys, how can you complain about the screenplay? This is the the only Star Wars movie, after The Return Of The Jedi, which explains perfectly what the force is. In addition, the story is finally original and, like in Rogue One, we get the idea of real Star Wars. Freaking wars! What did you expect? Movies like The Revenge of The Sith? Some of you cherish George Lucas' films so much but you don't understand that those movies contained more plot holes then the most recent ones.
The cinematography surely takes us back to the first trilogy, why don't you say anything regarding that?
The themes that the movie develops (different themes from the usual ones of the previous trilogies) make sense and are explained correctly, also thanks to the role of certain characters in the picture.
Are you guys upset because Johnson tried to be a different director from Abrams and Lucas? Are you upset because he invented a story which is more complex than the simple ones you were used to?

"Too many bad reviews from people who didn't get ""their"" SW movie","A lot of people seem to be over reacting to TLJ , focusing much on what wasn't in the movie, rather than what was in it. Furthermore, many are complaining about the plot, and how ""poor"" it is - they are confusing plot with story. There is a story here, and characters arcs, and surprises. But as Luke says , it's (probably) not going to go the way you think.Many pre-release reviews pointed this out - a new direction, unlike any SW movie you have seen before etc etc. Yet many user review seem to be harking back to the SW universe as it was 35-40 years ago.Characters, like real people, change. This is what makes them believable. I had no problem with Luke in the movie. In fact, I think the next time I watch the originals, I will probably appreciate his arc even more.Did I get to see Luke do what I really , REALLY wanted him to do? No - but hey, that's MY movie, not the one they made.Does this make TLJ bad? No - just because I didn't get to see everything I wanted to see (and admittedly , there are some things I wish I didn't see in this movie) doesn't make it a 2/10 or a 3/10 or whatever. Some of these reviews just sound angry because it's not what they thought they would get. The are some great moments here, as well as some truly great cinematography, acting and production design.I'm looking forward to seeing it again on the big screen, because I'm sure there are more details I missed.Go in with an open mind, appreciate it for what it is, give it a couple of days and see how you feel about it then.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A Complete Mess: Bad pacing, script, direction, and jokes.","I can only imagine that Disney assembled a team of bean counters who had to okay the dailies for this movie. Otherwise, I don't know how you realistically end up with such an uninspired disaster.It feels like the only guiding principles were: 1) Don't repeat the mistakes of The Force Awakens and 2) Create merchandise tie ins for every possible demographic on Earth.The pacing in the movie is horrible, the scenes move abruptly from location to location with no rhyme or reason other than it has to. There is way too much forced humour, to the point it is jarring and removes you from the very brief moments in which anything resembling tension (or a real movie) was starting to emerge.The writing was something you'd expect out of a video game or something. Third rate game studio RPGs have more compelling stories/writing.I'd agree with the other reviews in that Rian Johnson made JJ's TFA look like a masterpiece in comparison. JJ's TFA was completely devoid of originality and played it safe, but at least it was executed very well.The Last Jedi just feels like it was put together in the editing room 15 minutes at time with no overall vision or goal other than to set up merchandising for the future.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Second only to The Empire Strikes Back,"What Rian Johnson accomplishes here is nothing short of a rebirth of the Skywalker saga. Like The Empire Strikes Back, Johnson focuses this movie on relationships and character arcs while completely subverting expectations of what Star Wars ""is"".This is what the controversy about this movie rests on.

Until I saw The Last Jedi, I didn't know which kind of fan I was. Apparently, I am the former.Fans would do well to remember that The Empire Strikes Back was also highly controversial when it came out. But over time it has largely come to be viewed as the best Star Wars movie. I think The Last Jedi will fare much the same, since it holds up well to repeated viewings.Regardless of what you think of the writing, The Last Jedi is beautifully shot. The cinematography is stunning and arguably the best of the entire series. Johnson doesn't ignore the aspect of the visual spectacle of Star Wars that we all love to see. He manages to pack in the action while also elevating it. Shots and lighting are meticulously attended to. Care is taken to frequently convey metaphor in visual ways, giving the entire film a deeper meaning.I'm sure it was not Johnson's intent to divide fans over his film. But the problem remains.

I can understand it not being your fav SW film, or being disappointed with the approach to the way that some of the questions we had were answered...but ratings of 1 and 2?!

The graphics/visuals were spot on. The acting was also quality. The film consistently keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it is in no way predictable...which, I would imagine, is a plus. And, for the record, I'm not a newb to SW by any means.Basically every SW film after the initial trilogy had huuuuuge shoes to fill, and it seems that anything that doesn't live up to ESB is a failure in a lot of fan's eyes. I just don't understand that, I guess.A lot of people are apparently furious that Disney is in control now... but hey, Lucas made that decision, too. And he obviously trusted Disney with his creation or he would not have done it.All that being said... go into this movie with an open mind, untainted by personal opinions about Disney, the director, etc...and you will surely enjoy it.

Great special effects but not the good old Star Wars,"These days thanks to technique and special effects you can create and continue what once George Lucas started.

But I consider the movie a disappointment, because of the overreacting characters and everything not being the same anymore since George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012.
I mean you can clearly make the difference that it's not George Lucas's magic hand anymore.
All those old scenes where MAster Yoda was appearing, all those past great landscapes are not the same anymore.
Old landscapes and all the old characters gave to the movie a certain weight and put accent on characters.
Even though the new film has action and great special effects nothing is the same anymore.
All those winter battle scenes from the Battle of Hoth with the AT-AT's are long gone.

 The cast do their best with what they have but the script is terrible, badly paced and has plot holes that you can fly a star destroyer through. The decades of Star Wars history are ignored in favour of lame jokes and muddled mysticism.

"Not bad, not great either","Episode VIII: The Last Jedi ended 2017 on an explosive note, to say the least. While this looked likely to become that year's biggest hit, it also quickly looked set to be the most divisive Star Wars movie in a while.Picking up straight after The Force Awakens, we meet Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she finally hands an exiled Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) his old lightsaber, seeking training as the Resistance continues to fight for survival against the First Order. The main group of characters introduced in the last movie is divided with each one off on their own quest before they meet again at the end. Ridiculously good pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), whose philosophy tends to lean more towards blowing stuff up, finds himself having to consider alternative ways of fighting the enemy while Finn (John Boyega) and newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) attempt to track down a master code breaker.Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) discovers a connection with Rey through the Force as they both appear to struggle with their destiny. Whereas The Force Awakens was a light-hearted introduction to a new generation in the Star Wars universe, with the usual good vs evil themes, The Last Jedi genuinely attempts to push ahead while focusing on the infinitely more complex grey areas in-between.This is a darker film that explores deeper, more abstract themes and it's easy to see why some fans of the franchise might find that jarring when you consider the tone of the previous film in that series. The Last Jedi is closer to Rogue One in that it's much more earnest and fearless in its approach and there's an urgency to it. On the surface, this new film is a bit of a downer as heroes you took for granted show their flaws and reveal their humanity but, even though the conclusion is bittersweet, it leaves you with that optimistic feeling you expect from Star Wars.We see a new side to Luke Skywalker in this movie and, whether you like it or not, it certainly makes an impact. This is Luke at his most defeatist and closed off so seeing the eager-to-learn Rey attempt to thaw some guidance out of him is both fascinating and frustrating. Mark Hamill gives probably his finest performance as Luke Skywalker and makes the most of the role that made him a star. The late Carrie Fisher is finally given a more significant part as Leia Organa and it's a joy to see her play a fuller role once again.Our new heroes also have their fair share of conflicts to revolve: Rey looks for meaning in her past while getting closer to Kylo Ren, Finn struggles to live up to the heroic image his new sidekick Rose has of him and Poe learns a few lessons of his own. There's real character growth here and yet it remains unclear what everything is building up to so the third film in this new trilogy will have a lot of work to do, that's for sure. It's not all serious, grim and deep, however, as the much-feared Porgs are introduced along with countless other minor bizarre alien creatures and, while they serve no purpose, they are about as harmless as it gets.The comedy in this film feels infinitely more organic and cheesy-in-the-right-way than in Force Awakens, where the jokes felt a little too forced. This is also a beautiful-looking movie with thrilling space battles, stunning locations and iconic moments you'll likely never forget. Expect this one to stick with you for a while as a lot of nifty surprises pop up.If The Force Awakens was enjoyable if a tad bare, The Last Jedi is packed with just about everything you want from a Star Wars film and more. The lore is respectfully challenged and, for the first time in a long time, we feel like this universe is finally looking forward, not back.A newest hope.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doesn't deserve the hate.,"Yeah I know, I'm getting controversial with this (again😅), but this is an amazing movie. I used to be a hater. But I had an open mind watching this, pretending as if it is the first time watching The Last Jedi. When you sit down, pay attention and try not to be judgemental, it's a whole different experience. I used to think this movie is a bore. It's so weird how things can change once you actually TRY to watch this film. It's at the point where I don't know why people hate this film. It's Star Wars, it's adventure, emotion and you can learn a lot of life lessons. One reason why I didn't give this a 10:Leia flying. Come on, even if you are a Jedi or strong with the force, nobody can fly through space, let alone survive in space, you would choke, no matter how important of a Jedi you are.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017),"Directed by Rian Johnson. Starring Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher, Kelly Marie Tran, Domhnall Gleeson, Laura Dern, Benicio del Toro, Andy Serkis, Anthony Daniels, Joonas Suotamo, Gwendolyn Christie, Amanda Lawrence, Lupita Nyong'o, Frank Oz. (PG-13)Picking up shortly after the events of ""The Force Awakens,"" the First Order is chasing down General Leia Organa (Fisher) and the Resistance (and fuel is running low) while Rey (Ridley) tries to convince a disgruntled Luke Skywalker (Hamill) to help the cause and train her in the ways of the Jedi. If Episode 7 played it safe, this one chooses to be bold and daring, its successes more magnificent (the best cinematic presentation yet of the fractious pull between the light and dark sides, a conflicted Luke struggling to bear the weight of his doubts and miscalculations, etc.) and its failures more galling (a few rather glaring plot holes, Leia's ""Mary Poppins in Space"" charade, etc.). A magnificent visual presentation, filled with kinetic action scenes and eye-catching photography, well-acted and driven by audacious ideas about razing the past to move forward and sparking hope through ultimate means. The final scene, however--far from the actions of the main characters--miffs its dramatic potential. Fisher passed away mid-production; the film is dedicated to her ""in loving memory of our princess.""78/100",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Partially a disappointing plot, but this is quelled by the many, many different things that happen in this movie.","After the large disappointment The Force Awakens was, I was expecting more of the same rubbish from Disney, but I'm glad this isn't the case in this movie.If you come into this movie expecting it to be a carbon copy of the Empire Strikes Back, then I'm glad to dismiss this idea. I could only find two similarities, out of hundreds of conversing themes.There were many gobsmacking moments which left me astounded, and if you haven't watched the movie so far, I'm sure you will be left equally dismayed as I was.My main disappointment with the movie, despite its many successes, is the pacing throughout a large chunk of it. The movie attempts to avoid this disappointment by creating events which were unexpected; attempting to literally 'shock' the audience back into gear - effectively veiling the audience from a plot hole which is too big for me, at least, to leave unnoticed.If the central plot made more sense, this movie would easily be a 9.5 for me.The central theme throughout this movie showcases the conflict of which the force has between the main characters. A lot of redeeming things occur in this movie based on this idea and that's why I admire it so much.Having Luke Skywalker play a large role in this movie was a huge positive for me; Mark Hamill's performance, overall, was incredible.Daisy Ridley, despite her laughable performance in the last movie held her own very nicely. Her presence on screen didn't feel rushed or forced. If you ignore the plot holes from the previous movie, and perceive Rey as a developed character already, you will be very happy with her performance overall. Ridley's acting in this film is miles ahead of the 7th movie.We also understand, and somewhat sympathise with Kylo Ren in this movie. Adam Driver's portrayal of the character was exemplary. Much was left out in the previous movie of Ren's backstory, and this movie completely quells this.I was very critical over the pointless and childish jokes in the previous movie, and became aware that the director incorporated these into the film from an interview that was done with the director, but these jokes had actual meaning in the plot and were far more funny than in the previous movie.The best thing about this movie, which I felt that the 7th movie lacked entirely, is the purpose of our characters. It is apparent that each individual character has a crystal clear purpose, and this authenticates the plot much, much more. They don't feel lost, it feels right, as to where they are and what they are doing. There is appropriate backstory to explain why certain paths have been taken this time around and this will satisfy a lot of people.It is a very dark film; unlike any other star wars movie made before, but I welcome this. This theme took the film to a completely different dimension and helped repair the mess which was brewing from the central plot.I was very scared coming into this movie; alike other people, I didn't want to give an extra cent to Disney after the 7th, but for the sake of the saga, I'm very glad this movie turned out to be a great asset in the Star Wars saga.The path is somewhat unclear as to what we shall expect from the next movie, but all I know is that it will be a good one.(Pity that Abrams is directing it though).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Critics versus Fanboys,"I really enjoyed this movie. I say disregard the haters and their expectations of what should have happened; and Star Wars movies were never known for their acting. 
 Bottom line, this movie is fun! From start to finish I was entertained, it's family friendly and left me wanting to see the next one. I enjoyed the cameos. I didn't even have to adjust in my seat I was so entertained! I did not get all my questions answered and have more. I will be back for episode 9!I do not understand complaints about a lack of further research into the Force. Think about what you are really complaining about...a lack of further research into a made up concept? GET OVER IT! The tempo and vibe changes between TFA and this movie are no different than those between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Have you forgotten how different those movies felt? There were definitely some unneeded sub-plots and some inconsistencies with past jedi abilities and limitations, but so what. Someone just figured out how to take the force further than we thought possible.Movies are about entertainment and this is a good one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

way different than expected,"Before starting to review Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I'd like to tell you about my expectations of the movie. Many People said from the beginning that Star Wars VIII will be pretty similar to Star Wars: The Imperium Strikes Back. I used to share the same expectation aslong I just saw both teaser and trailer. After watching the movie last night, I can say that some of my expectations are fullfilled. Even when I dislike Rian Johnson's script due to some unintelligibilities during the movie, I need to say that I got quite surprised by some incidents.So let me say in my own opinion: the movie does not have the commonly known Star Wars-scheme, but it has so much new things that I quite like. Star Wars VIII has a new usage of supporting roles, they get more important as in Star Wars VII. If you watch Star Wars VIII for the first time, just don't let you blind be the actions of the main characters. Get a feeling for the things did by the supporting actors, which are quite important for the wide spectrum of actions, aswell as for the tension of the movie.The usage of the CGI effects are better than in episode I-III. It's pretty combined with most of the panorama recordings and strenghtens the impact in the movie.
 I quite like the use of the music in Star Wars VIII. Its a mix of the old score, combined with new compositions - props for John Williams.As a Star Wars-since-childhood fan im not really sad or angry for the mediocre script, but im impressed by all the other aspects of the movie and I fully accept Star Wars: The Last Jedi as a coequal Star Wars Movie.So may the force be with you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty good!,"I enjoyed it more the second time around, when I picked up little things that I must have blinked over the first time - like the broom - and some really great set pieces, like the At At Walkers suspended in the factory set ablaze, and seeing the people standing in Kylo Ren's hovering ship from a far away shot. Some of these incredible scenes last for only a second and it's easy to miss how much went into making this look so great. I would have gone a different direction for some things - it wasn't made clear that alot of the main protagonists were, at one point, on the same ship, just in different locations on that ship - so that was a bit confusing when it all came together. I wouldn't have given Laura Dern purple hair as though she just walked in from the set of the Hunger Games. Casting Finn and Rose together seemed like an attempt to force a multicultural agenda - their storyline was the weakest in the film, especially after Benicio del Toro gets involved - this whole chapter should have been rewritten. On the positive side, Adam Driver - an actor I don't particularly fancy - was incredible as Kylo Ren. Every line he delivered was perfect, and just from his eyes you could see the conflict within.

A bit better than TFA but only because of Rian Johnson,"Rian Johnson is a very talented writer.

Viewers not involved anymore,"I liked this one as much as the preceding others. Each character has a purpose and feelings to be useful to the story. To get into the story of the resistance continuing to fight against the bad guys, you have to accept new characters and try to understand those feelings in the story line. The story changes as years go by and it seems that most people just want it to stay in the past. If you are tired of Star Wars, please stop attending and go on with your life instead of filling reviews with complaints. You just aren't getting into the story as it is presented. It is a good thing this one in December is the last. There is definitely not an appreciative audience. I liked it, even if I am in the minority.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Last Hype.,"Even as I decided to review this... This atrocity in cinema history. I am stumped by the point that I don't even know where to begin. Or how to avoid making it into an essay.This is that one movie, where I can say for sure that my heartbeat slowed down with disappointment and disgust. Not even TFA did that. Yes I was disappointed, and I could feel the hype ebb out, and I could feel the disappointment. And because of TFA my expectations for this one were really low, so it's amazing how it could still cut even lower, and disappoint me yet again. A whole new low.Say what you will about TFA, most of the issues with lore can at least be explained away, or you can pretend there will be a good explanation down the road. But not this time. 
This time they decided to cross the point of no return. Retcon is now the only reasonable choice that is left. Because people will not buy this, not even the average Joe is that stupid.Sense? This movie makes NONE. The pacing is crap, the story is inconsistent, the characters are illogical(and make even more illogical statements), lore is being broken left and right; even their own sci-fi status is called into question, as they break their own deduceable physics(This is basically the last ""relevant""(this movie forces me to use the term lightly) scene in the movie, and the last blow they deal to their own credability). CG you just managed to turn the major part of even your most tolerant supporters against you. You know, those whom would have been happy to lick ceo ass and swallow if you told them. Even they finally found something they couldn't swallow, if they wanted to maintain any sort of grip on their sanity. It's like when some of these feminists start to see photo's of these so called 3rd wave feminists, and hear about some of the crazy things they do. That moment when they finally sober up, and take off those rose-tinted glasses.This is the death knell for Disney SW, in the eyes of all sane people.I remember there was a channel on youtube, where they counted ""cinema sins"" for movies they reviewed. But this time, they would not have enough time(in terms of clip size, or time spent making it), energy or stomache to complete a review of this stinking pile of crap.*Minor spoiler/hint alert*

"Entertaining, but ultimately confused and","Very surprised that the critics gave this a thumbs up. It's possibly among the worst Star Wars movies (including the prequels). It's entertaining, for sure, but in the way David and Jerry Zucker films of the 80's were crowd pleasers. This isn't something you go home thinking about or affecting you when you go home, at least in a good way.The problem as I see it is that it tried to tackle too much in one movie. Worst, it spent so much time on unimportant (and seemingly inconsequential) events and not enough time on the bigger questions that were left hanging from TFA. The story structure is a mess. The Finn/Rose subplot could've been totally removed, and the new characters introduced were a waste of time.Characterizations were very inconsistent. Characters who had already grown in TFA (Finn, Poe) suddenly regressed for no reason. Major characters (Rey, Kylo, Luke) would make surprising moves without any basis or set-up, for the sake of surprise. In fact a lot of the movie can be said as favoring a ""twist"" happening at the expense of consistent character development. The prequel movies' treatment of Anakin's character development was a lot more satisfying, AND that's a generally panned. At least the prequel movies' story tried in earnest, TLJ did worst that just phoning it in.As some movies have become acclaimed films over time after an initial bashing by the critics (e.g. Bladerunner), this one I believe will take the opposite direction.Here's hoping JJ fixes everything with IX.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A brilliant Star Wars movie, that doesn't deserve the hate","The last Jedi does what a sequel should do. Go in a new and unexpected direction. I love what Rian Johnson did to this movie and Lukes arc. I was kinda mixed the first time I saw the movie in 2017, but the movie has grown on me since and I've realized how great this movie actually is. The Story between Rey, Luke and kylo ren is amazing and so interesting. What you Learn about the characters motivation and desire is so fascinating, And how people can change after time. The cinematography and cgi is top notch, and looks way better than most marvel movies. It's not a flawless movie. The things I don't like is the entire rose and Finn subplot that just panders out the time and ruins the pacing and canto bight sequence (F#ck canto bight). The chase between the first order and resistance is not the most creative plot and kinda adds some plot holes. But overall I love this movie and I could watch it again and again. If you don't like this movie, that's ok.

Not a movie of Heroes.,"People tend to think that Star Wars is about Heroes Vs Villans. It´s not. People already forgot Star Wars IV. Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi was hidden where only a handful of people knew about him. That was the way to keep the galaxy at a ingrateful peace. Yoda too never returned from his deep obscure hideout. Luke made the same option. 
Ben Solo wanted to be the new Darth Vader... and that´s what he made all the way. 
On the other side, the movie shows us that ANYONE can be a hero, because each person thinks different. A fighter pilot wants to take out the enemy and survive, even that he loses his entire squadron, if the mission is completed, it was a great mission and the losses are normal. For an Admiral, there are other options and even that nobody cares, it need to hide from any enemy or spies, until the end... even that it costs people lifes but saves much more. That´s something that people tend to forget and want do see victories and defeats. 
Only the ones that survive can say they where there and lost less than the ones that died. 
All the movie is based on that. On the 4 acts, that´s the main point of the entire story. Anyone can be hero since everyone wants do survive but only the ones that are cautious can do it and will lose many on that escape. 
Can´t understand why people bash the movie... because it did the same think that started the IV movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Your just a bug in the system""",After I saw The Force Awakens back in 2015 I honestly thought the rest of the series was just going to be a cut and paste of the original trilogy but The Last Jedi proved me wrong by upping the stakes and giving the perfect mix of a slow build up to the story then hitting hard with the action keeping the tension high while not lacking story and narrative which is hard to do when people are complaining there's not enough action or that there's to much of it.The story takes place directly after the events of the previous movie with Rey (Daisy Ridley) having found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) she pledes with him to return with her to the rebels and fight with them he refuses but sees the potential in her and agrees to train her in the ways of the force but he fears he may fail and lose her to the dark side like he did Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) while that's going on the rebels are forced to abandon there base of operations when the First Order discover there position and blasts there base from orbit but there escape from the First Order is short lived when they are tracked through Hyper Space and the First Order pursue them through space destroying one ship at a time until they run out of fuel and can't run anymore so it's up to Finn (John Boyega) and a rebel engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) to stop the First Order from tracking them before the fleets fuel runs dry and the last spark of the resistance is wiped from the Galaxy.The detail in each scene is breathtaking really showing how good the Star Wars universe can look and sound when done right and not just a quick cash grab movie.The acting from all involved is excellent especially from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley you can see they are giving it there all in every scene and have great chemistry that really sells there characters close connection.I recommend this movie to any Star Wars or science fiction fans it's worth watching and is definitely an improvement from The Force Awakens and isn't just a cut and paste of Empire Strikes Back.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An unbalanced sequel,"The Force Awakens brought back Star Wars to the big screen and it did so with style and excitement. However Star Wars: The Last Jedi did not strike as hard on me as I thought the movie in general was unbalanced. To see Mark Hamill again was an amazing treat and he played a weary and wiser Luke Skywalker in a very good way, however sometimes it felt as if perhaps the character was a little too depressed for the storyline and in a way that seemed unfitting the brave and determined Luke that we heard last time in Return of the Jedi in 1994.I thought that some scenes were very good, for example the throne room scene with Snoke that ended very unexpectedly. Another great scene was the scene with Yoda as the amazing Frank Oz came back to give longtime fans a great nostalgic trip. But it also had many scenes that felt out of place. For me one of those scenes were when Finn and Rose recruited the code breaker, as this long scene used much unnecessary CGI and had little point other than the fact that they found a new associate.All in all I thought the movie was entertaining and well-made in many ways however because of its unbalanced storytelling and visuals I rated it lower than Force Awakens.7/10 Good!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great film, surprised by some negative IMDB reviews","We are star war fans and thought this was just as great an installment as The Force Awakens and original trilogy with well-loved trademark elements mixed with better quality next generation story telling/film-making which gives this trilogy a great unique edge - I personally think this makes the final trilogy relevant both from its original theme and for the new generation of films we see (the acclaimed ones rather than the overdone franchises out there). There are great contemporary characters and storytelling with morals to learn in this film too that you don't get to see done so well or even covered in most mainstream movies, one thing I particularly love about Star Wars.If you remember the original Star Wars trilogy and appreciated it for what is (great story, still sci-fi with some light hearted fun), and appreciate the new trilogy is made in this generation - I then hope you enjoy this film all the same.If you expect it to be exactly the same as the original attached with characters that haven't developed since then, you might not like the movie, and it's probably best to re-watch the originals that already exist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not the best of the franchise, but does enough to keep the momentum going for Episode IX","'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (Episode VIII) has a big challenge - live up to the original trilogy and build upon the solid foundation laid by 'The Force Awakens'. It achieves both in parts, but probably not overall. If Episode VII was reminiscent of 'A New Hope', Episode VIII doesn't really emulate 'The Empire Strikes Back' too much. It starts with a pretty good space battle between The Resistance and the First Order, with Poe Dameron (Issac) and General Hux (Gleeson) the main players. Poe's a great character, but probably needed more of him. The characters are all in different locations, so the film spends a bit of time hopping between them - Luke (Hamill) and Rey (Ridley) are on Ahch-To; Leia (Fisher) is with Poe on a ship being chased by Hux & her son, Kylo Ren (Driver); Finn (Boyega) is on a mission with Rose (Tran) at Canto Bight, a casino planet.Unlike the original and prequel trilogies, 'The Last Jedi' doesn't pick up a few years later - it's almost the next day. Some of my main issues with the film are because of this - The First Order had their massive ""Starkiller Base"" (and seemingly thousands of soldiers) destroyed at the end of Episode VII, so how do they suddenly have two of the biggest spaceships ever seen? Where are all their resources coming from? My other gripes are that's it's probably a little too long (2 hours 30min), we don't learn where Snoke came from or how/why he's so powerful/in charge, Laura Dern is not really needed, Benicio Del Toro's character could've been done much better and we don't see nearly enough of R2-D2, C-3PO, or Chewbacca. The film spends too much time in the space stand-off between Leia and Ren and is a bit disjointed cutting between what's happening.In saying all that, there's plenty of positives, with Rey being the shining light in this new trilogy, and Ren continues to remain an interesting character. It's good to see Luke have more screen time, even if he's still brooding over his failure of Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. The Porgs were funny and cute, not annoying as I thought they might be, Chewie finally gets a hug from Leia (something that annoyed me at the end of Episode VII) and there's a few good lightsaber duels, and the final act with the AT-AT's/sky-speeders is very well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Visually impressive, but surprisingly sterile","I'd heard lots of good things about this film before coming to it; in particular with its darker tone being comparable to Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps this slightly hyped expectation is what led to the film being quite the disappointment. There is an attempt at darker material here, while also shadowing what has gone before, but mostly it feels like a production line film, rather than something made with real energy and risk. That feeling is not anti-Disney for the sake of it (I get most of my entertainment from massive corporations seeking to make money) but certainly part of that is the weight and ease of the franchise, and how it impacts the film.Picking up after the previous film, we find the rebellion on the run while a new Jedi seeks out an old master - so essentially Empire. Within this there is a lot of action and impressive special effects, but surprisingly little in the way of emotional impact - even the previous film has it outstripped on that front. I found the characters pretty bland in the most part, and was surprised by the use of the main characters to essentially do stupid things and waste everyone's time. The moments of conflict have some strengths but there isn't as much human drama there as one would have liked. The action sequences are good in terms of bang for buck, but they don't draw you into them as much as I would have liked.The cast are mixed. Driver remains good and deserves more. Ridley is pretty non-descript here, although the script gives her so little. Boyega doesn't quite have the spark he usually has, and his chemistry with Tran's Rose is pretty non-existent. Hamill is good and has the most to do. The other characters tend not to make much of an impact; majorly significant characters are forgotten or moved aside, and generally he plot goes where it wants to go. In this way the narrative is fine in the grand sweep, but in any specific detail or action it tends not to make sense or to be lazy in the writing.Last Jedi gives you lots of spectacle for your money, and there is enough to it to be entertaining for a few hours; however it is surprisingly sterile. It lacks emotional punch or weight, and plays out even its darker moments in a way that feels designed by committee and lacking rough edges or any sort.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not the franchise film you're looking for.,"When The Last Jedi first came out I, like many, had... opinions on it. Despite any initial thoughts I had however, I decided to hold off on cementing them until the conclusion of the trilogy, since it is only a piece of a whole after all. Now, having recently seen ""The Rise of Skywalker"" and the end of this saga, I can confirm that... Disney, and Rian Johnson to a lesser extent, botched it.On its own, ""The Last Jedi"" actually has some pretty interesting ideas. The expansion of the Force and the recontextualization of some of the events of the previous films to challenge our preconceived notions are both interesting ideas that were worth exploring to prevent this series from getting stale. Some of the twists that defy what the genre typically does were exciting. The problem with these things is the film they're happening in, the middle portion of a story whose bookends are not interested in the same ideas.This battle between directors is the greatest disservice to both ""The Last Jedi,"" and the sequel trilogy as a whole. Johnson all but disregards the plot threads that Abrams had set up in ""The Force Awakens,"" wrapping up the lingering questions that movie left in a neat little bow. The problem with this is that he really doesn't set up all that much of his own for the next movie to go off of.Thematically, this isn't a terrible thing. ""The Last Jedi"" sets up some questions, and it answers them. This is how stories are supposed to operate. For the literal plot though, there still needs to be an engine to keep things running if you know the story isn't over, and this movie simply doesn't provide that. It's not conducive to long-term storytelling at all, which is why I think the ideas it explores would've fit better in a standalone movie.That's probably the most unique thing I have to say about this movie that's been discussed to death. My other opinions about it can be found anywhere you look about this movie. Rose and the whole Canto Bight subplot? Obviously terrible. The political correctness is too heavy handed. On the positive side, this is the most visually interesting Star Wars has been. I found the action to be strong and exciting. Just look literally anywhere on the internet if you want to hear about these topics in-depth.""The Last Jedi"" is probably bound to always be divisive. Now, in light of the completed trilogy, its legacy to me is that of the franchise's biggest monkey wrench.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Something is off,"I'm completely new to the starwars movies. I've avoided them my whole life, but with Disney + I was able to watch all of them and then this one on Netflix. The bad reviews I see on here must be one of two things. Either targeted bad reviewing by bots and trolls or dedicated older fans who dont like anything new.
Being a new fan I had no loyalty to any of the movies and have not been influenced by others opinions on them.
That being said this is a very good movie. I was only able to get through the prequel trilogy because I'd seen these first and I wanted to understand the history and plot points better.

It's cool to be a hater,"I thought ""The Force Awakens"" was ok. If it had been marketed as a reboot of the series I would have liked it much more. I went in expecting something new and was surprised and disappointed when it was simply ""A New Hope"" with a different cast. I felt nothing for ""Rouge One"" as it was to me simply an action movie set in the Star Wars universe. The Vader scenes were awesome, but those five minutes could not make up for an entire movie of stuff I did not care about.""The Last Jedi"" is everything I could ever have hoped for. This is hands down the best Star Wars movie since the originals. Which is why I am so confused at the hate it is receiving in the media. But it's the cool thing to hate things these days I suppose.Was this a perfect movie? Of course not. But to say that it is the worst Star Wars movie ever made and fans are calling for it to be struck from the timeline?!It is this humble Star Wars fan's opinion that this is the greatest modern day Star Wars that has been made to date. So great that I saw it twice opening weekend, and I want to get to seeing it a third time in IMAX if possible.Don't believe what your read online. Go watch the movie. Hate it if you want, but go watch it with an open mind and I think you'll be surprised.I can think of a bunch of things I didn't like about it.

Luke's arch showed a real look at what transformation looks like and how life's struggles don't always end because you've conquered some of them beforehand.

The Last Jedi stands out like a sore thumb,"The opening sequence of The Last Jedi begins as The Force Awakens ends; and in doing so creates a timeline overlap that only goes to amplify the jarring and blunt style transition taking place.The newly simplified existing characters and their cardboard tag-alongs spring from one unconvincing scenario to the next, while the trusted writer/director manically wipes the legacy slate clean. In it's place is served a large dose of passive and disposable entertainment that consistently fails to deliver enough internal logic to keep disbelief at bay.The entire storyline to date gets unceremoniously rolled through a mangle and cut into a shallow and insincere Star Wars parody.Inbetween the bizarre dialogue and poorly executed creative choices, we bear witness to tumbleweed one-liners, frown inducing sitcom set-ups, script-bending erratic manoeuvres and eye-rolling merchandise tie-ins.Every time the story raises its game; poised to deliver some real grit, tension or emotion, it immediately disappoints with cheap audience-aware gags and cringe-worthy pop-culture references not of a galaxy far, far away.The Last Jedi stands out like a sore thumb next to the succinct storytelling of The Force Awakens and the impressive cinematic impact of Rogue One.I seem to have found myself injected with a totally unexpected appreciation and respect for what George Lucas achieved with his Star Wars prequels, despite the significant flaws of their own.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Luke, the one person that is supposed to versed in the force, appears incompetent and moody, like a teenager that never grew up and the last person that Rey needs as a teacher.Sadly much of the storylines that seem to have been set up in the Force Awakens unravel like a pair of knitted underpants on a Velcro seat, leaving you to wonder if it's worth tuning in to the third instalment.Despite the poor storyline the acting and visuals are pretty good. The action is compelling enough, but as in the Force Awakens, the sinister characters are just pastiches and are too readily revealed. Kylo Ren hints at being an interesting and tormented character, but largely comes off as a moody teenager. The bad guys roam around without ever really having a raison d'etre. And this is problem with Stsr Wars, the more you show the bad guys the more you need to understand about them.

Big disappointment due to inexplicably positive critic reviews,"I am your average moviegoer that grew up watching and enjoying the original trilogy. I think the Force Awakens did a remarkable job of reigniting the excitement about the new saga in spite of its ""convenient"" script structure which was probably necessary to connect old and new characters. It was arguably far from an easy task after three mediocre prequels and its ending was a very promising set up for this episode. I admit that I had high expectations for this movie, I was genuinely excited. This was further fueled by stellar critic reviews:- ""If The Force Awakens raised a lot of questions, this tackles them head-on. Fun, funny but with emotional heft..."" Ian Freer, Empire Magazine
 - ""...does a better job than most sequels of giving the audience both what it wants and what it didn't know it wanted. The movie leans hard into sentiment..."" Matt Zoller Seitz, RobertEbert.com
 - ""...Mark Hamill in the performance of his career..."" Peter Travers, Rolling Stone
 - ""Johnson... has given us an actual movie... His movie has a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, but its emotional generosity...is its best special effect"" Stephanie Zacharek, TIME
...And much more of the same on critics aggregator sites.If movie critics that are usually hard to satisfy on this genre are so positive, it should be a great movie right? Well, in short, The Last Jedi disappoints on most levels:Killing off main characters unceremoniously and inexplicably reviving others just for the sake of delivering ""unexpected plot twists"" is usually signs of bad script and lack of imagination.2.5 hours of screenplay with uneven pacing and side-stories that deliver no emotional impact or advance the main story in any way are normally signs of bad director and editing choices.Changing the tone of the humor is always risky and in this installment it was done too much and in a way that does disservice to the characters and universe involved. Getting the humour just right is one of the most tricky aspects and it just shows that the team involved was simply not up to the task.Ignoring past history of characters and forcing them to act in an opposite way than previous installments (or just plain common sense) just to throw off viewers' expectations is also a sign of lazy script and lack of good ideas.Trying to portray serious themes in a sci-fi adventure without sufficient time or impact come off superficial and condescending to educated adult viewers.Setting a plot hole filled slo-mo chase as basis of the suspense is by any standards a poor way of advancing a 2.5 hour film.I understand that the Star Wars needs to evolve. I agree with many of the main directions taken in this movie (Luke's emotional journey, fate of the Resistance, retrospect on the Jedi traditions, Kylo's inner struggle, even Rey's parentage, why not). But I completely disagree with the forced, clunky and unimaginative way that these directions were followed and with the total disregard of the previous installments' lore. It was marginally above prequel-level storytelling albeit more beautifully produced.
Yes, there where plenty of unexpected moments, but they where mostly a combination of underwhelming, cheesy and unrealistic forced plot advancements. The Last Jedi is a story of great potential (ending of The Force Awakens) wasted to provoke cheap thrills mostly devoid of that human touch that made the original trilogy a classic.Getting that human touch right (with the proper amounts of sentiment, humour, heroism, romance) in between space fights and lightsaber duels is a sign of true film-making and story-telling mastery. I am convinced that the team behind this movie was just not competent enough to pull this off and it really shows when watching this movie. I am disappointed that so few in the mainstream media have the guts to say this simple truth.I was made to believe by professional critics that this film was a masterpiece in its genre (many were placing it close or equal to the Empire Strikes Back) and even from a movie-making perspective (script, pacing, performances, tone, etc) it is a mediocre film in spite of all the beautiful effects and occasional good performances. The narrative choices in regards to previous installments make things even worse.
I understand that most critics are employees like many of us, that Viacom can put pressure on the media organisations for which these critics work, but I expected more professional integrity from their part (yes I am convinced that they were pressured to review it positively, I would probably have done the same).In my humble opinion, it is a solid 6/10 (slightly above the prequels). 
Maybe 7/10 if you are not a Star Wars fan, but not any higher and surely not a masterpiece.PS: I fully understand all the reviewers rating it at 1/10 in an attempt to correct what seems to be a major overvaluation from the mainstream media. After rereading critics reviews I feel like they consider average people completely devoid of critical thinking which is quite insulting to many of us.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Ups and Downs,"Just like the last film (The Force Awakens) you are either going to love it, or hate it. But I also noticed a lot of people are very much in the middle. I am one of those people. Yes there were some good elements that made me happy, but, there is a lot more issues then I realized walking out; after thinking more and more about it, the more I feel unsatisfactory. I'm not going to go into spoilers, I'm just here to tell you if it is worth the watch. Honestly, it is, but I wouldn't go rushing to the theatre to see it like with The Force Awakens. I'll start off with the positives, firstly, Mark Hamill gives the strongest performance of his career in my opinion, however some of the direction of the character was off. With that said, I felt fulfilled with how Luke was portrayed in this film. Adam Driver gives a riveting, and damaged performance as Kylo Ren, surely his character is a lot more interesting then Force Awakens. I am very curious what will happen to him next. Daisy Ridley as Rey was spot-on, so was her character in many ways. There is a little surprise in the film involving two characters which I felt satisfied with. Ok, those were the ups. As I enjoyed Luke, Ren, and Rey...thats about it for the characters. The others fell flat, Finn is remarkably pointless at this point, he has no arcs, no story, he's just there right now to give John Boyega a paycheck, good for him, but not for us. The Porgs are Fu--ing stupid in the worst way. They're just a dumb excuse to sell TOYS, but why do you NEED that for Star Wars? Doesn't Star Wars sell enough TOYS! When I saw them in the trailer I snapped, this is what Hollywood has turned to. I wouldn't mind so much if they had a purpose, other then to sell TOYS. They are not as annoyed as the Minions, but pretty close. Finn wasn't the only character who was pointless or unneeded, and some of the ways they handle the characters makes no sense, I would go into more detail, but I want you to go experience this yourself. But in my opinion, this film is worth seeing, just don't expect The Empire Strikes Back or anything. It proves that Disneyfying everything isn't always great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Last Jedi equals Ingenious,"I will never understand the bad word of mouth with the last Star Wars outing, The Last Jedi. There's no going wrong with this franchise as far as I can see. In my honest opinion, Rouge One wasn't as good as The Force Awakes but after watching The Last Jedi, I will say it is one of the best. This gives me reason to question why people are going out of the way to bash what is being done with the Star Wars series.Nothing stays the same, and in this case the changes being made here are suitable and necessary for growth and expansion. I will respectfully add that The Last Jedi was ingenious. All the hate can't change that.Any film is worth viewing to make your own opinion. Forget the negativity and bad reviews being spewed by others. it is almost laughable. Even George Lucas has given his blessings and approval stamp before any of the Star Wars releases. One learns to expect a lot from anything of this magnitude and I was not disappointed one bit. In fact, it turned out better than I could have imagined. So see it for yourself! I gave it a 10, it's that good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
1The Last Jedi Review,The best star wars movie so far I don't know why people think it sucks or why Disney is ruining the franchise. This movie shows a lot of surprises and incredible action.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This isn't the Star Wars film you're looking for,"I like films. Actually, I really like films. I also really like TV and I really like novels. I like drama, action, fantasy, I like low-budget art-house films where nothing happens, I like gore-fests and I like psychological horror.In all these genres, I have very high standards. Yet I can love a cheap-as-chips horror film as much as I love a glittering, star-studded Oscar winner. Why? Because every film should be judged on its own merits, in the context of what it is trying to achieve and according to the traditions of the genre in which it exists. If I'm watching a Malaysian action film, such as The Raid, I judge it on the basis that I should expect to see lots of seriously shot, highly choreographed violence, a simplistic storyline and some throwaway stuff about familial betrayal. If I'm watching a film about the nature of the interlinking of humanity with itself, the animal kingdom and the world, through the human senses, such as Upstream Colour, I'm happy with very little action but lots of juxtaposition of sounds, visuals and emotions.And if I'm watching a Star Wars film, what I'm pretty much exactly looking for is a Star Wars film. The Last Jedi is not that at all.The reason many critics love the new Star Wars film is exactly the same reason why so many fans hate it. The Last Jedi takes the very specific sensibilities of the original trilogy and throws them out the window. It takes a series of films that are, at their best, exquisitely made, ground-breaking genre pieces and presents us with an easily accessible, bog-standard sci-fi action movie. It appeals to the lowest common denominator (i.e. non-genre fans), and the critics run with it because they know how to evaluate bog-standard sci-fi films. The critics feel at home with The Last Jedi in a way they did not feel at home with, say, The Empire Strikes Back (which garnered lots of negative reviews upon its release). Just as they felt at home with Arrival in the way they didn't feel at home with Starship Troopers (the former being an arty film that happened to have a sci-fi theme, the latter being a film that both gloried in and yet also subverted a low-brow sci-fi sub-genre and confused the hell out of the critics in the process). The Last Jedi is a perfectly serviceable contemporary action movie, complete with diversity, messages and all that stuff. It ticks lots of boxes for the film critics. But unfortunately, the director is so enamoured with his big brain, he decided he didn't need to respect the source material.It's rather disappointing that despite so many years having passed since Star Wars' release, so few critics appreciate where the artistry lies in the original trilogy. The simplicity of the stories, the casual, natural intimacy between the main characters, the purity (bordering on naivety) of the messages of film, the fact that everything is presented at face value and nothing has to mean anything more than you want it to... all these things are lost in The Last Jedi. In their place we have contrived relationships, forced messages, and a complete lack of authenticity. All well-and-good for a trying-to-be-smarter-than-it-is Disney flick, but just not good enough for Star Wars. The OT Star Wars was high concept film-making at its best, but what we have now is the opposite. The critics love low concept movies, which is fine, but it's not the point of Star Wars and they really should be able to understand that. Yes, the OT Star Wars films had their inherent limitations, but the people behind those films pushed up to the very edge of those limitations. The latest edition tries to do more by blasting the limitations away, but ends up achieving a lot less as a result.The Last Jedi: 6/10.
Critic's response to The Last Jedi: 1/10.p.s I've seen quite a few comments along the lines of ""I never really got into the Star Wars films, but I love this one"", even from some critics. To some, that means bringing Star Wars to a new audience, but in reality it just means selling out. Has cinema really become so artistically bankrupt that it's now seen as a good thing for a franchise -owner to burn away a highly-regarded creative work's foundation in the name of putting new bums on seats? No wonder TV is where all the talented creatives are right now!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Satisfying like fast food,"Good, but not great. If you have any scientific background, you'll very often be forced out of your suspension of disbelief by the story's frequent ignorance of the laws of gravity, the reality regarding transmission of sound in a vacuum, its disregard for how a battle environment would be under constant surveillance, etc. Still, the movie is satisfying in the same way that fast food will kill hunger.

Star Wars is getting so lost the more movies they roll out,"I've never written a review for any movies ever, but Star Wars has always been a special place in my heart. However, the film disappointed me so much that I just got to write a review bout this film.To sum it up for the bad rating is that the franchise tries hard to capture the brilliance & core aspects of the original George Lucas trilogy with modern film making & Michael Bay explosions but somehow messed it all up.The force awakens is ok to say the least but doesn't take the movie too seriously as it's filled with cheesy & cringe worthy dialogues.The last jedi instead just don't make any sense anymore. The plot twist in the film is very cringe worthy, the characters are very misplaced & badly portrayed, the plot is just crap like they've really run out of ideas, the new ideas & lore of star wars that the producers tried to introduced is pretentious & failed miserably.In the end, The last jedi just don't make sense & very cringe worthy, the movie is just for die hard star wars fans and even they will be disappointed by how messed up this film is.The only plus side are the actions scenes and sound effect, nothing else. Rest is total crap.Only watch it if you have nothing better to do and just want some time out with friends & family, if not just wait for the movie to be release on the internet, save your money.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pathetic, soulless, vapid, shallow...I'm talking about the reviewers.","This isn't a review other than to say the The Last Jedi wasn't the strongest entry in the SW series, but it was far from the worst.The only thing ""worst"" things about this movie are the absolutely pathetic excuses for people reviewing it. I'm not saying you have to love it or even like it, but the rancor and venom being spewed against it says less about the movie and more about the lack of mental stability of much of it's fanbase. If the types of dark, vile emotions people are claiming this movie spawned in them are real, then all I can say is...You have mental issues that require professional help. You are sick, period.However, I don't truly believe that most of you can claim mental illness as an excuse. Most of you are just bad people with such a sad, pathetic heart and soul that you can let a piece of fiction stir such garbage. The concept of the Mom's-basement-dwelling, socially-inept clown is overused, but it exists. They are usually sad failures as humans who think their opinion on SUBJECT A is more relevant because they've devoted o-so-much time to SUBJECT A. Truthfully, your lack of real-world experience in anything that truly matters makes your opinion irrelevant. You only have one frame of reference due to your lack of like.Go and check out the movie if you want to be entertained for a few hours. There's nothing especially wrong with it. If you like it, great. If not, no harm done....unless you act lie some part of your life has been taken away because you didn't. If that's the case, keep it to yourself. There's too much anger in this world over things that matter. Expressing this kind of anger over things that don't makes you....well, read the title.

"The second best Star Wars film, easily!","I teach film production and screen writing, i have an honours degree in both subjects and have done the job for a decade. In my dispassionate and professional point of view ""The Last Jedi"" is the second best Star Wars movie. It's well shot and aside from the Finn fools errand section it's very well written.There have been a lot of very vocal ""fans"" that have slated this film which is their perogative I guess but each point they have (Finn and The Casino aside) that they raise is easily rebuffed and usually contradicted by similar events that have already happened in the Star Wars films. Once those points have been disapproved most of these so called ""fans"" still maintain their hatred for this film which means it ultimately boils down to personal dissatisfaction at not being given the exact movie they wanted and not getting answers to questions they either demanded or expected. This film has laid bare the awful entitled attitudes that a lot of so called fans have toward Star Wars and it's made the universe that I've loved since I was a child a little more toxic and made the fandom look like a collective of petulant children crying that dinner wasn't cooked the way they liked.It's a good film that changed things that NEEDED changing to stay fresh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force Is NOT Strong With This Movie,"The reason for my title is this. I saw the film with my Dad on Friday and I have to admit I liked it. I thought it was an okay film for what it was. The reason I said this is because I liked the Force Awakens a lot better than Jedi because at least their was a story there. The Last Jedi was basically the same rehashing of the same Star Wars plot the Empire is trying to take over and the Resistance is trying to stop them. That's it. That's basically the film. And no that's not a spoiler because I don't do spoilers.
 What I liked about The Last Jedi I loved Rey and her journey to find Luke and trying to find out who she is and learning the Jedi arts. I loved BB8 he was basically doing everything in this film from piloting the airplane, helping take down some guards or helping out anyway that he can for the Resistance against the Empire. I did enjoy seeing Luke even though he was asking like he was an manic depressive disorders douche to Rey but that sort of reminded me of when Yoda treated Luke that way in Empire Strikes Back which was cool but sort of mean to be honest. I did enjoy seeing Carrie Fisher in her last role as Princess excuse me General Leia BUT to be honest she didn't really do much in the film but whatever at least they didn't cut her out because she passed on but I do have an issue that I'll get into in my dislike part of the review. 
 What I disliked about the film which isn't much BUT the major thing I'm disappointed with and it's really not a spoiler BUT the way they honored Carrie Fisher's memory at the end of the film. They didn't do anything! They just said in loving memory of our princess....that's it. Of course her role in the film was a bit weird as well which I can't say because I don't want to give away anything but I found it weird the way they kept her in the film. 
Other dislikes where maybe the so called training of Rey which didn't live up to the hype and that's all I'll say. Kylo Ren was a bit lame in this film at least in Force he was interesting in Jedi he was just an emo kid on a bad acid trip but I did like the lightsabor battle with Rey that was pretty cool so I guess that would go in my like part of this review. I did not care for that Asian chick Rose she was a bit annoying with Finn. One more she hates him and then she somehow loves him it's like pick an emotion girl. 
 Should you see this film? Well I mean if you're a Star Wars fan you're going to see this film and possibly love or hate it. Will I buy this film on Blu-ray probably so to add to my Star Wars collection. If I were you I would wait until a few weeks to watch Star Wars because it was a bit crowded when me and my Dad went to the theater but that's normal for any Star Wars film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
mini review of Star Wars The Last Jedi,"Went to see Star Wars The Last Jedi, I always get sucked in and end up regretting. This one is no exception to that rule. In the words of the immortal Princess Leia, the spark is gone although the budget is still more than handsome and the cash registers are singing happy returns. We know what that means, another sequel to the sequel or to the revamped series after the original and the prequel. It's a sure fire money maker so why bite the hands that feeds you, certainly not George Lucas.
There is one word which kind of sums it all up for me: debris. Lots and lots of debris, especially in 3D it's coming right at you that plus three strands of a story which do not coalesce into a satisfying whole.
One theme endlessly repeated: the light and the dark and who will conquer but meanwhile let's all enjoy the neverending war. Apparently there were cameos of people I missed Lupita N'yongo, Gwendoline Christie plus a wasted Benicio del Toro, an OK. Laura Dern looking suitably gungho and severe in an appropriate outfit.
Still there was something bittersweet knowing that Carrie Fisher's bright light had dimmed but she will be remembered forever here even if the movie itself was a thorough disappointment. Maybe I'm just not a Star Wars fan or I've simply outgrown it. In the end I found it overly long and boring. Once they start shooting each other out of the sky it's hard to tell who the friends and foes are and frankly my dear I don't really give a damn. Reviews have been mostly positive but with all the hype surrounding the release and the hush hush scenario it's not all that surprising. I did enjoy Adam Driver's performance, definitely can hold the screen and one's gaze. His Modigliani face is hard to look away from. My grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"C'mon guys it wasn't that bad, surely?","Guys, it's been 40 years since episode IV, you were probably 13 when you saw it back then - every big movie looks amazing when you are 13. Now you're 53, middle aged and grumpy, which is why the newest movie looks bad.I admit I was somewhat underwhelmed. Yes, there were a bunch of pointless subplots; yes, there were more plot holes than in, say, Prometheus; yes, there were a bunch of scientific anomalies; yes, the script was bad (and mumbled - I couldn't make out what half the characters were saying); and yes, the acting did make us want Harrison Ford back...But the movie does have its plus points:
The music is quite good.
The soundtrack is very noisy - in a good way.
The Millennium Falcon looks just as amazing as always (I'm glad they managed to recover it from that golf club in the south of England...).
The new cute bird creatures are brilliant - they need a spinoff movie of their own.

Disappointing movie,"Going into The Last Jedi, I was optimistic and excited about the film but feel that I and many fans have been let down on what it could have been.I'll say the movie was ok, stand alone not attached to Star Wars it would be fine with good special effects and music. However the overlong story manages to not include any major character development, includes poor humour at the wrong moments and a whole story arc (30-45mins) that could be avoided if a plan was shared with a subordinate (who's about 5th in line of command at least), which is not unreasonable.This felt to me as if Disney wanted to rip up all ties to previous films so that they can usher in further trilogies.oh plus wealthy people bad, diversity good, animal cruelty bad (even worse than child slave labour apparently)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Legacy of Luke Skywalker: Now naught more than a Disney cash-grab.,"While I am a Star Wars fan, I am not a fanatic. I would, however, classify myself as a purist, as I refuse to watch the ""remastered"" original trilogy, as in my opinion, not a single change made the films better and many changes made them worse. I only own Episodes III-VI and Rogue One, as Episode I is a drag that adds nothing of import to the Anakin story arc, and Episode II adds important points but is still hard for me to watch. Episode VII had equally terrible acting, script, and plot contrivances, not to mention being a glaring knock-off of Episode IV, and I have no qualms about standing nearly alone in saying the Force Awakens was a relatively terrible movie.If you feel the same, this review is for you.The Last Jedi (TLJ), as the title suggests, is a story about Luke Skywalker. You may not realize that while watching the movie, as there are so many other mostly meaningless plot points and story arcs demanding your attention, but this is clearly a movie about who Luke Skywalker has become juxtaposed to the legend of Luke Skywalker that commands the minds of both Rebels and their enemies (not to mention Star Wars fans).
Unfortunately, we are at least a half hour into the movie before Luke is even mentioned, with multiple superfluous characters and plot points being introduced in the meantime. And over the entire length of the film, there is so little Luke time, it is easy to understand that so many do not even realize that that is what this movie is really about.
And here we have the first major flaw in the movie: When you have to explain to people who just watched the movie what the movie was about, you know something is wrong.From the get go, it is evident that Star Wars has not escaped the influence of Guardians of the Galaxy. But what made a talking raccoon and walking tree adorable does not work in other movies, not even in the Marvel universe. The first TLJ scene starts with Poe's immature, slapstick humor, and then tries to switch to a ""desperate hour"" tone as Rebels sacrifice their lives for their comrades. Which is immediately followed by more pointless attempts at slapstick humor as Fin makes his first appearance. That trend continues for the duration of the movie, with scenes that should have felt dark or desperate being interrupted by forced attempts as humor. Possibly the only times the laughing came easily was with the nun-like caretakers, who constantly chide and berate a novice and unwieldy Rey as she tries to use the force whilst destroying Luke's island sanctuary. Overall, TLJ's humor came off about as well as the one-liners teenagers come up with in their homecoming skits: funny only to the writers, traumatizing to the dutiful audience.The Last Jedi continues with another hour of two simultaneous plots, that are both completely pointless, as the disorganized Rebel forces flee. Not to mention the introduction of at least two more major and pointless characters. The acting continues to be bad all around, but part of that may be to blame on the writing, as it is obvious the audience is intentionally left in the dark, but also left without any curiosity, only frustration. By the two hour mark, it becomes pretty clear that, save Rey and Kylo's moments on screen, the movie up to that point was pointless.Stories usually ramp up to a climax, something neither the writers nor director of TLJ seem to have mastered. Time after time after time, I found myself getting a little on edge as the final conflict seemed to be drawing near, only to have that faint glimmer of hopeful anticipation doused as the plot line took an abrupt turn and the story continued. After a few of these moments, my excitement simply could not be provoked; I became numb as over and over again, the movie seemed to drag on. At least in the last half hour, the story did seem to have a purpose, even if it was not an inspiring or even very interesting one.
If it were not for Rey's fight scene, and Luke's cameo appearance, it is quite likely fans everywhere would have rioted and burned down their respective theaters. Rey's final fight, and Luke's final appearance were the two bright spots in the movie, the two times I actually, genuinely enjoyed sitting there.Overall, TLJ had an interesting story to tell. It was simply a poorly told story, as if by a grandmother who wanted to emphasize her part in events past, even though they had no bearing on the actual story, nor its unfolding, nor its outcome. The story is about Luke and the effect his Legend has had, and how far he has strayed from that path. The story is about the gray areas, the things that are not extreme enough to labeled either right or wrong, just told so poorly I feel like I may come off as justifying the movie instead of explaining it. It is about the evolution of the minds of people, their good and evil, their pride and fear, their courage and complacency. The movie could be said to be showing that moment when you realize that something you hold dear and true is wrong, the crush of betrayal, the loneliness that follows. But The Last Jedi doesn't convey those feelings. You have to read deep between the lines to see those contrivances. And so the movie ends as it begins, ultimately a failure, as evidenced by the fact that the story told has to be explained.I left the theater torn, not hurt. There were a couple of genuinely spectacular parts, buts so much of the movie was so bad I could not leave with a smile. I wanted to smile, but I couldn't. As the days past and I had time to reflect on the story I was shown, and what that story could have been, my opinions solidified: this is another Star Wars movie that I will not own.*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***Now, for the nitpicky stuff, as some of you are, like me, very nitpicky.
The space physics are distractingly bad. Someone on the production team must have known something about physics, must have said something, but someone, perhaps the director in his creative genius, chose to ignore said advise and make a movie that not only exhibits false physics in multiple, unreconcilable ways, but who's entire first-hour-plot revolves around bad physics. It drove me nuts. I will accept the laws of a given scifi universe as long as that universe obeys them; TLJ does not.
Military strategy is nonexistent. It is not a matter of inexperience or immaturity, as when Kylo commands his troops; these are the leaders of the First Order, professional military men. Yet points established in Poe's assault in the first five minutes are completely gone against five minutes later when the bad guys have the upper hand. It doesn't take a brilliant tactician to see the flaws, and asking even the averagely intelligent viewer to buy into the subsequent plots is disrespectful.
The endless ""just"" moments. Just big enough, just far enough, just hard enough, just fast enough. I can usually take a lot, but when the Millennium Falcon flies through a hole JUST big enough for it to literally scrape through for the fourth time in its five movies, I was left shaking my head. I cannot even call it a spoiler that the hole actually turns out to be a tunnel. And with as many times as it felt like this movie was about to end and didn't, we are blessed with more ""just"" moments than usual, definitely more than bearable.
And of course the pointless plots. The film could be cut back to only scenes containing Luke and Rey and all it would be missing is Snoke's taunting of Kylo, and we would still have to watch Luke trying to traumatize and scare away Rey, and the awkward hand touching of Luke and Leia at the end.A note about me, for all those who think I rated this too high or too low:
I watched the trailer, maybe twice. I was not impressed, and went into the theater with low expectations, not so much because the trailer made me think this film would be bad, but because the previous entry in the series was bad and also, because I have learned that I like movies more when I go into them with low expectations. I think a lot of the backlash to this film only exists because there was so much hope, and so much of that hope was crushed. I watched this film opening weekend, and rated it before reading anyone else's reviews. I decide on a rating before I visit a film's IMDB page to guarantee I am not swayed by the film's current rating. And I have not changed my rating; 6/10 stars seems fair. I judge relatively harshly, but as long as there are not aspects of a movie that literally sicken me, the lowest I will give it is a 4/10. I consider a 7/10 a movie worth owning, and rarely give out 9's or 10's.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
why?,"So I caught the midnight showing of Star Wars The Last Jedi, by complete accident mind you(it pays to check the AM and PM after the time when booking your tickets online) but hey I've been holding out for this movie for a long time and what's a few extra hours sleep between showings. Now I make it to the cinema(I'm excited at this point, more so then I would have had admitted if asked), I'm a huge fan, since the beginning and I'm old enough to admit that I mean since the beginning, the really big fans are all dressed up and the anticipation in the air is contagious.
and then.........
the first WHY? came rather early on but id heard that this was a new vision and that director Rian Johnson had thrown some spin on the ball so hey who am I to complain. Surely this was just some light hearted humour and god knows the world could use more laughs.........But.....
When one of the most beloved characters not only in this particular universe but in the entire movie universe expresses breast milk from something that has four udders and takes a big drink, just like Rey I had to look the other way, I didn't get much time to gather my thoughts on the matter before dinner was being caught with what could only be described as a massive whaling harpoon.....Why?
So much of this movies 2and a half hour running time is absolute Star Wars gold. some of the best moments that this entire saga has offered up happen in this movie, hands down, in that respect Rian congratulations, truly wonderful stuff, and you knew this was coming ..... But at a time when the devoted are scathing other films for not being long enough and feeling rushed, my feeling is that this film could have done with a closer shave(if you get that then I've found my audience) quite easily 30 to 40 mins could disappear from this and I don't think anybody would have noticed, it then truly could have been the equal of if not the best in series.
