My Favorite Of The Harry Potter Films,"I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it.This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didn't have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG-13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark, nasty and/or annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wise-guy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickman's character softens.In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tea-leaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound. I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Finally, a movie that captures the books' magic","If there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. ""Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?"" ""Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?"" ""Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?"" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet.The only way to satisfy fans would be to include everything from the book, which would require a miniseries. Since that isn't what these films are, the story has to be abridged. The first two films tried to fit everything they could within a reasonable slot of time. The result was a set of films that felt cluttered yet incomplete. Had they continued with this strategy for this movie, based on a much longer book, it would surely have been over three hours long.The virtue of the latest film is that it makes a real attempt to adapt the story, not just marching in lockstep with the book's events. The screenplay is sparing, leaving out or simplifying loads of details not directly relevant to the plot. But it captures much of the book's delight and humor. The first two films fell short in this regard, because they lacked the guts to tinker with the details, even though that was the key to condensing the story while staying true to its spirit.The movie is still faithful to the book, of course. Many of the scenes are exactly as I had imagined them. When it deviates, it does so based on an understanding of the story and characters. This is evident in the way they show, for example, the Knight Bus; Hermione's overstuffed schedule; and the introduction of the Marauder's Map, a scene that captures the twins' mischievous personalities. The changes are clever and funny, and they help compensate for the movie's loss in other areas.Certainly this has something to do with the new director. Columbus's approach was to stick to the books as literally as possible, often draining them of their subtlety. For instance, where the books only hint that Dumbledore can see through the invisibility cloak, the earlier movies make it unmistakable. The new director never condescends to the audience in that way. This is a children's movie, but it is also a fantasy-thriller that we can take seriously, because not everything is spelled out for us. We're given a chance to think.But part of what makes the movie work is the book itself. The story is gripping from start to finish, because the threat looming over the school is established early on. Harry's personal life is sharply intertwined with the plot. We feel for him as we watch his disastrous (but hilarious) attempts to escape his uncle and aunt, and his humiliating reaction to the dementors. The story avoids common devices such as the talking killer or deus ex machina, which the other books have in abundance. The ending is nicely bittersweet and ambiguous. The plot is so complicated, however, that the book spends several chapters explaining it all. The movie wisely includes only very little of this, allowing the plot twists to become understood as the story progresses. I was surprised to see certain events that were in the movie but not the book lend support to an important theory some fans have had about what is to be revealed at the end of the series. Of course, it is well-hidden and won't give anything away for those who aren't looking for the clues.I was so satisfied with the film that it almost seems trivial to mention the flaws, but there are some. The portrayal of Fudge's assistant as the standard hunchbacked dimwit is out of place here, as it would be in anything other than a cartoon or spoof. The most serious misstep, though, is the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon's face seems frozen in a perpetual nonexpression, and his voice lacks resonance. He compares poorly to the late Richard Harris, whose line readings had gravity, and who played the character with a twinkle in his eyes. It is a pure mystery to me why this actor was chosen as a replacement, especially considering the fine performances from other members of the cast. Even the children are in top form here.Those complaints aside, this is the movie I was hoping they would make when the series began. If it doesn't live up to the book, so what? What's important is that it lives up to its potential as a movie. Fans who want a carbon-copy of the book are looking in the wrong place, because they're never going to get it here. This is probably the best example of a Harry Potter movie that we're ever likely to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Darkest and best one yet,"This is the third movie in the franchise, and it's the darkest one yet. We're introduced to Dementors, vile creatures who are tasked to guard the prison of Azkaban. When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger.The introduction of Dementors ushers in a new darker chapter in the franchise. These CGI creatures look every bit the evil creatures they're suppose to be. Accomplished director Alfonso Cuarón shows his great skills in creating tension and atmosphere. Even the darken corridors of Hogwarts are more foreboding. Without spoilers, I also must praise Hermione's part of the plot. The story loops created are usually fraught with problems. This one is done with care, and works great. Looking back, the change in tone is what drew me into the Harry Potter franchise. It is the first great Harry Potter movie and in my opinion, the best of the lot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Abstract and dark themes abound; still the most mature HP entry,"Alfonso Cuarón's masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script.First-time and young viewers will likely enjoy the film for its merits based on plot and 'adventure' alone, but it takes multiple viewings and a critical eye to enjoy the abstract ideas and nuances. Cuarón himself credited the source material as being laden with real-world issues: oppression, racism, loneliness, power, friendship, justice and so forth.This is the Harry Potter film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. For instance, the ending is bittersweet at best and retains a healthy amount of ambiguity.If you've never read the books or understood the acclaim of the series as a whole, watch Cuarón's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and you'll understand why this entry is clearly the zenith of the seven.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A visual feast with bite,"Harry Potter is growing up! The voice is deepening, the shoulders are broadening and...hurray! You no longer feel like a creep for having a little crush on Daniel Radcliffe...whoops, did I say that out loud? Say what you will, I see him making the jump from child star to adult actor in a way that Haley Joel Osment only dreams of.Appropriately, this third film in the Harry Potter series has matured along with it's young stars. At first glance the storyline itself is relatively simple - Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and young Harry is on his hit list. But the reality is that this movie is about being a teenager and all the trials and tribulations that go with it. On one level, Harry is like any other kid at school - he puts up with torment from bullies, gets into scrapes with his teachers and hangs out with his friends. But this is not just any school. This is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry has a whole OTHER set of problems. Like an escaped madman who may just want to kill him, for example.The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. The focus is on Harry's past - Sirius Black was his godfather but just may have been in league with he who's name cannot be mentioned. There is the usual game of 'are they or aren't they?' when it comes to deciding which characters are really the baddies. Alan Rickman continues to walk the finest of lines between good and bad with his marvelous performance as Professor Snape. Has there ever been a better match of actor and character? Snape shows again that, while he may take occasional delight in making his students' lives difficult, he does have their best interests at heart - like any good teacher. Other plot quirks worked well - I enjoyed the way the time travel angle was worked in and the map showing the location of everyone in Hogwarts was a delight.Visually, this is a much darker film and it is a sumptuous treat for the eyes. There is so much incredible detail in the sets that it's impossible to absorb it all in one sitting. All the staples from the other films are there - the paintings talk, the staircases move, ghosts roam the halls - watch out for the knights on horseback crashing through windows! The special effects are all top notch. A word of caution for any parents - there are some genuine scares here. The Dementors are particularly nasty, and I would certainly think twice about letting very young children watch this film. This is without even considering it's running time - two and a half hours - which is a very long time to expect some children to sit still.One of the most impressive things about this film is the way that the young cast are more sure of themselves. As Hermione, Emma Watson grated in the first film with her occasional woodenness. Pleasingly, she has grown into herself as an actor and her performance here is much more mature. A leading lady of the future, perhaps? Hermione is growing up and is tired of being taken for an irritating goody-two shoes know it all. Rupert Grint provides comic relief and Daniel Radcliffe gives an outstanding performance, considering the whole film rests on his shoulders. Harry is the hero - the audience needs to identify with him. By the end of this film teenage girls will want to take him home to mother, while their mothers will just want to take him home and adopt him!New cast members acquit themselves well. The role of Sirius Black was tailor made for Gary Oldman - he has a requisite creepiness with just a dose of humanity to bring the character to life. Daniel Thewlis is good as Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts master who takes Harry under his wing. Emma Thompson is amusing as a Divinination professor with bad eyesight. She can see into the future but can't tell which students are falling asleep in her class!Many have criticised Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore. While it's true that he is no Richard Harris, I personally was pleased that he didn't attempt to imitate his predecessor. Gambon is accomplished enough a performer to stay true to the character while at the same time putting his own stamp on it.Take away the magic and monsters, and what you have is a coming of age movie. Harry is forced to grow up and confront both his past and his future, and come to terms with the reality that he is no ordinary wizard. With the spectra of 'you know who' continuing to loom on the horizon, roll on film four!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Film of the Series; One of the Best Films of All Time,"I wish Alfonso Cuaron would come back to the franchise. I know that he probably won't, but I still hope. After all, as we float through this empty, depressing world, sometimes all we have is hope. He detached this film franchise from its safe-as-a-CIA-file roots and allowed it to grow wings and fly into a silver ether. To anyone who thinks franchise films cannot be art... check out LOTR. But once you are done, check out this film. It is both ironic and darkly appropriate that this is both the lowest grossing Harry Potter film and the one that many film critic types, such as myself, say is the greatest of the octology.The film starts off like do all Harry Potter books and most Harry Potter movies. Potter is at the house of his over-the-top, abusive, Muggle adopted family, getting tormented like he always does. Yes, I know it is explained in detail why he needs to stay with them, but such doesn't make it any less of a poor writing choice. But, when and if I do a full review of the Potter series, I'll go over those kinds of decisions.I only bring this up because it is a base line for these movies and such something I can use to show why this is the best one. In the Columbus films, it is played with a cheerful exaggeration that reminds me of many of his eighties movies. This is not a bad thing, but it is not brimming with greatness either. In the Yates films, it is downplayed as just a backdrop, a facade, if you will, to more serious matters. Cuaron manages to combine these approaches, which is expected, as both this and GOF are the 'transition movies', while adding both sophistication and a level of charged rawness, which is not expected.We get to see Harry's emotional landscape. Fragile but potent, unstable but unyielding, it is a sight to behold, one that belies the simpler character that we got in both the earlier and later movies. If Harry Potter developed along these lines, he might have actually been a great character instead of the flattest one among a crowd of interesting people.The scenes are magical, but not in the try-hard way of the first two films. Around the time that I first saw them, I declared myself a true blue of the series. I haven't looked back since. The shots are magical in a way that is both wispy and intense. This is the tone that these movies should have taken, and if they reboot them, something of I am not in favor but something that is a conceivable possibility in today's Hollywood climate, this is the tone I would like them to try to take. Just the thought of that sends chills down my spine. It might even be able to challenge LOTR for the crown of best fantasy series of all time.After that virtuoso opening, I kept waiting to be let down. I never was. Every new character introduced was interesting and every old character they excluded was not missed. The pacing is the best out of the movies; the first two were too slow and the other five were too fast. The plot was more personal to me than the other movies; this is the one movie in which Voldemort does not appear in some form or another. There is no direct end boss and so the plot has to be more creative. And so it is.Of course, more of the credit for this has to go Mrs. Rowling for writing the book on which this film was based. But the cinematography is all the work of Cuaron's team. And it is the best in the series by far. Not to say that the other movies are poorly shot; this is Britain, after all: things may be bad, but they are never badly done. But while the cinematography of the first few movies would perfectly fit a kid's fantasies, the cinematography of the fourth movie would perfectly fit a high class ball or gala, and the cinematography of the last four movies would perfectly fit a nature doc, the cinematography of this film perfectly fits the franchise.It is artful and well-done, but it is not show like an Oscarbaity period piece. The camera feels alive and coated with magic powder. It is exactly how I imagine the heartbeat of a troubled magic society to feel like. The music helps it out. If you listen to Window to the Past and are not sucked into the world Cuaron made for this film, then you just don't have a soul. It is introspective, ambient, immersive, and coated with the kind of cerebral wonder that I think makes life worth living. It is the best tune in the franchise. But do not think it is the only good tune in the movie. Buckbeak's Flight is a good second.While the characters in the series may never be willing/able to turn back time after this movie for reasons cheap and nonsensical and borderline nonexistent, I hope that you will be wiser. Come back in time with me to 2004. And let the emotional waves of this picture overtake you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Charming and Extraordinary,"As with previous Potter films, this one is wonderful. The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts.Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a slightly different character in this film as the anger inside of him for what happened to his parents has grown over the years. This made, for me, the film much more enjoyable than the first and second.As one would no doubt assume, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the character Sirius Black is nothing less than perfect. However, Sirius Black seams an unlikely roll for the talented Oldman. I enjoyed him more in other films, such as 'The Professional' and 'Immortal Beloved'. Let us hope he has had the chance to 'play it up' a bit more in the much anticipated 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.The original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. Williams has created memorable compositions such as the theme music to 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.Overall, any age should enjoy this film. The visual effects are not the most spectacular I've seen, but fantastic enough to take your imagination away from the real world for 141 minutes. Even the closing credits are kind of cool.Now, go watch the film. You'll be glad you did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
a mixed review,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a ""fan film"". By this I mean the makers have made the assumption the majority of viewers, the core audience - are fans of the Potter series. As a stand alone film would leave a viewer confused by a fast moving plot devoid of a lot of detail contained in the original book which the film quite closely follows. To fully appreciate the movie, prior knowledge through reading the book would be most beneficial, it would allow you to fill in the many blanks.Concepts, background, and explanations are skipped in the movie, which gives it a rushed, incomplete feeling, even for a Potter fan. Users have commented the movie is darker, this is somewhat true, it definitely has a different feel from the first two films, much of this can be attributed to the new director. He has changed the sets considerably, to the point where they barely resemble the first tmo films. The fine cast of adult stars is under utilized throughout the film. Maggie Smiths role could be considered a cameo for the limited screen time she got.Overall the rest of the film is acceptable. If I didn't previously know the plot I would rate this film lower than I did. Though this IS Harry Potter and he still has the midas touch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Felt Rushed,"I saw this when it first came out, and thought...hmm...what am I missing?This is the highest rated movie in the series on every platform. Critics and fans alike rate it highly.I have only read the first book. Which of course invites judgement for reviewing it when I don't know the source material.Well, I recently watched this again. And read some of the reviews as well. Critical reviews point out that there are big chunks of the original story that are missing, glossed over or warped to fit the director's focus. Director, Cuaron, who happens to be thought of very well in Hollywood circles. So that's probably a little of the ratings bounce this gets.I also found that while the central three did a nice job acting wise, some of the supporting characters were a bit...off. Tom Felton (Malfoy) seemed too broad and cartoonish in his malevolence. A sharp contrast with his tortured, nasty turn in The Half Blood Prince. Hagrid, always a bit of a goof, struggles with the spectrum of true despair, and the lighter spots of this installment.My last complaint is the ending. A frozen still shot of Harry flying toward the camera feels line a cheat. Run out of time? Did the original ending not please the director? Was it just a lazy choice after cutting so much meat from the original story?I don't have that answer, but the end was jarring. The audience in the theater I saw it in was filled with gasps, as in, ""Is that it?""
Two girls sitting behind me complained that it didn't follow the book closely enough.So roughly two decades later, I feel there are parts that are good, but ultimately it feels rushed.Sue me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the Harry Potter films so far,"This third Harry Potter film is the best one yet. Director Alphonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien, A Little Princess) has taken over from Chris Columbus and has stuck less slavishly to the original JK Rowling Books.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back as Harry, Ron and Hermoine, with Hermoine in particular getting to do a lot more. There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling's third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass. And the new CGI-scripted character Buckbeak the Hippogriff (half eagle, half horse) looks fantastic and has personality.The kids are all supposed to be thirteen but look older - hey we'll forgive them. Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he's almost unrecognisable.Great performances from Emma Thompson hamming it up as the ditsy professor of foretelling, Prof Trelawny, Michael Gambon as the new Professor Dumbledore (not as magical but good), David Thewliss as Prof Lupin, and Gary Oldman as the Prisoner of Azkhaban.Thrilling, complex, menacing, ****/***** stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A darker offering but still as magical,"I have to admit that when I first saw the PoA, I didn't receive it as warmly as the previous two outings. However after viewing PoA again at the cinema and subsequently on DVD, I tend to believe it virtually as well done as Chamber of Secrets and hence slightly less than Philosopher's Stone. There are still the little tricks and quirks that make it 'Harry Potter' and all characters returning are great... except one. It was with great sorrow I heard the passing of Richard Harris and therefore I tried to look with respect and allow that Dumbledore is replaced by Michael Gambon and give him the benefit of the doubt. However the shoes of Richard Harris are too big for him to fill. The majesty of Dumbledore is not the same and regardless of good intentions, it detracts from the movie.But the story is interesting and engaging, though sometimes had to be explained to a younger audience. The special effects are fantastic. The kids are growing up and a lot of the silliness is disappearing, but then again (apart from the constant Radcliffe cheesy smiles) was that silliness part of the magical innocence? PoA is another good solid episode for the Harry Potter empire. And I still find it refreshing to escape the Americanised offerings that is usually the norm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A hacked job - a sequence of scenes that tell no story.,"From the beginning, I felt as though I'd come in 5 minutes into the start of the film; as if I'd missed some beginning section, thought I was there from the previews on. This film never got to telling a subset of the story of described in book 3, but rather was a collection of scenes depicting parts of the book, but never evolved into a coherent plot-line that one could follow or feel. I'd read the book; all the books, in fact. That did not help and so I feel those movie goers who had not read, but mearly came for a good film were even more confused and disappointed.Clearly, there was too much material to cover in the 2hours 20-something minutes of the film (does that count the last 10 minutes which is all credits?). As to be expected, some of the story had to be left out for the sake of brevity. However, this, being my favorite of the books, resulted in my least favorite of the films. And its not even related to the new, leather-cap wearing Dumbledore, whom I could get to like, despite the drastic change in appearance that was not necessary. No, its either the direction, but surely the editing or production thats too blame.For one, the scenes didn't seem to flow into a store that brought the viewer in. Then, the look of Hogwarts was totally different than the previous films. Sorry, when you are part of a series, you MUST stick to those things that have been established in previous films. Hagrids house is not down a rocky slope from the school and the whole thing is not on a mountain side as depicted... at least not from the previous films. To that I say BOO! Bad job on all responsible. Thanks for ruining a promising and wonderful world. Get off your high 'my artistic vision' horse and do the damn series the way the fans and the previous films and the books have set it up. No one gives a 'wormtails'-arse what your artistic vision of the story is. Really, we don't.Where did all of these 'standing stones' come from? Nothing of the sort was ever mentioned in the books, neither was Lupin having a mustache. If there had been a mustache - Rowling WOULD have mentioned it. Which, by the way makes me wonder, what the hell was J.K. doing other than making sure the director and producers didn't bugger up the film?In stead of wasting time on a needlessly long bus sequence and pointless whomping willow vs bird encounters, they could have spent more time telling vital story elements. A few mentions of Hermione showing up to class in the middle of it all doesn't cut it for setting the stage to her actions. Snape making 'one' mention about the 'potions' Lupin should have been taking..., if thats it, you chould have left that out since the director/producer didn't bother to develop the whole Snape-Lupin-Potion situation at all.The film felt rushed and cramped. Knowing the story, I barely could follow the events. For those not readers of the book, I feel pity for what is surely total confusion.If there is extra footage on the floor, I pray they do put it into an extended version for DVD ala Lord of the Rings.Learn your lessons and don't fudge up the next film, ""Goblet of Fire"", which is to already be shot and I'm expecting in the editing process now.If this is the vision of the current director, I say, bring back Chris Columbus as soon as possible.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"So dark, I love it","This is one of my favourites of the franchise because I love Sirius Black and time travelling. Harry Potter's universe was still full of surprises at this point and the films never failed to impress. I also noticed a better soundtrack as well - not that it wasn't already pretty good in the previous ones, I just liked this one better. Oh, and RIP Richard Harris (this is the first one with Michael Gambon).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the three,"Although this film isn't all that I'd hoped it would be, I believe that it was the best of the three 'Harry Potter' films so far, thanks largely due to director Alfonso Cuaron. In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.The child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.The adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!One of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.However, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to.Also, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.At the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A valiant effort bringing a truly complex book to screen!,"This is certainly darker than the first two instalments, and not as funny. But based upon a truly excellent but complex book, it is a very good film nonetheless. In my reviews on the first two films, I forgot to mention the music by John Williams. In all three movies, it is very good, but not Williams's best work. His scores to Star Wars, ET and Home Alone are better. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying, a lot more chilling than they were in the book. All in all, very good. 8/10. Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"awesome special effects, decent plot","I think movie wise, this was the best of the Harry Potter films. The story was OK, but of course the books are better because they have so much more detail.The special effects are incredible. At times, it looks realistic. Like when Harry is flying on the half bird/half horse creature. The animal looks like it has depth. Another example is the extremely fast bus Harry catches a ride on at the beginning. It's refreshing to see a film with good effects that don't look like they belong in a video game.The acting by the kids has gotten so much better than in the first film. Too bad some of the teachers aren't featured more like they are in the books.FINAL VERDICT: If you have watched the first two films, then I'm sure you'll be watching this one. But, if you have never read the books are seen the other movies, then you best not start off with the third film because you will be lost.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The good and the bad...,"Like most Harry Potter fans, I found this movie disappointing. I felt that Director Alfonso Cuaron choose style over substance, which is never a good thing in a movie.Some critics say that the previous movies were too stiff in how they stuck close to the book. THAT IS THE POINT!! If I want to see a Harry Potter movie, I want to see the book, the plot, brought to life. I don't want to see the plot changed.However, I must admit, I loved the darker, more Gothic look of the film. The books are taking a turn for the darker and this movie sets that tone.But there was so many plot holes, so much left out. It was hard for this HP fan to ignore. This book, while the smallest of the 5 out there is crucial. This is my main complaint with the movie.It introduces Lupin, Black, and Pettigrew, all of which are important to Harry, as they fill in the gaps of his past.In this book, you discover why Snape hates Harry, Lupin, Black, and James Potter. This is important later. The relationship between Snape and Harry is important to the Order of the Phoenix.Who is Wormtail, Prongs, Moony, and Padfoot? What is and who created The Marauders map. And why is Black an Animagus?The above are all questions that the movie leaves unanswered (but are in the book).I would have sat through another hour to hear the explanations and see the full story. Instead, plot points replaced by unnecessary (but yet funny) cut scenes. Not a good thing.Buckbeak looked great; the CGI was very well done. The time warp effect was also cool. I was disappointed in how Lupin looked as a Werewolf, I thought they were more hairy.The best part of this movie - the acting. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are growing into their roles and as actors. Although Radcliffe could have actually shed some tears during the Hogsmade visit. Tom Felton was great as Draco, who tries to be brash, but is really a coward under it all. He played it excellently.The adults were also fantastic. Maggie Smith was the stern, yet almost motherly Minerva McGonagall. We needed to see more of her; she only had about 2 lines. Robbie Coltrane comes back as Hagrid and he plays the part perfectly. Emma Thompson plays a wonderfully flaky Sybil Trelawney. Michael Gambon had a tough role to fill by following Richard Harris. Gambon brings his own slant to Albus Dumbledore, which in this movie was a bit off-kelter, but I think as we get used to him in this role, it will seem more natural.Alan Rickman.... He is the most underrated actor in this movie. The critics seem to ignore his astounding acting in these films. He is absolutely fantastic in his role as the sharp, harsh, angry, but troubled Severus Snape. Any lesser actor would have made Snape flat, but Rickman gives him life and dimension. Also, he has some of the greatest lines in this movie. ""Revenge is very sweet...""Gary Oldman was good as Sirius Black, but we didn't seen enough of him. His confrontation with Rickman was emotion filled and was one of the best parts of the movie. I wish it had gone on longer.Timothy Spall plays a disgusting and revolting Peter Pettigrew. He looked the part and played it well.Remus Lupin was played by David Thewlis. I was not sure what to think at first; I was hoping Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from Buffy) was going to get the part. But Thewlis was excellent, he made Lupin a character you liked and cared about, a feeling you didn't get from the book. But Thewlis makes you feel that for the character. He got a fair amount of screen time, but I wanted more. Fantastic acting. I can't wait to see him come back in the next few films.All in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an good movie, as long as you don't compare it to the book or other HP movie. The plot holes really damage the film. The acting and the feel of the movie are great, but still don't quite make up the difference.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Film of The Series,"Of The 7 films made this is very much my favourite and l would give it 9 out of 10.The reason l like it so much is that, 'spoiler alert' Harry discovers Sirius is his godfather. Strangely, he reminds me of my own Uncle because of his hairstyle and mannerisms and this adds to the whole experience.My favourite character is Dobby, a house elf, cleverly incorporated in the film by CGI, who is a continuous help to Harry and his friends. I found him to be very funny and added a really light-hearted feel to the story.As in all the films there is some difference in the storyline to the books but l think this film is the closest to the adaption.Whereas It is best to watch all 6 films in order, this film could stand alone as a classic.If you have seen or like Fantastic Beasts, this film will be a must for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What a letdown!,"After the first two movies, I expected something similar although the tale was maturing with its characters. What I received was an incredible letdown. I realize that a different director meant a different movie, but I at least wanted a clear and understandable movie. The take jumped from scene to scene, often without connecting information. If I hadn't already read the book, I would never have known why characters were acting the way they were. Also, did anyone notice the altitude change of Hagrid's house? It wasn't that low on the mountain before, was it? I gave this movie a 5, and I'm fervently hoping for a better try next time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Dark and Impressive Film,"Harry is maturing and becoming more and more involved in that past that has brought him here. Sirius Black becomes the spoken adversary, but his presence is a bit obvious and we moviegoers are a suspicious lot. The three compadres begin to work together in more productive ways, moving the action rather than being moved by it. Hermione begins to become more flesh and blood here and deports herself well. Harry is now dealing with the horror of the potential end of his life and must make his way, discovering clues along the way, knowing that everything isn't always as it seems. Hagred and his hippogriff are pretty cool in this one and the unraveling of the plot with those spooky wraiths guarding Hogwarts is really captivating. There are a few rules that could bear some explanation. I've not read the books and would probably benefit from an occasional explanation. I'm ready for the fourth installment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Way to go,"Wow. I love the new direction. The style fits the movie perfectly. I also think the kids acted much better in this one. I really hope they don't get rid of Daniel Radcliff, even if he does get too broad in the shoulders. You can't swap horses mid-stream. Also, did anyone recognize the kid who played Neville at first? The biggest problem that I had was that there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain, such as ""Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs."" I think that it may have been hard for those who hadn't read the book to understand. It also didn't show that Harry's Patronus was a stag, which I thought was important. And Harry's eyes aren't green (which is mentioned at least once in each book), but that's a minor thing. I felt that the style fits the book well. I go back and read the first book and think ""Wow, how young they all are, how naive."" The books age, and I think that comes out in this movie. I hope they continue to follow the same path.All in all, I loved the new direction and the movie itself. I can't wait 'till the next one comes out.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best in the series,"Harry leaves his adoptive family and returns to Hogwarts.This is a very strong entry to the franchise.The Prisoner of Azkaban is a decent story with good character moments. There is not much I can say about the plot without spoiling, but it involves the mysterious past of certain characters and some temporal magic that makes for an exciting conclusion to the plot.Like many movies based on books there is a fair bit of exposition dialogue and this does not always result in cinematic moments, but it makes up for it with good visual storytelling through most of its running time.It has some of the best cinematography of film series. One long take where the camera follows different characters through the great hall in Hogwarts is terrific. The effects and spectacle are generally very good.The ensemble of acting talent is as superb as you would imagine. Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Pam Ferris, Timothy Spall, Emma Thompson, Richard Griffiths and David Thewlis are on great form. My personal favourites are Alan Rickman, who amuses with virtually every word he says, and Gary Oldman, who lives and breathes Sirius Black with fantastic emotion and energy.The central three characters are portrayed solidly by the main stars, who with age appear to get stronger in performance.For me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfects The Harry Potter Formula.............,Just such a achievement to me. The character development dives so much deeper in this film then the second (not to put anything against the second) and it works so good. Each character they introduce and continue on are very likeable in there own way. I think this is the only franchise that doesn't have a single character I don't like. The plot develops very far and brings in so much more world building opportunities. Which is always a good thing in the Wizarding world. This movie definitely feels darker but still has that childhood magical wonder to it. Overall this was a great film and is easily one of (if not the) most watchable movie in the franchise.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why The Prisoner of Azkaban is the Best Harry Potter Film,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stands as one of the definitive films in the entire franchise. Why? Well, for starters, you've got Alfonso Cuaron-a true master director-taking the reins of a franchise that had already made its mark, but needed a fresh breath of creativity. Cuaron's vision elevated this film beyond your typical franchise entry, and that's where the magic truly happens.The cast had matured, not just in age but in their acting chops, and that made a world of difference. But it's not just that. The darker tone of the film matched its growing themes, and Cuaron made some very bold choices that paid off in spades. Case in point: Gary Oldman's casting as Sirius Black. It's not often that an actor makes such an impact with relatively little screen time, but Oldman's presence is felt throughout, looming like a shadow in Harry's mind.What really sets this film apart, though, is Cuaron's directorial approach. The introduction of the Dementors-something fans of the books had eagerly awaited-exceeded expectations. Their first appearance, with the ominous loss of light and those terrifying glimpses of the creatures through the train window, is nothing short of haunting. Cuaron doesn't rush to reveal the full extent of the Dementors; he lets fear build up gradually, allowing the tension to mount as we grow more connected to the characters and their struggles.Another standout choice was the way Cuaron brought the presence of Sirius Black into the narrative. Instead of relying on endless exposition, Cuaron uses the moving photographs in the newspapers to subtly remind the audience of Black's looming threat. This, paired with the shadowy and eerie atmosphere of the film, gives us a haunting portrayal of Black that lingers long after he leaves the screen.All of this culminates in Prisoner of Azkaban standing as the only Harry Potter movie that feels like a fully realized film in its own right. It's not just a great entry in a franchise; it's simply a great movie. It stands apart as the finest film of the series-hands down. And it's not even close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"While still a good movie, it's the worst of the series.","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the worst film in the series, because too much of the style has been changed. Chris Coloumbus set a standard for how the Harry Potter universe should look. He had everything done a certain way, and it was perfect to the Harry Potter mythos. Now, a new director has come aboard with a completely different vision, and he did it his way.The story and the settings are dark, which is accurate to J.K. Rowling's book, but the style of everything seems off. In the first two movies, they wear their wizard robes through the whole film. In this, they wear their normal clothes. There's no reason given, and this isn't from the book. The story seems to rushed because the director cut so much out of the book, and then didn't come up with a way to connect everything that's in the movie. This movie just isn't as enjoyable as a Harry Potter film. It still provides a fun time of course, but it just doesn't feel the same.As always, the performances are top notch. Gary Oldman is perfect as always in the role of the wicked Sirius Black. David Thewlis is great as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher with a dark secret.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Anorexic,"There are some sensationalist reviews here that believe the hype that everything Harry Potter is great and give the movie five stars regardless (the book of Azkaban was definitely a 5 starrer) but this movie ain't so great I'm afraid.Prisoner of Azkaban is my fave Harry Potter book so far (and was more than welcome after the weak Chamber of Secrets) but the translation from book to film loses 90% of JK Rowling's story.Every single second, every frame of this film is utterly devoted to being nothing but pure exposition for a plot that has no mystery intrigue. If you have read the book then there isn't much point in seeing this as you'll already know the twist. But I didn't want this to bias my opinion so I gave it a go anyway.As I have said, there are no subplots. Everything focuses on the Sirius Black story. Character development and mystery are non-existent. It almost feels as if Harry, Ron and Hermione are the only students at Hogwarts because no one else gets a mention and Draco Malfoy is reduced to wimpy, comic-relief. The strangest change of all is the presence of Dudley (a funny character) with NO dialogue at all.I liked Professor Lupin in the book, he was a rebel, renegade teacher who broke the rules and was one of the best mentors Harry has ever had. In the movie he doesn't do much and the character never really comes through. Same goes for Snape (a character I am liking more and more), he barely has two lines to say. Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore is cool and naturally authoritative but he's got nowt to do either. Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny has five minutes of screen time and Hagrid has two scenes.The relationship between every character and situation is very much defined in the book. In the film all of that is stripped away in order to tell the Sirius Black story as quickly as possible. Which would be fine if the Sirius Black story could make the film stand on its own but it doesn't.Alfonso Cuaron may bring a new look to the film and a more modern edge but I blame him and Steven Kloves for the hasty rearranging and muddling of JK Rowling's story. Sure, some sacrifices had to be made in adaptation but they've diluted the story to the point of obscurity.There were rumors of Goblet of Fire being released as two separate parts (ala Kill Bill) but Mike Newell got overambitious and stripped about 90% of the story out of that one too. At this rate, Order of the Pheonix, will be the worst yet.For a much more atmospheric and exciting mystery try Young Sherlock Holmes. A film with many alarming similarities to the Harry Potter world. This movie may look good with a new director doing a fresh take on the Harry Potter universe but there are so many restrictions weighing this franchise down and it's REALLY beginning to show.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Directing and screenwriter stand out in perfection,"Everyone's favorite of the Harry Potter movies is the first one, right? A close second place for me and my family is the third installment: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not only is the story very interesting, fast-paced, and full of mysterious twists, but director Alfonso Cuaron turns ordinary exposition shots into works of art. After seeing the same castle and sets the past two movies, it's intriguing to see them filmed differently. It reminds you to pay attention to details as well as the big picture, and it subtly tells you that you'll need to see the movie at least twice to understand its full potential. There's a famous transition he films through the clock tower that's continually gorgeous no matter how many times you've seen it.Onto the story: Once again, Daniel Radcliffe starts the movie unhappy in the home of his aunt and uncle, Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths. This time around, since he's entering his teenage years, he gets fed up and runs away to the wizarding world before summer vacation has ended. Everyone's worried about him because there's been a prison break from Alcatraz-I mean, Azkaban-and a dangerous criminal, Gary Oldman, is on the loose. Entering his third year of school with all that on his mind, he still has to deal with the hostility of his least favorite teacher, Alan Rickman, taunts from the school bully, Tom Felton, and the presence of some very scary guards hanging around the school who are on the lookout for Gary but might kill anyone else on accident. Hogwarts sure isn't the safest school out there, is it?Believe me, that's just the start of the plot, and as the film progresses, you'll be endlessly fascinated by the story. Screenwriter Steve Kloves managed to sew the scenes together tightly without making anything feel rushed, and since the audience already knows the ins and outs of the Hogwarts world, there's no time spent on explanations or exposition. There are a few new additions in this movie, of course: the Marauder's Map that shows the locations of everyone on campus, Hagrid's pet Hippogriff, the speedy public transit for the wizarding world, the Dementors and the special spell that repels them, and the new ""guest star"" teacher, ¬¬¬David Thewlis, who's very sympathetic and easy to like. Keep an eye out for Julie Christie, who has a cameo as a pub owner, Emma Thompson as the ""psychic"" divinity teacher, and Timothy Spall.The only blot of imperfection on an otherwise perfect film is the replacement of Richard Harris with Michael Gambon. Even if you managed to get used to him in later films, it's quite a shock to have him installed in this movie. Not only does he look nothing like his predecessor, but he's fashioned differently and delivers every line as if he thought to himself, ""How wouldn't Richard Harris have said this line?"" If he truly did have a vastly different interpretation of the character, it would have been nice to ease the audience into it. The replacement couldn't have been helped, unless a huge change to the rest of the stories was made-had the school given a very sad but touching funeral for Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall been promoted to Headmistress, the rest of the stories still would have been functional, and with an added boost for feminist viewers-but we'll all miss Richard Harris's twinkling blue eyes and kind, sensitive delivery.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
*A Journey Through Shadow's *,"In a cinematic landscape where magic is often merely an escape, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" emerges as a profound exploration of adolescence, fear, and the shades of morality that define us. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón, this third installment of J. K. Rowling's beloved series marks a definitive turning point in the franchise, infusing the tale with a darker, more mature aesthetic while deftly preserving the wonder that captivated audiences from the start.From the moment the film opens, we are whisked away into a world that feels simultaneously familiar and hauntingly new. Cuarón's unique directorial lens transforms Hogwarts into a character of its own-its shadows stretching longer, its corridors whispering secrets. The vital theme of time is interwoven intricately, echoing in both the plot and visual motifs. The famed Time-Turner serves as a beautifully conceptual device, representing not only the manipulation of time but also the weight of choices and the inevitability of consequence.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint deliver performances that showcase their growth, not just as characters but as young actors. Harry grapples with the specter of his past, Hermione wrestles with the burdens of genius, and Ron exemplifies the heart of loyalty against the trials of friendship. Within this dynamic, the introduction of Sirius Black, portrayed with a haunting intensity by Gary Oldman, adds layers of complexity to Harry's story. The bond between them is a poignant reminder of the familial ties that bind us, alongside the grave realities of loss and betrayal.The film is a kaleidoscope of artistry. The whimsical yet unsettling design of the Dementors evokes a chilling sense of dread, symbolizing the darkness that lies within us all. The exhilarating Quidditch matches take on a new, sweeping grandeur that mirrors the highs and lows of Harry's emotional journey.The soundtrack composed by John Williams, intertwines seamlessly with the narrative, elevating key moments and deepening the emotional resonance of the story. The haunting melodies linger in the mind long after the credits roll, leaving viewers enchanted and introspective.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is not just a film; it is an experience-one that challenges us to confront our fears, embrace our identities, and understand the intricacies of love and sacrifice. It beckons us to look beyond the surface of magic into the depths of what it means to be human, making it a unique gem in the wizarding world. This film is a reminder that while magic exists, it is the choices we make that ultimately shape our destinies. A true masterpiece that resonates with both the young and the young at heart, this installment stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling in its most enchanting form.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Expecto Patronum!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is easily the best of the Harry Potter films, and there is one simple reason for that: Alfonso Cuarón! After two films done by the capable, but workmanlike Chris Columbus, Warner Brothers realised their needed a stronger storyteller for when the Harry Potter films started to turn darker, and an excellent Mexican director stepped into the frame.Set during Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts a murdered named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) escapes from Azkaban prison. Sirius was believed to be a follower of Lord Voldemort and its believed wants to kill Harry. The Minstry of Magic use a creature called Dementors to protect Hogwarts from Sirius. The Dementors can suck out happiness and the live out of people, which has a really powerful affect on Harry considering his past. Harry asks for help from the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) to help him defend himself against the Dementors. Harry overhears that not only does Sirius want to kill him, but that he used to be a friend of his parents. Sirius betrayed them, telling Voldemort where they were hiding, and kills their other best friend Peter Pettigrew. Harry swears he will kill Sirius for what he did.Cuaron has such visual flair to directing which Columbus lacked. He knows action and where the camera should be based or follow, such as the fight scenes and the scene involving the Whomping Willow. He got the pacing right, making the film shorter then the previous two, and he focused on a characters and the story. He also offered some very stylist shots, worked well with the special effects (using both CGI and traditional techniques) and got the best out of his actors. He builds the relationships between the characters, especially Harry growing anger and need for a father figure. Cuaron also shows that he is much better at handling the darker elements of the story, whilst still having time for some physical humour. The main three actors, Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all improve a lot from the first films. Radcliffe and Grint show that they have good potential in the acting world after the Harry Potter series, whilst this is Emma Watson's best performance in the film. Adding Gary Oldman into the cast is always a good way to improve film straight away, and David Thewlis is a fine addition to the film. Michael Gambon is a good replace for Richard Harris who sadly died in 2002 and Alan Rickman has a lot more to do in this film then in The Chamber of Secrets. In novel terms, Prisoner of Azkaban was when the Harry Potter started to improve and look at darker themes. It is also the only novel/film where Voldemort doesn't show up as the main protagonist in some form. J.K. Rowling, screenwriter Steve Kloves and Cuaron all hand the third act involving time travelling with real talent and tie-up all the sub-plot which was needed.Best of the Potter films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"True to the spirit of the book, though not to the letter","I think this third installment of the HP series is remarkable in that, with a consistent and contagious dark atmosphere, it brings out the psychological dimension of Harry's adventure, and illustrates that his struggle in his own psyche is as fierce as that on conventional battlegrounds.Cuaron¡¯s rather idiosyncratic vision as a director has instilled this movie with a memorable artistic identity, hereby making it something considerably deeper than an ordinary kid¡¯s adventure flick.Surely the action sequences are eye-catching, but what I've enjoyed more is the in this film is its suggestive cinematography, and the drama tension among the characters. Ron and Hermione's bickering is more naturalistic, and gives just the right amount of hint for an impending romance.I would hope that Tom Felton kept his hair glued, but, well, he is still the definitive Draco Malfoy. Daniel Radcliff has progressed a lot as an actor---in fact, I think he has a more difficult task since Harry is in many aspect a more interiorized character in the book, and I hope that Daniel may stand up to the challenge when Harry gradually comes to recognize the dangers lurking in his inner abyss in the fourth and fifth book. Alan Rickman's performance as Snape is simply divine. I am also very excited at the addition of two superb actors in the Potter series---David Thewlis as Lupin and Gary Oldman as Sirius. I'm refraining from giving away too much here,but how breathtaking when extremely intense scenes involving Snape, Lupin, and Sirius are delivered by these impeccable performers!The visuals of this movie are stunning as usual. I particularly like the Wimping Willows seasonal change scenes, and Buckbeak's flight. I am also glad that Williams has made a new set of music for the movie, more haunting,dark,suspenseful,yet at the same times grotesquely humorous---exactly the right colors of the magical world that Rowling created.Of course, this movie also has serious flaws---yes, I'm talking about the failure to fully introduce the Marauders. I think it would only take five minutes more to integrate this necessary background story, without which non-readers are left very confused about the plot, and fans of the books are severely disappointed.There are also some glaringly tacky and out-of-character moments, such as Ron echoing Snape in calling Hermione an insufferable know-it-all. I hope in future movies Ron, Harry's best friend, can stop being a mere comic relief, and present a more in-depth character revealing his loyalty, kind heart,and,even more interestingly, momentary jealousy toward Harry.Despite the flaws, I still enjoyed the movie tremendously. It is true to the spirit of the book, though not to the letter.I only hope that the forth and fifth films would be even better---for, hey, Rowling's books deserve that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A solid work of art.,This movie marks the departure of the lightheartedness of the previous movies into a much more serious and somber journey.

Such mixed feelings about the movie...,"When I first saw the theatrical trailer for this movie, I wasn't impressed with it. The trailer was disjointed, it had very odd editing, an odd pacing, it was very short, it showed one scene that I hated the first moment I saw it (Hermione marching down a hill, yelling at Malfoy in the oddest tone, and then punching him... there's just something about that scene that I hate).Now the trailer represents the movie in a way, but the movie was at least well-made as a film. The thing I really didn't like about the movie was that it was so freakin' short! A little over two hours is just tooooooooooo little time to tell the story. It should have been longer. WAAAYYYY longer. I would have liked to see a three+ hour movie. Return of the King length at the least! The big problem of the short running time was that so much got cut out. The pacing is odd, the ending is very abrupt, but the cut parts of the book are the biggest reason that the film should have been longer.They should have taken the time to:1) set up the Firebolt when Harry is at the Leaky Cauldon/Diagon Alley. It would have taken like 10 seconds, and was pretty important when we get to the end of the movie.2) show the Quidditch House Cup scene. IMO, this is what made book 3 so great. Without it, the movie doesn't have a perk. Would have been a GREAT scene!3) Show the proper ending on the train, when Harry gets the letter from Sirius. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WASN'T IN THE MOVIE!4) Show the proper beginning, when Harry gets all the ""Owl Post"". They never mention his birthday, they never mention how Ron's family got the money to go to Romania (or was it Egypt? I dunno). And by the way, how did Harry perform the ""Lumos"" spell under his sheet without the Ministry of Magic noticing it? He's not allowed to do magic outside of school (as we see later), and I'd like to know why he was allowed to perform that spell!5) show the Sir Cadogan scenes. I don't know if these scenes were filmed, and were just deleted, since we do see Sir Cadgogan moving around in the pictures in the scene with the Fat Lady disappearing, and I'd of liked to see him taking over the entrance portrait.Other than that, most of the deletions were justifiable, and acceptable.Now... Things they shouldn't have put in:1) the freakin' shrunken head in the Knight Bus. Enough said.2) Hermione punching Malfoy. I already mentioned this scene. As great as it is to see her hitting Malfoy, I just seriously dislike this scene. Emma Watson doesn't deliver the ""you, foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"" line very well, and the horribly clichéd ""That felt good."" like afterwards is just so cringe-worthy. I easily could have done without this scene. I'd prefer her slapping Malfoy after he calls her a Mudblood down by the Shrieking Shack. It'd be simple, and more effective.Things that should be changed:1) Dumbledore. Micheal Gambon is a fine actor, and of course, I never expected anyone would be able to fill Richard Harris' shoes, but... I DID expect better. Micheal Gambon just doesn't have the Dumbledore touch. He doesn't have the proper wise feel that Dumbledore should have.And what was with the bells tied around his beard??? God, I was just itching for those to be gone in at least one scene! Speaking of which, why'd they make his hair so short and cragly? And why is it so gray-looking??? Dumbledore's hair is clearly described in the book as long, straight, flowing SILVER hair!!! Richard Harris' Dumbledore had the absolute perfect hair! And they go and change that too!!! For crying out loud, THIS is the main reason why Micheal Gambon's Dumbledore just didn't look like Dumbledore. His look determines the feel you get from him, and they completely ruined it by changing his hair. I can't express how much I miss Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Of course, there's nothing anybody could do, but they COULD have re-cast better, and they COULD have kept the hair the same.2) What was with Goyle being re-cast? Anybody know what this is about? I mean, if the original actor didn't want to do it again, fine, but why they bloody hell did they cast a skinny, small guy to play the part??? Goyle is supposed to be huge and brute-like. What the hell was that all about??? When I first saw him, I was like, ""Who is that??? Don't tell me that's supposed to be Goyle!"". Whoever the casting director was on this movie should be fired.3) what the BLOOODDDDYYYY HELLL was with Hagrid's Hut being re-located??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? It's not only inconsistant with the other movies, but it's wrong in regards to the book as well. Who's stupid decision was that? Same with the Womping Willow, for that matter.And what's with the ugliness???Both Ron and Draco got way uglier between Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban. Ron looked great in CoS, and Draco looked cute and hot as hell. Then, in this movie, they both look different, they've changed for the worse. Why was Draco's hair changed? His hair was perfect in the first and second movie. Really showed his sly, slick evilness. Now, he looks like his mom cut it with a bowl on his head... what the hell???Daniel Radcliffe looks pretty hot in this movie tho!OK, now that I've gotten all the bad stuff out of the way (I'm pretty sure I got it all...), onto what I liked about the movie:I liked that the movie seemed to be taken more seriously. The dark feeling of the book was captured, and Harry's maturing was shown rather well. Daniel Radcliffe has obviously matured as an actor, and he doesn't say lines like he's reading them from prompt cards anymore. I liked the film-making aspects of the movie as well. The visual effects were very good (although I think they were a little bit better in Chamber of Secrets. Not quite as noticeable.), and I loved the shots where we go THROUGH the clock. Buckbeak was pretty well done (although he should have been a little bit bigger).I liked how they handled the scene with Aunt Marge. Harry reactions to her were pretty good, and the whole blowing up thing was done quite well. Even though it seemed rushed, it was pretty good.Towards the end, the movie just got so great all of a sudden. Right from the scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione sneak out of Hagrid's Hut, up until the end when Harry and Hermione come back into the hospital wing, the movie was great. The Time Turner thing was done well, and the little things that suggested the Time Turner were great too (the rocks (or whatever those were) being thrown into the hut, Hermione seeing something, the Executioner axing something). All handled very well. And the scene in the Shrieking Shack was great. I saw the movie with someone who hadn't read the book, and when Lupin hugs Sirius, she was like, ""So predictable. The trusting ones are always evil."" She fell to the trap of thinking Lupin was bad too. It was hard for me to resist saying, ""No, Sirius is good!!"".To be honest, I've never had such mixed feelings about a movie. I don't know whether to hate the movie because it was so different from how it should have been, or to love it because it was so different. To be honest, I'm very, very, very, very, very glad that Alfonso Cuaron is not directing Goblet of Fire. I just don't like his style. I really do wish that Christopher Columbus had kept directing, because the first two movies were great as movies AND adaptations. PoA is great as a movie, but terrible as an adaptation.I just hope this Mike Newell guy sticks more to the Columbus side of things for Goblet of Fire... AND RE-CASTS DUMBLEDORE!!! ...and puts Hagrid's Hut back where it should be! .....and he better keep the ""Riddle House"" chapter in!.......and the Quidditch World Cup! ..........and make the movie more than 3 hours long. Goblet of Fire better be a long movie!Overall, I'd give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban a 6/10, because I did enjoy the entertainment side of things!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Best Films in the Franchise,"This movie is such a creative shift in the saga. Alfonso Cuarón directs a masterpiece that introduces us to Dementors, and a complex and harrowing Prisoner named Sirius Black. The lighthearted tone of the previous films turns into a dreadful and riveting journey in this movie. This is one of the best Harry Potter films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
JK And The Film World At Its Best,"I liked this film so much, I read as many of the negative reviews as possible. (In an attempt to remain balanced!) Here, JK is at the height of her literary powers. So, I can completely sympathise with the dedicated book fans who shout loudly regarding the curse of film-making... Plot editing and adaptation.Despite the limitations of filming, one has to remember just how successful a writer Jo has become. A quick glance at her book sales will inform you of an astonishing achievement. To date: 400 million copies sold ... We may not be able to turn out a well-appointed table lamp in England anymore, but we sure produce the occasional literary genius.Am I wrong? Let's examine The Prisoner Of Azkaban's gorgeous list of well-drawn characters for a moment. There's the flawed, but caring Remus who takes Harry under his wing. There's the misunderstood, yet poignant outsider, Mr Sirius Black. There's a new, more determined and stronger Harry, a shining model of boyhood in a world where boys often remain maligned, or sidelined. (In this way, JK brilliantly punctures the absurd reverse-sexism that blights society).But let's not forget the girls..! Here, Hermione is redrawn as a courageous, chin-thumping adventurer. She takes the initiative, disseminates common sense with easy candour, makes intelligent decisions while the wizarding world dissembles. And most of all, she's a fierce friend. Every boy's dream? Almost certainly...But back to the film... The plotting here is immaculate. We're on a poignant journey with Harry from the moment he steps aboard that incredible bus. There's humour, there's suspense, there's a feeling of movement (so hard to capture with genuine precision on film). There's the brilliant casting decision to appoint Mr Oldman as Sirius. (He's played difficult parts before, namely his extraordinary portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK). In this sense, the casting choice is inspired.Emma Thompson's wonderful Professor Trelawney served as an enjoyable comic counterpoint in a film that was layered with foreboding. Emma is clearly enjoying herself as the bespectacled diviner. A small part for one of our finest English actresses, but By George, she makes the most of it! And let's not forget Timothy Spall. His sudden transformation into the crumbling, scabbed Wormtail lifts the film just at the right moment, due entirely to Spall's notable acting abilities. The other actors suddenly have opportunity aplenty to react and carry the narrative forward.Not only this, but we have the rarest of rare finales. A movie that makes us all feel better. Sirius wins his freedom. The true betrayer is unmasked! The Fab Three have matured and earned their stripes. Harry even has the semblance of a real family once more.Thank you J K Rowling. The fans may be correct that your story was mutilated, the hogwart's crowd may no longer be in uniform, the school and its grounds may have changed beyond all recognition, but these minor elements did nothing to detract from a thrilling, absorbing tale well told.Highlights:Fudge: ""Come now Harry, we don't send people to Azkaban for blowing-up their aunts!""

The best in the entire series!,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was directed by Alfonso Cuarón and is the third entry in the Harry Potter franchise. After the second movie, ""Chamber of Secrets"" felt just as childish and very similar to its predecessor, the decision was made to hire a new director for the next instalment. This was not only justified but also much needed for the series, as this is the first movie that is a lot more dedicated to its characters and generally feels much more suited for adults through its dark themes.This flick features amazing cinematography, unbelievable art-direction with immaculate framing and scenery, great performances by the entire cast and probably Steve Kloves' best screenplay of the entire series. What stands out most about this movie though is Cuarón's inspiring direction and how everything comes together greatly in this transcendent cinematic adventure.I haven't seen ""Y Tu Mamá También"" yet, but I am a big fan of Cuaron's work so far. His work in this movie is great, however he still improved significantly in his later projects. His (at least in my opinion) best work so far and science-fiction masterpiece ""Children or Men"", his space adventure bursting with groundbreaking cinematography ""Gravity"" that led to many oscars for its technical achievements, including best director and his latest feature ""Roma"", which Cuaron did not only get his second oscar as a direction, but also for his production and as director of photography.Anyways, back to the subject. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is not only my favourite Harry Potter movie by a long shot, but it is actually so good, that it can easily hold up with the best of the genre. This is probably due to its dark and gritty themes, which make the movie feel so adult like. This is actually the reason why the next film ""Goblet of Fire"" is my least favorite of the entire series, but more on that in my next review.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A darker Potter... could have used more humor...,"What strikes me most about this third Potter film is how truly dark it is during its two hours and twenty minutes of storytelling. Darker both in theme and in cinematography. Although the photography is striking at times, too much of the film is enveloped in darkness which is going to make a lot of the special effects look a lot less intriguing when it makes its transition to home video.This entry is first-rate entertainment all the way. Daniel Radcliffe looks considerably more mature than he did previously but his acting remains largely one-dimensional until he is moved to anger. The early sequence where he puts a hex on a boorish aunt by inflating her like a balloon is the most whimsical touch of magic in the whole film. All the other magic is mostly on the dark side and this is precisely what's wrong with this Potter entry--not enough bits of humor to lighten up when things get too tense. Apparently, kids will love it anyway.Standouts in the cast are Alan Rickman's hateful Snape and Emma Thompson's brief turn as an off the wall professor. Largely ignored is Maggie Smith who barely matters at all--another case where her zaniness would have injected more humor into the dark plot. She no sooner delivers a few lines than she is gone for the rest of the film.Most outstanding special effect is the half-eagle half-horse creation (the Hippogriff) which does an amazing job of looking both real and frightening as it takes Harry for a wild ride in the sky.Emma Watson's Hermione could have used some dubbing to clarify her spoken words for American audiences and Rupert Grint continues to be the most amusing of the leading trio with his expressions of fright or disbelief. Both have settled easily into their roles. Robbie Coltrane has some nice moments here.Imaginative and abetted by a nice background score--but a bigger dose of humor would have balanced all of the darker aspects of the tale. Noticeably missing is the sort of quirky humor that pervaded the first Potter film directed by Chris Columbus.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Greatest of the bunch,"After the success of the first 2 films, the producers knew they needed to step up their game with this one, so they started off with a change of directors with the talented Alfonso Cuarón. Out came a heavily darker, but better developed sequel with great performances and awesome visuals. The additions of David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were flawless and the cgi was impressive for the time. A must see!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The ""Harry Potter"" franchise at (broomstick's) cruising speed...","Animaguses and werewolves, a flying hypogriff, which is a pleonasm, night buses, talking paintings, time turners and so on and so forth... all these exciting products of J.K. Rowling's fruitful imagination blending with centuries of fantasy literature, bloom as smoothly as naturally in the third opus of the Harry Potter's series: ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". I liked it a lot and I was surprised by how much I liked it.Indeed, after two movies, I started to notice patterns within the structure ... sometimes they enhanced my excitement, some others, I wasn't quite sure whether I wanted to experience them again. For instance, I knew the film would start at the Dursleys and I was wondering what kind of mischief Harry would inadvertently cause, I wasn't disappointed and Pam Ferris sure got what she deserved for insulting his parents. I also liked that for once it was Harry going out by himself telling viewers in all subtext that Harry has grown up and wouldn't take it anymore.I was also expecting a few newcomers: as the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher, Professor Rupin, David Thewlis proved to be a nice addition and so was Emma Thompson as a Professor Sybill Trelawney. I expected of course a new villain, and seeing Gary Oldman introduced as Sirius Black, the man who caused the murder of Potter's parent, I expected quite a climax. But all positive expectations put aside; in all fairness, there was something perplexing about the title.""Prisoner of Azkaban"" made me expect a prison (duh!) so I visualized a high dungeon or a dark tower over a high cliff with many passageways and corridors inside. Which means that after the claustrophobic and unnerving journey around the ""Chamber of Secrets"", I wasn't too excited by the premise of another in-door adventure. So you can imagine how much I enjoyed ""Azkaban"" and its departure from the usual settings. Most of the adventure takes place outside Hogwarts, and features great exterior shots. It says a lot that the film wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Set Design.However, it was nominated for Best Score and Best Visual Effects and on that level, the film is an absolute delight. ""Secrets"" was made of variations from the previous score because John Williams had a busy year but here, he makes a spectacular come-back with a score that is as heart-pounding and triumphant as any fantasy epic, far from the ominous and whimsicality of the original score. And the visuals remind us that CGI reached a point of maturation in 2004, though Alfonso Cuaron, the newly assigned director, didn't let them overtake the film and the best computer effects are never obtained without the involvement of some practical ones.So ""Azkaban"" is an outdoor adventure, perfectly suitable for three protagonists whose ages are around 13 or 15 and seem more fit to be running over a hill, flying on an apogriff or finally punching the odious Malefoy in the face, than any riddle to solve within the confined walls of Hogwarts. It's like the scope of the adventure was too big for the school and allowed us viewers to have some relief and a share of fun as Harry attempts to catch Sirius Black and avenge his parents' death. That would be too linear of course so within his journey, many obstacles will be set as well as many opportunities to unveil many secrets.And that's the mark of the best franchises, they don't touch the pillars (the leading trio, Dumbledore, Hagrid, Snape and even Malefoy) they enrich the gallery with new protagonists and plot elements, but they also dig deeper in the past and reveal a whole chain of events that preceded Harry Potter, as if the story was only one link of an epic chain, one that involves so many characters the franchise start to strike as a real universe where each member gets into a passage rite consisting of a substantial contribution to the plot. In ""Secrets"", Ron took part to the climax without Hermione, ""Azkaban"" allows Hermione to finally shine and contribute to the resolution. Characters start to act like heroes on their own and not just foils.And all the teachers and courses are left to the backdrop. Seriously, I didn't expect the film to be contain such a great deal of escapism but it says a lot about the seriousness upon which Rowling and the Warner Bros studios considered the franchise and insisted on maintaining this capability to precede the viewers or the readers' anticipations, to surprise them. And that's the least one would expect from a series dealing with the world of wizardry, isn't it? And any innovation works because we're getting used to the world of spells and magical formulas so we can accept any new trick as long as it has rules of its own.And it all comes down to that last nice time-playing twist I didn't see coming, and that could have been contrived if it wasn't foreshadowed in previous scenes. Yes, the Harry Potter plays tricks with us but never without elements of foreshadowing, even some that weren't meant to foretell anything. Yes, they play tricks with us, and in retrospect, they often work. : from a simple pet animal that hides a terrible secret to the explanation of why Hermione is so studious and always ahead of her schoolmates.Though the story didn't get darker than ""Secrets"", it goes deeper in Harry's fears and traumas and features some of the most frightening creatures after you-know-who in the Dementors (the guardians of Azkaban). But the tone is quite lighthearted and the film has more the flavor of a teen adventure than a fantasy movie, but don't get it wrong, it's still a Harry Potter, and the series is definitely at cruising speed. Broomstick-wise of course.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Gambon is not Dumbledore,"As a huge fan of all the Harry Potter books, I have been somewhat disappointed in all the films, but my biggest complaint is the miscasting of Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore!Richard Harris was wonderful in the part and captured perfectly the combination of gentleness and power that is paramount in the books. Gambon, on the other hand is overly emotive and not at all gentle. He appears inadequate as Dumbledore and every time I see him, I feel like walking away from the film. I would bet that Gambon never read the books, or read them and disliked them.I've tried to recast Dumbledore and think that Michael Kitchen would have been wonderful in the part. Of course he's much shorter than the character, but this is not as important as his other qualities. His demeanor in Foyle's war seems to match those of Dumbledore very closely. He's smart and authoritative, but also kind. And he appears to be holding onto many secrets which is a true Dumbledore characteristic.So, I've reduced my score from a 9 to a 7 and this is largely due to my dislike of Gambon as Dumbledore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Some good performances, but bad replacements. The better Potter movie to date.","After finding that the second movie was much better then the first and then seeing the trailers for the third, I was really under the impression that the third would outshine the first two. The comments were that it was much darker and adult, and that was backed up by the trailer.Oh sure it was better than the Philosophers Stone, but better than Chamber of Secrets? Surely, with the more adult storyline and the darker mood, surely it was better. The Director had even been changed, and that could make it go either way.Well I wasn't so much disappointed as not excited enough. Yes, it was darker and much more for an adult audiences taste with an extremely clever plot, but there were still some problems with it all.Firstly, the eighty minutes of scene setting and build up, in that time we hardly see anything that's really concerned with the final part of the movie. Just the usual character settings and plot explanations.Then there are the standard plot deviations to explain something new about the Potter universe, and once complete we pop back into the story. This is fine, but in this movie I felt there was too much of that.Yet again, as with the other two films, there is the ending and the many unanswered questions. For example, why doesn't Professor Snipes say anything about Harry blasting him, what happens to the Dementors and why were they after Harry in the first place on the train? There are lots of these and mostly popping up nearer the end of the movie.There's also one of the major plot twists just happening with the wet fanfare of a single trumpeter. In fact the turn happens so quickly and without notice you do suddenly wonder why and what the hell just went on.Unfortunately, I do think Michael Gambon is a great actor, but not as Dumbledore, not as a replacement for the late Richard Harris. His acting and mannerisms are totally wrong for the part and present more of a bungling old man rather than the wise and all knowing character that Harris portrayed.Still, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson are very good in their roles. Also the effects were excellent in this movie, in particular the Dementors, the Hypocrate creature and once again the spider! The story overall is much more enjoyable and more representative of a movie plot line than the other two. The darkness and maturity also provide for a much stronger and watchable movie, however the shortcomings are still too much for me to overlook and really be taken into the film and the world of Harry Potter.I think it will now become very interesting as to how the stories progress with such obviously ageing actors in the lead roles and a new Director for the next movie and a new Screenwriter onboard after that. For me, I would like these changes to be for the better, although sticking with Alfonso Cuarón for another movie might have been a wise move.We can but wait and see. As for the DVD, the same issues are in this DVD as before, the extras are difficult to get to and you never really know what each menu option is for.

This Movie is not worth the money,"1. This movie is the worst of the three. 2. The director decided to create a whole new set for the movie....So Hogwarts changes between year two and year three. 3. The firebolt scene is so cheezy, what is he playing at, this is not some cheap B-rated crap he is filming in Mexico, this is a million dollar production, at least take some filmography classes or something. 4. The filming is horrible, completely like a home-video type thing. The camera was too close to the characters. 5. The director also americanized the movie too much....where are the uniforms....they do not go prancing about the school in casual wear. 6. Who gave the director permission to change such large chunks of the script. Skip some scenes, thats OK....but do not change the damn story. 7. The director also rushed the dialogue. These people are English...and when the English speak (properly that is) they speak slowly so it can be understood....not the rushing that he was telling his actors to do.8. The Quidditch players do not have numbers on their robes. 9. There is no giant clock that you can look out of at hogwarts. 10. The shrieking shack is not a small castle. 11. The entire story-line has no depth...I don't think he (the director) read the series, he probably read only the third book, and that too he didn't understand half of it. 12. Oliver Wood and Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup is a huge factor in this book. 13. Peter Pettigrew is supposed to be shorter than Harry not taller than Sirius. 14. Padfoot is supposed to be bigger than the werewolf. 15. The dementors do not fly, they glide along the surface. 16. And since when do they suck out the life in turns....Their presence alone make it chilly, but the only time they come in contact is to perform the Kiss. 17. The list goes on and on...At least in the other two movies, Hogwarts did not look so small, and it was definitely better filmography....Also if anything was missing it was an entire scene....unlike this one where the story itself was changed....I think JK Rowling would have something to say if she was present during filming...Here's an idea, have her consult during filming, to check the authenticity of the movie....This one was CRAP - sack the Director, get a new screen-write.

Black Could Be Anywhere,"It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry.Of the first three Harry Potter films, this is by far my favorite. The atmosphere shifts to a darker place, which may be partly due to the story and partly due to the new director. Besides the darker images, I like the characters introduced here -- Professor Lupin, the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor thus far, and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is my favorite character in the entire series. We also have the Hippogriff, which is a fantastic creature, and Doby the house elf. And a time travel element that plays out just as effectively -- and with more sense -- than ""Timecrimes"".Harry Potter purists may have some complaints here. Hermione now has normal girl hair rather than the wild, frizzy hair, making her less of an outcast that she may be supposed to be. And they spend very, very little time in their school uniforms. Of course, they are more often outside of the school grounds, so that explains itself. I was curious why Ginny never appears even once. Perhaps she does not appear in the book, but at this point she should be becoming a more important character.There is a line in the film that really stands out: ""Black could be anywhere.""

"New Director, Same Old Fun","The third Harry Potter film has finally arrived in cinemas after a rather long two-year wait. Alfonso Cuaron takes over at the director's chair while erstwhile director Chris Columbus becomes a producer.  It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and this time he must face a new foe in the person of Sirius Black an escaped murderer from Azkaban prison who is out to get Harry.There is always a risk for a successful movie franchise to take on a new director especially if the previous one did a good job. Well I got to say that Cuaron has justified his hiring as he has done a great job in crafting this film. He was really able to capture the dark moments of the film and I as a viewer was able to feel feelings of fear and uneasiness. I also felt that some of his rather unique camera angles were really good. Really breathtaking stuff that added to the overall feel of the movie.I thought that the effects were great. The dementors looked really menacing and scary. The Hippogriffs also looked good. Even if the effects were not in a grand scale like ROTK, they still did great job in crafting these creatures and make him look real.In terms of its story I felt that it was much richer and deeper than the previous films. Definitely a much darker and deeper story, which really helped the film in the long run.I wasn't so convinced with the performance of Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore. I guess it may be because Richard Harris did such a great job in previous films that anyone who takes over pales in comparison. Harris' had a unique atmosphere which Gambon didn't have.Even though the story places the characters a year after the previous film some of the looks much older than that especially Daniel Radcliffe. I guess you really can't blame the cast, as they cannot film every year just to make the grade. I would be really interested to see how the cast look for the fourth film.Overall Cuaron did a great job in creating a great film. I must say that this is the best Harry Potter movie so far. It is really a shame that this will be the only HP film he will be able to direct.

Best in the Series.,"Review:
'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is a fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It is based on J. K. Rowling's novel of the same name and which is the third instalment in the Harry Potter film series.
This movie is where the franchise starts to get darker while its core audience gets more mature. Alfonso Cuarón brings a dark tale which feels like a Soviet revenge story and it's so good!
The story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and intends to kill him.
I feel like Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor in this movie. That's unfortunate because all of these focus around him, and this is one of the most important movies in the series. When he was in a scene leaning his Patronus with Professor Lupin, he was good, and I was invested. But when he learns a secret about Sirius Black and gets angry, he doesn't do a good job at showing emotion. It took me out a bit. However, everybody else brings their A-Game. Gary Oldman being brought into the series is fantastic, and this is the first time we see Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is fine, but I did find myself missing Richard Harris as the soft spoken and wise Professor.
This is the 'Harry Potter' film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. And above all else it is beautifully shot and edited.
Overall, in my opinion this is the best in the series. It has so much story to tell and adds important characters to the main story of the series.

"Great in places but a jerky, 2D adaption.","I have really been looking forward to this film for a long time since I thought the first two films were excellent and this was a MUCH better book/story. The previous films had worked very well even though they left quite large parts of the books out, there was a continuity and a flow that was true to the spirit of the books. Unfortunately this can not be said of this film, and for this I am grateful that the Director is not making the next film in the series.So what is good about the movie ? Well the special effects are great and there are some really good moments when the main characters really do get you involved. However the cuts have been so savage that the character development of the supporting roles has been trashed and the extra scenes added actually made the film worse.Do you know the film Scrooged with Bill Murray and how he butchered Dickens ? Well when I left the theatre, that was how I felt that this movie had turned out. A lot of the characters had their development removed and were nothing more than cardboard cut outs, Hermione is now turning into a typical Hollywood lady (holding hands through chase scenes etc.) and what happened to Mrs Weasleys development into a Mother figure with an edge. No linkages into the next book such as Quidditch World Cup, Sirius Black's letter, threatening the Dursley's to take Potter back (would you after he'd blown your sister up ?) just took the shine off the whole book.I really hope they get back to basics and follow the book more faithfully for the next film. If they do that then we are in for a real treat, if not then they will lose many millions of pounds/dollars/euros in lost sales and will probably damage the reputation of the remaining films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My childhood love!,"It's just the right point in the line of 7(8) pieces, the slow beginning of the dark, in all directions. The story gets intensified in many ways and the plot gets deeper. Our performers grow older and the first deeper steps into the history of magic are taken. The ties in our characters are more developed and naturally attuned to the environment of the more dangerous world.*The glow of childhood is slowly fading*The only tick I still have to give, or rather I would recommend, is to read the book. It explains many points in more detail, and some chess in the story makes even more sense. It gives the film that *ahaa* feeling even more.Part 3. Is just my best of all

Tremendous,"Absolutely outstanding special effects. Daniel Radcliffe bounce back into acting his third Harry Potter movie; Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban. Things get challenging for Harry in this movie, he finds out that Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come for him. As Harry is in Hogwarts School with his fellow friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermonie (Emma Watson)he faces new classes such as approaching Buckbeak, the Hippogriff and learning about shape shifting Boggarts and how to transform them in to something hilarious. Then Harry's worries of Sirus Black are getting deeper, when he founds out that he is lurking around the Hogwarts grounds to find Harry.Also soul-sucking deadly dementours are also lurking outside the castle walls...Harry has a lot of mysteries to face in his third year of Hogwarts...Especially Peter Petingrove...Daniel Racliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and the cast all deserve an Oscar for all their hard work and achievements. Also, I understand the crew spended millions of money to make this magical movie for us, so they should all deserve an Oscar for that as well. I would recommend this movie to people ages 7+ despite the lack of fantasy. So grab your popcorn and snuggle up in the sofa and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A change in direction...,"Returning for a third year at Hogwarts, it's time for a change in director and a change in tone - resulting in a more grown up feeling film than the first two. There are some genuinely creepy moments here, certainly for any kids watching, and the plot is somewhat more complex than the earlier efforts, with double crosses and time travel elements. I have got say though, as much as I did enjoy this film, it felt very much part of a bigger picture as opposed to its own self contained entry, and as such as viewed as a standalone film struggles to work. It starts assuming you have seen the previous entries, and doesn't really end with any sort of payoff. Its better than chamber of secrets for sure, and an enjoyable watch as part of a saga, but on its own feels like a stepping stone to more. Still, the Dementers were cool, and the main trio are noticably becoming more confident with each film...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Series Darkens,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series, and marks a new departure for that series in several ways. It was the first in the series to be released in summer; the original idea was for the series to consist of seven films, one of which was to be released at Christmas every year between 2001 and 2007. This schedule proved to be over-ambitious and the third film was released in midsummer 2004 rather than Christmas 2003.The film also saw a new director, Alfonso Cuarón taking over from Chris Columbus who had directed the first two films, and a new actor in the key role of Albus Dumbledore, Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris, who had died in the intervening period.Finally, the film marked a darkening in the tone of the series, something possibly attributable to the change of director but also to the content of the original novel. The ""Azkaban"" of the title is the prison which holds wizards who have violated the laws of magic, generally by using their powers for evil ends, and the ""prisoner"" is Sirius Black, a wizard who has succeeded in escaping from the prison. It is assumed that Black is a supporter of Lord Voldemort (the arch-villain of J. K. Rowling's universe) and that his intention is to kill Harry Potter.The perceptible ""darkening"" in this episode is both literal and metaphorical. In a literal sense the film is bleaker in appearance that its two predecessors, with many scenes being shot at night or in dim light. Cuarón uses a much darker visual palette than did Columbus. (David Yates uses a similar palette in the most recent Potter film, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""). In the metaphorical sense the film is certainly more scary than anything in the first two films. Although this is the only film in the series in which Voldemort does not appear directly, much of the plot revolves around Rowling's most terrifying creations, the Dementors.Harry, who in the first two episodes was played as a young boy, now emerges as a rather rebellious, truculent teenager, and Daniel Radcliffe does well to suggest the difference. There are good contributions from two newcomers to the series, Gary Oldman as Sirius and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, the seemingly mild-mannered new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who turns out to be a practising werewolf. (Rowling's names often have some relevance to the character's personality or attributes, Remus being one of the twins in Roman mythology who were raised by a she-wolf). There is another good contribution from an established cast member, Robbie Coltrane, as the genial West Country giant Rubeus Hagrid, now promoted to Teacher of Care of Magical Creatures. Gambon, however, does not yet seem quite at home with the difficult task of taking over a role first created by another actor. (He was to improve in subsequent episodes).Overall, I did not enjoy the film quite as much as the first two, possibly because by 2004 the concept no longer seemed as fresh and new as it had done in 2001. There is, however, a lot to enjoy; scenes I found particularly memorable include the journey through the streets of London on that triple-decker bus and Harry's ride on the Hippogriff Buckbeak. This was also the first film which revealed that Harry's parents were named James and Lily; as my name is James and my wife is Lily we have decided that should we have a son we will name him Harry. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best movie in the franchise?,"Wow, just wow! This movie is incredible! It has everything; great acting, excitement, amazing storyline, great new characters, and just an awesome vibe to it.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the best movie in the franchise, it has everything a Harry Potter movie should have. We can see that the main characters, Harry, Ron and Hermione, looks older. In the first two movie they look like kids (which they were), but now the look a little bit older, like teens, which makes the movie a little bit more ""mature"". It doesn't feel like a child movie like the first two movies.I remember when I was a kid, I was very scared of Sirius Black. Even if I'm not scared of him today at all, he makes the movie so much better! It gets darker and more mysterious. Dumbledore also has a new actor which. Is kinda noticeable. Because this Dumbledore feels much more forward and he's also funnier. Professor Lupin is also an amazing character and I really like the connection he and Harry gets.The difference between this movie and the first two movies is that as I said before, not too childish. Plus that the movie has no flaws. I can't tell one thing I'd do different if I had to do the movie. The ending of the movie is also incredible, very exciting and the ending is also so good made and how they work with time throughout the ending. Harry also gets more vulnerable in this movie, he gets angry, sad, scared and everything in between. Hermione is also so enjoyable this movie. Her intelligence and bravery is very much shown.To sum thing up, probably the best movie in the franchise, everything about the movie is perfectly made and I have probably seen this movie at least ten times, but I'll never get bored of it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
All grown up,"The third installment in the Harry Potter series sees a significant progression from the cinematic style established in the first two films. Not only is the overall storyline much more dark and sinister, but Alfonso Cuaron, who has replaced Chris Columbus as director for the third film, has revamped the entire Harry Potter ambiance and presentation style.Cuaron's intensely emotional, visually-oriented, darkly humorous style gives lends the production the air of an adult film; it could not be further divorced from Columbus' perky, energetic, vapidly funny touch that moulded the first two installments as family movies. Understandably, this will upset many fans of the first two, but what has really thrown the viewer base is that Cuaron is not afraid to play fast and loose with the plot in order to better synthesise the film's overall image, continuity and message, which, while it makes for a better film, alienates fans of the novels looking for a flawless adaption.I personally believe, however, that to truly appreciate the movie, one needs to simply forget the book that inspired it, and attempt to enjoy the show. Cuaron's direction, despite his disregard for the traditional adaption style, is superb, with brilliantly atmospheric cinematography, mise-en-scene, emotion, and subtle humour. The talented cast rises splendidly to the challenge of the film's new style (with the exception of Michael Gambon, who is woefully unconvincing as Dumbledore), with great performances from Emma Thompson, Rupert Grint and Gary Oldman. It's disappointing as an adaption of the book - but, as a stand-alone film, it shines. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Superb jump in quality,"It's the same writer, so what changed? Simple, the director.
Alfonso Cuarón showed his talent, ingenuity and imagination, to bring to life the already good scripts that were wasted in the first two movies.It did help one more year for the kids to grow and get better, yes. But being ""darker"" didn't, like so many say. The second one was as dark, but the director just wasn't that good.Here we have way better exectution at the same type of scenes, with better dialogue, better pace and a way more mature structure. While the first two had this pattern: ""the kids investigate; danger; they are saved; they are lectured; REPEAT""; here we have a more mature film, with the story revealing its details slowly and naturally.The score, already good, also improves with the use of cassical and classical folk beyond the Orquestal, making it more adequate to handle the different type of scenes and moods. Amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Care for tea?,"As a Potter fan, the world is a rather sad place to be hanging around. It's a matter of principle, no more, no less. The refuge one may find in the books is comforting in an enchanting way, but can the films be so as well? After watching HP's one and two, nay was all that I could say. Both films were somewhat played down in quite a few regards and despite differing only in details from the books, they both achieved the tremendous performance of boring me to a paralysis-like state. Surely enough, there were things I liked, but reality and fantasy remained two separate things: you can't get a Harry Potter without taking him from the muggle world and the muggle world simply needs time to learn and to grow up. And they did, all of them, those little brats, all for Harry's sake and under Cuaron's guidance!What makes HP 3 a much more enjoyable ride is the sense of existence with which the characters are finally bestowed. They are leading a life of their own and the kids finally learned how to show that on screen - obviously, with Cuaron's help, who was more than able to reinvent Rowling's universe in a way only a true visionary could've done. Columbus wasn't up to the task, for all that mattered in his case was the frame and not the painting itself! It's very important to be able to guide children and the only real way to do it is by making it feel natural. So Cuaron did.The third book is probably the best one to film due to the plot, mainly. That's one of the reasons why it plays out so well as a movie. But the fact that the kids have started to grasp the basic concepts of acting and the stunning visuals create a new world for us to taste have had an undeniable positive influence upon the end result. This new film is good because it finally shares the spirit of the book: the innocent hope, the complicated issues of life (and death), the reasons which make us tick the way we do. It's a step in discovering who the heck you really are, who the heck Harry is and what he is becoming. The ""wise words of Dumbledore"" are always powerful and mysterious, in the sense they really should be. And it's good this way, because there so much more behind them and we want to want to be intrigued. That's what Cuaron managed to do, he created a world which leaves enough unanswered questions as there can be. Finally someone who understands the essence of the book. Finally something fresh and exciting. That's the way HP is supposed to be!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Darker and thus better than the first two but still far too baggy and slow,"Its Harry's third year at Hogswarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry and he returns there in a rush having accidentally used magic at home. Forgiven for this by an understanding Ministry, Harry learns that the murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and is supposedly coming to finish his killing spree by murdering Harry. With the cruel and ruthless Dementors circling Hogswarts looking for Black, Harry resides in fear until he learns the truth about Black and longs for to find him and extract his own revenge.Meanwhile many other secrets await exposure within the hallowed walls.I was able to see the first two films of the HP series on video at a friend's house for free, which was fortunate because I certainly hadn't been interested enough to pay to see them in the cinema. However, having seen the first two and enjoying them more than I expected, I decided to go and see this one; before I talk about the film let me rant for a minute. First, how very cynical (but unsurprising) that this film has the longest run of adverts (not even trailers) I've ever seen at the cinema  all during them I could hear children bothering parents that they 'want that'  it just confirms that many studios see these sort of films as big seller rather than films. Secondly, this is a dark film with a plot  if you have a group of children who are all younger than 5 then this may not be the film for them; you know that, so why bring them  just say no! Third, if you do bring them then try to control them  chances are they will not be able to sit still for 2+ hours so bring them a colouring book or a soft toy  don't just let them run up and down the stairs. Anyway, as you may have guessed my viewing experience was made more difficult by children who shouldn't have been there but I stayed calm and remembered it wasn't their fault.The film itself is darker and therefore I enjoyed it more  the change of director has made a great difference in that regard. The plot is also more interesting and is based more on characters and tension that the other films. However this is not to say it is great; because it isn't. No, the film has all the flaws of the earlier films and it is far too baggy and long for one thing. I know fans of the book will cry that it should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in and I wouldn't mind any running time if the film can support it; sadly this film cannot even support two and a half hours and it feels like it is dragging at times. The plot is good but it's delivery could have been tightened up a great deal just by minor snips and the further simplifying of the story  it is meant to be entertainment and, if the long running time takes away from the 'fun' it delivers then it has failed and needs to be trimmed further. The effects are better used here and the darker tone is delivered well in many ways; I enjoyed the shadows and the crueller characters even if some of the aforementioned children clearly didn't want to be in the cinema for much of it!The cast suffer from the same problem as they did in the other two films  being too heavy in names who are mainly underused. Radcliffe is better again and seems to be taking the film with him as he matures. Watson has less to do than in the other two films and I didn't think the film served her well; Grint is comic relief and pretty much that's all he does. Oldman needed the work and has said that in interviews but I still thought he did a good job even if his performance is too much one way then the other (as the plot requires him to be). Thewlis is a temporary addition and it is obvious to even those of us who have never read any of the books that he will be a key part of the film  but his performance is mostly good. The rest of the cast is cluttered and mostly not really used very well, although the impact of this is minimised by them being in a series rather than just being underused in one film. Rickman has almost nothing to do, Gambon is a poor man's Dumbledore, Smith barely says a line, Coltrane just does his usual stuff, Emma Thompson is funny and hams it up a fair bit but Spall is poor and it is annoying to think he is a key character. The rest of the cast features well known faces in (deliberately) small roles including Lenny Henry (doing his usual rubbish accent thing), Dawn French, Paul Whitehouse, Mark Williams (who looks like he'll say 'which was nice' at any moment) and special mention to Ingleby who will be loved by all Spaced fans as the thug who doesn't know where 'it's too orangey for crows' comes from in the funniest episode of that great sitcom!Overall this is an OK film but no more than that. I enjoyed it and felt that the darker tone made it a more interesting film even if it chickens out from going very dark in terms of content and feel. The plot is too rambling and the whole film needed to lose another 20 minutes or so to be a tighter more enjoyable film but I can forgive it that, even if I was bored at times. The cast are mostly wasted again and the film is more a product that an actual film but I was still glad I saw it and will watch the next in the series with the ongoing hope that they will improve. Not great but maybe worth watching once and certainly an improvement over the first two in the series.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Prisoner of Azkaban,"Most proclaim this to be the best of the franchise. I'm not sure I concur. The sense of wonder that Chris Columbus brought to the franchise makes way for something, well, darker. Not only in storytelling but also visually. Man, this is a dark movie. I don't like desaturated color palettes in movies and this is somewhat of the posterboy for desaturation.In other places Alfonso Cuaron does bring his A-game. I liked how the movie followed the flow of the seasons. The whole of the third act, where the movie turns all Back to the Future II on us, is very elegantly done. Rupert Grint is thankfully disposed off for much of the runtime, saving us from his incessant mugging. Watson and Radcliffe have grown as performers and are likeable leads. Appartently Hogwarts has changed their uniform policy over the course of the summer break, cos all the students nog run around in their civvies, another point where this movie stands out.The stellar supporting cast (Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson) get precious little to do. They have to make way for the two new additions to the ever sprawling cast: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman, both very good. As an adaptation it works very well. Some of the side plots are ditched, but nothing too important is thrown out, something that would occur in the later movies.Prisoner of Azkaban is a key moment in the franchise. It's the one where innocence is lost and magic gets scary instead of magic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprisingly Awesome,"I would like to mention that Alfonso Cuarón has done a great job. The treatment of the movie is totally different from the previous installments. The magical world has not only grown much darker but it has taken for of a thriller. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown not only in age but skills as well as they give a great performance.The movie has taken shape of a much more complexity.Its no longer just about the Quidditch matches or the menacing Malfoy but its much more than that. The whole movie has a suspenseful environment and it holds on to it from beginning to end. The climax especially is great and more mature than the previous installments. Overall I think this is the best installment from the three. Totally amazing experience and close to perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why does Harry Potter appear to be a glowing deer????,"When Harry and Sirius Black are being attacked by the Dementors.....why does it look like a glowing deer that saves them....I Just don't get it.....also, when Peter Pettigrew is transformed from being a rat he is fully clothed...However, when he turns back into a rat, the clothes remain. I know these are trivial issues...but that glowing deer thing!!! What is going on there?the Film is very good though, I think Michael Gambon should have studied Richard Harris' Dumbledore a bit more.....Talked a bit slower and had a calm demeanor....Don't get me wrong, He is a wonderful actor...it was just tough to think of him as the same character.Overall a very good film and am looking forward to the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better than the first two movies combined,"Harry Potter is back and this time it's more enjoyable than the first two movies. To be honest here, I actually like this movie. I was never a fan of the first two movies because they concentrated on bringing eye gawky teenage girls than actually caring for a story, but the special effects and John Williams' music made things up for me. All the principal actors from the first two movies return; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are back as Harry, Hermione, and Ron in which the story behind the Prisoner of Azkaban is that a killer name Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the prison of Azkaban in which he is after Harry Potter and wants to kill him. Harry isn't scared, as he is ready to kill the murderer who is after him. With an all-star cast featuring Emma Thompson as a teacher and Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledor, the acting is superb in which not only the three main actors have matured, and the special effects and John Williams' music are ten times better than the first two.If you enjoyed the first two movies, that's fine. But I recommend this for fans and non-fans alike to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Downfall,"I remember seeing this in theaters and being absolutely livid. Even now, I still can't watch this movie in a yearly rewatch without instantly being angry about it.New Dumbledore - Michael Gamon, rest in peace, was a terrible Dumbledore. He said he didn't read the books which was pretty stupid for an actor, I think. The movies were big by then and what kind of commitment was there if he didn't bother knowing the character?Honesty, as far as adult actors went, if it wasn't Alan Rickman and Emma Thomson this movie would literally be unwatchable.Gary Oldman just wasn't Sirius. But in a recent interview, I have to give him a lot of credit for owning up to it:""I dunno... maybe if I had read the books like Alan, if I'd got ahead of the curve [...] if I had known what's coming, I honestly think I would have played it differently.""
Good for him and I completely agree.David Thewlis was pretty decent as Lupin, actually. Too bad the movie made his werewolf form absolutely revolting. He was supposed to be a huge wolf but what we got some hideous biped nightmare fuel.The direction was horrible and the worst part of the movie. I know there's so much information in the books to put into the movie but the director was more concerned with unnecessary shots than explaining anything! Do movie-only watchers know who the Marauders even are? They had to use the nicknames in other movies but this one dropped the ball hard on that. I'm just glad this was the only one the director did.There was a ridiculously long shot of Harry on Buckbeak which was just annoying because he not only hated it but it was a really short trip. + The wacky crazy Whomping Willow scene didn't happen either. Crookshanks pressed a knob and the tree froze. I'll take plot over these unneeded shots all day long.There was also a lot of creepy Hermione praise. They have her a lot of Ron's lines (eg. ""you'll have to go through us to get to Harry""), Sirius and Lupin praise her for being smart even though she really didn't do anything. Even though it was more Ron assassination, I always chuckle when he agrees with Snape in calling her an ""insufferable know it all"" since she was really obnoxious in this movie.I loved Stan Shunpike and can't even count how many times I've said ""wut chew fell ova for?!"" Truly a treasure along with Tom Felton.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfect!!!,This is truly a perfect Harry Potter movie. I loved the third book and the movie really captured its feeling. I think out of all the movies this one stays the closest to J. K. Rowling's story. The young actors are way better than in the first two and Gary Oldman is just awesome as Sirius Black. I know that some people don't like the story and i agree that it isn't Rowling's best but it's still great and interesting. Cuarón is a fantastic director and the movie looks very beautiful. There is a lot of great dialog and the movie added some amazing new characters.The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite movie in the whole franchise and deserves a very good rating.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"OK, finished the third installment of the Harry Potter series and still doing fine, lol. I have to say that this was a great installment into the series, I still haven't read the books, so I cannot judge on those, only the films. So the Prisoner of Azkaban I must say had a much more dark side of the story, the kids are now a little more grown up and facing much more terrifying things as the head on to become great sorcerers. The cast is still doing great things together, same as the other films with a great addition of Gary Oldman. The story seemed also a bit stronger than the other Harry Potter films.After having trouble at home once again with Harry Potter's adoptive family, he runs away sick of being called a freak and wanting to be with his own. Only now entering his third year at Hogwart, he is about to face a great enemy, Sirus Black, a murderer who would like to see Harry dead to avenge the sorcerers. Not to mention his constant feud with his schoolmate, Draco, won't stop, but he has his friends to help him lead on into a world where Harry will live and become a great sorcerer.The Prisoner of Azkaban was extremely entertaining and kept my total attention. I loved watching him having to learn how to control and use the bird like creature in his first class and just seeing finally Draco getting his. I would very much recommend The Prisoner of Azkaban, it was a great installment and I cannot wait for the Goblet of Fire, from the rating, I'm extremely excited to see what that is about.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Third Time Lucky,"We all know the saying: third time lucky! Well this film is living proof of that.Prisoner of Azkaban comes the closest to depicting the story of the book so far. Azkaban seems to really go that level further than COS or PS in so many ways (special effects, mood, narrative style, performance from the actors and storyline in general) and it seems in this case the book was definitely suited to the director (Alfonso Cuaron).This film has such a richness to it, and it's easy to see that this book is easily the most cinematic from the series. POA flows so much more smoothly than PS and COS, which seem to have more of a repetitive structure to them. POA has a freer structure and style, which is really symbolic of the characters, whom are now teenagers.Which brings me to the actors. Well, they all seem to be maturing not only physically but in their performances too. Danile Radcliffe is transforming into quite the spunk; his transition from a child to a young adult is truly amazing to watch. He brings a more nuanced performance to this film, exploring more emotional territories.Rupert Grint gives his best performance to date, playing an awkward and comical Ronald Weasley. He has good on screen chemistry with Watson and we see the first pangs of romance between Ron and Hermione kick in. It doesn't help that Grint is becoming more handsome...Full marks also to Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Watson has proved herself more than capable once again to display the real human emotion in these films. She is maturing into quite a beauty and has excellent screen presence. I especially liked her performance in the Time-Turner sequence. She led and dominated the scenes with such procession and style while still being true to the clever Hermoine. She brings insecurity to the character, while delivering a rather gutsy performance.As always, the adult cast of Harry Potter deserve a huge mention. Gary Oldman was a perfect choice as Sirius Black, David Thewlis as Professor Lupin gave a sensitive performance as a father figure to Harry. The rest of the cast (Sir Micheal Gambon, Dame Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Emma Thompson)all step up to the mark as the films are heading in a more mature direction.The thing I really loved about this film and that I feel separates it from it's predecessors was the Gothic style visuals that Cuaron brought to the film. The dramatic and beautiful landscape of Scotland, with it's mountains and valleys, really symbolize the emotions you feel when you are 13 years old. This stunning cinematography makes the characters, events and all of the quirks and emotions felt by all in the Potter world leap off of the screen.These dark and eerie sights are matched with humour and the occasional romantic emphasis between the trio. Cuaron has a true sense of humour and infuses a slight sexual tension between the main characters into the story.While the three are obviously maturing, Hermione as the only girl, is usually caught in the middle of all of this sexual tension. (And when I say sexual tension I mean it's very subtle and you can read into it any way you want, but it is in no way inappropriate). Cleverly with Watson though, Cuaron makes the wise play of acknowledging her development without drawing perverse attention to it.There's the obvious signs like an awkward glance here and there, a consoling hug that lasts a little too long, the awkward flouncing around of Watson and her co-stars in the action parts of the film, in which they are usually bent awkwardly and breathing heavily as they try to escape/set things right, the odd hand grabbing and odd touch or unaware brush, just small things like that.Cuaron uses tight framing in these shots to suggest intimacy (the scene where the trio hug when Buckbeak is slaughtered, the quick close up of Harry reaching his arm around Hermione's behind to take her wand out of her pocket, the awkward moment when Hermione grabs Ron's hand when Harry is trying to tame Buckbeak, when Harry is conveniently behind Hermione when they are riding Buckbeak to save Sirius, etc).As I said before, Cuaron tries not to draw perverse attention to it, by deliberately (I would say accentuating) the awkward moments so as to not draw bad attention to the young stars's obvious maturity.On a different note, the special effects are really something in this film. There's the beautiful Buckbeak, the frightening and splendidly eerie Dementors, the hilarious Knight Bus sequence, all of the special effects have really improved. Everything looks so realistic yet still retains an old-school magical look and feeling.Another thing I have to mention is the Hogwarts castle and the musical score. All of the things in the castle, the props (especially the divination room) has such a beautiful but old-style look to it; it's really a visual feast for your eyes. The musical score infuses a little 40's big-band pizazz (think the Knight Bus scene and the Boggart scene) and the general score is very grandiose old-school but with a modern sound. It somehow seems to retain earthiness at the same time. One special piece of music that deserves recognition is the Irish style music (think medieval pan flutes and strings) that plays over some of the really touching and heartbreaking moments in Azkaban.Azkaban is essentially a coming of age story, that really has such a mature look and feel to it that it will attract a larger Potter audience. It really is just one big exhilarating adventure with highs and lows and I truly believe that no other director but Cuaron could have mastered this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"If you liked the first two movies, or the books, you won't like this movie.","Alfonso Cuaron was a very bad choice of directors. I just saw this movie today, and it was very bad. I read the book a few years ago, and I thought it was great. But everything that made the book great just seemed to be gone in the movie. I can't even put my finger on it. I think it's because of the change in directors. Alfonso Cuaron seems like a very artistic and gimmicky kind of director to me, and has no sense of story telling. Christopher Columbus told the story better, and made good movies out of it. They didn't omit anything major, and the movies ended up being wonderful. But Alfonso Cuaron cut out some of the best parts of the book, as well as the most important parts (like explaining how Sirius Black knew Peter Pettigrew was at Hogwarts, or even explaining how Sirius Black was wrongfully accused of Peter's murder). One of the worst parts of the movie is the end. It was all wrong. The Firebolt being received was a terrible way to end the movie, and it wasn't even explained who gave it to him. We never get the heartwarming letter from Sirius to tell Harry (and the audience!) that Sirius did indeed make it to safety, and that he wasn't attacked by Dementors (who can fly????) or something on his way to the mountains. There were obviously a lot of omissions from the story, and one must wonder why, when they could have put most of them in, and the movie could have been like 3 hours long, like it should have been. I don't know what they were thinking by making the movie only 2 hours and 15 minutes. The movie seemed so rushed, and incomplete.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a much better movie, and adaptation. I wish Christopher Columbus would direct again, because he really understood the story well, and made good films from it. Alfonso Cuaron seemed like he was too busy trying to make a good movie that he disregarded the importance of the story, and just crammed it all into a rushed and creepy movie that alienates it's audience.Sorry to everybody who liked it, but I thought it could have been done way better if someone else directed. Somehow, I should have figured the director Y Tu Mama Tambien would be wrong for Harry Potter!5/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but not as good as the first two","What I thought was the highlight of the movie was the two scenes where Harry fights off all of the Dementors when they are attacking him and Sirius. Those scenes were incredible. The score in particular was amazing.There is definitely more humor in Azkaban than the previous two movies, and while a lot of it is genuinely funny, I did not much like the shrunken heads.I think that Cauron contributed some fine things, but he rushed a lot of plot scenes to focus on humor and stylistic changes. The character of Ron went backwards. He was a third wheel. In the first two movies there was more of a balance between all the elements. Radcliffe gave his best performances so far. Watson is clearly the best actor of the bunch. Grint was good. I am not sure why Malfoy was so hysterical and wimpy in this movie.With the new supporting characters Emma Thompson was fun as Professor Trelawney even if her big scene was rushed. The way Julie Christie was introduced as Madame Rosmerta was one of my favorite moments of the movie. David Thewlis was excellent as the scarred Professor Lupin. The scene on the bridge was a highlight. Gary Oldman was good, especially in his brief one-on-one scenes with Radcliffe.The whole scene in the shack was rushed. Oldman, Rickman, Thewlis are all good in the scene but I thought it was underdeveloped. I didn't like what they did with Pettigrew. I thought he would be more pathetic. Not pathetic so you laugh, but pathetic where you get angry. I thought Spall's performance as Pettigrew was off.Visually the movie is very impressive. The changing of the seasons using the Whomping Willow was a great idea. The radiating light around the wands was nice. The Shrieking Shack with its moving walls, the hippogriff (it was like its own character, one of the most impressive CGI/puppet creations I've seen), and the frightening dementors were all impressive technological achievements.Here I felt that the movie actually did seem longer than the previous two. I think that was largely because the time travel aspect of the plot. When Harry and Hermione sit down to wait, however briefly, the scene dragged.Also the final credits are worth watching. They are really well designed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the best,"As for me and many of my friends this is one of the best of the series.It is the first movie with a new Director after Chris Columbus directed the first two and is also the first with Sir Michael Gambon as Dumbledore replacing deceased Richard Harris.So Director Alfonso Cuaron is faced with the reality of providing continuity for the much beloved series while having to blend in a new actor for one of the primary roles. The other reality is taking the third book which is approximately 150 pages longer than the first and 100 pages longer than the second and keeping it within a reasonable length without cleaving too much. He accomplishes this while trimming run time by approximately 15 minutes.Again, each movie has to undergo the often harsh reviews of faithful readers who have their own ingrained bias regarding how the film should have portrayed characters and scenes. Having watched the movies before attacking the books I can say that I have my own feelings on how well these transitions were accomplished. However, having seen the movies prior to reading the books, I was free to judge movies as they are...movies.The last thing I will add is just a personal note. I felt the performances of Ekow Quartey and LeeIngleby to be magnificent. In Ekow's small speaking roles he delivers each convincingly and in my opinion greatly portrays the severity of the issues at hand. Lee, who i remember from ""Master and Commander"" does a great job as Stan Shunpike. Sometimes these small roles enhance the overall movie viewer's experience and theirs certainly did for me.As I have stated, to me and many others as evidenced by the ratings, this is one of the best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is often regarded as one of the best entries in the Harry Potter film series.","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is often regarded as one of the best entries in the Harry Potter film series, and revisiting it after many years can reveal both its strengths and some of its minor shortcomings.One of the film's standout features is its casting, particularly Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Both actors bring depth and complexity to their roles, perfectly capturing the essence of their characters from the book. Their performances add a significant amount of gravitas to the movie, making it one of the more emotionally compelling entries in the series.The darker and grittier tone of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is another aspect that sets it apart. Director Alfonso Cuarón's vision is evident in the film's cinematography and atmosphere. The use of practical effects and detailed set design enhances the eerie and mysterious mood, which aligns well with the book's narrative. The special effects, especially for the Dementors and Buckbeak, have held up remarkably well over the years, adding a sense of realism to the magical world.However, the film does have some drawbacks. One notable issue is the limited focus on the broader cast of characters and the day-to-day life at Hogwarts. Unlike the book, which delves into the experiences of other students and various school activities, the movie primarily concentrates on the main plot involving Harry, Sirius, and the Time Turner. This streamlined approach, while effective for pacing, means that some of the richness and detail of J. K. Rowling's world are lost.Despite this, the new settings introduced in the film, such as the Shrieking Shack and the Knight Bus, are vividly brought to life. These sequences capture the imagination and stay true to the descriptions in the book. The handling of Hermione's Time Turner subplot is also well-executed, adding a layer of complexity and excitement to the story.The chemistry between the three main cast members-Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint-continues to be a highlight. Their performances show growth and maturity, reflecting their characters' development as they face increasingly serious challenges.Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" remains a solid and enjoyable film. While some aspects of the book are condensed or omitted, the movie successfully captures the core of the story and presents it with style and flair. It's a testament to Cuarón's direction and the strong performances of the cast that it continues to be a beloved part of the Harry Potter franchise, even if some fans might feel certain elements from the book are missing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Butchered,"This new director did a great job making a movie with a lot of flash and no bang. He did not just CUT things out of the movie but he made HUGE changes to the wizarding world. I will list some of them now. Opening scene Harry is trying to cast a spell under his sheets (a spell that is not even in the books) but DARN in the books its HIGHLY illegal for wizards not of age to be casting spells outside school (let alone in a MUGGLE neighborhood). A huge change that I saw were FLYING dementors, in the books they just hover over the ground...in the movie he has them chasing him like airplanes...zooming all around. In the book they had to list the ways of telling a werewolf from a normal wolf...no where did I hear ""Long thin legs"", in the books a werewolf looks VERY much like a normal wolf (other then a few things like eyes and snout length). In the books there is only ONE time you will catch a wizard in muggle clothes...and thats when he is in a MUGGLE town. In the movie they almost NEVER wear cloaks or robes and thats after JK Rowling did a GREAT job telling us what each of these wizards normally wear. The first two movies followed the book great, it was like reading every other page. This movie was like a friend reading the third book and then a year later trying to tell you what happened. (huge changes in the plot) I'm a avid fan but this movie hurt more then it helped.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The best installment of them all, masterfully directed by Cuaron","It's quite a miracle, actually, that prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite film in the series, seeing as it's book form is not one I find myself returning to very often. However, Cuaron turns what, in my opinion, is one of the weaker storylines in the hp universe, into a power house of a film that far surpasses my expectations of what a hp film could produce. For starters, It takes creative liberties that work seamlessly with the source material (unlike the previous two which were bland carbon copies of the books). It is also a visual treat, well shot and edited, with a signature directorial feel that helps it stand out from the often one note style of the other adaptations. The grounds of hogwarts are expanded through Cuarons vision and make for a more lived in and welcoming world for us outsiders. The atmosphere Cuaron creates aids in ushering in a justifiable dark tone to the series, a tone that continues to deepen in further installments. John Williams is at the top of his game here, perfecting the score he has been building upon in the previous films. The young acting trio of Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint take tremendous steps with the guidance of Cuaron and start to really become comfortable in their respective roles. The additions of David thewlis, Michael Gambon, Timothy spall, and the amazing Gary Oldman (who is perfectly cast as the misunderstood Sirius Black) just continue to stack an already all star British cast. The humor is punctual and never feels out of place, a good reminder that, while this is definitely a darker hp film, it still has the endearing child like vibe of the franchise.In summary, watch the movie. It's a glittering gem in a mixed bag of a franchise, a sweet coming of age story wrapped in the sugar coat of fantasy. Also, Alan Rickman is a stud.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The best of the Harry Potter movies!,"HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the third installment of the HARRY POTTER film series and it is directed by Alfonso Cuaron.HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is considered by critics and fans to be the best installment of the franchise. It is also the best-reviewed film of the series.The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and wants to murder him.The story definitely follows the book nicely, with a few new things added to it. Since Chris Columbus, director of both ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" decided he would not direct this film, Alfonso Cuaron was chosen as director for the third film.The musical score is composed by John Williams for the last time and this was the last HP film to be rated PG. The script is solid and Steve Kloves did a really great job creating an amazing movie. The direction is very amazing and fantastic and Alfonso Cuaron knows how to make a very entertaining movie.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Bonnie Wright, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton all shine out in this film. The rest of the original cast is amazing and they have good performances in this film. Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black and he did a good job. The rest of the new actors are really good in this film.Since Richard Harris died after the second film was released, a new actor was chosen for the part and Michael Gambon would play the part.The visuals and production values are amazing and spectacular. The costumes in the film are wonderful. The pacing is still slow, but it is amazing as heck. The make-up is really interesting and this film goes down as for having the best make-up in a film in my book.The rest of the production designs are very amazing.

"A wonderfully put together film, both in style and substance.","Well for me at least, having just had my third viewing of this, the third instalment in the Harry Potter franchise, and I'm pleased to report that now I'm finally at peace with how I feel about Alfonso Cuarón's delightful picture. When I first watched this film upon its DVD release, I found myself yearning for the children to be children again, it was as if the magic had gone, for the reason I liked the first two films was because they allowed me to be childlike again, was the franchise losing it's fantastical ability to draw the viewer in and make us feel magically childlike? Thankfully some four years later I'm positively beaming about it's wonderful adult aura, the professionally handled structure, and yes, the delightful magical charm at every turn.The Prisoner Of Azkaban finds Harry aged 13, back at Hogwarts with his friends he finds out that a murderous prisoner has escaped from Azkaban prison, and he's heading straight for Harry.The film suffers from its young stars not quite developing their acting skills to befit the burgeoning onset of their now teenage characters, but it's a minor complaint that's forgiven because the new additions to the adult cast are positively fabulous. One could possibly decry that Gary Oldman & David Thewlis are sadly underused, and to a degree that would be a fair gripe, but both men leave such an indelible impact it helps offset the sad loss of Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Into Dumbledore's big robe comes Michael Gambon, and although he is solid, watchable, and graceful enough, he could never have hoped to achieve the magnificent aura that Harris brought to the role.Directing wise I think it's fair to say that Alfonso Cuarón was blessed with a far better script than Christopher Columbus had for the first two Potter movies, where here we get a gripping denouement and certainly the best finale of the franchise thus far. Certainly this is a darker movie, where threats of death loom large and moody imagery features throughout, but credit has to go to Cuarón for neatly pulling it all together, be it for the snow bound sequences, a Dementor attack, or a sumptuous wide angled shot of the rolling Scottish hills, it's a beautifully crafted piece of work that thrills for adults and kids alike. Stuart Craig's sets are a joy to behold, Michael Seresin's wonderfully mystical cinematography brings the whole locale into your lap, and John Williams naturally scores it with deftness personified. In short it's the technical highlight of the franchise so far and a benchmark that the others will struggle to equal. 9/10RIP Richard Harris.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Best Fantasies on Film,"I was not crazy about the first film, and while the second film was better it still wasn't the be all and end all. This film is damn near close to being the be all and end all.Granted the acting is at times off by the two male leads,and Malfoy is too much of a wimp but for the most part this is everything that the first two films should have been but weren't. I have to credit the fact that this film was not directed by Chris Columbus, who is too light weight a director and was too faithful to the material. That is not the case here...Here the hero is director Alfonso Cuarón, who made great dark fantasy by handling the material the way that it should have been handled. He made changes in the source, but kept everything focused on characters and plot. Best of all he made a movie that seems real, no matter how fantastic it gets, something that never happened in the first two films.I want to recommend this film to everyone, but I'm pretty certain you'll be best off if you watch one of the first two films to bring you up speed.

Returns to Hogwarts,"Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, brings the usual assorted hazards, challenges and life-threatening scrapes we've come to expect from this series. This time Potter is under threat from Sirius Black, an escapee from Azkaban Prison., who is apparently intent on murdering our hero and prematurely ending one of the most successful film series of all time. Along the way Harry must also face the frightening Dementor (the spectral guards of Azkaban Prison), get the better of Draco Malfoy, and save Hagrid's new pet from a sticky end.Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is as well-produced as its predecessors, and atmospherically (if gloomily) photographed by Michael Seresin, with the usual excellent set designs (by Stuart Craig), impressively-realised visual effects and another good score from John Williams. There's also the usual excellent supporting cast, and the roll-call of Potter cast members is approaching a who's-who of British acting talent. This time Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis and Julie Christie join series regulars Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and Julie Walters and others. If nothing else, these films are at least keeping half of Equity in employment.I have to admit to being a little disappointed with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which stuck too closely to the formula of the first film, but The Prisoner of Azkaban at least introduces some new elements in the plot department. As in the previous two films, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts master plays an important role in the story. This time, however, the plot is a bit less predictable, and the audience is kept guessing which side Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and some of the other characters are on. But there is also some evidence of sloppy writing, particularly with the ""time turner"" device, which is conveniently produced to save the day at one point.Of the new cast members, only David Thewlis really gets that much of a part. Gary Oldman is very under-used as the prisoner Sirius Black, and Julie Christie barely appears. Michael Gambon meanwhile, does a decent enough job as the late Richard Harris's replacement as Professor Dumbledore. Tom Felton (as Potter's schoolboy nemesis Draco Malfoy) is also improved. In the first couple of films he seemed hopelessly miscast, but this time the makers seem to have realised his portrayal of Malfoy is more snivelling than threatening, and he seems more convincing.A lot has been made of the frightening nature of some of the scenes in the film, particularly the Dementors. However, if you could take the hordes of giant spiders in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets you'll probably be fine here too. More to the point is whether children will really have the patience to sit through another two hour plus Harry Potter epic. Like its predecessors, The Prisoner of Azkaban could go with cutting by about 10-15 minutes and will seem long even for adult audiences. Sometimes these films have seemed a little too faithful and reverential to their source material, hence the impressive running times. As the books The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are twice the length of their predecessors, the film-makers will have to lose their excessive caution and do some serious cutting and refashioning of the story if the next two films are to be a manageable length.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Cuaron and company rise this to the level of near pop-art; Harry Potter moving on up in style and substance,"After the first two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus waived his director's seat and after some searing Alfonso Cuaron stepped in. It's an interesting choice, as he had only done one 'family-friendly' film before (A Little Princess), and had just finished an NC-17 film the excellent Y Tu Mama Tambien. Although I've yet to read 'Azkaban' or any of the books, from what I've heard from those that have it's a book that doesn't seem to be really progressing too much in terms of a 100% engaging 'plot'. We're only learning so much about Potter's lineage, and mostly through the element of Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban prison and has his sights set after Potter to avenge the ""dark lord.""But through this set-up, Cuaron does the most extraordinary things, surpassing Columbus's big-epic aspirations and making it...still epic, yes, but with a more ambitious scop in directorial style. Even when things get at their most conventional, there's a full sense of balancing whimsy and true dark intonations. I loved how he and the visual effects crew dealt with the Dementors, the shape shifters who act as a double-edged sword with Hogwarts and Potter. I haven't seen the film in a while, but I still remember so clearly many scenes and shots, and how the filmmaker this time really brings on a strong presence that actually, if anything, enriches the material of the book.There's other small pleasures as well: Emma Thompson wonderfully plays a scatter-shot professor who looks like she could get lost in a grocery store; the beginning scenes, where the pig-headed family that's taken in Harry all this time getting their just desserts; the Quiddich battle, which ends up being a little unexpected in some ways, and is actually much ahead in suspense than in even the first film, which introduced the whole bloody concept; the acting by David Thewlis, usually known for more idiosyncratic character roles in movies indie and mainstream, who despite all appearances is also ambiguous.Best of all is Oldman as Sirius Black, and for the brief moments he's on screen (and, to be sure, how sentimental the dialog veers towards when he and Potter sit down for a talk on the roof), the screen does the clichéd move of ""lighting up"". Just the poster image alone, with ""have you seen this man"" is ominous, even as there is almost the feeling that he isn't quite as evil as might be let on. The levels of darkness in the film are upped a bit- this is the first time that the Harry Potter series has to get a little more mature, even still on ""family-friendly"" terms- and cast and crew are up completely to the challenge.In fact, this might still be my favorite of the Potter films (Order of Phoenix close second), as it does capture the levels of wonder at such a concept that a wizard school offers, and expands further into the crevices of the psychologies of the characters and the possibilities of the identity of evil or good or what might be mixed around. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I understand that this book was longer, so to produce a film that told a credible story , some parts had to be left out, but really...Also the obvious change in some of the settings- Hagrid's cottage was now down a steep hill, out of sight of Hogwarts, rather than a slow decline from the school is not how I pictured it from the book.

The things I feel sorry about this film are that many good explanations about Harry's family and life, and also many things about the Marauders are not showed. I also hated the actors they chose to be Sirius Black and Lupin: they are not similar to the real characters I imagined to be, and Lupin's transformation to a werewolf was terrible.Ps: This movie is okay, but the book is GREAT!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Where did the story go?,"I know many people think that Prisoner of Azkaban was a great film and I agree that it was visually stunning, well directed, and much more mature than either of the previous films. There's more to a movie than that, though, especially this movie. Prisoner of Azkaban is an adaption of a book, part of a larger series, and ,most importantly, already extremely popular and well known. It is also the favorite of the series (so far) among the majority of those I have asked. There were many important issues to consider when making this movie.I think that too much of the story was sacrificed for the sake of the artistic vision in this movie. If you haven't read the book and never plan on reading the series, but do watch the movies, I'm sorry. You'll never understand how much depth Rowling put into this story, she really went to a whole new level in the Prisoner of Azkaban. There's a depth to the story and details that are weaved together in unexpected ways and you miss the majority of it by just seeing the movies. Its not that I expect every detail of the book to be in the movie, I'm a filmmaker myself, I know that there are limits to what can be done due to movie length, budget, etc. I also realize that a different director is going to have a different vision for the stories, I think that most of what Cuaron did for the film was fantastic. Even the inconsistencies that were introduced by Cuaron I could easily overlook if more of the story had remained in the movie, but its not there and its a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
MAJOR plot points left out,"Listen, I understand that to make a movie from a book you have to leave things out. However, I believe that if a movie is going to made from a book, it should stand on its own. Meaning that you should be able to follow the movie if you haven't read the book. I have read the book, but I saw the movie with people who had not. And we got out of the movie and they were thoroughly confused. And I don't blame them, because the movie failed to explain (1) how Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, (2) how he knew that Pettigrew was Ron's pet and therefore at Hogwarts, and (3) who the 4 Marauders were so it was confusing that Lupin understood what the map was and how it worked. This is just sloppy film making. Add a few lines here and there and it's explained. I can live without the Quiddich and the subplots from the book, but when I have to spend 15 minutes explaining things to people after the movie, the movie is a failure.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
From here it got better,"Prisoner of Azkaban, so far, is still my favourite Harry Potter film, still having not seen them all. This is where everything got better, the way the story was put into action and more importantly the acting from the three main characters. I'm going to admit the first two movies weren't great, particularly Harry, Ron and Hermione. It wasn't believable in the first two because those three characters had the majority amount of screen time. In this movie, the acting was so much better and you could believe it was real.The special effects were good but not brilliant by any means. I thought, mainly, Emma Watson stood out in this film and her acting was great along with Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint.I'm on the Half Blood Prince and this is still my favourite Harry Potter movie. By choice, I'd rewatch this movie rather than the others. It's not one of my favourite films ever but it's still great. I still find Harry Potter fans slightly overrate these films and say everything is better than any other films and will not admit if there is a mistake in the film. I love Harry Potter but most movies have there flaws.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
amazing.....truly stunning!,"First of all let me say that i am a 32 year old man who has never read a harry potter book before, but i love sword and sorcery stories so i've seen all the potter movies. This movie was amazing...the cinematography was the most stunning work i have ever seen on film(and i'm a movie buff and photographer)! It was a visual feast for the eyes...the other potter movies never gave the feel of a magical environment,this did.The night scenes were so beautifully shot that that you felt immersed in an outerworldly realm of magic both good and bad every second.The overall story telling was brilliant and well paced, and i found the story to be very dark and mature.Some moments are a bit too scary for small children ,but everyone should find something to like.This one was about maturing as people and wizards.....and the 3 kids have matured as actors as much as there characters have on screen.It is a travesty that this director doesn't continue with the series. To the potter fans that say this doesn't closely resemble the book, get over it!!! No movie can ever match what you visualized in your mind.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"The darkest film yet, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderful film. As a big fan of all Harry Potter related things, I loved this film but, only because it was Harry Potter related. As almost all films, it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages. I must say, that the director this time outdid himself, as the visual effects are no less than fantastic. The dementors, the scenery in general and the outside ambiance, especially Hagrid's hut are really fascinating. The village of Hogsemead is really cute and just as I expected it to be. What really disappointed me, probably disappointed most who are big fans of J.K Rowling's books. The film gave great importance to visual effects (if i might add fascinating ones, especially the computer animated hippogriff, Buckbeak) but almost ignored the whole story and its essence. Certain funny comments and situations were eliminated from the film, such as the Dementor/Malfoy situation in the Quidditch Game and Harry's crush on Cho Chang. The Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book was really emotional and although, true Harry Potter fans did find their eyes watering at the some point in the film, I must say that I almost tore the book's pages with my crying. The whole story of the Maurauder's map is almost deleted entirely and that, in my opinion is not good, as it is a very special part in the book. I really must say that the previous two films were more faithful to the story. But, who am I to comment on such things? After all, J.K Rowling did work entirely with the screen writer, so she, of all people, should know what is important and what's not relevant to future films. Still, I think that certain special moments mean the world to Harry Potter fans, who probably, have lost count of the number of times they had seen the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,10/10 - the third installment is a cinematic tour de force that does not let up in its wondrous adaptation of the even-better series of novels,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Are u all nuts? Cuaron damaged what he could!,"2 days ago, I lived my worst disappointment in my whole life! I was sooo excited to watch the new Potter movie, which I awaited for more that one year. And when I was leaving the movies, I still didn't believe that it wasn't a bad joke what I saw. After two first movies, which I really liked came this one, absolutely different and absolutely strange. Something wicked this way comes... Now I understand what did It mean in the slogan. U know, its nice to see a pathetic picture of an angry willow as it kills a little bird, or a joke for 5year-olds when Neville gets attacked by the Monsters book of monsters, but I would rather like to see an explanation who actually Black is, who Lupin is, what and who created the marauders map, why Harrys Patronus takes the form of a deer or why Sirius and Snape hate each other so much.On the other hand, there are things I definitely didn't wanna see and despite that I did - Willow beating up Harry and Hermione (they would definitely get some broken ribs or bruises, if not getting killed), a grimm in the sky during the quiddich game ( he was supposed to see Sirius and not a grimm! This is a really big error), Hermione talking to Lupin when he transformed, Lupin telling Harry how Lilly helped him through in the rough times when he discovered he was a werewolf (Lilly started to date James and so to know the other boys in the 5. year, so she didn't even know him then).....and many other things, I could go on for hours. and the main question is - where the hell was the damn music??? NO MUSIC! Only one good theme - when Harry was flying on hypogrif. What bout all the other scenes? The music COULD fix some broken parts, but it wasn't there.Was mr. Williams drinking coffee in his trailer in that moment or what? And in some scenes, the music was absolutely not suitable, example the scene when Marge changed to a balloon...the scene was underlined with a light funny theme, but it was supposed to be scary, for harry and also dursleys. So mr. Cuaron maybe amused some small kids,but for sure not the older audience. And what bout the cut?The scene that was supposed to be touching, when harry is crying bout the fact that black is the reason his parents are dead, could get to her end and leave a feeling in the viewer, cos it was immediately cut by smt else - there was no time for the viewer to sing into harrys feeling. And what bout the shedule of scenes - all school lessons were together in one peace - lupin,hagrid,trylawney,snape...and then nothing else any more - the selected order of scenes was could be much more dynamic and imaginative. The only one who made the movie watchable was Dan Radcliffe, who was absolutelly astonishing and showed a gorgeous performance by his own. Also Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon were great. But all this couldn't help the screenplay that has such holes that even 20 houseelfs couldn't sew it together. And here it comes the one big question - HOW COULD J.K.ROWLING AGREE WITH THIS??? Total humitation of her universe and Columbus' work, who did his best to make the first two movies as great as they were.It was the biggest disappointment and I would like to asdk all the ppl who like it - could u pls (!!!) explain to me WHAT so so great bout it?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Poor special effects spoilt the movie,"It seems that once again, I am one of the few to criticise Harry Potter films (3/10 for Goblet of Fire). What spoilt this film largely for me was the special effects. The Dementors were a huge disappointment - they looked like men with pieces of black cloth over their heads. As with the Goblet of Fire, not enough time was spent on small but important details. Harry does not meet Cho in this movie, which provokes an unlikely glance at a random Ravenclaw in the fourth movie as Harry's basis for falling in love. Where was the quidditch? Where was Diggory?Sirius Black and Remus Lupin are poor caricatures of deep characters. Black is not involved enough, he just hovers at the edge of the film at all times. Lupin does not look shabby with a neatly trimmed moustache and combed hair - he looks like a Muggle businessman. The scenery also changes inconsistently with a great whoppin' bridge appearing out of nowhere and gosh, Hagrid's hut has relocated.Another detail which I forgot is the Boggart scene with the class and Lupin. As Harry steps forward, the Boggart clearly takes the shape of a Dementor, yet later on, Lupin claims he thought it would turn into Voldemort.The only redeeming feature of this film was that the actors (with the exception of Black and Lupin who weren't provided with adequate script and just didn't look like the part respectively) did well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The peak film of the franchise,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the series so far. This is because it takes the strengths of the previous movies (the score, cast, and source material) and unites them with artistic filmmaking. Clearly, Alfonso Cuarón is a directorial step up from Chris Columbus. The imagery is more beautiful because of dramatic lighting, intentional composition, and ambitious camera movement. Meanwhile, there are stylish scene transitions complete with thematic meaning. Lastly, the settings and locations have more depth, which finally worldbuild like the franchise had always strived for. All together, this produces a film that has artistic undertones rather than just light family entertainment.On top of all that, the additions of Gary Oldman and Timothy Spall further strengthen the cast and overall acting in the film. The story is also slightly refreshing because it isn't centered around another Voldemort plot. This gives space for surprises and character development. Throw in mostly good special effects and some creative sound design, and we have an all-around good movie. In the end, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban possesses all the gems that the series has to offer and is the peak film in the franchise.Writing: 7/10

"Overly dramatic, the latest Potter flick fails because of direction","From the get-go, it's clear that the latest Harry Potter film was directed by someone else.  Unlike the first two, which do their damnedest to mimic Rawling's magical and slightly whimsical portrayal of the world she creates, Cuaron's interpretation focuses on a much darker element that is barely evident in the story.  Aside from a few forced jokes, there is very little whimsy in his take on the book, which is a travesty.One of the clearest problems in Cuaron's direction is the overly fluid way in which he moves the film.  There are no stepping stones or key events which really stick with the viewer.  Instead, he spends a good chunk of the movie showing the passage of time, which is just downright silly.  This changes a bit in the last twenty minutes, but by that point I just wanted the film to end already...it had run its course.  I didn't care about the characters because, apart from a few choice lines by Emma Watson, there was very little depth to the characters -- they were devices to move a simplified plot.Apart from pacing, Cuaron also flops in his misunderstanding of the material he has to work with.  Though he may have taken the song from Macbeth, I have a feeling Cuaron felt he was dealing with something more akin to Bradbury's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"".  This is just not the case.  The Harry Potter books, even as the story becomes darker, just do not have that dark, haunting tone.  Between the music (say it isn't so, John Williams!), the darkened visuals, and the over-use of the grim reaper characters, he tries to infuse Rawling's tale with something that just isn't there, turning a story which is very clearly made for kids into something that is clearly not aimed at children but far beneath what any adult moviegoer would have any desire to see.  It's an unnecessary seriousness that just doesn't work.  If you've seen Y Tu Mama Tambien, however, you shouldn't really be all that surprised, for there, too, he tried to make something out of nothing (or rather, too much out of not much, since he had three separate themes that diluted each other).Hopefully the return of a less serious director (Mike Newell) will set the Harry Potter series back on course.  As much as J.K. Rawling would like to take herself seriously, these are still just kids books -- Cuaron should have recognized that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The Best Wizarding World Movie Available,"In my opinion, it's here where Harry Potter's story really starts to take off. The first two novels are decent books, but they're pretty similar to the dozens of other Orphan-learns-magic storylines that populate (and pollute) YA literature. ""Azkaban"" is where Rowling pulled back the curtain to show us what the Wizarding World really held, and it's also one of the tightest stories in terms of what Harry and his friends set out to accomplish during their year at Hogwarts. Simply stated, ""Azkaban"" is about as magical an adaptation as we could've hoped for.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Quirky, offbeat characters brilliantly portrayed by the whole cast and a darker (but not too much) atmosphere about it along with great creatures (Do you know what a Hippogriff is? Neither did I!) and a clever story (one of the best time travel sequences I can remember, up there with BILL & TED) all contribute to a highly watchable, entertaining movie which I would highly recommend to anyone!!!

Nearly perfect.,"An excellent entry into franchise. Not content with simply following on from the tone and atmosphere established by the first two films, this new Harry Potter story takes us into more mature and developed story. Events start to affect our characters, they doubt, they worry, they become closer to each other, it's not a magical light-hearted romp in which they stop the baddie and save the day. Having said that the story still retains that touch of awe and innocence which was gradually phased out by the final few films in the franchise.The cinematography, costumes and music are all superb and help to convey a slightly bleaker tone at points. For child actors the standard of acting is really impressive, having a couple of previous films under their belt must have helped hugely. When the children are the protagonists in a film they need to carry it, there's no hiding place for them and if we don't believe them then the film wouldn't work. New characters and creatures also help keep the film fresh. Needless to say in each film in the franchise the effects also improve.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

well it beats the other ones,"The First Potter film hit theaters November 2001, it was a huge hit so the sequel was sure to come. Now what was wrong with the first one? Well to my opinion it was too boring to be for only kids, the children's acting was only mediocre(well you can forgive it, maybe...), and the believable paradox of a fairytale failed. Well it wasn't that bad, but with the exception of Dobby the house elf(though Gollum beats him 1000 - 0) the second film was even worse. It was better in terms of technical achievement since more time was used to that, but there was all the time a too linear story telling adapted like word to word from the excellent book. That doesn't work right. Well that movie still deserved it's 6/10 because of the wonderful appearances of such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs.Well the third movie is not THAT much better, but it's richer. The linear type of telling the story is forgotten and it feels fresher and more entertaining right then. Acting of the children is FAR better and the story of course gets more interesting. Gary Oldman is always great and this time it's not an exception, though his role is small. Now the characters still do not really develop since the story itself takes too much time. The film could have been half an hour longer though and it should've been. Everything is told quite quickly and it doesn't really get boring but it gets annoying. In some points only.

It gets even better with time,"Alfonso Cuaròn's astounding direction, John Williams' score (not only the best one in the Harry Potter film series but also at the very least one of the composer's finest), Stuart Craig's unparalleled production design, the visual and special effects that still hold up two decades later, the beautiful cinematography and the actors' performances (even the kids' acting got noticeably better from 'Chamber of Secrets'); simply put, this is a masterpiece, and sooner or later even the ones that are still complaining about the story of the marauders being cut and the little changes made by Cuaròn and writer Steve Kloves (at one point you'll have to understand that book to film cannot be a 1:1 translation) will see what an incredible film this truly is. Also, to the picky ones who may have never seen a Harry Potter film or may have abandoned the saga before the third year at Hogwarts, please watch and listen and feel this one, you won't regret it (plus, thanks to Cuaròn's and Kloves' cleverness and ""show not tell"" tricks, and obviously to the story from the book itself, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' can be seen even without having basically any knowledge of the previous entries in the series or having read the books; and hopefully this peculiarity will help the film in the future to stand out as the cult it should already be).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Prisoner of Azkaban Highlights?,"I felt that the other two HP movies stuck close to the storyline. Azkaban definitely included the story, but some of it was out of order (the Firebolt) and much of it did not happen at all.I'm certain it's difficult for the director to make a movie of reasonable length and include all the points of the story. A previous writer mentioned the bits left out, such explaining the behavior of Lupin and Black toward each other. This is told in the book, but barely even mentioned in the movie. The involvement of Hermione's cat was also left out, although it's not vitally important.The movie itself was okay, but I would have been more satisfied with a complete story.

New Director = bad story telling,"I've never been one of those people. You know the ""Oh that movie didn't do the book justice"" people. Yes, THOSE people. However, in watching Prisoner of Azkaban, they leave out so many important points in not only the book, but in the big picture of the story which is Harry Potter. First of all, let's get this out of the way, PoA, the book, is not a very good story. Yes, it does advance the plot, but let's face it, there's not Voldomort and the only point is to introduce new characters, in particular, Sirius Black. So granted, the movie doesn't have a lot to work with (compared to the other stories), but it could have at least done a better job in capturing the story telling aspect.Instead of using foreshadowing, continuity, and other aspects of story telling, they focused more on the cinematography. I could just picture a director's commentary ""yeah, this part of the plot was important, but we had to take it out, because it was such a BEAUTIFUL special effect."" And just to prove I'm not ranting incoherently, here are a few examples of this: Harry was never spotted at Hogsmeade, very little quidditch mentioned, nothing about winning the quidditch cup, nothing about the house cup (only 5 points were deducted the whole movie), Ron never spotted Sirius in the dorm, no mention of Snape delivering the potion to Lupin as his reason for finding them at the shack, no mention of who Padfot, Prongs, Wormtail, and Mooney were (or better yet, that they wrote the bloody map!!!), and perhaps worst of all, Wormtail transfigured into a fully clothed human, but when transfiguring back into the animagus, his clothes were left behind.Though much of this was probably because the general muggle viewing public is incapable of following too complex of a plot, they wanted to simplify the plot. I respect that, and I came to expect as much. However, as I stated earlier, the case turned out that they wanted to show off their special effects and ""movie making"" ability, even if they had to sacrifice some of the plot. An example would be with the Wormtail transfiguration. I'm probably with the 99.9999999% of the movie public, and we don't want to see a naked Wormtail appear as a human, so it is perfectly acceptable to have him appear fully clothed. However, when he turned back into a rat, his clothes fell tot he ground, and the rat scurried away out of the pile of clothing. Now of course, the director thought it would be such a ""cool shot"" to have the rat run away as the clothes fell, thus sacrificing continuity, for a good camera shot. I find that highly unacceptable.The bottom line is this. If you are a film student, or someone who is into good camera shots, special effects, and scenery in movies, than Potter 3 will send you home very happy. But if you're like me, and enjoy good stories, consistent plots that challenge the viewers to think what will happen next, and reward those who remember little things to make the story deeper and very interesting, then you will leave this movie feeling unfulfilled.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Lovely . . . book purists get off your high horses.,"I rarely comment on movies, but the stupid backlash against this film by book purists is really making me angry, and I wanted to give them all a good, sound lecture. And I'm just as big a Harry Potter fan as any of you; and yes, Azkaban is my favorite book; and yes, I could quote you verbatim from almost any section of the book. So don't just sneer and dismiss what I'm about to say.So what if there were changes and deletions to the book? If any of you had seen A Little Princess you would have known that Cuaron made drastic changes to the story line there too (moving the book from London to New York, having Captain Crewe alive at the end, etc . . .) and it still made for an effective and moving film. A BOOK IS NOT A MOVIE! Sometimes changes fail completely (think the Count of Monte Cristo film version with Jim Caviezel), but many times they work amazingly (think Michael Mann's Last of the Mohicans). Granted, I was hoping to see flashbacks to Sirius' laughing in the street before Pettigrew's supposed remained, the scene where Harry bends down to tie his shoe so that Lupin won't see his tears, a more detailed pub scene with Madame Rosmerta, and a more in-depth Shrieking Shack. Still, even without these scenes, the heart and soul of Rowling's book was captured to perfection. Harry is becoming a more independent, angry, and less ""gee-whiz!"" boy. Hermione learns to put her foot down and stop playing by the rules so much. And Ron is . . . well, he's just Ron.Changes I Liked:Dumbledore: Gambon was RIGHT ON Rowling's depiction of the character. Not to speak ill of the dead, but Harris was just too SLOW. Dumbledore's mischievous and young-ish and, in Percy's words, ""a little mad."" Personally, I've always found Dumbledore to be somewhat unsettling, something more along the lines of Lewis' Aslan (not tame, but good) than the 'grandfather-figure' everyone else sees him to be. And what about that flash of triumph in his eyes at the end of book 4? Weird.Hagrid: Kudos to Kloves and Cuaron for making Hagrid less pathetic. He's probably my least favorite character from the books, but one of my favorite from the movie. I'm glad they made him a much more competent teacher and really stressed the fact that Malfoy was just being a git, as always.The Animal-Noises Scene: Priceless. I thought I was watching my brother and his friends goofing off as always.Big Band Music: Used AMAZINGLY in the Boggart scene, and also very well when Harry says goodbye to Lupin. It gave the movie a more real feel.Costumes: I'm glad Cuaron got rid of the robes. I re-watched Chamber of Secrets last night, and you wouldn't know that these were kids in the movie.Especially in the scene where Harry ends up in Knockturn Alley, he looks old, stuffy, and boring in that cape and sweater (isn't he hot?), instead of the spritely, mischievous boy we all know and love.Harry's Hair: Finally, a director who understands what messy means. I probably would've taken it even a step more beyond what Cuaron does. Think Tim Burton-esque style. Note for Warner: Has Burton been offered any of these movies? If not, you should. He would be amazing if he would do it (which I somewhat doubt, but hey, it's worth a shot).Quidditch: Wow, that was pretty intense! Loved the way Cuaron made the crowd more 'crazy' (painting Neville's face, etc. . .). Felt like a real NFL match. Loved the icy rain. Loved the fall. And one Quidditch scene is enough.Dementors: Looked like creepy jelly-fish. And since jelly fish really scare me and I thought the Ringwraiths in LOTR were fairly moronic (come on, people! These are supernatural beings who can sense the ring and yet can't find four hobbits right under their noses? And how in the world are hobbits supposed to outrun horses! Sheesh!), I think making them more fluid was a great idea. The soul-sucking technique was a little awkward, but how else would you have shown the dementors' effect physically? Viewers can't get inside Harry's head.Buckbeak's Flight: Incredible. Enough said.Werewolf Class: Loved Snape's slides showing the history of werewolves. Brought the whole thing into real-world, historical context. I'd never really thought of Anubis as a werewolf before. Interesting. Smart.Change/Omissions I didn't like:Okay, the shrunked head on the Knight Bus was just stupid. I'll give you that.Snape(kinda): The only scene in the movie where the omissions really hurt was when Snape simply appears in the Shrieking Shack. That really did need more exposition, and seemed too much like a deus ex machina device than it was in the book. My feeling here is that Cuaron wanted to cut Snape from the Shrieking Shack, but that Rowling wouldn't let him. (This goes of all the other omissions too. Apparently, Cuaron wanted to add 'little people' to the movie and also have a cemetery, but Rowling vetoed these changes. This gives me the feeling that whatever changes Cuaron made had to have her stamp of approval. So let's trust, JoRo on this one, she know what she's doing. Either they'll show up in later films, or they're not important to the final conclusion of the books.)Bottom Line: If you watched this movie and couldn't get past Cuaron's artistic liberties, I have a suggestion for you. Go watch the second/first movies, and then re-watch Azkaban. Keep an open mind, and enjoy the movie rather than watch for changes. You'll realize just how improved Azkaban is over the other two. The plot is leaner and meaner, the costumes snazzier, the acting better . . . hell, everything is better. And look at this as an expansion of the Potter universe. Instead of one brilliant Azkaban, now we have two. And there can never be too much of a good thing!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Somewhat lacking,"I went into this movie aware of the fact that the 3rd book was a bit darker and different than the first two, but I still came out disappointed. (And FYI, I haven't read any of the books, so please excuse my inability to compare.)As such, I had no qualms with the movie being a bit darker, for that was a welcome change and a way to take the series to a new level. But my first overwhelming thought was that the movie seemed very choppy, like a segment would start and I'd think it would be building to something and then it'd jump somewhere else, and I kept thinking, 'when is something significant going to happen?' It also seemed as if it was dumbed down a notch, almost as if several subplots were left out so as not to confuse us. But nonetheless, I still wound up being confusing with the whole 'Serious Black isn't actually the bad guy' reversal. It was so abrupt, if you blinked, you'd miss it. And personally, while the back-in-time thing was well-written, I felt it was a bit beneath the intelligence of the series (and yes, I realize it was in the book, so I don't suppose one can fault the movie for that).On the whole, there was nothing really extraordinary in the film. Sure, it had it's moments, such as the seasons changing as the owl's flying and I really liked the Hippogriff, but to me the CG looked a bit different and on the whole it had a very different feel, and while I'm sure that can be contributed to the new director having a different style, it didn't seem to encompass that lasting quality that the first two had.I think the biggest disappointed to me was that I was kinda glad when the movie was over. There weren't any parts that I particularly enjoyed, nothing that stood out. I think my biggest enjoyment was seeing the characters older and the young actors growing in their abilities. Ultimately, I went into the movie not expecting much and came out feeling like I'd done little more than see the characters two years older.6.5 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Don't like the change of director,"My opinion of the recently released Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is that the new director totally changed the mood and feeling of the Harry Potter series. Those of you who watched PoA and read the book saw many things cut out, I am aware that a lot had to be cut out for time reasons but in doing this many things were lost that were important in the storyline. An Example of this is how Heromine was able to attend all her classes this was shown briefly in two scene and could have easily been missed. Another thing that was troubling was why was the scenery of the movie changed. The grounds of Hogwarts were totally different than the first two movies.I believe that the change of director could have turned off many Harry Potter fans from the movies. As for myself I enjoyed the first two films and did not like the third.

The best movie so far!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the twist-filled third installment of the franchise, and it outshines the first two by far.This movie's plot is that Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger, (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) are back for another year at Hogwarts, and discover that Sirius Black, (Gary Oldman) the notorious criminal has escaped from the wizarding prison, Azkaban, and is searching for Harry.Although this film is not as faithful to the books as the first two, and it leaves out a lot that would have made it a lot more enjoyable, it's still filled with all sorts of twists and turns. There seems to be a plot twist around every corner.And while all of the actors are incredible, per the norm, David Thewlis deserves special mention, as he absolutely nails his rule as Professor Lupin.And perhaps best of all in this film are the dementors. They are absolutely terrifying, and Alfonso Cuaron brings the most horrifying creatures from the book fantastically.Ultimately, although this film has a new director, he takes the film in a darker direction than it's predecessors, that makes this film stand out from the others in the franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Azkaban is better than the other Potters.,The producers made their wisest decision in the Potter franchise yet by switching from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron in the directing position. Cuaron keeps a firm hold on the magical aspects of the story while going into darker territory. The film has more complexities and challenges the viewer more than the previous two chapters. It successfully and even compellingly exploits the intricacies from Rowling's tale and also keeps the content manageable for their marketed age range. Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban tops the other two films well and sets up the fourth chapter well. A victory for Director Alfonso Cuaron and the great cast of talents.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter grows up,"I saw this film yesterday. I think it is the best one yet. The new director has done an excellent job. This is an interesting movie because Harry, Hermione, and Ron all begin to grow up in this film and the actors are growing with them. This movie stays very true to the book even though some of the more detailed parts had to be left out due to obvious time constraints. I really liked the Marauder's map and the special effects they were absolutely incredible. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked pretty computer animated to me but he even seemed pretty real. I think more than anything it was just amazing to see this book come to life. When Harry casts the Expecto Patromum it is really sweet how you get to see him save himself. Lupin is an important character to this film as well. It is pretty interesting how they show him transform from a man to a werewolf. Anyways, long story short this is a great movie, I think it gives the first two a run for their money. I highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
third time's not the charm,"It feels like a transition movie, as the books become darker, obviously their celluloid counterparts will follow suit. But this film doesn't feel that dark, yet still managed to be less magical and less fun then the previous two films. Granted with ""Chamber of Secrets"", the bar was sat extremely high, but this film is definitely missing Chris Columbus's touch. The good acting is there (Gary Olman is great in damn near everything), the good special effects are there, and it's nice to see Rupert Grint growing into his own skin a bit and not looking so weird looking. The substance so much displayed in the first two isn't there, the heart isn't there (not in the same degree at least). This is not to say the the third film isn't good, I DO like it. It's just the worst of the three and I'm glad that Alfonso Cuarón isn't directing the next film ""Goblit of Fire"", as his eye is obviously meant for more pretentious Art-house cinema.My Grade: C+2-Disc DVD Extras: Disc 1) Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", ""Harry Potter and the Chambers of Secrets"", ""The Polar Express"" & ""Elf"" Disc 2) 5 Deleted Scenes; 11 minute and 50 second Creating The Vision featurette; 7 Interviews with cast & crew with Introduction With The Shrunken Head; Catch Scabbers Interactive Challenge; Choir Practice Sing-Along; Quest Of Sir Cadogan Interactive Challenge; Self-Guided Interactive Tour of Honeydukes; Magic You May Have Missed Interactive Challenge; Self-Guided Interactive Tour of Lupin's Classroom; Care Of Magical Creatures featurette; Conjuring A Scene featurette; and Game PreviewDVD-Rom: Hogwart's Timeline; Trading Cards; Video game preview",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A new darker and adult style,"Except for the childish nonsense of the bus in the beginning, it's the most entertaining entry of the three I've seen-the first three. It's also the most darker and adult. This new refreshing air is worth, above all, of the technicians and, also enough, of the Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón.The special effects are impressive. In fact, together with those of ""Jurassic Park"", they are the digital ones that have surprised me the most; even more than those of the trilogy of ""Lord of the Rings"", and not because they are better or more quantity, but because they are infinitely more imaginative and elegant.The story of Rowling offers, finally, really unexpected twists. Play with our subconscious and, above all, with our prejudices: I was expecting to see Voldemort again reincarnated, resulting bored by the repetition of history, but how would expect the triangle formed by Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew! (Obviously I have not read any of the books yet, I do not know what opinion the lovers of the novel will have about it.)Although we start from a fantastic and magical world, I have been very surprised by the meticulous work in which time travel is minimally coherent.

Seriously, that was how long the movie seemed. Actually within the first three minutes I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I left angry.

Almost perfect.,"I loved Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ; this movie was not as childish as the others, and Alfonso Cuaron did a great job. I love the fact that it is darker than the other ones and the characters are more mature (haven't read the book.. i guess in the book it is like that). The only think I didn't like was some of the effects that seemed so fake considering the mega budget for a HP film. They really have to improve on it, specially on the animals. And there were some shots, specially in the ones when Hermione is held by the tree that look so horrible and in the room you could hear a big laugh for the horrible shot.Gary Oldman looks great on it, the best of actors in the movie.

Puberty hits at Hogwarts,"I'm discovering the Harry Potter universe only now, and together with my own two kids aged 7 and 13, simply because I felt too old and uninterested to watch the movies when they first came out. Three films and more than eight hours of fabulous fantasy-entertainment later, I can only acknowledge this franchise based on J. K. Rowling's successful novels comes highly recommended to everyone, regardless of what age category you are in.What stunned me most about ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is how fluently - and marvelously - the tone and subject themes evolve harmonically with the lead characters. There were ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" were more playful, child-friendly (NOT childish, mind you) and fantasy-like, the third installment is noticeably darker, more convoluted and a lot more mature. The change is also linked to the new choice of director (Alfonso Cuarón of ""Children of Men""), but it's undoubtedly also symbolical for the young wizards' end of childhood and first ventures into adulthood. But, before adolescence comes puberty, and even that era is excellently processed into the script. The youthful lead players depict several typical characteristics of kids this age. Trust me, I know, I have one walking around my house as well. Harry Potter is stubborn, disobedient, and rebellious. Hermione and Ron feel simultaneously uncomfortable but pleasant around each other, etc. Accurate details like these make an already fantastic film even more genius.From a cinematic perspective, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is impeccable as well. The script is fast-paced and full of variety, so that the running time of 145 minutes flies by. This means a lot coming from someone with an allergy for films longer than 2 hours. Light-hearted gimmicks (like flying cars) and straightforward spooky stuff (like the giant spiders of the dark forest) get replaced by genuinely disturbing and nightmarish horror elements, like the Dementors and the Grim. New great actors/actresses join the already stupendous cast, like Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson, while Michael Gambon is a worthy replacement (as Dumbledore) for Richard Harris who passed away. Still, though, one minor point of criticism. The CGI-werewolf transformation is weak and disappointing. For the one and only brilliant werewolf transformation, you will still have to check out the 1981 ""An American Werewolf in London"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Cuarón really knows how to do a Potter movie,"Finally a Harry Potter film that seems like a real film. The two first movies, directed by Chris Columbus, weren't bad, but seeing them without having read the books was a confusing, and sometimes boring experience.This new installment is superior to its predecessors in many aspects: the plot is better explained from the first moment, and the script (by Steve Kloves, who also wrote ""Philosopher's stone"" and ""Chamber of secrets"") condenses better the story without missing capital points from the book. The CGI, which improved a lot from first to second movie, are even more polished, with astonishing new creatures as Buckbeak the hippogriff and things less sensational: the moving stairways are, to give an example, much more credible. The three principal actors have grown ""a little"", as their characters (or a little more), but this is always interesting. New themes are starting to develop that will transform those ""kid's movies"" into something more. Correct performance of Sirius black by Gary Oldman, and hilarious new teacher played by Emma Thompson. All the rest of the original cast are in this one too (excepting Richard Harris, of course, greatly replaced by Michael Gambon), but is a pity for a fan like me to have so few scenes with Maggie Smith. The atmosphere in the film is very creepy, so the younger audiences can be scared with it...a price we have to pay for a more adult, more complex, and a better Harry Potter film. P.S.: The Spanish dubbing is horrible! (almost as much as my written English...)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Different but not necessarily better.,"This third Harry Potter movie is different from the previous two movies. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is darker and much more mature but not better than its predecessors.Yet again there are several things wrong with this Harry Potter movie. The movie starts of too slow with a completely wrong pace due to some poor editing. Once the movie really gets started you'll notice that there are several things different about this movie compared to the first two. No, I'm not just talking about the visual style or the fact that Harry and his friends are wearing 'normal' clothes, I'm mainly talking about the two things that I missed most in the movie; The humor and the adult cast. What made the first two Harry Potter movies excellent to watch was the perfect English adult cast with many big names. In ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the adult cast is heavily underused. Gary Oldman who I normally love was way too plain and boring in this movie, I actually really wish now that he hadn't been in it. Odd thing is that they let the main adult character play by the fairly unknown actor David Thewlis. Micheal Gambon does his best but he really wasn't Dumbledore to me. Richard Harris scene's as Dumbledore always brought a smile on my face and I really enjoyed every scene with him, Gambon just plays the role very plain and I just couldn't like it...Problem is that the story takes itself too serious. The first two Harry Potter movies had a fun feeling especially between the three main characters and some good humor. In ""Harry Potter the Prisoner of Azkaban"" everything is far more serious and less fun. The story also gave me the feeling that it wasn't very original all. It seems like J.K. Rowling uses a bit too many parts and elements from different fantasy genres.Good news is that the special effects are looking great. Another great thing was that there were some nicely done acting sequence's such as the werewolf scene which I found quite good.It is still good entertainment, especially for children and the Potter fans, although the movie probably is too scary for the very young ones.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Spellbinding Review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a captivating masterpiece that seamlessly blends magic, mystery and adventure.

A technical master class,"Rating-8/10Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment of the hugely popular Harry Potter series of adapted films, and what an important one this is. This is a step up not only from the first two in the franchise, but when looking at the series as a whole, this stands as one of the very best. Technically it's beautiful, directed with an air of class and looks sinister yet underneath holds a loving and philosophical tone.This is the kind of movie that many film series just never have, one that stands out and is remembered at times as one with a slightly quirky edge to it. The whole story centres around the escape of convict Sirius Black and basically how frightened all the wizards are because of it, but that's not all this is about. Not including the Quidditch and of course magical lessons, this also contains a kind of heartbreaking story that connects with the main plot to make this an emotional ride, and one that may at times have some reaching for the tissues.Radcliffe and co return better than before, now they aren't quite top quality yet but there are signs here of what is truly to come in future careers. The addition of David Thewlis makes the teaching staff look even better at acting, Alan Rickman as the ever miserable Snape has still got it and cast members such as Robbie Coltrane(Hagrid) make's a much more emotional display. The producers(among them Christopher Columbus who directed the first two) create a cast that is imaginative yet also strangely dark, creating a lovely fresh new look for the movie's.This film cannot be reviewed without mentioning the absolutely magnificent technical achievements coursing though this piece. The cinematography is just amazingly fine, in fact watching this for the camera shots, it is beautiful and the fun ways in which it works makes it stand out to us the viewer too, all credit to Michael Seresin. The sets are well made too, dark yes but it makes this look all together much different from the first two movies, less for the children and more for the growing teenager.Alfonso Cuaron is the real mastermind behind this movie, directing it in a way I don't think anyone could have imagined. He makes it as previously mentioned quirky, and he lets the more serious scenes run their course, letting the comedy also have it's time in the limelight. Cuaron makes this just generally new looking, you'd struggle to find a fantasy film so serious yet so as if it were made to be overly crazy.Is it unique, well yes, is it smart well yes I suppose it is but the main point is emotion, now without ruining the ending it could be said emotions run high(without me saying if they're happy or sad). Harry deals with a lot in the movie, and this Harry Potter as well who lets face it, deals with an over abundance of crazy hijinks on a seemingly daily basis, or maybe that could a yearly basis actually.So overall a new take on a fantasy series that always brings something new to the frontier of movie making, it's a very good piece and one I am sure that will live on in the minds of movie fans and of course Potter fans, for many many years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
David Thewlis and Gary Oldman stole the movie.,"Okay, so I go along to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to enjoy seeing my favourite book of the HP series put on the big screen. The film is excellent, of course, but there is one major problem with it, well, actually two: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. These two excellent actors stole the whole film. No sooner than Remus J Lupin teaches his class to tackle the Boggart, I was aching to see more of his antics ( as we obviously do in the book ). But when Sirius and Remus take the stage together - my God what chemistry. It could have gone on forever and would have if the scene hadn't been reduced so much ( which I'm angry about by the way >:  ).

The Best of the Harry Potter franchise,"10 Years after it's release, this film remains my favorite of the Harry Potter franchise. The 3 leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint) have settled into the characters and the world of movie making and are more than capable of steering these movies. The supporting cast of British acting royalty (Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Robert Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, David Thewliss and Gary Oldman) have a good time playing in this world and the plot is the most interesting of the series.But it is the direction of Alfonso Cuaron that sets this film apart. The first two movies, under the direction of Chris Columbus, the world of Harry Potter was established looking and feeling like a ""kids"" film. Under Cuaron's direction, it transformed into something much more adult. This is a darker story, so this film was shot very dark, the sets are dark, the costumes are dark and it rains constantly. It sets the mood very, very well.His use of everyday clothes (versus constantly being in their school uniforms) also adds to the realistic feel of this movie.As for the story, time travel plot lines are always tricky, but this movie pulls it off well and fairly.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A darker chapter in the wizarding world, with great performances and special effects","The film follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in his third year at Hogwarts, as the escaped convict Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) casts a shadow over the school. Believed to be after Harry, fear and Dementors, soul-sucking creatures guarding Hogwarts, create a tense atmosphere.This movie marks a shift in tone, with Harry no longer the wide-eyed child. He's become more confident, even a bit mischievous. The supporting characters, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), also show growth, with Hermione taking a more assertive role.The film introduces captivating new characters like Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), who teaches Harry how to defend against Dementors, and the misunderstood hippogriff Buckbeak.The special effects are impressive, particularly the gnarled tree that plays a crucial role in the time-twisting climax. The darker, stormier aesthetic by director Alfonso Cuaron effectively contrasts with the whimsical tone of the earlier films.While the film boasts strong performances and visuals, the plot can be confusing at times. The focus shifts between Sirius Black and the unexpected reveal of Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), leaving some questions unanswered.The film excels in its character portrayals. From the delightful performances of Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid to the established brilliance of Alan Rickman as Snape and Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, the acting is top-notch.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a good film, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two installments.

Our favorite book turned into a freakin soap opera...,"This third movie, whether being ravaged by a new director or simply dressed up by Hollywood, was a total let-down. How many of us Harry Potter fans walked out of the movie theater with either a frown or a nasty glare?! The movie seemed to lack a great deal of what the book is based on--magic. The kids were mostly pictured in normal street clothing instead of robes, and the usual air of mystery and fantasy was completely absent. I felt that the story itself didn't change all that much (it was pretty accurate), but the key minute details just weren't there. It was too modern and there was too much of an effort to make Harry and his peers mainstream and modern. The book is based on a world far removed from our own; why did the producers/director try to capture an average high school with wands and freaky creatures? We don't read the books in hopes of seeing another representation of our reality. We read them because the magic, mystery, and adventure captivates us. The dementors, hypogriffs, and animagi were great, but they just weren't enough.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I Wish I Had Been in Azkaban Than Watching This Film :-(,"Whatever was Warner Bros. Pictures thinking when they decided that Alfonso Cuarón should direct this film? First of all his well known film is Y tu mamá también, which was good with critics, but not really Harry Potter worthy if you ask me.First of all, the writer of the script, Steven Kloves, did not do a good job as he had with the previous films. He completely took the book and turned it into more of a Cliff Notes version of the book with leaving some important things out of the film.Now, don't get me wrong but the film is great as a movie, but as an adaption based upon the book it's horrible. It has many flaws, plot holes and worse of all the magic seems to be missing from this film. Not magic as in magic, but the presence of magic that the first two films brought into us fans of the books. Hogwarts even looked different to me.For people who have never read the books you'll love it, but for readers of the books you may have mixed emotions as I did. I liked the film, don't get me wrong, I was just disappointed as a fan of the book. However, I have to give some credit to this film. Since I didn't completely hate it but didn't completely love it.

Harry grows up and things change,"-------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry still must put up with the Dursley's and with too many negative remarks about his parentage, he has an uncontrolled confutation with Aunt Marge.

This could not be at a worse time as a mad prisoner has just escaped from Azkaban prison. And you can guess who his next target is.-------------------------------------------------------------------
As with most movies, there is no justification to book readers as to what was left out or modified. We can, however, compare this to the previous movies. The first thing you notice is how much danker the scenes are, even the train that used to be so colorful is now just a train and filtered out. That is fine as Harry grows up so does the target audience.The one disappointment for me was the castle that they portray in this movie is so much shabbier and deteriorated. It was not necessary unless the director could not find old sets and locations.Also, Sirius never cleans up well.No problem with Hermione getting a punch line, however, Draco Malfoy is turned from a dude of evil potential into a snotty wimp, where is this leading us?I would like to give a laundry list of good and bads but then the surprise will be lost for new viewers that have not read the book.Again, other than a few abbreviations and consolidations this film takes in the essence of the book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"I have to admit, as an AVID READER, this movie was not that great...","Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, there were some cool scenes, but the director altered it SO MUCH, not only from the book, but from the other freaking films. I mean, the landscape of Hogwarts looks like the result of a devastating mudslide based on how much it has changed. It really is noticeable. There are also so many minor alterations from the book that seemed out of place. For example, what the heck was with the talking head on the Knight Bus? That was just dumb. Also, the pace of the entire time they were at school seemed like it went all too quickly and it was rushed. The pace was really off and they never really had an ending to the SCHOOL, just an ending of Harry's adventure/quest.But, there were some good things about the movie, like the Bogart scene for example. Also, Gary Oldman did an excellent job in the small role he had. BUT FINALLY, and most importantly, the feud between Malfoy and Potter has just gone too goddamn far. I mean it is so cheesy, and so corny to a point of feeling uncomfortable watching it. Every time they meet it is like a showdown. They throw out some insults, Malfoy's friends chuckling at his ""clever"" remarks, and Harry's friends stick up for him. In the book it doesn't nearly seem that ridiculous, possibly (and probably) because it is written, not acted out. But I do cut the scene some slack, for two reasons. The first reason is the director is working with inexperienced kid actors. The second reason is that I myself can't imagine them doing it any better ON SCREEN (perhaps they could tone it down and make it more discreet, that is about it). Now, all in all, it was about a 6.5 out of 10. I liked the movie, but from a movie-making point of view, it wasn't that great. The reason, after all of this criticism and negative remarks about the film, that I gave it a high score (in terms of ratings) was that these flaws didn't bother me that much, but they were evident. Now, I can see why someone who is bothered by these flaws and inconsistencies would despise the movie, and I can see why someone who isn't bothered by these flaws and inconsistencies would adore this movie. This was a fun review to write.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great directing in this movie.,"A lot of people will tell you this is the best Harry Potter movie, and there's a good reason for that. This is when the series went from enjoyable fun kids movies to a darker and more mature tone suited more for young adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Creative, Charming, and Clever","Alfonso Cuaron has made a film worthy of the title ""Harry Potter."" Allow me to say: it's about time! After Columbus' slow and obtuse movies, Cuaron's creativity and movement seems like a work of genius.The photography, camera work, set design, acting, and writing are all far superior to that of the first two films. Cuaron has changed the layout of Hogwarts, yes, but changed it for the better, giving character to the landscape with lakes and mountains, changing the castle and interior for a more distinct look. One of my favorite touches is the dormitory, made much cozier and zanier by crooked bunk beds. Columbus' Hogwarts looks like a coloring book; Cuaron's looks like the pet project of a rather batty architect.The director and crew took some artistic license, which, in my opinion, is all for the best. The Knight Bus performs a great stunt, squeezing itself between two Muggle buses; the Leaky Cauldron has crooked hallways and ancient hardwood chambers; Hogsmeade is beautiful in the snow. Talking heads and candy that lets you make animal sounds add to the fun.None of Columbus' dull heavy-handedness is evident here. Instead, the audience must be prepared for hints and subtleties. Cuaron shows the changing of the seasons with the drop of a leaf of the bloom of a flower. The nature of an Animagus is revealed off-handedly during a Defence Against the Dark Arts class. From this bit of information, the audience must put together the pieces and understand why Sirius and Pettigrew can transform into a dog and a rat, respectively. Similarly, you have to catch Ron's constant complaints about Hermione's sudden appearances in class to understand later how she has been using the time turner. It's an active experience; we have to pay attention to get it. Cuaron gives is facts; we have to connect the dots.Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint have all improved visibly. Once again, the direction helps. Scenes juxtaposing the Dursley's at the table with Harry slaving in the kitchen give a better sense of his emotions than simply training the camera on his face. Radcliffe proves himself in a shot where he listens to Professor Lupin talk about his parents. Since Harry and Lupin are not facing each other, Harry lets his emotions play over his face, and we as the audience can witness them. Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic, especially Thewlis, who makes us feel for him even as he is transforming into a werewolf and attacking his friends. Oldman has the typical task of being an insane murderer one moment and an innocent, loving man the next, but pulls it off with his usual skill.The Prisoner of Azkaban also retains more humor. Aunt Marge inflating and floating into the sky is priceless. Trelawney is a blast. Clever additions such as Harry's accidental ""volunteering"" during Care of Magical Creatures elicit a giggle. The film is sharper, wittier, and more charming.The one criticism I could level is the shortness of the Shrieking Shack scene. The dialogue was too fast here, and Cuaron could have afforded to extend it by ten minutes or so. A mention of the identities of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would also have been good and not taken too much time. Overall, however, the film is such an improvement on the first two that this can be forgiven.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Potter movie not for Potter fans,"Someone who hasn't read the book might say this is a good movie or even the best Potter movie ever. But anyone who knows the book will surely be disappointed by it. The most scenes happen in another time, another place, with other persons than or have never took place in the book. But even worse than that is that Hogwarts has become another castle and even the Hogwarts grounds, in the first 2 movies flat and wide are now in mountain style.

The humor works in this one where it seemed forced in the second.

It helped shrinking the quidditch scene as I felt it went too long in the second, and thought the time travel aspect helped in making it more relatable to those of us who grew up with great time travel films ie, Back to the future, Star trek IV the voyage home.

Decent direction can't turn this movie into anything but a big game of Clue.,"Not being one of the hoards of pre-teen Harry Potter fans wanting to jump back into Hogwarts for another round of magic and mayhem, I was probably one of the few who went to see what acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" fame had done with the story.  Would Harry and Ron take Hermione on a fun filled road trip to the beach having various erotic encounters along the way?  Not likely.What I found was more of the same from the other pictures.  If you are a fan and have read everything about the young wizard, you are sure to find a treat in seeing it play out on the big screen.  However as just another muggle with a penchant for movie watching, the story line can be a bit boring and dare I say soap operish at times.  As with the end of the last film, I felt like we were in the middle of a big game of Clue, with the Prisoner of Azkaban in the cabin with the candlestick as one of the many possible scenarios.Visually stunning and special effect full, this latest entry was a pleasure to enjoy.  The camera shots are far superior to the work from the first two and you couldn't ask for better back drops for Harry and friends to fly, run, fight, and frolic as we wind down another chapter in Who Dun It mystery theater.Like Chinese food it's a fun ride but at the end a little unfulfilling.

"Great acting, lousy story","I so wanted to love this movie! But it's not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Parts of the movie have improved over the other two films, but it also lost something they had. The acting was awesome--the kids have so much improved, and Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman were superb, as usual. And the visuals, the camera work, and the scenery were fantastic. But the film lacked a great story. There was so much left out of what happened in the book, and it went way too fast! I don't see how the longest book can turn into the shortest movie. I would have gladly sat through an extra half-hour to further develop the details of the story and characters.

"The Best ""Harry Potter"" among the first ones","Harry Potter was not specifically designed for the cinema, that is why adapting a Harry Potter book for the big screen was, in itself, a challenge. The first two of the movies were quite faithful to the book, but took the time to show some details of the world of HP, for example life at school or others things that were not indispensable to understand the story completely. With the change of the director (Cuaron replaces Colombus) comes a change in the way the story is set up for the screen. Cuaron didn't think it was necessary to keep the previous details, in order to focus exclusively on the story. It might be a bit embarrassing for the people who are not familiar with the atmosphere of Harry Potter, but for the other it is really efficient: The story turns to be more intensive and breath-taking. Nothing to say about the actors, they are mainly the same than in the previous movies. A last word concerning the music: when will Williams retire???

The story is intriguing right from the beginning and you notice straight away that it's different from the first 2 movies when you see that scene on the train which sets out the dark tone of the movie. What I like about these Harry Potter movies is that there's a few twists and you cannot predict what will happen next.

This Harry Potter didn't meet expectations.,"Our family are avid Harry Potter fans, and to say that this installment of the series left us wondering what happened to the Harry Potter style is an understatement. There was so much important information left out of The Prizoner of Azkaban we wondered if it was the same story. Our oldest child who has read all five books several times (even out of order), and our second child who has also read them several times, were telling us what important things were excluded that lead into the fourth installment.For instance,leaving out Cho Chang who has a significant role in the next two books, or changing the location of Hogwarts all of a sudden- what happened to the field outside? And since when do the students dress in their street clothes all the time they're out of class? The pond in the middle of the woods is not there in the book, it is near Hagrid's hut which is not at the bottom of the hill. No hill in the book.Also. What's up with Fred and George knowing about the invisibility cloak---no one knew except Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore (whom might I add would have been better played by Ian McKellen (Gandolph from the Lord of the Rings). Also, when Snape went into the Whomping Willow he wore the invisibility cloak, in the book. Also. The broom was given to Harry for Christmas and was used in several Quiddich games, which were not shown nor were they mentioned, which brings me to wonder why the Quiddich tournament was is not mentioned as is usually is. And most importantly. The dementors do not fly---they glide on the ground; and the patronous is a stag not a shield. We do not appreciate the extreme(in our opinions) detour from the plot of the books. There were many things that should've been in, and many things that shouldn't have been in this installment. If this one does as well it will only be because of the Harry Potter name. Please do not use this director again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
WOW THIS MOVIE TOTALLY Surprised ME!!!!!,"I went to a NYC Screening of this movie and all I have to say is Wow.

As always Dan, Rupert, Emma, and Robbie play there parts well but I was surprised about how good David Thewlis played Lupin he was awesome and was meant for the role. Gary Oldman played Sirius well but he looked a little too old for the part but who cares anyway. Micheal Gambon was just as good as Richard Harris as Dumbledore.

Harry 3 the rough version,"Anybody who has read the books will be able to tell you just how good the Prisoner of Azkaban was, and how good the movie really should have been. POA is by far my favorite of the five books that have been so far released and to say I was excited to watch this movie doesn't even come close. This was the first of the Potter movies that I went to see on the big screen and although I did enjoy the amount of information and aspects that made the book so good were sadly missing from this adaptation. Add the fact that due to a new director the grounds were completely changed and you find more reasons for me being upset at Alfonso Cuaron. Richard Harris being replaced didn't help either but that couldn't be changed unfortunately. Harris was the best person for the job and although Gambon did an almighty job in the role there really was no way to replace the man who many people will now see as the face of Albus Dumbeldore.But anyway enough with the critical side of things, I'm not paid to do that. (I'm obviously not paid enough to do my actually job either since I'm doing this whilst in the office! Oops) Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is about to start his third year at Hogwarts but all is not well. His Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris), although not his actual aunt he still had to call her that under strict orders from Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), is coming to stay and she's brought her dog with her too. All sorts of antics occur and eventually her bad mouthing of Harry's parents (James and Lily) leads to her blowing up, not in an explosive way but a floating away sort of way. Which forces Harry to leave his summer home and take to the road, enter the Knight Bus which takes him to the leaky cauldron in London and all sorts of hectic adventures can start right there. The introduction of several new characters occurs in this latest episode of the boy wizard including Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and the maniacal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and there former friend Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) these three actors I believe did there parts tremendously and although the relinquishing of the directors title of Chris Columbus I did enjoy this movie, here's hoping that Goblet of Fire is better.

This one was even darker than the 2nd one and I remember how dementors freaked me out as a kid but it's still nothing compared to sequels. Young actors are much better this time, especially Radcliffe. He really surprised me. Watson and Grint did a really good job too. And there is so much new actors in this movie and ,oh my god, they were brilliant. Emma Thompson was hilarious as prof. Trelawney, Timothy Spall in role I'm not gonna mention because, spoilers, and, man, Gary Oldman did such a brilliant job as Sirius Black. Michael Gambon was really good as Dumbledore but still not as good as Richard Harris (R.I.P.) who really was Dumbledore from the book.

The credits say it was filmed partly in Scotland, which probably accounts for the change. While the essence of the plot was intact, the pacing was slow. The best part of the movie was the Marauder's Map, which was shown throughout the final credits.

B+,"How difficult is to transform a 435-page book into a truly brilliant 2 1/2 hour movie? In ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the real conflict and problem in the movie is just this -- the adaptation could've been better. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed the movie now that a fresh and new director has taken the helm. It's an extremely visual feature that puts the entire series on a darker, more sinister path and saves it by giving it a completely different look, a change I found to be terrific and much better than the previous movies. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is brimming with pure delight and fascinating eye candy, and the presence of Alfonso Cuaron truly shines.First, let me address my only gripe about this movie. The story felt rushed and underdeveloped, and the only reason I understood it was because I had read the book. Your children may have a high degree of difficulty as the story sweeps past fast, but sometimes I felt this is just what the series of movies needed -- a faster pace. The first two dwelled on things I felt irrelevant or unnecessary, but this movie gets right to the very dark heart of things and becomes a more streamlined and thrilling movie. Overall, the adaptation was okay, but the movie needed to explain things a bit more and throughly explore the characters' situations; now I wonder how The Goblet of Fire will be like adapted *gulps*...The acting was alright, but somehow I felt Harry to be the weakest actor of all the three (he's still great and fits the part perfectly, of course). His scene when he found Sirius to be his parents' killers didn't affect me as I thought it would, and I found that to be one of the most critical scenes in the entire movie. Emma and Rupert are developing actors here too, but Daniel could use a bit more help if he wants to play this critical role to its full potential. The other shining performances I felt really proved terrific was Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Exactly as I imagined in the book...truly brilliant, and as for the new Dumbledore...some people are heavily disappointed because he's different, and his persona is not like the late Richard Harris, but he does a good job replacing him and proving himself to be a good Dumbledore; I still think Richard Harris did a better job.Yet the real reason why ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" proves to be the best in the acclaimed series is the excellent visuals. Alfonso Cuaron's vision is so much more creative than that of Chris Columbus, and paired with some breathtaking special effects and sweeping camera angles the movie has taken on a darker feel that spectacularly delivered. I really like the way he uses the environment to add to the scene and putting the characters and setting in a way as to encourage a certain feeling. It's beautifully dark. I wish he could direct another Potter film because he captures what I believe the Harry Potter series embodies -- darkness (not that darkness is everything in Harry Potter, but I find it more interesting.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is great, but not perfect; small flaws in the pacing and action that outshine the story hinder it, but the visuals save it.

"After 20 years, Prisoner of Azkaban is still a great installment with a subtle dark atmosphere and superb acting","I loved the first two Harry Potter movies. Sorcerer's Stone, while not without some problems, was still a pretty good start to the movie franchise while Chamber of Secrets is even better with improved child acting and interesting mystery. Prisoner of Azkaban is another great installment. My only quibbles is that while it does have some humor, it isn't quite as funny when compared to the first two which had some good humor and Michael Gambon isn't quite as strong as Richard Harris in terms of Dumbledore's portrayal although he did a decent job.Everything else is handled greatly. In terms of being an adaptation (considering the movie franchise got me into reading the books as well as the fantasy genre in general), it does have some changes, but it was a noble effort in capturing some of the complexities. Not only that, it managed to have character development to not only the Trio, but the side characters as well notably Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Plus, the acting from everyone involved is superb. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson did great in their chemistry as the Trio while the supporting actors did a superb job including Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Pam Ferris (which is funny consider Pam Ferris played Aunt Trunchbull from Matilda, an adaptation of one of Roald Dahl's books that inspired Harry Potter and Emma Thompson did her portrayal of Aunt Trunchbull in that 2022 Netflix movie adaptation of the musical).The directing from Alfonso Cuaron (A Little Princess and Gravity) is unique which captures the dark atmosphere while adding a sense of maturity, the cinematography is beautiful, the special effects are nice especially the Dementors in their chilling appearance, the makeup is great especially Wormtail played by Timothy Spall. And last but not least the music score from John Williams. While not in the same league as the music from the previous two, it's still good and a nice sendoff for the composer considering he later went on to compose music for other movies.Overall, Prisoner of Azkaban is still a great installment of the movie franchise after 20 years. Recommended. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best one yet!,"It's a peculiar thing. The ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was written by the same author ... adapted by the same screenwriter ... played by the same cast ... so why the hell is it so much better than the previous two? The answer, of course, lies in the change of director. Mr Columbus, I don't want to hurt your feelings but ... you suck. The arrival of foreign director Alfonso Cuarón has saved the franchise for me, just when I was about ready to give up on the whole series of films. The problem was that I could see the potential of the books, which had thus far not been realised on film. They just had no magic about them at all. But this latest offering from Hogwarts has plenty of that magic to spare.The colour palette for the movie is suddenly all dark shades of blue and green, a stark contrast to the browney-orangey memories I have of the first two -- and it suits the mood of the film so much better. And remember all those tedious sequences that you hated in the other two movies (i.e. the Dursley household, Dumbledore's office)? Well, in this one either they're cut short or they're done in an interesting way.Also, the dialogue is considerably less clunky, even though it's written by the same people and spoken by the same actors. Either Cuarón fiddled with the script a little, or he taught the kids how to act. It certainly appears so, as the three child stars who failed to be convincing in the previous movies have suddenly learned their craft a whole lot better. The new arrivals, notably Gary Oldman and David Thewlis, are somewhat unusually cast in their roles, but both come off extremely well.One criticism of the film is that it may be a little confusing to those who haven't read the books. Whereas the previous two movies had those tedious dialogue sequences which explained everything that happened, this one sacrifices those to save the pace of the film. I only wish that Cuarón had signed on to direct the next installment, and then I could honestly say ""The Goblet of Fire"" is one of my most anticipated movies of the coming years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disgracing a Noble Series,"Harry Potter, the new rage of the century and turning new generations onto reading. Recently this beloved books have been transformed into motion pictures. Other than simple nitpicks the first films, depicting the first two novels in the series were tolerable. They are outlines of the plot and it is understandable why many things were cut and changed so as not to make a PG movie three hours long. Yesterday the new film reflecting the events of the third novel in the series was released and I must say that reviews from the Times to Newsweek are praising it, so it must be better than the satisfactory first two. This assumption is terribly wrong. The turning point of the series the Prisoner of Azkaban is, however unlikely, worse than its sister films. Somewhere at sometime they must've tossed the book out the window and started from scratch. Critical events to the plot were butchered and glazed over and some key points that are important in the future Harry Potter books are not even mentioned. The film went far too fast paced to give the viewer the same satisfaction given when reading the book itself. If you are planning on enjoying this film then I recommend not being a fan of the books or having read them at all. The only ones people who could sit down and watch this film without being purely disappointed are those who have never read the books and aren't planning on it soon. I must say this is absolutely the worst movie adaption and I plan on never seeing this movie ever again, for it has ruined one of the best books in the series. I can only pray that the same writing staff is not hired for the future movies, especially the Order of the Phoenix (e-mail me if you wish me to elaborate or discuss the subject)",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Top-1 of Harry Potter Films.,"I think and i know (:)) that... It was brilliant idea to invite Alfonso Cuaron. Perfect directing and book ADAPTATION. Not copy, but adaptation. 1st of all. Harry's Hair. Hermione's Hair, The Leacky Cauldron, Knight Bus etc etc etc. I saw Harry Potter World on the Screen, each detail of it, like chairs in The Leacky Cauldon or a knight walkin' from picture to picture on the background. Yes, i didn't see Harry Potter's 3rd book on 100%. I didn't see a story about animages, and Gambon as Dumbledore not so ""dumbledored"", but i see life in his eyes(sorry about Harris, but i need to say that). If u red ""Albus Dumbledore's Big Game"" - huge Russian theory about Harry Potter books, u will see that Gambon is those ""gamer"". Also, i saw atmosphere of HP. Movie - is not a book. I think it's stupid to read a book on the screen. I can read it in my armchair with cup of tea. I want to see a World. I want to see all, what i can only imagine by reading. And i saw it only in Cuaron's film. And it's cool. Thank you Alfonso, for realism and perfect book ADAPTATION.P.S. Sorry for my English. I'm Russian :P",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best Harry Potter film!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) follows Harry as he returns to Hogwarts and faces a new threat, an escaped convict name Sirius Black. This is my favourite film of the franchise! It's super entertaining with a lot of tension, mystery, and some very memorable new characters.The visual effects once again feel ahead of their time, and the cinematography is impressive! There's a broad range of colour palettes used with some good framing choices, and the use of fog brings a mysterious and very eerie feel to the film. The creature designs, especially the dementors, are great and incredibly effective at invoking horror. The CGI is also impressive for the Hippogriff!The score is very good, and the sound design adds a very unnerving tone to the movie. The score includes the iconic music known from the Harry Potter films but also includes some new tracks that fit the mood well, it was mainly loud and fit the fantasy genre well.The acting is phenomenal in this film, and it I no introduces even more iconic character. Lupin and Sirius are introduced well and they are both super interesting characters! Even though he's not a main character, I also love Stan, he's funny and a nice little addition. The dialogue is well written and I find that the humour is used well in this film, there are a lot of moments that make me chuckle!The film is consistently paced with so many entertaining moments and a lot of depth. There's also a strong sense of mystery throughout that leads to a satisfying and shocking twist. My favourite scenes in this film include the Knight Bus scene, which is iconic, funny and attention-grabbing, and the scene on the train with the dementors, which I find brings a whole new level of horror to the Harry Potter universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
There's got to be SOME reason why these stories are so popular . . .,"I have yet to read one of the Harry Potter' books and maybe it's high time I did  because, based upon the movies made from them, I have a hard time seeing exactly why they're so popular.To be sure, the first movie (which, like the second, I saw as a chaperone for my young nieces) has a certain low-key charm, as the notion (and presentation) of the Hogwarts School of Wizardry contains enough wow-ee inventiveness to be sufficiently engaging. And, of course, the tried and true theme of the ugly-duckling transformed into a prince (or, closer still, the poor waif plucked from obscurity and ill-treatment to be lead into a life of wonder and personal distinction) that Harry's story represents is a surefire route to the capture of any child's imagination. It is accomplished, too, with sly Dickensian wit that can prove similarly entertaining to adults. As a stand-alone movie (and book, I guess), I can certainly see the appeal of Harry Potter.'But as a SERIES?? It seems to endlessly repeat itself and its dramatic beats in each succeeding storyline. So, in this third movie we get  yet again - an opening glimpse into Harry's home life with the cruel and spiteful Dursleys (whose overstated and unwarranted evil grew tiresome even before their exit from the *first* film); his re-acquaintance with friends Ron and Hermione on the train to Hogwarts; the preparations for the upcoming academic year; the maddeningly brief and perfunctory introduction to each of the whimsical wizardry classes for that year  all populated with masterful British actors who get only the most token of screen time; Harry's ongoing (and boring) rivalry with the dreaded Malfoy (whose one-dimensionality bespeaks an artistic laziness); and the entire movie threaded through with an underlying evil and threat (either to Harry, the school in general, or both) which finally erupts into the inevitable rousing (or, would-be rousing) showdown at the end. Frankly, this last always stretches my credulity, as it becomes increasingly clear with each tale that not only is Hogwarts possibly the most dangerous place in the world for Harry to be, but that it is populated by a staff of `expert' wizards who are singularly ineffectual in combating any kind of outside threat. One gets the perverse sense that the school should actually be *run* by Harry and Hermione, rather than developing them from diamond-in-the-rough wunderkinds who only gradually come to expertise in their fledgling magical powers.Now, don't get me wrong: as a kid, I too was taken with books written in series (starring the likes of Encyclopedia Brown, the Hardy Boys, and the Great Brain) and demanded nothing more from them than that they provide the same types of stories and interactions that I loved so well the first time round. But J.K. Rowling's inflation of her books to near `War and Peace' lengths, as well as her insistence that each one represents a further step in the development of a larger artistic master plan strikes me as so much pretentious piffle. I don't begrudge kids their fun  and ANYTHING that promotes reading on such a wide scale is to be cherished and encouraged. But let's call a spade a spade.And, while we're at it, let's call Rowling a sell-out. If there's ANY work of literary fiction that could stand on its own, without a movie needed to popularize it among the masses, it's Harry Potter' (probably Lord of the Rings' too, but we won't go into that). Frankly, I think the beloved authoress let slip a grand opportunity to stick her tongue out (and finger up) to Hollywood by refusing to allow her books to be adapted into movies. She certainly doesn't need the money, the books don't need the exposure, and it would have provided her young readers a glimpse into true artistic integrity at work: an example that some things *don't* work best when the most money and advertising is thrown at them . . . that sometimes, the inner recesses of your imagination is the best place for beloved characters to reside.And of course, had she done so, we as moviegoers wouldn't be subjected to productions so overly reverent to their source that the makers live in terror of leaving even the tiniest of details out. Why o why is it important for Potter fans  who know everything that's going to happen anyway  to be able to see Hollywood's representations of their private fantasies? Why o why is it important for us non-Hogwarts initiates to be force-fed every scene and character from the book in a compressed running time that gives none of it any room to breathe or create any resonance? It's the absolute worst of all worlds, and everybody loses. (Yes, even fans of the books who enjoy the movies  because, whether they realize it or not, their own mental pictures of the characters and situations, formed when reading, are being reprogrammed and reconstituted by Hollywood. It's doubtful whether, having seen the movies, even the most die-hard reader can ever picture Harry as anyone other than Daniel Radcliff, or Professor Snape as Alan Rickman, etc.. . . Which maybe wouldn't even be an important point to bring up, except for the fact that the books had clearly done such an EXCELLENT job at capturing young imaginations, all on their ownsome. Now, even that accomplishment becomes suspect.)But oops, I realize I haven't yet said anything about the newest movie, re-conceived by director Alfonso Cuaron, which has received buckets and buckets full of praise (and, truth be told, was the only reason I went at all). Well, yes, he is a better director than Chris Columbus, and the photography in certain scenes is much more dramatic than anything in the other two, but we're getting into some pretty minute distinctions. It's a Harry Potter' film, and so subject to all the same annoyances and inconsistencies mentioned above. See it if you must - but me, I'm heading for the library . . .",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Be a movie, or be a book. Not this half-assed thing.","Effects are amazing, it's a fun spectacle.That being said: Yes, it's a freaking huge book, and there's absolutely no way to get the whole thing into the movie. But the choices they made... Fans of the book will be disappointed by the crucial plot elements that get left out, and people who've never read the book will have no idea what the hell is going on. But if the critics are any indication, people who like auteur directors apaprently will not care that this movie has plot holes you could drive the Hogwarts Express through.For example, if you haven't read the book and you've seen this, you might be asking:How does Lupin recognize the map? Who are Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs? What the hell was that stag thing I saw for 2 seconds? What just happened?Obviously, I'm a dork fan of the book, but when I see a movie adaptation I don't expect the book. I expect a movie that can stand alone, have a coherent plot and fleshed-out characters. I'd rather they cut out even more plot elements from the book, which became meaningless in the jumble of events here anyway, and devoted more time to developing the few things that were left, like the characters and relationships. And that freeze frame -- just... don't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Much of story missing,"The first two installments were so in-line with the book, but Azkaban left out so many critical and interesting points that the story suffers for it. This movies run time was too short and while the bird flying into the Whomping Willow was cute, there were too many redundant scenes and if these were cut, there would have been more time for the important dialogue in the Shreiking Shack. The school choir was another example of this, interesting, but not in the book. Also it was disappointing that this movie did not begin with Harry's birthday and end as the first two ended. But, the dementors were absolutely fantastic, as was the Maruaders map!! Stay until the end credits are over for a small bonus; besides that the Map is worth watching the complete credits.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The least cartoon-like of the three films,"Finally, an installment in the Harry Potter series that has a serious amount of intelligence. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the most film-like of the three movies, and definitely the least cartoon-like. It looks like Warner Brothers made a smart move by replacing the director with a professional: Alfonso Cuaron (the new director) sure gives the impression that he knows what he's doing, unlike Chris Columbus' clumsy work on the first two Harry Potter movies. Then again, Cuaron directed some great films, such as ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y tu mama tambien"", while Chris Colombus' major credits are Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. It is quite understandable (and obvious) that Cuaron is the more professional of the two.One of the things that annoyed me the most about the first two films is how pastoral the world looked, especially the Hogwarts grounds. I always thought that the Quiddich sequences in the first two films looked abnormally fake, and they were my least favorite parts of both films. I'm not sure why I thought they looked so fake, but it was probably a combination of the shiny, spotless witness stands, the smooth, bright green grass and the perfect blue sky, and a very ""fake"" filming style. Cuaron changes all this. His most obvious addition to the series is just how dark he managed to make the Harry Potter world. Quiddich never looked so real. Then again, in Prisoner of Azkaban you never really see the Quiddich field, as it's raining cats and dogs (not literally). The filming style of the Quiddich came, though, is so much better than that of the Quiddich games in the first two films. Also, the Hogwarts grounds are no longer so green and perfect: they are now very muddy, with ugly, pale weeds growing all over the place, and the entire place is littered with gray rocks and boulders. It just looks so much more real than the flawless, bright green grass in the first two films. Also, there is almost never a blue sky: it's always cloudy and very murky. This was a great touch, and it was a great decision to change the pastoral look of Hogwarts to a gloomier appearance.Another thing I must praise Cuaron for is the acting he managed to squeeze out of his actors: Daniel Radcliffe's (Harry) performance in the first two films always annoyed me, but Cuaron really managed to turn him into a pretty good actor. He does a great job in expressing Harry's emotions in this film, which was very important since this is when they really start getting turbulent. Rupert Grint (Ron) doesn't really have much to do except whine and look terrified, and Emma Watson's (Hermione) acting never really bothered me. But, as usual, the actors that really shine are the adults. Alan Rickman, as usual, is stunning in his role as Snape: he truly was the perfect choice. The three newcomers were also great. David Thewlis was good as Lupin, although I always imagined Lupin's character as a much more sympathetic one, but then again his condition probably really agitates him, so his attitude in some scenes is probably appropriate for his character. Gary Oldman, as usual, is excellent in his role as Sirius Black. While we're supposed to sympathize his character, at the end of the film he still looks ruddy, dirty and slightly crazy. And last but not least, Emma Thomson was excellent in her somewhat small role as Professor Trelawney: the filmmakers made her exactly how I imagined her to be.The main problem with the film is some bad storytelling at some points. For someone who read the books, watching the movie is really no problem, because they can fill in the gaps themselves according to what was in the book and not featured in the movie, but for people who haven't read the book, the movie looked to me as very difficult to understand. There were quite a few points that something wasn't explained on screen that made somewhat of a difference in the scene, and some cases in which I wouldn't have been able to understand what was going on unless I'd have read the book (which, as I mentioned before, I did). Bottom line is, it might be a bit difficult to see this film unless you know what's going on.To sum it all up, Alfonso Cuaron, the new director, certainly proved himself as someone who knows what he's doing. He's managed to improve this film from the first two in almost every aspect: acting, mood, production design, cinematography, visual effects, and of course, direction. It's really too bad that Cuaron's not directing the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (this is due to the fact that filming on Goblet of Fire began while Prisoner of Azkaban was still in post-production), and I really hope that the new director will take a few leafs out of Alfonso Cuaron's book. The great thing about this film is that he's so much of a professional, movie buffs (like me, for instance) who enjoy watching ""artsy"" movies, will probably like this one as well, for its artistic merits (check out some great use of time as an artistic tool near the end of the movie, mostly usage of the giant clock installed in the school in some shots I described before). But, a few things that bugged me about this movie lower its value a bit. Also, the fact that I just don't like J.K. Rowling lowered its value a bit. Final evaluation: definitely worth seeing, but it might be too complex (and quite scary, at times) for the younger ones.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Azkaban,The Prisoner of Azkaban is when the Harry Potter series takes a turn for the better. The quality in film and budget has seemingly increased and the story begins to take a more dark and serious tone. It's very cool to watch the story line evolve with the characters as they also grow and mature. This particular movie really sets the stage for the movies to come while still being entertaining and surprising itself. I think this was one of the better movies of the series for character development and setting the tempo for things to come.

My favorite harry potter movie!,"**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)**Rating: (9/10)""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" stands out as a standout entry in the series, thanks to Alfonso Cuarón's imaginative direction and a darker, more mature tone. The film introduces intriguing new characters like Sirius Black and Remus Lupin while expanding on the wizarding world's depth and complexity. The story's blend of mystery, suspense, and emotional depth adds layers to the already rich narrative. The visual style is distinct and captivating, with impressive effects and set designs that enhance the film's atmosphere.

don't tell me they based it from the book!,"It seems that this third part of the Harry Potter movie sequel is not part of the sequel at all. Its entirely farfetch from the book and the new director even have some fun doing the changes. I am very frustrated by this movie, and my wait hasn't been paid off. My expectations were too far from what i saw on the screen and the new director failed me. It thought this would be a better movie from the two. well, i think JK should be more strict the next time her book is being filmed and see to it that is depicts the events from the books even just a 50 percent from it.Yeah, the new background and the already-grown-up cast and has been portrayed more maturely is indeed very nice, but still, the movie is too far from the book.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
fairly entertaining...,"I can say i enjoyed this movie but i can't say it was a fabulous adaption of the book. I mean they took out so many important scenes that would be useful in the later movies, aside from that the acting was terrific Dan, Emma, Rupert, Robbie, tom and etc all played there roles perfectly. And Professor Mcgonnagal played by Maggie smith was once again brilliant, and Gary old man's performance as Sirius Black was my favorite. David Thewlis gave a terrific performance as Professor Lupin, and the visual effects were great and my favorite was Buckbeak he was so beautiful i wish i could just take him home. A downfall was the director Alfonso Cuaron now i'm not being mean i don't think he is a bad director but he was bad director at making a harry potter movie. And what was with tom the barkeeper he turned all goofy and weird, and even though tom felton did a great performance as Malfoy his character was sissy than ever...Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a fairly good entertaining movie but it was missing stuff the other two potter movie's had.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
From wizarding 11 year old to maturing teenager...Harry's just grown up.,"When viewing 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', you really begin to see how much more mature the young casting members have become when you cast your mind back to 2001 when they made their Potter debut's, in the 'Philosopher's Stone'. As a member of this current generation, I can soundly say it was a privilege to have grown up with this consistently thrilling and entertaining series of movies - originating from the stimulus of author J.K Rowling.Anyway - enough off the topic - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now in his third year at Hogwarts. After reaching the end of his tether with the dreaded Dursley's, the teenage wizard flees the nest and soon realises he needs to watch his guard. This due to the fact Azkaban convict Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) - the murderer of Harry's parents - has escaped and is on the prowl for Harry. Also, the Dementors - new guards at Hogwarts - have a withdrawal effect towards Harry as he struggles to cope with all of his personal life, despite support from friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).An enforced casting change from the 'Chamber of Secrets' was required following the untimely death of acting great Richard Harris. However, filling his boots solidly was the more eccentric Michael Gambon. Although he's no Harris, Gambon's interpretations of the old wizard are easy to adapt to.Again, the dark ambiance/atmosphere is increased as Potter finally becomes more than just a children's wizarding fantasy - it becomes more appealing to older generations. Seriously though, if you thought 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was too dark for your child, they certainly shouldn't view the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as certain areas of the film can send a brief shiver down the spine of even the oldest of civilians.In brief, this is the best of the first three.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Potter just keeps getting better,"I don't read books.  I have mentioned this in reviews before, but every time a Harry Potter movie comes out, I feel embarrassed that I am one of what seems only a handful of people that have never cracked open a J.K. Rowling experience.It's not that I can't read or that I don't have the time, it's just that I find it simpler to have a director tell me a story on the screen from their interpretation of a book or screenplay.  The best books and stories are usually purchased by Hollywood anyways, so by the time I finally get to the back cover of any purchase, the movie version would be nearing the end of its multiplex run anyhow.So when I went to see the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I immediately felt out of place with the young pre-teen kids in the line both in front and behind telling their parental guides what their best parts of the book were and what scenes they are most looking forward too.  They seemed to be foaming at the mouth in anticipation while my lone spark of interest was the fact that the reins of the franchise had been turned over to director Alfonso Cuaron who also is accredited with the wonderfully, 2003 Oscar nominated film Y Tu Mama Tambien.Such a curious choice as the first two Potter films had been incredibly successful under the watchful eye of Chris Columbus who was known for his family films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone.  Cauron, on the other hand, has a much darker side as evidenced in the sexually driven Tambien and his 1998 adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations.  I was then peaked when it was announced that Cauron vision would be applied to the next Potter film and thus my standing in line with a group of rabid looking kids who I had no doubt will cheer as soon as the theatre lights dim.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third of the Potter books totaling five and this installment follows the growing Potter gang as Harry is faced with the threat of convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison and is expected to try and kill our young Potter as per his former masters' wishes.Of course, the books and movies would not be as popular as what they are if it wasn't for an array of magic, special effects, and mythical creatures and maybe even a plot twist or two to help keep us on our toes.  And rest assured, this adaptation has them all.  The special effects are top rate including the Dementors who are sent to protect Hogwart's and the tree outside the school, that later plays a big part in the climax, is both fascinating and provides some humor.  There is a creature in the film that is a cross between a horse and a bird that was too Harryhausen for my tastes, but I am sure it made for a wonderful character in the book and therefore I can't complain that they kept things consistent.Pretty much every actor in Britain plays a role in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Emma Thompson, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon (who steps into the role vacated due to the death of Richard Harris), and the Julies (Christie and Walters) all show up on screen at one time or another.  I guess anyone that couldn't get work in Altman's Gosford Park joined a collective and put their efforts into this film.  Gary Oldman is one of the newbees to the set and he does the best with what is a very limited and understated part.  The three main characters of Potter and his two best friends are back, and it will be interesting to see them in the next Potter movie as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are now in their mid-teens and no longer the young wizards they were just three years ago.It's always hard when it comes to the third film of a franchise.  Return of the Jedi is more of an embarrassment each time I watch it (sorry, Ewoks), The Lord of the Rings and the Matrix third entries also were a disappointment.  But the Potter films seem to be getting stronger each time. I will no doubt agree that the change of director this time round was instrumental in bringing a darker storyline to the table, but to continue to better your achievements in both story and screen presentation each time is a feat not often achieved.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a delight.  It was a children's movie with adult situations and effects and the story was complex enough to even have me wondering to myself how it was all going to tie in together in the end.  Now, I won't pick up the next book just because of my recommendation here, but I will ensure I have a ticket for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire due out in 2005.www.gregsrants.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hmmmmmm,"This is not the Harry Potter that we've come to expect. This kid, and his friends Hermione and Ron, have become rebellious...like todays teens. Of course, they ARE teens now. But they've actually become disrespectful, yelling SHUT UP to adults and generally acting a bit too much like I see kids doing everywhere. It make it a bit more difficult to actually LIKE the kids the way we have in the past. The story is, as usual, very good, the acting first-rate and the special effects are better than the previous films. There is a little less ""wonder"" built in, with emphasis on the story and characters rather than the magical stuff at Hogwarts (floating candles and the like). The tone of this film is a good bit darker than the previous two also. However, I still enjoyed watching it and will, as always, eagerly await the next installment of the Harry Potter series. However, I only gave it a 7 out of 10 because of what I cited about the attitudes of the kids.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another great addition to the series,"Who better to play Sirius Black than Gary Oldman, or who better than David Thewlis to play the friendly Professor Lupin. The new characters fit into the story like they have always been a part of it, and maybe indeed they were, as the movie shows the story of the past goes beyond than a small glimpse, and their ties with the boy who lived is much stronger than would have seemed in the first 2 movies. We get a new face to professor Dumbledore who plays a fantastic role, and proves some great acting skills.

And Voldemort is not really appear now, everything is as good as a dream that you never wake up. In the end of the movie they fly in the cloud, I believe they really feel happy and free, free like wind. And, this movie do not have that noisy and horrible people and things, this is a movie really focus on Harry Potter and his friend themselves, not treat them as a tool to show the whole Hogwarts and the whole wizard world, det vill säga, Harry Potter in this movie is just Harry, the boy Harry with his friends.

"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (UK/USA, 2004)","The third year of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has begun. This year, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who was accused by the Potter's parents murder, has scape from Azkaban Prison - until then considered as leakproof - and now, everything indicates that he's looking for Harry to finish what he had no opportunity to do.As safety measure, the Dementors - strange creatures that feed themselves with the energies and the soul of anyone who approaches them - are sent by the Ministry of Magic from Azkaban to protect Hogwarts School. But they can make the things become more difficult there too. This time, Professor Lupin will help Harry to discover the truth history of Sirius and why they both are so connected.Within this exciting plot, based on the novel by J. K. Rowling of the same title, Cuarón (The Little Princess, 1995) gamble to its excellent creativity - and good taste - at work with the dark, mysterious and magical photography - so different from the charming and magical world of the first two films, directed by Christopher Columbus - and the ability to work with young minds that developed with ""Y tu mamá también"" (2001).Kloves can put together a spectacular cast to the development of the series: Gary Oldman (""Hannibal"", 2001), Michael Gambon (""Sleepy Hollow"", 2001), David Thewlis (""Seven Years in Tibet"", 1997) and Emma Thompson (""Love Actually"", 2003) are phenomenal actors together to make the fans of Harry Potter becomes increasingly enchanted with the productions. It is important to mention that Gambom was named for replace Richard Harris due to death of it and exceed the expectations of the production team: with his strong Irish accent, managed, along with the dark sphere, given more personality to your character (Albus Dumbleodore) without being noticed as a rookie.Although the amazing cast, the script left to wish. Like the first two films, some details of the story were left out and others being treated only superficially, disappointing a little bit those who also follow the thrilling story of the young wizard through reading. But this point cannot be noticed at first glance: the special effects - in which the team of David Heyman worked hard - even snatch the soul of one who hates the magical world of Harry with the help of the lovely soundtrack composed by John Williams to meet the Scottish sets and landscapes.In this third year of the series, what we have new are the Dementors: vicious creatures that feed on the souls and energies of others, used as guardians of Azkaban, the most safety prison of the wizardry world. They are very similar to the Black Riders from the ""The Lord of the Rings"". But to balance such cruelty, there is the appearance of the Hippogriff: a lovely creature half-horse and half-eagle, along with the Marauder's Map showing the location of all inside the Hogwarts castle, will make young imagination go very far.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is, until now, the best movie of the series. Even having developed his script less than it could, can create expectations of what could be the next film of the series, helping to create the obscure sphere that involves the central plot of the story of the young wizard and making your fans stay remain spellbound with each event.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004):,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004):
The third Harry Potter film is widely regarded as one of the best in the series, and for good reason. Director Alfonso Cuaron takes the reins and brings a darker, more atmospheric tone to the story, while also exploring the complex emotions and relationships of the characters. The film introduces Sirius Black, played brilliantly by Gary Oldman, and delves deeper into the backstory of Harry's parents. The film also features stunning visual effects and a haunting score by John Williams. While the film may deviate from the source material in some ways, it still captures the spirit of the books and sets a high standard for the rest of the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry is growing up,This Harry has a new director in Alfonso Cuarón and a bit of a moodier look. The characters are also growing up and becoming teenagers now with a bit of angst. It all lends to a darker turn in this third installment that also sees the arrival of two fan favorite characters: Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Brilliant acting by the new additions adds to the unique directing and makes this a turning point in the Harry Potter movies.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dark Days For Harry,"I'm going to admit something here that I probably shouldn't: I haven't read ANY of the books in the HARRY POTTER series (don't hurt me!) It might be because everyone says ""Oh you just HAVE to read this!"" that puts me off. I'm not the type of person to follow all the lemmings over the cliff. I tend to enjoy more obscure stuff. But I digress...What I don't mind doing, though, is watching cinema and I've thus far seen all of the ""Potter films."" And this one I found to be quite different. Although the second in the series (THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, 2002) was pretty dark, it pales (brightens?) in comparison to this third installment.Harry is breaking the rules and barely getting away with it. He's using his powers outside of school and in general muggles population (he causes a relative to inflate to great size and drift away). And when he can no longer stand staying with his aunt and uncle, Harry decides to leave and seek refuge in the outside world. The trouble, though, is that a dark creature seems to be stalking him. Was that a wolf peering at Harry through the brush? Eventually Harry makes it back to Hogwarts and discovers that a psycho prisoner  Sirius Black, played by the wonderful Gary Oldman (BATMAN BEGINS, 2005)  has escaped his cage and may be stalking him. Was Sirius responsible in some way for Harry's parents' death? Dementos, dark specters that resemble wraiths, are assigned to the perimeter of Hogwarts and Harry has some very uneasy feelings about them. They seem inordinately interested in him, too.With the help of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) Harry is led down a dark path, a path believed to contain the secret to his mother's and father's death.Friends and enemies are often intertwined within the same characters as this third story unravels. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, 2001) gives some excellent direction to a film that could've easily gotten out of control. With the multiple twists and turns (i.e., time travel, werewolf friends, etc.) this film flowed smoothly and was packed with angst and action.The special effects (specifically the early bus ride) are pulled off nicely and give a slight sense of the whimsical without going overboard. But the previously mentioned wraith-like Dementos are pretty creepy and could easily freak-out children under 12 years old (so be careful, parents.) Again, not having read any of the books in this series, I have no idea where the storyline is going. But things tend to be darkest before the storm (forgive the cliché), then they clear. So my assumption is that things will come to a head very soon for Harry and his Hogwart friends. Darn! I might have to pick up one of the novels now!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Highly disappointing to anyone who read the book.,"Yes, I know that if the director went about making the movie an exact copy of the book, the movie would be over 4 hours long. But then again, you can't condense a movie to the point where it looses its entire essence just to keep it within 2 hrs 20 mins.A 3 hour movie would've done justice to the storyline as well as each character.In my opinion the movie lacked substance.

Perfect blend of darkness and Humour ..... for some,"Of All the Harry Potter movies this is by far the most enjoyable. I am not a big fan of Harry Potter but this is a film that kept me entertained for the whole film ...... Something that is hard for movies to do despite dragging on in some parts. to me the first two Harry potter films were more of a Seven year old movie and despite minor moments that i found entertaining, that only made up for 15-25 minutes of the movie.And an honorable mention has to go to The introduction of Sirius Black who i hoped would get more screen time in the goblet of fire (Luckily we got to see him again in Order of the Pheonix)overall I give this movie an 8 as it is the perfect blend of humor maturity and darkness and it is regarded as the film the first two should have been (At least the last four were OK!!)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

EH...ho hum,"My family saw this movie...my husband and two young children.There were scary parts of this movie that my toddler did not like atall, so first off be wary of taking very young children to this movie.My 8 year old loved the movie.  We've seen the first two moviesprobably 40 times each [no joke]...we are huge fans of the booksand movies.This movie was really hyped by critics who didn't like the firstmovies.  Frankly, I was hyped myself to see the third installment,as I had hoped for an edgier film.  It is an edgier film.  But most ofthe camera angles left me feeling as if I'd just watched a homemovie...you know how you get that feeling of vertigo?  Sort ofmotion sickness?  That's what I came away with, and found outlater that my eldest child and husband came away that way too.So, be forewarned.If you are a ""slave to the story"" the way Rowling wrote it, you will bedisappointed.  There are scenes in it that are completely rewritingthe book.  Many things were cut out.  And I can respect that, due tothe sheer length of Rowling's recent HP books.  Understandableindeed.  However, it seems that a little too much trimming tookplace, and part of the joy of watching the characters interact waslost.  And I suppose in a sad way that's how it will continue giventhe length of the following HP books.  If they are to be adapted tothe screen, cutting will have to be done.Also, did it strike anyone else as odd that the characters,especially ""Harry Potter"" himself Daniel Radcliffe, grew so quickly?His physical growth was really representative of the othercharacters quick physical growth as well....many actors grewconsiderably from a physical standpoint.  And then it hit me...thiswhole series will be over so quickly...and then they will be nomore.  What will we ever do without Harry Potter and that wonderfulworld that Rowling created.  Frankly, she is a master at characterdevelopment, and I'll miss that when she writes her last on thisseries.All the things you read/hear about this movie are true:  The movieis edgier, darker, more mature in nature, and downright scarier foryounger children.Something wicked this way comes....and I wish it would havestayed around a little longer.I gave it a 6 out of 10.  The filming left something to be desired.  Alittle too much liberty taken with the actual story.  Not enoughcharacter development where you actually cared for the charactersthis time around.  And the background renderings left you wantingto hurl at particular points.  Go and see it.  Just leave yourexpectations lower than before with the other two.  And let's praythat they don't fire the younger actors for looking too ""old.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Face up and being strong,"The third film is the only one in which harry doesn't face up to the death threat, where voldemort never shows up, and the wandering dementors are an outward manifestation of inner fear. When faced with the boggart, the greatest fear is fear itself. In the face of fear, escape is useless, only true happiness, strong positive energy, can resist. There is no shame in acknowledging vulnerability, and one of the signs of not being strong enough is not being able to face up to it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Funny and imaginative but not harry potter,"I totally agree with every positive review of this film. It is both funny and imaginative as well as entertaining however it does not capture the magic of the first two films.As with every director Alfonso Cuaron wanted to put his own mark on his work and thus this film is incredibly different from the first two films directed by Christopher Columbus. It seems that while Columbus preferred to focus on the actual book and narrative, sticking jealously to the plot, Cuaron preferred to branch out from the norm which had a positive and negative effect on the film.The film is as I said very enjoyable, entertaining, thrilling and in most cases downright funny. However the negative part is that there was a loss of continuity. This means that basically for me the film no longer felt like the books. Things like the animal sweets, the big swinging pendulum and the toads singing seemed completely out of place.Another example of lack of continuity was Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore, who's almost energetic performance is in stark contrast to the wise, plodding Richard Harris who captured Dumbeldore perfectly. Gambon is less convincing. By contrast David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are great in their respective roles.All in all this is not a bad film, however it fails quite badly to capture the magic of the first two films of the books",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointed,"This movie was not of what i expected. The character development was absent and many important parts of the plot were missing. The direction was taken to a new level. I understand the 3rd book was a little more intense and ""horror"" like, but the movie presented itself in a almost ""creepy"" way. Also, there was minimal transitions from the 2nd movie to the 3rd movie, and left little doors open for the next movie. It almost seemed like the series could of ended with the 3rd book. The replacement of dumbledore was disappointing as well. Although no one can live up to Richard Harris's role as the famous Headmaster, the new actor could have tried to fit the role. So i hope with the new direction of the 4th movie, it will be better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the worst movies ever made!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a terrific book, but Alfonso Cuaron's direction of the movie was absolutely terrible! There was no Harry Potter feel to it at all! Everything good from the first two movies was ruined in this ridicules excuse for a Harry Potter film! The lighting, the acting, and the sequences were all wrong. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for expressing liberties, but for a series like Harry Potter, the movie should follow the book as much as possible because the books are just so great! Chris Columbus did such a terrific job directing the first two movies, and I don't know why he resigned, but he needs to come back and direct the fourth one, or else, this series may very well be doomed...",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best Harry Potter film? It very well may be,"After two relatively family friendly films, the Harry Potter series goes in a more mature, adult direction with its third film, Prisoner of Azkaban. Not enough to go past the PG rating, mind, but enough to be noticeable. The tone and themes, involving betrayal and murder and evil omens, are a lot darker than anything in Sorcerer's Stone, and the imagery, especially involving the Dementors, can even be more intense than in Chamber of Secrets, giving the film a satisfying edge that suits its maturing cast and audience. I did feel for the longest time that the biggest problem with the film was that it crammed too much of the book into too short of a runtime, basically the opposite of the next film, which cuts too much out. As a result, it felt crowded and the various plot points felt underdeveloped. While that is still true to a point, it does a reasonably solid job of juggling the various stories and giving them enough time not only to develop, but come together in the film's excellent final hour. Plus, we get some stellar development of our main character, particularly looking into his past and how it affects him going forward.As the child cast grew up, so did their acting abilities. While they're fine in the first two films, it's in this one where they truly find their footing and make the characters their own. Daniel Radcliffe is particularly good as Harry, handling the emotional scenes exceptionally well. The adult cast, for the most part, is great too. David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and especially Gary Oldman are more than welcome additions, excellent as always in their respective roles. The only actors who don't work are Michael Gambon and Timothy Spall. These are both extremely talented actors and as the series went on, they grew into their roles very well. However, in this initial outing, Gambon comes off as creepy (a far cry from Richard Harris' turn as Dumbledore) and Spall is way too over the top and goofy.The art direction and visual effects have gotten a complete makeover. While they were stylized to the point of silliness in the first two films (which fit them well given their kid friendly nature), here, they're more sharp and realistic, with Hogwarts pretty much getting a full redesign, adding in a bridge and a clock tower, both of which look great. The creature designs are all fantastic, with the Dementors looking, moving, and sounding absolutely terrifying and Buckbeak the Hippogriff looking both majestic and adorable. The soundtrack's great as usual, including a catchy song from what looks like a Hogwarts choir. And there are some fun action scenes, including a really intense Quidditch game.Overall, I may have had mixed feelings about Prisoner of Azkaban before, but I'm glad to say my opinion has changed for the better. Yes, it has its flaws, but the good more than outweighs the bad. Is it the best of the films? Possibly; I'd have to watch them all again. But, I can say it's in the running.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Movie Adaptation In The Franchise,"Why couldn't they have Alfonso Cuaron direct the rest of the movies? He did a far superior job than Chris Columbus (what a joke) and David Yates.

Different...,"I have now seen this film 3 times, and it just gets better and better. However, if you haven't seen it yet then be warned, Alfonso Cuaron has completely reworked the set. Hagrid's hut is no longer across the lawn, as in the first 2 films and all of the books, but is halfway down a mountain. Michal Gambon is good as Dumbledore, and Professor Trelawny is brilliant, but Lupin is a disappointment.I know that its supposed to be darker, but Rowling makes it seem like that without the castle and it's surroundings sprouting legs and walking away. However, it is not the surroundings which makes this film, it's the story, and although some of the scenes with Ron and Hermione arguing have been cut, it is a pretty good portrayal of the book. All the important stuff is there, and the film flows through wonderfully.Overall it is an amazing film, and although it should have been a bit longer (it's only on 2 hours 5 mins approx.), it will grip you from start to finish. Well done Warner Brothers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Darker but still magical,"If this third installment of the Harry Potter series doesn't quite match the magic of the first, it's because - well, this is a sequel, and the 'magic"" no longer surprises quite as much. While it has to be selective due to the fact the novels progressively get longer, this production remains faithful to the book. Alfonso Cuaron as the new series director has been given credit for adding a more substantive darker side and concentrating a bit less on special effects. Regarding the former, the material itself calls for a more grown-up story: the kid characters along with the actors are maturing, and their coming into full-fledged adolescence demands sterner character. There are humorous scenes, but the general tone is more serious, as in fact it must needs be, and Daniel Radcliffe, for one, shows himself quite capable of serious acting as Harry continues to discover his identity. And isn't that Eriksonian quest of youth in fact the real theme of Rowling's series? It looks like most of the cast will be back for the fourth installment: we'll get to see them grow up at least once more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Exhilarating to the last shot.,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (""PoA"") is a story identical in structure to the first two books/films. Harry makes a narrow escape to Hogwarts, where he is soon at the center of a complicated mystery. With the help of best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he resolves to unravel the perplexity, which leads to a dramatic and mesmerizing final act.""PoA"" is in a unique and tricky position for a literary sequel because not only will it be inevitably compared with the book, but because of a directorial change, the film will be more heavily contrasted with its predecessors. Fortunately Alfonso Cuaron (best known for Y Tu Mama Tambien, pardon the lack of accent marks) has helmed the best film of the series, even though it is the least similar to the source material.While Chris Columbus turned in workmanlike efforts in the first two movies, his primary error was in remaining too faithful to the text, resulting in too much content that slowed down the pacing. Conversely Cuaron has chiseled away at the third book (which is longer than the first two, although the film is shorter) to create his own handiwork that is faithful to the spirit of Rowling's writing, while clearly featuring his own artistic style.That style is what makes ""PoA"" so enjoyable to watch, even if, perhaps especially if you've read the book, as I have. Instead of simply waiting to see how the director's vision matched up with my own, I found myself eagerly anticipating not only the what but the how, as Cuaron's transitions, shots, and camera movements injected new life into the series. The Mexican featured wider and longer shots than most American directors, endowing Hogwarts with a different feeling, one more open and less ominous. His transitions also stood out, in contrast to Columbus' straightforward manner. Many vignettes opened or closed with stylish scene-setting shots, whether it be a freezing flower or a bird veering too close to the Whomping Willow. These transitions meshed with a more subdued color palette to give the film more of a human feel, reflecting the tumultuous times that the main characters were enduring. They also allowed the drama to build, which was important in a film that contained so many vignettes that could easily have felt much more unrelated.The humane aspect of ""PoA"" may be the core enhancement to the series. Cuaron's technical alterations aid this development, as does the maturation of the three children, both as characters and actors. Being clearly older, Harry, Hermione, and Ron have grown past the cute child actor stage and reached the teenage plateau, which for makes them easier to relate with for most of the audience. Additionally the trio is outfitted in normal clothes, rather than their school uniforms, much more often. Not everyone remembers what it was like being a preppy little kid, but everyone recalls life as a jeans-wearing teenager. The physical aspects would possibly be enough, but also the script contains more and better emotions, the three actors are better at portraying them, and the director is better at displaying them. That's a Murderer's Row of improvements that is impossible to overlook.Consistent with the first two films, the adult actors are stellar once more. >From Alan Rickman's permanent sneer as Snape to Maggie Smith's world-weary wisdom as Professor McGonagall to Robbie Coltrane's now-promoted-to-faculty Hagrid, all of the returnees slide effortlessly back into their parts. They are complemented by an equally talented group of newcomers. Michael Gambon performs admirably with the impossible task of replicating Richard Harris' gravitas, combining Harris' established character with his own interpretations. As the latter titular character, a frenetic Gary Oldman is deliriously watchable once he finally makes an appearance. Last but definitely not least is David Thewlis as R.J. Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He expertly works with Harry to supply several tender exposition scenes that don't slow down the movie. All in all, the adult cast shines as they relish their roles without chewing scenery.Special effects were at the center of the first two films, but in ""PoA"" they largely take a backseat to traditional dialogue scenes. That allows the fewer primary visual effects (not to be confused with the numerous background paintings, etc.) to range from solid to superb. Buckbeak looks perfect, while the Dementors quality tattered look will suffer from comparisons to the superior Ringwraiths of ""LOTR"". But due to sheer originality, the Knight Bus tops them all in an early thrill ride. Good stuff as usual from Industrial Light & Magic.Speaking of reliable technicians, John Williams has composed yet another excellent score. With the choral song Something Wicked This Way Comes, Williams has added another lingering tune to his already familiar work, allowing him to weave both themes throughout the film. The guy's a machine, and while he does occasionally produce some melodramatic scores, this is not one of them. Its tinges of darkness and minor keys (?) accurately mirror the action, soaring and subsiding as needed.Lest you think the movie was the greatest film ever, I should point out that because Cuaron trimmed so much from the book, the numerous scenes sometimes feel rushed and truncated, as though we are dashing through a museum in an effort to see everything as quickly as possible. The truncation did not bother me because I knew the omitted information, but the pace was too choppy over the middle portion of the film. I could also argue that if you haven't seen the others or read the books, then you won't fully understand everything, as characters and skills aren't entirely explained. But that's a minor complaint, because will anyone actually see this one who hasn't seen or read the others?Like it or not, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is clearly the most cinematic of the first three movies. Rather than simply churn out a live-action version of the book, director Alfonso Cuaron utilized tools like telescopic fades, zooms through clock towers, and additional character development as he adapted the book to fit the big screen. The result is a emotionally darker film with more humanity than the first two combined.Bottom Line: ""PoA"" was the best film I've seen so far this year. Thoroughly enjoyable to the last shot. A high 8 of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The new (to the movies) characters are all fine too. The animation has certainly kept up with the times - Hogwarts is more alive than ever, and Buckbeak is a sight to behold.I only wish the music was stronger.

What a wonderful film,"Just finished watching Azkaban for the first time in years (I'm 18, I think I watched Akzaban for the first time when I was about 12). I'm really surprised by how in-depth and detailed this movie is, considering how I thought that only the third film into the series, it would still be quite childish. However, I was proved wrong and left enchanted by a beautifully rich set design and intricate plot- one that in the final act, had me gobsmacked by how interesting and UNIQUE it was!Watching this film, sometimes you forget that it's one of the largest film franchises on Earth. Usually, with these big films, there's never any attention payed to how the film looks; it's all about big explosions and SFX. However, with Azkaban (and hopefully the rest of the series, that I'm going to binge after this review), the cinematography is STUNNING. The whole film is engrossed in such a mesmerising, fresh and vibrant British countryside, along with incredible architecture. I'm a sucker for gorgeous British settings in films, with 2005 Pride & Prejudice's own setting helping to make that movie one of my all time favourites, Azkaban has the same beauty that immediately pulls me into the film.Great plot, brilliant acting, especially from Rickman and Thewlis.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Something Wicked This Way Comes,"After giving his rude, overweight aunt her just deserts, teenager Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is off for another year at ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" with fellow magic-makers Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger).

""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" referred to in the title, Mr. Oldman looks out for blood. This puts everyone at ""Hogwarts"" in grave danger...A change in direction, literally, to director Alfonso Cuaron, helps gives this third ""Harry Potter"" film a moodier, darker style; and, it is the perfect accompaniment to the three leading players' rapidly approaching adulthood. Up until about the time the students unconvincingly mouth animal noises, everything runs smoothly. But, even when it's silly, or wanders away from the original text, the story is marvelous. The players are more endearing than ever, even Tom Felton (as Draco Malfoy).

Harry Potter 3 was Good Enough for Me,"Part two of my Harry Potter reviews is a single review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. This movie is very different from the previous two and also from the next five films. We have the same actors from the other two, the only real difference is the director. The director for this film is Alfonso Cuarón and he put his own directing style into the movie. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not. He really is the major strength and weakness of the movie itself.Here we are, year three, and another year at Hogwarts is on the way, but a mass murderer named Sirius Black has escaped. Sirius Black is built as an evil character down to the core. You even see it in his name ""Black."" Black is a color that literally means evil and bad. He is accused of selling out the Potters to Voldemort. Now he is after Harry so Hogwarts is sort of on lockdown. That's our story but I think it was one of the most well written stories.In this movie we are introduced to a lot of new characters and animals. It is a different view of the magic world. There is a little less physical magic such as spells and potions and more of an abstract magic. We have Dementors, Buckbeak, the boggart, werewolves, and animagus' , and many other ways the magic world blows our minds. I like most of them but I have a few problems with the Dementors. First off, they are a complete rip off of the Ringwraiths from Lord of the Rings. Rowling likes to take ideas from Tolkien and make a tiny difference. I don't like that and seeing it on screen just made me think of Frodo and the ring. Dementors are beings that wear all black and have a skeleton like appearance under the cloaks. They are really terrifying and symbolize fear and death. People feel cold when they are near and they suck the happy memories from people. It is a really good idea and it fits well with the film but the appearance could have been done differently. This is twice that Rowling rips off Tolkien and there are more on the way. Its frustrating to fans of movies and books. We are also introduced to Professor Lupin and he is one of my favorite characters throughout. He is a great character and a role model in Harry so in turn he is a role model to the audience. He was a childhood friend of the Potters and he teaches Harry how to fight the Dementors. He has a weird feeling and throughout the film I got the sense he was hiding something and he wasn't all he was showing. I knew this by following the pattern. All Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers have a major flaw and Lupin seemed too good to be true. This is the first movie not directed by Chris Columbus and this is almost a completely different movie. The color scheme is really different. It is very dark and most scenes are dark. He decides to have the kids wear regular street clothes a lot rather than the Hogwarts robes. He tries to be fun and funny a lot in the movie and most of the time it doesn't work. From the opening title sequence when Harry is trying to light up his wand and Uncle Vernon comes in and out of the room. It is supposed to be funny and I think he made too much of an effort to be comical in a simple title screen. We see it again with the shrunken head. Let's set the scene. Harry just made his aunt Marge into a balloon floating up in the sky, OK that was funny and I enjoyed it so touché, but Harry is emotionally torn and upset. He runs away from home and sees the creepy dog so he is sad, scared, and angry. Then the Knight Bus shows up and we hear about Sirius Black and how he is a murderer. All these negative emotions and feelings and it instantly turns to comedy with his one liners and unfunny comments to Ernie. The whole Knight Bus scene was a disaster and I wish it was done differently. Not all was a fail. I liked the scene when Marge was blown up and the buttons flew off and hit Dudley. It was funny and it worked. Same with Harry in the invisibility cloak and hitting Draco with snowballs and messing with Hermione and Ron. Little things like that made the movie better and added a nice touch to a very depressing and sad story arch. A big question in making the movie is how they will handle the big twist at the end and how mind bending the writing is. I think it was done brilliantly. Walking out it made me think how it actually happened. It was a different type of magic and the director nailed it perfectly. It had a plot hole or two but it makes the audience think and try to make sense of it so that's a good thing. The third book and movie is very significant in my opinion. It is different from all the rest mainly because Voldemort isn't that important. He is only mentioned a few times but he isn't a real threat. Sirius Black is the primary focus as the bad guy. I loved that. I like that there was another sense of evil in the world other than Voldemort. There was something else to fear and it made the world more real and believable. Overall, Harry Potter 3 is not a bad movie but it has a few flaws. The directing style is really well done but has a few things I did not like so Harry Potter 3 gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"wonderful movie, horrible DVD","i remember when i watched this movie in the movie theater. i loved it. definitely one of the best ones of the harry potter franchise. then, in Christmas, my parents gave me the widescreen DVD version of this film. in that time, i didn't liked the widescreen format, now i love it. but, since back then i didn't liked the widescreen format, i sold the widescreen DVD version i got, and i bought the fullscreen version later. that was one of the biggest mistakes i've made in my life. i mean, when you watch the movie, the picture quality is horrible!another thing is that,like, in one shot, harry potter might be talking to Professor Lupin, and you see harry but you don't see Professor Lupin! that's retarded! it looks as if harry was talking to himself! and, there's drizzle in the whole movie! warner bros. might have forgotten to clean the picture quality of this movie. the picture quality for this movie is surely of the worst I've seen in my life. another thing is that, in one scene, harry potter and rons dad are talking in the leaky cauldron, in the left down side of the screen you see a code or something like that. i think those things come in every DVD in history. im not sure what they are for, but in this movie, they are so easy to catch! so, overall, don't buy this fullscreen version. its such a wonderful movie and it is a real shame to watch it in such a horrible picture quality. even if you don't like widescreen pictures, still buy the widescreen version for this movie. you will find out that some buy black bars and a small picture are nothing compared to drizzle an sloppy camera angles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Above Average Except For Plot Exceptions,"It is said that all knowledge comes from introspection. If viewed from the original novel, the movie's screenplay is very incomplete. Given, it is a story about magic! But its explanations as to how many of its important events occurred are impoverished. First and foremost, Mr. Black's escape from the prison of Azkaban isn't explained. Nor is how Miss. Granger came to be in possession of a time-travel device called a time-turner. In retrospect, the primary theme of the entire movie amounted to the belief that Mr. Black wanted Potter dead. Moving on, the production of the film was very good. The special effects captured the events as I expect the writer Rowlings intended. The performance of the actors was sufficient, but not great. Well, whoever plays Granger is nearly as annoying as the fictional one in the original text. The guy who plays Snape is also nearly as creepy as the fictional one. The beginning of the film is excellent, and quite hilarious. It also seemed as if the entire story could have been told in a film three quarters as long, including the omissions as mentioned above. Overall, I give it a 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Huge Potter Fan, but this Movie sucks","I have read every book of the Harry Potter series and have liked everyone of them except for this one. This movie in my opinion strays way too far away from the book, and fails to hit all the key points of the book. I hated the ending of this film, as harry flying on his thunderbolt to a freeze frame was lame( Really never end a movie like that), and the exclusion of the quidditch house cup, a huge part of the novel is something that hurts this film. I also don't like any of the rest of this film, or at least its adaptation of the book, which was one of my favorites of the Harry Potter Series. The only movie I would compare this to in terms of being weak is the Half Blood prince, but that gets a pass, as it was much longer than this one. All in all, as much as I love the books, and liked all of the movies except for this one, this movie sucks big time compared to the book",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Review,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a film directed by Alfosno Cuaron. I was curious before watching this film as many critics have noted this film a turning point in the series. After watching the film, I can say that this is by far my most favorite film of this series.Plot: Harry Potter is warned about Sirius Black, a prisoner who just escaped Azkaban prison in order to kill him.Story and direction: Taking the reins from one director to another is a very risky thing sicne you have to match the expectations of the audience as well as find a way to say your voice in the film. But this film has excelled in that department. Alfonso Cuaron is successful in providing a change of tone in the film. From scene one, you know the film is going to be different from the previous two. This is very clearly known from the lighting and camera work which is just awesome. The images of certain things like the tree or the flowers depict the kind of silence this film wants to convey. But the film doesn't seem boring for even a single moment. It is never dull because it has the series comedy that defines it. The comedy is very subtle and that says how good a director Alfonso is. Also we get to some new characters in this film, which are very interesting. I especially liked the bond formed between Lupin and Potter. He was just like a mentor to him helping him out in various odd situations. The music is also great and I can just go on about it. The VFX has improved from the previous two and even today it is very much relevant. The VFX feels real and just immerses you into the fictional world that is created. And for the first time, the Quiddicth scene was just to look out for. It was gorgeous. Also to be noted is some of the animal designs in the film. They are so life-like. You feel scared by some of them and also you feel that you want to own some of them. I liked the fact that the film is shorter than the previous two since it was a good move and a long film I guess wouldn't have worked. Steve Kloves deserves a pat on the back for adapting another chapter of Harry Potter successfully.Performances: The regular cast does their job just perfectly and also adapt to the new settings. Michael Gambon is great as the new Dumbledore. Never for a moment do you miss Richard Harris. This character also has a change of characterization from the previous two which I very much liked. David Thewlis is also great in donning the role of Remus Lupin. He is the new character that I liked the most. And finally, Gary Oldman: He is just awesome. Although his scenes are lesser than the rest, but he just leaves an impact on the mind.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where the kids go to Hogsmeade and Hermione and Ron see some building. Then Malfoy and gang come and begin to tease them. After that, Harry with the help of his invisible cloak scares Malfoy and gang away. After all, who doesn't want to see Malfoy beat up!!Verdict: This film is by far the best of Harry Potter. The film did everything for me that I wanted to see in this series. And also, it makes me anxious as I can't wait to see what else it has got to offer. This goes on to prove that when you tap on to the right content and know what your audience wants, I think you can make sequels even more successful than the originals (story wise). Sequels are never cursed. It is just that the makers should know how to handle the characters and give them the respect that they deserve.I am going with a perfect 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Series Starts To Grow Up,"In the first two Harry Potter films, the plots/action are primarily geared towards a much younger audience than the medium. There are some ""tense moments"" and drama in those films, of course, but it isn't until ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" that the series really starts to grow up and deal with some more mature themes.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an escaped prisoner from the terrible Azkaban prison, come to Hogwarts in search of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) for reasons dealing with Potter's deceased parents. Hermoine (Emma Watson) & Ron (Rupert Grint) still play large roles in the action (Hermoine especially in this one), while new Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) brings a new dynamic to the Hogwarts third-year experience.In terms of ""growing up"", this film does so more with themes than content. There isn't any objectionable content in this one, but the themes and some of the characters present are sophisticated enough that younger children might have difficulty following them. Basically, this is the type of movie that seeks to maintain a fanbase and not create new followers based on this effort alone.As with the book, the ending portions of ""Azkaban"" really serve to change the entire tone of the series. I won't spoil it for you here, but suffice it to say that it feels as if the saga could go in any direction now and not be limited by the more child-friendly plots.This is also the first movie of the series that has noticeable differences from the novel. Nothing too ""gasp-worthy"" or anything like that, but certain parts of the narrative this time are indeed re- arranged to better suit the cinematic experience.Overall, ""Azkaban"" might be even better as a movie than as a book because it skips over some of the ""fluff"" found at the beginning of the book and gets right into the thick of things from the get- go. Despite a few key scenes that were explained a bit better by Rowling herself, this movie is the perfect complement to its literature twin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
worth the 8 bucks but not really,"hello first off i want anyone reading this to understand that i have read the books all the way. OK, i found this movie to be more or a disappointment than some people say it was. but i would recommend this movie to any one who doesn't mind violence. or action. seeing how there is a good bit or that in the movie. if your looking for a movie you can see time after time, this is not the movie for you. a person could most likely see this movie about two (2) times before it lost all or most of the fun, surprise, and everything else. i recommend you to read the book before or after the movie. and i m sorry about any spelling mistakes",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This is the best harry potter adaptation!,"Although this movie leaves out some important details from the book, it has something most of the movies don't. The magic And the tone of the book are truly here. And the parts they did have from the book where outstanding.

"A fun film if you have not read the book, a let down if you have","Taking this film on its own, not as the third film in the series or as an adaptation of a book this would be excellent. It has a good story, though as mentioned later it is full of holes, great acting and some good set pieces. But as an adaptation and a third film it is very disappointing.Let me explain why. Firstly I know it is a magical place Hogwarts, but who decided they could completely rebuild the place and move everything around. In the first two films Hagrids hut was just out side the main gate, now it seems to be over a bridge through a church yard and down a very steep hill. Also the Whomping Willow now seems to be in the middle of nowhere rather than in the main courtyard where it was in the last film. Now I know they made Hogwarts bigger in the last film but they did not start moving buildings around.Secondly as many people have noted very important sections of the book are missed out and the story is left with a lot of holes if you have never read the books. I saw the first film and then read the books using the film as a way into the series, this one would make you think the books were not worth reading as the plot is so full of holes.Thirdly why do we have to have so many shots of things floating and flying. Every cut scene has at least one flying object in it, be a feather, a leaf, a bat or a dementor. This started to make me laugh as I tried to guess what would come up next.Fourthly, Dumbledore. I know this is the first time we have been without Richard Harris, but that is who I now imagine as Dumbledore whenever I read the books, it will take some time to get used to the new meaner sounding Dumbledore, but hopefully this will happen.Finally, it is just over much to quickly. You never get time to settle down with the characters. It is always rush rush to the next bit on and on. Hogwarts is a place that no one really minds how long they stay and take in because everyone wants to be there. I know we don't want a 4 hour movie, but a little more time spent in the company of friends would be appreciated.I am not saying it is a terrible film it is just flawed in a number of ways that make the experience less enjoyable than previous outings. Lets hope the next one brings us back to the Harry Potter we love to see on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
disappointed,"I must say that i'm disappointed about the 3rd film. I waited a long time for it and...it wasn't what i expected. 1st, Sirius wasn't at all what i expected. i think he looked old and i thought he wasn't THAT scary..but the acting was good after all. 2nd, the during of the movie was too short. i know it's long sitting for 4 hours in a theater, but if the movie is excellent, we won'tmatter. just imagine what the 4th movie would look like if the during was under 3 hours. we'd miss so many details, some very important! 3rd, i didn't like the aspect of the movie. The changing of director was obvious! I say that Chris Colombus should have direct the 3rd movie too. Well at least, Alfonso Cuaron won't be there for the 4th so i hope it will be better. the positive side now.. (lol) when Lupin changed into a werewolf, i thought that was cool and scary! and..the dementors..when i read the books, i didn't imagine them like that but..they're still scary so, that's what matters. the main characters were still pretty good, and funny :) i still love HP despite of all those things and i'm looking forward to see the 4th movie !",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A delight for Harry Potter Fans!,"All Harry Potter Fans are sure to be delighted with this movie which was by far the best one yet. The first two movies were good but not that good. The change of director has brought only good things and also the Prisoner of Azkaban book was more exciting than the first two.This movie has a lot more action, a lot more suspense and, of course, a lot more action magic. The already grown up Harry Potter and Co., are in their third year at Hogwarts and the real challenges are just starting to appear.Having already done the first two movies, the ""old"" actors were at their best mostly because they managed to understand J.K. Rowlings characters and they made the whole thing more enjoyable and even believable( if I may say so). The special effects were very good and even the Dementors, which I am sure we all wanted to see after reading the books, were just as they were supposed to be, not to mention all the creatures which were just perfect.All we can do now is hope that the improvement seen will continue with the next movie, although I am not sure if they'll be able to do it ""by the book"", and let's not forget about the sixth book launched in July 2005(I can't wait).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
NEED THE OLD DERECTOR BACK!!,"OK the first thing i want to say is that if you have not read the book or seen this movie than do not read this review because it gives away many parts of the story that i don't think should be ruined for you, the second thing i want to say is that the prisoner of Azkaban was my second favorite book out of the series so far, right behind the order of the phenixnow that i said that i would like to say that this movie was horriblethe order of events that went on in the book were completely butchered out out of order in this movie, important events, like when mowfoy and his friends dressed up like dementers and hary performed the patronus on them were completely left out, and many important people have just been completely left out, like Percy, who this year was when he became head boy, and oliver wood who this was his last year at hogwarts, i could name people who were left out all night long but those are some examplesthey left out many important details that if you did not read the book befor you saw the movie than you would have no idea what is going on, for example they didn't explain the time turner at all...the only thing that i thought was almost good was how they saved sirus, but that was still a little offthey definitely need to get the old director back for the rest of the movies because this one obviously has know idea what he is doing, the old director i thought did very good in capturing the story but it seems that the new director is just sucking all of the fantasy and majic that harry potter is good and known forthere are many other things wrong with this book but i do not want to go on all night, so ill leave off here and let you decide what you think of the movie...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Although Being a Good Adventure, It Is the Weakest Story of the Trilogy","While travelling for his third year in Hogwarts, the grown-up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is advised that the criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison Azkaban. Sirius Black is blamed for being responsible for the death of Harry's parents and their best friend, Peter Pettigrew. In the train, Harry Potter faces an evil Dementor, sort of creature who drains good memories and life of their victims and which was sent to chase Sirius Black, but he is saved by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Once in Hogwarts, he realizes that the school is surrounded by Dementors, sent to protect Harry Potter and the students against Sirius Black. After many adventures, the truth is disclosed. Although being a good adventure, I found ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the weakest story of the trilogy. There are many situations used in the other two stories, like the game they play, or the bad treatment of Harry Potter's relatives, the character of Emma Thompson is too silly and not funny and Daniel Radcliffe does not correspond in some dramatic situations. Emma Watson, in the role of Hermion Granger, has another excellent performance. It is funny to see how the cast grew and changed in a couple of years. However, this movie is a great entertainment and does not disappoint. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Harry Potter e o Prisioneiro de Azkaban"" (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
thank God that changing directors didn't diminish the movie's quality,"Now that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in his third year, he has new things with which to contend: Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) and escaped prisoner Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), in jail for murdering Harry's parents.When I read the book, I realized at the end that there was a clue to one of the things that happens. Maybe it's harder for the movie to present that, but they still do a good job with the movie. The cast all does a great job once again. Part 4 was equally good too. It just goes to show how much the Harry Potter franchise is part of our cultural heritage. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is dynamite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The franchise can finally be taken seriously,"With Chris Columbus abdicating at the sight of dark material, the Harry Potter was gratefully gobbled up by Alfonso Cuaron, a director having only at that point turned heads with the incredibly sexy Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001). This is a vastly different Potter to that which came before. When his dead parents are insulted by an obnoxious aunt (Pam Ferris), Harry blows her out of the window, kicking his bedroom cupboard in a rage. There's no plinky-plonky music or pie-in-the-face sight gags, and when Harry steps outside of his house, the streets are grey and grim, not a cosy suburban horror show.After fleeing another run-in with the Dursleys, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) hops on the Knight Bus, which takes him to the Leaky Cauldron where he is to learn his fate having used magic outside of Hogwarts. Best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are there waiting for him, when they all learn that convicted serial killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from notorious prison Azkaban, possibly with Harry in his sights. With the ghostly guardians of Azkaban, the Dementors, surrounding Hogwarts in search of Black, Harry finds his own life in danger, and seeks help from new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and friend of his parents, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis).With Columbus's kid-friendly approach ditched and Cuaron's more focused direction, the franchise at this point could finally be taken seriously, with real threats finally entering Harry's life, and the trio's characters hitting puberty and becoming more feisty in the process. Cuaron also wisely adapted the book, rather than simply filming the pages, and this is noticeably shorter than it's predecessors despite being the biggest book at this point. Hermione is less precocious, Ron is less gurny, and Daniel Radcliffe finally puts in a decent performance. He isn't perfect, but there's a delightful eccentricity to the actor's mannerisms which make him endearing to watch.Apart from a climax that makes as little sense as it does in the novel, the story is also more gripping. We finally see Harry's past intertwine with his present, with revelations coming out of the woodwork, and Harry finally starting to learn more about his parents. There's also some genuinely frightening scenes, including the Dementors - hooded, faceless ghouls - and a scene involving a certain character's dangerous affliction. In Cuaron's hands, Harry Potter is genuinely magic, funny when it should be, dark when it needs to be, and it's rather disappointing he didn't go on to direct more of them.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

It captures the feeling of the book very well.

Pretty disappointing and hard to follow,"I was highly anticipating this film ever since ""Sorcerer's Stone"", but really feel that I have been let down. I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan, and I feel that Alfonso Cuaron has left out much of the detail found in the books and the first two movies. This movie felt as if you could never follow the story unless you have already read the books. And this movie doesn't seem to fall into place with the rest of the in-progress series.The most striking change from the first films to this one is probably the set. The school of young sorcerers, Hogwarts, looks absolutely nothing like it did before. The Great Hall has apparently shrunk, the Whomping Willow is now standing right there in the middle of the lawn, and a clock tower has emerged from the building that's pendulum can easily clip students trying to enter the village of Hogsmeade. Hagrid's Hut has moved about a mile downhill, and the Fat Lady has received a change of address and an extreme makeover. Basically Hogwarts is no longer the warm, cheery, magical, welcoming castle from before, but now not much more than a haunted mansion. While this dark forebodingness goes with the dark foreboding plot of the story, it really destroys the feel of the school.The plot is choppy, jumpy. There is only the inflation of Aunt Marge - a funny little scene, by the way - of the little skirmishes and annoyances of life with the Dursleys. There is absolutely no attention on Quidditch except for that one match, the one where the dementors knock Harry out. There is not much explanation about Hogsmeade, particularly the Shrieking Shack - although Hogsmeade, the candy store, is very well done. The appearance of the Patronus is questionable, and the stag, Prongs, Harry's Patronus and the form of his father, only appears once. And could we please explain the Marauder's Map and its creators?Characters? Well, the students are adolescents now, and it really shows in Harry and Hermione. (Punching Malfoy was, well, brilliant!) But Ron is just this little arachnophobic redhead freckle-face who makes about two jokes and has a talent for whimpering. The enmity between Harry and Co. against Malfoy and Co. is displayed only occasionally. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was a poor choice, and we don't hear any of his confusing magic lectures. (Which is a bad thing.) And Lupin's werewolf form just didn't look right. It's called a wereWOLF for a reason....Still, a nice stab at the Harry Potter Hollywoodization Project, although it could have been better. Can't argue with the soundtrack... it is John Williams, people. If you have kids who think they love or at least enjoyed the first movies, make absolutely no move to resist, although remind them that it could be disappointing. If you enjoyed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, sure, go if you'd like, but prepare to be disappointed. If you are on a strictly J.K. Rowling diet, obviously don't go. If you just wanna start the summer movies with this, then you might want to make a visit to your public library to prepare. Just don't complain if you don't and can't follow the story.Overall Rating: 6/10. Book-to-Movie Adaptation: 5/10. Casting: 7/10. Setting: 3/10. Plot: 6/10. Scripting: 5/10.

My Review four this film,Well it was really good I really like how Daniel Radcliffe presented himself in this film in the face of danger and following his lines with his other cast members also that people that were in the previous Harry potter films were included in there role's from slithering house and other houses too and that dumble dorf and the other's in the film did a great job along with there wardrobe choices and that the guy from the first die hard film took on a role of a teacher because he had the haircut four it and he was honest in his role in Harry Potter films and that Daniel Radcliffe he was still growing up with his other cast members and that a lot of people forgot that besides the money as a actor he went on too make this film a historical event based on the director's guidance and that the movie Harry Potter series is bye far something else that isn't violent and there not a lot of CGI involved but from the hart's of people involved behind the cameras they used in this film and I will never forget what Daniel Radcliffe has done four my family with Harry Potter and the prisoner of askaban.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing Diversion from Author's Storyline & Detail,"I am disappointed that it appears the humble but talented work of Chris Columbus in providing an accurate big screen rendition of J.K. Rawlings inspired writings has come to an abrupt end.Whether it is the lack of humility of the director or the languishing attention of the screen writer, author and producer due to assumed unlimited success, this film was a let down for my whole family.We have been incredibly impressed prior with the uncanny ability for the film team to render such gifted story telling, with so much vivid detail, onto a medium which leaves much less to our imagination but still succeeded to inspire a sense of magic. This new film's lack of consistency with it predecessors and written source seems to be a combination of introducing someone who thought their own creative view was more important than those of the author or the loyalty of the viewing public. More disturbing yet is that the new director for HP4 is said to be planning to follow the path of HP3... a second let down?With the potential of creating an unparalleled creative franchise, I think those with the most to lose financially should rethink their new strategy. Since it seems WB cares little for its image with regard to entertainment genius (as set forth in the first two movies and sent to a demise in the third) perhaps the public need rebel at the box office to send a message that we won't pay our due for those who deliver a lower quality product to cash in on momentum alone. You have an incredible opportunity to produce movie history and thrill millions  don't blow it!A saving grace for this movie is the acting of the traditional cast and the new comers, who, although more screen time needs to be devoted to dialog and less to the whomping willow scenery, did a great job of maintaining the story's attitude despite other short comings in direction.I do hope HP4 and follow-ons return to the masterful quality provided under Chris Columbus' direction and that follow-on films are not used as a method for directors to add block buster titles to their resume of film projects.If HP4 is delivered at the level of HP3... perhaps I'll wait for the rental...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too Gloomy and Several Critical Aspects were missing,"I am a huge HP fan, and I admit I am not his target audience. However, I just have to agree with the previous review about the lacking in this film. I understand that you have to make certain transitions or adjustments between a book and a film. However, there were MANY things about this movie that could have been much better.The film definitely had a much darker feel to it than previous HP films. I understand that the characters are older and the situations are darker than previous books. However, it was so dark, (especially the cinematography) that it just became a dreary movie. For example, any HP fan knows that Harry was very happy to stay at the Leaky Cauldron. However, the set was so morbid and ugly, it makes it difficult to believe he would really feel ""at home"" there. The same goes for the way Hogwarts appeared in this film. Harry always says he ""feels at home"" when he's at Hogwarts much more than with the Dursleys. Again, that was pretty hard to believe given how dark and cold and dreary all of the scenery was.Lastly, I think a few critical parts of the plot were left out of this movie. For example, it's pretty important to this and future books that Harry (and the audience) understand the relationship between Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs. NO explanation is given in this movie of who they are or what their history relevant to the map is. Also, although the stag was shown briefly at the end, explaining that he was actually Prongs was also missed. I can appreciate the intensive tone towards the end of the movie with the werewolf, but it isn't true that the werewolf would have tried to kill the black dog. According to the book, they were amicable as animagus(es).Other examples include...how did Snape find them in the shrieking shack? Why did Sirius bark at Harry back on Privet drive ?Lastly, the character development was lacking. It wasn't very believable that Draco Malfoy would go from total arrogance to a whining, sniveling wimp just because Hermione hit him with the wand. There are several other examples but I will stop with those.Overall, I enjoyed the movie somewhat, but I really hope the future releases will not have the same dreary, gloomy tone. Or if they do, they at least need more humor, better character development, and better explanation of critical aspects such as those mentioned above. Personally, I think adding 45-50 more minutes to the movie for the sake of better flow and development, would have been worth it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Series Hits Its Sweet Spot,"By now the series has found its sweet spot between dark and light, fear and wonder, childhood and adulthood, strangeness and convention. Cuaron is an excellent director who can seemingly turn his hand to any sort of film that comes his way, and as with every film in the series there are some good newcomers here - Emma Thompson is only briefly seen but is very good; Gary Oldman is a fine addition and the introduction of the Dementors marks the arrival of one of Rowling's most powerful, enduring and meaning-packed creations. It's trimmed some of the fat in comparison to the first two films, but is still a little too long - otherwise is probably the series at its peak.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful!,"Most of all I appreciate your young cast. It certainly left curiosity in our hearts for the forth-coming flick. I have like warner brothers previous works too. Mostly magical, special effects, never seen before(NSB) computer graphics and anime. Especially the hippogriff. We wished it could stay for long and could do more things. Nasty! Sets are quite attracting and absorbing. One thing lacking is spontaneity in Harry's character. He hears too much. Takes a lot of time. He must become emotional with age. Which is bad of'course but that's how this character sounds. Otherwise, it is rising. Rupert Grint is your finding. We like tidier movies and thin guys. Movie has a scary name but was action packed and scary too. Keep it up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best yet,"For me this is the best 'Harry Potter'-film yet. The story is better, especially the ending, and the characters are really growing up in this one. 'Azkaban' is darker, scarier than the first two, making it more a grown up film. What also helps for that is director Alfonso Cuarón, known from the terrific 'Y Tu Mamá También', who gives the film a better look. The cinematography is more ""European"", if you can say that, and for me that makes the film better.The only point of critique I have has to do with my comments above. The movie feels more mature, a good thing since the book was pretty dark as well, but I feel younger children should enjoy films like this. I guess there are some scenes here that are not very suitable for the kids. Still, the best entry in the series, a highly enjoyable movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Masterclass,"My favourite of the books, and certainly one of the strongest films in the series, Azkaban heralds an even darker new vision, as our three heroes are faced with an escaped murderer. Cuaron brings a maturity to the film that parallels the now-teen cast. Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black and the final third of the film is a masterclass in fantasy filmmaking. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pleased,touched with slight disappointments","An eagerly awaited treat to be treasured in the collection. Partly because of what it is;- the third film of the most exciting ""children's"" story in modern times and therefore a must have if you are following the adventure. (I am 46 but that is not old for a child........) A fabulous book needs a fabulous film to re-create it perfectly, a very difficult job. But then, if you are eagerly following as I am, there were slight disappointments. Unavoidable as it is, I feel Michael Gambon is only a substitute Dumbledore, not the real thing. Not his fault, it would have worked fine if he had been in from the start, it is the sad fact that he had to pick up where others left off. If only he had stuck with his own wonderful speaking voice and not used an Irish accent the exchange might not have been so noticeable. Other differences stood out rather glaringly, the alteration in position for Hagrid's shack gave us all a jolt. My friends and I felt there was rather too much attention to scene setting at the expense of the plot - why could we not have been told who Messrs Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs were, for instance? Why did not the childrenmeet up with Dumbledore inside the infirmary to be locked in so no suspicion could fall on them? We felt it was obvious that there was a new director, understandable that he wanted to do it in his own way but this is one episode in a complete story, isn't it? A friend who had not read the book found the plot quite confusing and the sequences rather staccato, the story did not flow for them. However, to put things back into perspective, it was a triumph of organisation and thrilling special effects. Buckbeak was simply perfect. Lupin and his transformation were excellent. All the great names were as wonderful as ever and I shall be watching this film over and over again - along with the others of course, and I confess that so far, I think I prefer them in their own way.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
win lose situation,"There are as many great things about this movie as there are sad disappointments.Harry is 13 now and starting his third year at hogwarts. he is reunited with his friends and finds that he is yet again in trouble. The dangerous prisoner, Sirius Black, had become the first in history to escape from Azkaban Prison, and he is going to Hogwarts to seek his revenge.This movie is darker than the last two and I think that the mood and atmosphere of this movie reflects the intention of the director. It is time to see that Harry Potter is not just for kids anymore. The evolution of the kids as well as the CGI development is really maturing and coming to fulfill the climax of the movie that will lead to the center of the entire plot.As we all are aware, there is no way to fit a 700+ page book fully and detailed into a 2 1/2 hour movie... but some changes of the director really offended the faithful readers of the series.Overall, a great film that, though a bit choppy, made everyone want to believe in the magic in ourselves.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Kids are getting better at it.,"My wife and I finally decided to watch all the Harry Potter movies, just to see if it was worth all the fuss. J. K. Rowling made a fortune of it, and I can see why. It's all very entertaining, certainly for kids or as a family movie. The first two were good but the kids obviously needed some improvement with their acting. In this third movie it's clearly visible that they're getting better. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have everything to thank from this franchise. I rated the first movie with a seven, and the second with an eight. This one is of the same level as the first one. The green screen monents were a little bit better this time, but still not perfect, and as for the story it was weaker than the second movie but still good enough to have a good movie evening. Tonight it's time for the fourth movie, curious if the kids are still getting better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonderful.  Best one yet.,"I love this movie. As a devoted Harry Potter fan, I was disappointed with a few things, but you can't always match your vision with the vision of the director. All of the Harry Potter main characters, played by Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint, were much better this time around (I still like to laugh at their acting jobs in the first two movies, but they were kids). The replacement Dumbledore I actually liked BETTER than the first one because he seemed more quirky, more like the Dumbledore that I picture and that is represented in the books. David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were fine, though I see them differently as well. Not that he is ugly, but Sirius Black is supposed to be very, VERY good-looking, and you could not see a trace of a good-looking man (that I pictured) in the withered Oldman.Also, the ending was rather stupid for me. I did not like the whole Harry-got-a-broom-and-is-whisked-away ending with Daniel Radcliffe's blurry face.Great movie. I cannot wait for the next one!

Not as fun as reading the book,"Harry Potter 3 is really a good time at the movies, but just not as great as reading the book. Saying that, I did love the special effects, and the Dementors were just as I pictured in my imagination. The Griffin was REALLY well done but the flying scenes on him were a little 'The Neverending Story' for me and lasted too long. There has been talk that this movie is ""darker"" and that it may be too scary for kids, but I don't really find that is the case. None of the little kids in my theatre seemed to be upset over the scenes, and there really isn't ""jump-at-you"" moments that would make small children cry. Even Snape, one of my favorite characters, isn't that scary at all in this installment. There is plenty of silliness to appeal to kids, and I think they would love all the creatures and characters just as much as in the book. It is weird to see all the actors growing up though, with deeper voices and teenage bodies (complete with acne!) and that made a lot of people chatter at the beginning of the movie (""Listen to his voice!""""Ron looks so grown up""). Something though was just missing for me. I just feel like I didn't totally feel the magic like I had in the very first HP movie. I would say see it, but please read the book too - it is so much more rich, vibrant, and magical than the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Could of been better,"This potter film i believe went downhill from the first two. I believe that warner brothers should have never changed directors. I had many problems with this installment. Me being a Potter fan myself i had an idea about what this film would look like. I am sad to say that many portions of the film were not only done wrong but out of time sequence, there was also a lot of things missing from this film that could have been done if other minor parts were left out.Though i did enjoy the special effects and the characters, i felt that there wasn't enough time in each scene to digest what was really happening in the story. I think you would really only understand what was going on if you had actually read any of the books. I think many people would agree that even the look of this film was different then the previous films. Its understandable that because directors were changed things would be different, but certain things i believed went to far.I gave this film the ranking that i did because like i said before i am a potter fan and i still stand behind the books and the films no matter how bad or good they are.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
scenery,"i love the harry potter series. i absolutely do, but i have some criticisms of this movie in particular. There were so many things that were changed, unfortunately, for the worse. not that I'm not gonna buy th DVD or anything, its just, when i saw it in theaters....# 1? the scenery. it was the same in the first 2 movies, so it would have been so much better in this one if it had stayed the same. i know that replacing dumbledore had to happen, poor richard harris, but the new one coulda at least tried to sound a little raspier like the old one so that people who didn't know harris had died would find it harder to tell this was a new cast member. and the prophecy... i know they have to cut things out of th story and all, but there is supposed to bee like a month or 2 difference from the day hermione leaves divination til the prophecy. certain things just shouldn't be changed, and certain things must be made with real timing. oh, and peter pedigrew!!! he was fat!!! peter pedigrew is supposed to be a thin and frail, tiny man. yeah, the guy looked like a rat, but he definitely wasn't thin!!!!!and the whole movie just seemed so much darker.... the others had a realistic coloring, this one was just like it was always dark, when thats not the case...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
More of the same,A little disappointing after some of the really good reviews this film got. I saw it a week after Shrek 2 and it pales in comparison. The three main characters are a little older and instead of being impressive child actors they seem little more than average. By the next sequel the two boys will have trouble playing their characters ages. It really had the feel of a Walt Disney TV movie. Kind of a jazzed up Bednobs and Broomsticks. Still the demographic it is aimed at is 13 year olds and it should continue to impress that age group. I would still recommend it for 16 year olds and under but DO NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE! It is not as good as the first film and you will probably be disappointed if you go in expecting that.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Kids have grown and the plot grows with them,"Got free two hours and a little more? Turn on the TV and start watching another ""Harry Potter"" film. ""The prisoner of Azkaban"" is the last movie I can watch with all the family. Next movie (""Goblet of fire"") is rated as 12+ and none of my kids qualifies for this age, so they will have to read it.This is where the film series make a small jump and upgrade. Not just in the way that the books make it, but in the way the movie start to become even more darker, the level is going up and the tension goes way high. You can find small jump scares bits and pieces, but it is a hell of a ride - also for the kids.Harry potter is returning to school just to get the news that a serial killer is after him and things get series. The tone set by Alfonso Cuaron is magnetic and the job he performs to still remain PG in this kind plot is admirable. It is not the darkest of all, but a lot of fans can agree that it was one of the best movies and with some good reasons.Two hours and more fly by, as always, as part of this film franchise ground rules.

Harry's Even More Magical World,"Alfonso Cuarón is probably one of the most eclectic directors in all of Hollywood. I first became interested in him after viewing the film Y Tu Mamá También, and began to devour his other works including Great Expectations and A Little Princess. Every film of his is a gem, and completely different from the previous, but the one film that really stood out in my mind as a showcase of his work was, incredibly enough, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, I am by no means a very big Harry Potter fan. Yes, I've read the books, and yes I've seen the movies, but they were never really a very big deal for me, like they were for some of my peers. What drew my attention to the film was the attachment of Alfonso Cuarón to the job of directing.After two financially successful Harry Potter films, Chris Columbus called it quits, and in 2003, the job was up for grabs. Columbus, after a string a very successful family films including Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Stepmom, had developed a very predictable way of directing, which, for me, made the first two Harry Potter films incredibly dull. When I became aware that Cuarón was taking the job, I grew very excited for the release of the film. In his other works, Cuarón had found a way of completely opening up the film to let the audience be entirely immersed in a world they are not part of. He gives the audience room to imagine what is beyond the scope of the camera and the walls of Hogwarts. I love everything about this technique because it gives such a sense of possibility and limitlessness.While many cynics, especially kids who have read the book, as it's likely the only book they've read which has been made into a movie, object to the removal of subplots in the film, they are missing the overall aesthetic and feel of the film. The third movie feels more like a Harry Potter book. While only focusing on the linear events of Harry Potter, Columbus missed out on the broad world of Harry Potter, which is exactly what Cuarón provided. Cuarón spent a great deal of time showcasing the lusciousness of the castle, the beauty of the grounds, and the overall quirkiness of everyday objects in this world. He paid extra special attention to the colors that were placed in the film, green for jealousy, and red for warning. Cuarón managed to set up incredibly complicated camera shots that weave in and out of rooms, over turrets, and across lakes. These small touches are what emphasize the magic of Harry's world, and not the actual events that happen in the narrative. Everybody knows they can do magic and everybody knows the invisibility cloak works. It's how the director engages the audience by the use of camera movement that the audience feels that they too, can be a part of this.Cuarón also binds magical elements to the elements of the real world. Like in A Little Princess, the audience is not quite sure how all of those food and luxury items appeared in Sara's room, but they like it just the same. In Great Expectations it's quite unrealistic to believe that Fin gets this remarkable chance to display his art and become famous, but it is bound with very realistic elements such as poverty, and heart brokenness, that makes the audience come to believe that this could really happen. Cuarón uses the same techniques in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Throughout most of the film, the main characters are never seen with their robes on, yet appear performing magic all the time. Having these two elements juxtaposed together engages the audience even more, because these are kids who wear the same clothes, talk about the same things, and have the same problems that everyone does. The audience can relate to the characters, and feel like they area part of the story, rather than idly watching. Cuarón emulates what J.K. Rowling's books were trying to invoke in readersa sense of belonging.A well directed film will not necessarily leave the viewer continuing to think about the plot of the film, or even its social implications, but a well directed film will make you think in terms of the world it was set in. After The Prisoner of Azkaban, the audience wants to know what else is going in this world. They want to know what lies deep in the forbidden forest; they want to know the ins and outs of the castle; and because of the omnipotence of the camera, the audience believes that they are entitled and have the ability to know more. This was not a film told in a linear way, but in an incredibly 3-dimensional world, where anything is possible, and it is they way that Cuarón illustrates this with his techniques that makes this film amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

In Contrast to the other Summary...,"I thought this movie was very good, considering they went and got themselves a new director. The way the movie transitioned and went from scene to scene was pretty well, nothing was dragged out or moved too fast. The only thing that I thought was silly was the end when they froze on Harry's face when he was riding the broom XD Hahahaha, but hey it is a movie meant for kids, so who cares if its childish :) It overall was great though in my opinion. Sure everything that was in the book wasn't included, but thats understandable because if they stayed faithful to the book, then well you know, it would end up 16 hours long or something, so they did fine with what they had. They kept you wondering and interested about what was going to happen next (for those who didn't read the book) and wondering just what it is that certain monsters or spells do. Of course, all of it eventually gets answered anyway, so its all good n gravey, and pretty much all of your questions (or mine were) answered by the end. I dunno why you'd go and strain yourself over something like that anyway, and go out of your way to find some unanswered question or something wrong. You can't ever really bottle perfection, and sometimes just have to be happy with what you have.I honestly didn't read the books at all, because I'm not one with the attention span to be able to do so, but this movie certainly drew me in, and explained things to a non-book person just fine :D The only reason that I might've not been able to know what was going on at times in the movie was because I couldn't make out what they were saying with their accents, or they were speaking to softly at times, but after watching it a 2nd time with the volume up and some subtitles, i got it all fine.But hey thats just me. I'm a Potter fan, and happy with the movies they've come out with so far. This one would have to be my favorite though, seeing as they've come a long way since the beginning and have got more budgeting to do the better CGI and animations and whatnot. But um... yeah.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An interesting take on the third installment in the Harry Potter saga,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite of the books so far but right off the bat, I have some mixed feelings about the movie. There are some huge differences between this film and the previous installments and that's not necessarily for the best. Let's begin...Azkaban is considerably darker and more mature than the other two films. Every scene in this film is morbid and dreary with little or no humour. Rupurt Grint, normally the oddball comedian in the films, rarely gives the audience a chuckle. Not even the Great Hall gives off that warm light that normally shines during Harry, Ron, and Hermione's dinners. And judging from this, I think the box office numbers reflect that. The target audience for the Potter books is getting to that weird gangly age where they begin to lose interest in things (thankfully, I was well off the puberty train many moons ago). If the the HP crew want to keep the boulder moving, they need less talking and more action.But there are also some good things here. All the actor's voices have cracked (thank God) after passing that hunch of 13. There are fewer childish moments than in the previous films (that damn shrunken head still bothered me) but the maturity of the plot and cast keep this film afloat. The FX are not spectacular but are still quite good.But probably the best and least celebrated element of this film is the music. John William's goose-bump infused score, to me at least, is gorgeous. The music in the final scene with Sirius was actually quite beautiful. In some other thoughtful moments between Lupin and Harry, the film provides some lovely Celtic music. With myself having quite a strong Welsh background, the music actually made my day more enjoyable.All in all, if I had to compare, I'd be forced to say that ""Chamber of Secrets"" is the best so far out of the series. Azkaban tries hard to be good but the slow pace and morbid tone keep the score at a worthy 7. It's still worth checking out but probably not worth buying.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but not great,"I mildly enjoyed it, but all this fuss about it being better than the first two is not true.If you have not seen the movie or read the book, I recommend seeing the movie first and then letting the book fill in the gaps for you.The movie's breakneck pace is too fast - you never have time to properly understand or savor anything. It's always ""on to the next thing, quick!"". Most of the characters besides Harry, Ron, Hermione and Lupin are cameos, including Dumbledore, McGonnagall and Snape. There is no depth.Questions answered in the book are not answered here. Why does Lupin know about the Marauder's Map? Who created the map? Why is the Patronus a stag?How does Harry trust Sirius after, oh about thirty seconds, without an adequate explanation? What potion does Lupin take and why? What is Snape's connection to Lupin? Why and how are there so many Animagi? Who is that crazy knight cavorting around the paintings? The list goes on and on. The film is good but the book is a far richer experience.There were other items I found irritating. Harry can't use magic at home, but the movie opens with him practicing a spell. X! The Whomping Willow is smaller now, in a different location and is a breeze to sneak past. XX! Crabbe and Goyle are both in the film, but Malfoy ends up most of the time hanging around with Crabbe and some other kid?? XXX!Bottom Line: I was not sure before, but now I agree that Goblet of Fire should be two movies or it will be an even more hurried affair than this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Solid, but uneven","I saw this with my family on Saturday.  We all enjoyed the first two movies, and have read the book.  The movie was enjoyable, parts of it were excellent, but there was certainly a feeling of deflation when leaving.First for the best part of the movie, the new cast members, David Thewlis, as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Micheal Gambon as Dumbledore. Thewlis was excellent, showing a great empathy and friendship for Harry. The scene of Lupin and Harry on the bridge was perfect.  Emma Thompson was spot-on as Trelawney, a role that had to be fun to play.  Michael Gambon took over the role of Dumbledore seamlessly.  Except for his first appearance, when I was specifically looking for the change, throughout the movie he was simply Dumbledore.  Dawn French as the Fat Lady, was also fun especially for Brit-com fans.The pacing of the movie seemed odd, and there did not seem to be the attention to detail that there was in the previous movies.  Previous movies had you looking in the nooks and crannies for things you might miss, this one seemed more barren.  The movie leaped from introduction to conclusion in a jarringly short time.  It felt like it should have been about 30 minutes longer.  I don't expect every detail from the books to be included, especially in light of Rowlings increasingly bloated prose, as the series has progressed, but we got very little ""life in Hogwarts"" and almost no real look at Hogsmeade.The biggest losers in this rush to the finish line were two of the best cast characters though this series, Maggie Smith's Minerva McGonagall is almost completely absent, and Alan Rickman's Snape is only shown when absolutely necessary to the plot.In the end, we gave the movie a 7, but it was much closer to sliding to a 6 than it was to an 8.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Where Harry Potter became ""cool""","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best Harry Potter movie. From a filmmaking standpoint, everything about this film is improved compared to the first two films. The script, the acting, the cinematography, everything is crisp and perfect.While the first two movies have a tremendous amount of heart, this movie is where Harry Potter became ""cool"". Wearing muggle clothes more often, darker themes and straying away slightly (but not too much) from the books helped elevate this film to new heights.I truly believe that if Prisoner of Azkaban would have flopped, the series would not have been finished. Thankfully Alfonso Cuarón is a filmmaking legend, and this film is at the top of the Harry Potter list.Best Character: Remus Lupin (honorable mention to Sirius)

School Daze and Knowledge,"Rowling's books, given their references to: English boarding schools; the problems of life in (apparently mundane and, at times, abusive) suburban and middle-class English life; the acquisition of knowledge regardless of cost; the shifting and unreliable input of adults per se; and, surely, the need for a child to believe in the sanctity of missing parent(s), were always going to be problematic when transferred to the ""big/silver screen"".Well, three films later, Alfonso Cuaron (sorry about the lack of diacritical mark) has fulfilled the promise! There has ever been a darker side to the texts and, finally, it has come to the fore. Cuaron has not lost the thread of the first two episodes - rather he has added to what at the moment, promises to become a remarkable teratology. And, of course, there is more to come from Rowling's pen.Steven Kloves has written a superb screenplay. The CGI and cinematography are, as usual, excellent: as is the casting.On a different note, there is, perhaps, too little attention given to the subtexts contained within Rowling's work. And, as mentioned in the opening paragraph, they seem specifically English. Obviously, with regard to publication of the books, this is not the case: translations and the move ""across the pond"" are reaping enormous awards. Regardless of this success, how do the films cross cultural barriers and appeal to children across the globe? Within reason, they don't.If there is a third-world audience of children (the US ""M"" classification and individual governance's may, in effect, ban them from seeing the film) they will, perhaps, understand only the references to magic.(In New Guinea, in 1974, ""Easy Rider"" was screened, for us, as Australian soldiers, on a bedsheet outside a tent. The interested indigenous people [viewing it from the obverse] were mesmerised - but only by the music and cinematography. None of them understood English and therefore the text. Oh, dear. They probably think, to this day, that slurred and misunderstood dialogue is ""the way to go"".)The appeal of the books AND the films can only be understood within the contexts of either an elite (yes, I know, diacritics) class who can attend boarding-schools, or those granted scholarships to attend same. Surely, this is the reason for the delineated antagonism between Draco, Potter et al. The notion that old money will buy a place in the ""academy"" (Draco), is offset by Potter (granted a scholarship), Hermione (innate esoteric intelligence), and Ron (perhaps second-banana to Harry) who also is there because his impoverished family has a ""free ticket-to-ride"". The only way that the reader/audience GAINS insights into these protagonists' characters is how they react to, and combine with, Harry.In some ways, the books/films are a ""rite-de-passage"". As the central characters gain knowledge, they also (perhaps) become world-weary. At the same time, however, their inter reaction with an unusual and magical world never ceases to delight.

Glowing Reviews are not justified,"Although Columbus left much to be desired, I despise what Cuaron has done to Azkaban. He cut WAY too much out of this movie.

The sets , while beautiful, are entirely different from the 1st two movies, and I disliked that. Hogwarts is supposed to be a home and refuge to Harry even when danger threatens. Here the Dursley's house looks more inviting. What is with all the muggle clothing. Different clothing is worn by the entire wizarding world. So why is everyone walking around in jeans?? I was just entirely put off by the set changes and the butchering done to the storyline. I hope that some others finally speak up and bring some sense to the reviews of this movie.

Missing a little of the magic...,"I went and saw ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" at midnight this morning. I was looking forward to this movie for quite a while, having read the books. Unfortunately, the movie may be a bit of a disappointment to readers of the book. To anyone going to the movie without reading the books, it should still be great. But Cuaron left out a lot of smaller details that should have been involved, taking away a bit of the true charm of the stories... However, Cuaron did a great job at making the movie darker and grittier than the first two. At times, you forget that he's made changes because you're so caught up in the fantastic work on the movie. The acting is especially brilliant, since the kids have matured and we have some great new additions to the cast. Even though he doesn't have much screen time, Gary Oldman does a fantastic job as Sirius Black. Over all, the movie is very good, and I still suggest you see it. Though it may not have everything some readers hope for, it's still fantastic to see it on the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Darker and better: the Potter franchise keeps maturing,"Like Tim Burton did with Batman, Chris Columbus ""dumped"" the Harry Potter franchise after the first two movies. Luckily, his replacement, Alfonso Cuaròn, is no Joel Schumacher and the third Potter episode is no Batman Forever.While still children-friendly enough to get a PG, The Prisoner of Azkaban is quite darker than Columbus' opening twosome: this time, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in serious danger. No, the fact that he put a spell on his aunt has nothing to do with it. The real problem Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a feared murderer who has broken out of magical prison Azkaban to track down and kill our favorite teenage wizard. Why? Well, probably because he used to work for Voldemort and wants to complete what he started several years ago: apparently, he is the one who betrayed Harry's parents, leading to their death. With all the other weird things going on at Hogwarts (new teachers, werewolves, ""I have a bad feeling about this"" speeches), it looks like the third year will be like the previous two: filled with dangers, excitement and, most of all, magic.Cuaròn does an excellent job when it comes to showing the young protagonists' growing pains and frustrations, emphasizing the fact that they are getting older and more aware of what is required of them, as well as laying the grounds for further exploration of teenage problems in the upcoming fourth film. Also, unlike Columbus, he's not afraid of removing certain parts of the book to make the film less stiff. As a result, Prisoner of Azkaban is more fluid and enjoyable than the first two Potter flicks, but the director could and should have kept a couple of crucial explanations in the third act, their absence implying viewers who haven't read the book might be left with more questions than answers. Another crucial innovation, as previously mentioned, is the darker tone, never more evident than in the scenes featuring the Dementors, the demonic creatures that have been sent to capture Black. An impressive example of good (as in serving the story, not being above it) CGI, they might remind of the Nazguls from The Lord of the Rings at first, but in the end they come off as much more frightening).As for the additions the cast (the other element to constantly evaluate in each new film), Emma Thompson is very amusing (though in a spooky way), while Michael Gambon proves a worthy replacement for the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, having the authority and at the same time kindness the role demands. But ultimately, this movie belongs to two actors: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. The former provides warmth and humanity as Remus Lupin, the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, even if it is weird no one ever becomes suspicious because of his last name (as seen in the brilliant climax); the latter comes close to stealing the entire movie, making Sirius Black this installment's Big Thing. All the character's pain, resentment and anger come out of Oldman's face and mouth with an almost scary intensity, adding plenty to the film's emotional resonance.Overall, this darker, less by-the-book (in terms of fidelity to the source material) Potter is much better than the first two entries in the series. If the fourth movie is at least equally good, the franchise might turn into something spectacular.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This is just my opinion....you think what you want,"okay....I'm going to quote my cousin on this movie...""It's really good, but it sucked compared to the books."" It moved way to fast, all of a sudden it was Christmas, then it was the last day..if it would have been longer they could have added more of the better points...and the animation wasn't that good, and the grounds were different than in the first two movies, the terrain was way different, and it should have stayed the same. Personally I think the movie should be re-made with the previous director Christopher Columbus. I liked the way he directed the movies. I think the main thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that it went to fast, Hermione didn't have time to be smart, and Harry didn't get his broom until at the end. But I think the acting got a lot better, especially Daniel and Tom's acting....I liked their acting way better than in the previous movies, but thats because they have had more experience two.~Amy Burghardt~",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Good as a film but missing some crucial details,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. But the director had a monumental challenge in adapting a book that most fans have read dozens of times and memorized down to the tiniest detail. Of course, even the slightest deviation from the book was going to be met with aghast cries from the Potter-obsessed. So instead of trying to cram everything into the movie, Cuaron went for style instead and tried to transplant his own vision, instead of Rowlings's, to the screen.For the most part he succeeded. I especially liked how the three main characters - wearing street clothes - had more natural interaction and seemed more like regular teenagers. And the visual effects and scenery were stunning.But there were some major plot holes that weren't explained, namely, the history of the Maurauders' Map everything that goes along with that, including the friendship between Harry's father and the other three. I found that that alone stopped this movie from being as good as it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,"This film is amazing, the use of camera transitions between the scenes and the character development in the film is flawless. Although there were areas that could be improved such as the cleaning up some of the plot the overall of the film is good.The idea of the director letting the actors wear the uniform however they want adds the the simplicity of the school environment.By giving it 10/10, I have enjoyed the use of the camera techniques and use of media conventions ions not only making it enjoy to watch but also making it interesting to study. This film is simply just done so beautifully and follows the books and previous two films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the series,"I saw all Harry Potter movies in the cinema upon their release, and Azkaban stuck with me the most. The combination of actors in their respective roles, and seeing them collide off each other is brilliant, especially the scene between Snape, Remus, Sirius and Pettigrew.There are no moments in the entire movie that I don't enjoy, and none that I cringe at, whereas every other HP movie has their moments that I find hard to watch due to the cringe, or immersion-breaking stuff.The writing is superb, with such memorable lines as ""I solemnly swear I am up to no good"", which personifies the essence of the medieval magic time-turning mystery and intrigue that is so well presented throughout this movie.The score is sublime and spellbinding, and is used so well with its according scenes and moments, elevating my enjoyment of the movie greatly, especially when Hermione uses bombarda on Sirius' jailcell and they all fly off on Buckbeak. It's evocative moments like that which really make Azkaban the best of the franchise.I miss those days of great cinema that belonged to HP, POTC and LOTR that captivated us all with their continuing magic over the years. Will we ever get such days renewed?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A welcome rejuvenation,"The Harry Potter movie series, so far, stands among only a few movie series that have improved with each successive film--the Evil Dead series and The Man With No Name trilogy to name two others. Chris Columbus, director of the first two films, gained a steadier grasp on his material with the second film, but it was Cuaron, director of this third, that moved the series into a much needed different direction.Columbus, a children movie director, paradoxically does not understand children. In his films, he forms representations of children that cater to an adult imagination; however, these representations are far too stiff and too clever to be true or believable. His films are entertaining because they appeal to this adult imagination, but that can only take the Harry Potter series so far. Cuaron stepped into it and yielded to the young actors a measure more freedom of character movement. The young actors, because of this freedom, act more like real kids, rather than cute representations.Rupert Grint, playing Ron Weasley, in this film does not rely on the quizzical expression that frequented his face in the first two films, and his punchline voice, though it remains, is clearing up nicely. Emma Watson, as Hermione Granger, has gained strength and confidence as an actress; she possessed both in the first two films, but has more-so now.Daniel Radcliffe, as the title hero, still needs some tuning up: his dialogue is more halting in this film and he can't quite manage the clunkers screenwriter Steven Kloves throws at him--when, for instance, he swears vengeance on convict wizard Sirius Black. Despite this, Radcliffe plays a better Harry Potter in this film, one who is more a troubled loner and tumultuous teenager, one who is a truer manifestation of the hothead Rowling created.In an otherwise cartoonish--though not unpleasantly cartoonish--first third, Radcliffe brings this troubled teendom out when he runs away after an upsetting episode with the Dursleys, his foster family. He seethes with anger, confusion, and melancholy.The filmmaker, whether it is Cuaron or Kloves or others, risks more in this film. Some of these risks are silly, whether it is an allusion to drug use when the boys are sitting around trying candies that have different joke effects on them, or whether it is an allusion to another boyhood activity when Harry makes his wand incandesce underneath his bedsheets.The biggest risk was changing Hogwart's locale. The terrain in this film feels natural and vibrant, and though they acquaint the audience well enough with the new hilly school-grounds, the audience may be put off, or, worse yet, confused after having familiarized themselves with the setting during the first two.The filmmakers also risk confusing the audience by glossing over some of the plot details in the assumption that most the audience has read the book. Columbus, at least, enunciated every significant detail.Cuaron, however, should be congratulated on the risk that paid off the best: putting more emphasis on characters than effects and putting more control into the young actors' hands. This most of all makes Prisoner of Azkaban the engrossing, entertaining, vibrant film it is.The visual effects--and they're considerably vital in a franchise such as this and worth consideration--are absolutely astounding, Buckbeak the hippogryff especially--another leap forward from the first two.Also, listen to the score by John Williams as you watch. It's a treat too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
HP3,"The Harry Potter series begins to enter it's adolescence and leave behind the childishness of the first two films, resulting in one of the best films in the franchise. Oldman as Sirius Black is a delight, especially given he was always my favorite character, the addition of the Dementors add severity to the world as suddenly there is an institutionalized kill squad roaming about of devious creatures that are near unstoppable leading to one of the great moments of the series when they are inevitably overcome in grand fashion.Now, admittedly none of these movies hit me the way they seem to hit others. I enjoy this one more than most of them and even then it still just never really, truly wows me or hits home for me. It's a good movie, it just never reaches levels of greatness for me personally although I recognize where it would shine for a lot of people.

I was so disappointed!!!,I have seen all the TV reviews of Harry Potter and I was anxious to see the movie. Don't go. Save your money! It is the worst film of the three that have been released. The worst movie I have seen this year. It left so much of the book out. Some of the great scenes were left out. One scene ended and when the next scene started you were like...uh? It started off OK but went downhill from there. It contained none of the humor or interaction between the characters that makes the books so poplar. I was like so what..who cares what happens to these people in this film. It left me cold. The Prisoner of Azkaban was one of my favorite of all the Potter books and it was just ruined in the movie.

a glimpse of what could have been...,"This movie is so fresh... it flows easily are sprinkled with nice humor and is full of creative touches, the music is good, hell even the kids (especially Emma Watson) are good (well... Radclife is passable) and the direction is nothing short of mind blowing.Seriously, this is a glimpse of what could have been a great series if someone like Cuaron would have directed it. He seems to have a firm grasp of the humor and atmosphere of JKs universe and have distilled the book into a organic film instead of a bunch of stringed together scenes.Everything looks so much better then in previous entries. And there is a sensed of darkness here that could only been sensed before, now, if you read JKs novels you know that this darkness is in the books too, its that surrounding darkness that makes Hogwarts such a cosy place, Cuaron understands, look how he contrasts the dread of the dementers with the guys joking around in the tower. Its a knee-jerk reaction equating darkness with improvement, but Cuaron is much more then darkness, he instills real warmth and charm into his characters, contrasting that darkness, making it a cosy picture, Hagrid is especially endearing in this installment. His warmth is real, his sadness is real.David Thewlis as Lupin shines brightest though. The acting, the mustasche, its just comes together brilliantly.Cuaron also understands that Dumbledore isn't some Gandalf rip-off, he is this wise, but still genuinely eccentric wizard. And Finally we can sense that weird side of him to.

After the movie the story left a very thin impression, like there was no ""meat"" to the story.Acting was extremely uninspiring; maybe the directors fault, I thought it was fine in the first two installments.Special fx were OK but nothing ""special"" by todays standards.

Instead the film had a very rigid storyline and without the fun most of us love in these films lost my attention very soon.

Disappointment,"I was disappointed at this movie. As the book is my favorite so far, I expected much more. The casting wasn't great at all, and they missed too many important things, including the explanation of the map. I thought Emma Watson's acting has improved greatly, compared to the annoyance that it was in the first and second movies. The set of Hogwarts, to me, was much better than before. The scenes with Aunt Marge were so much better than I'd expected, and the humor of it was fantastic. I think the change in directors really improved the movie, but the screenplay shouldn't have been like it was. They should not have deleted so much stuff from the book.

Rewatched it for the 3rd or 4th time,"Just rewatching this movie for the 3rd or 4th time. Definitely more than any of the others, and I don't exactly know why.Maybe, because it is just (for my taste) exactly in the middle of ""having presented the world of Harry Potter like the books 1 and 2"" and ""too much plot already established from book 4 and onwards"".Not only that, but the characters are equally in the ""middle"" of their lives (i.e. Their teenage years, during which the typical struggle between the comfortable, known childhood and the enlightened adolescence and later adulthood is about to kick in).Finally, the movie is just absolutely beautifully shot with regard to subtle but effective editing that strongly supports the narrative of the book. And of course, we can't forget the, by now, iconic Marauder's map theme by the great John Williams, which is as subtle and effective as the editing of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you insult a hippogriff, it will kick you","Gone is Chris Columbus and so enters Alfonso Cuaron. Strike up the band, paint a banner, and the parade will be here in a few minutes.I have nothing against Columbus (haha thats where i live), but from the way chamber of secrets was going, it looked like the franchise was going to get a little stale. So gone are the bright colors and blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects of the first two movies and in comes the new artsy, darker look of Prizoner of Azkaban.Cuaron wasted no time in changing things to suit his needs however. Gone are the gentle rolling hills surrounding Hogwarts and in place of them are more extreme mountains. Hagrid's hut is down a hill that was nonexistent in the other movies, and the castle now includes a courtyard, a giant clock, and a large elevated walkway that leads to seemingly no where. These changes aren't necessarily bad, but they hurt the continuity of the series. Also, the entire tone of the movie is different, as the kids grow older and more mature.At first viewing, I didn't really like this movie as much as the other ones, mostly Sorceror's Stone. But when I thought about it, and as I read the 6th book, I realized that Harry's world isn't always a bright and colorful world with a blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects. So in a way, this movie provides a nice transition between the first books of the series and the later more darker ones, at least for the movies.Personally, I loved the new sound of the soundtrack. John Williams remains as fresh as ever and the medieval styled music is very good and appropriate, combined with the old themes.Some things are sorely missed though. One thing in particular, is Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is by no means a bad actor, but him as Dumbledore wearing a beanie just doesn't work. Richard Harris' dumbledore had that warmth and authority that perfectly caught the essence of the character portrayed in the books. There's nothing they can do about it, but I think Ian McKellen would have been a better choice, or maybe even Patrick Stewart.The only thing that makes this movie a little subordinate to the Sorceror's Stone is the end, which i thought lacked a little substance and could have been better given how the book ended. There were just a few little things that it could have added to make it that much more powerful, but they decided to make the movie that much shorter. Still, this is a very good movie and I eagerly anticipate the next movie. Mischief managed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Potter Movie yet,"With an entirely different director, followed by a different style, the third installment of the Harry Potter series had people questioning whether or not this film would be as entertaining and refreshing as its predecessors. As for me, it not only was entertaining, but seemed better and more adult than its predecessors.When comparing such a movie to its original novel, it's hard to say how along the lines this particular movie followed. With several crucial missing parts, it left faithful Potter fans to throw their popcorn cartons to the screen, and babbling about Cuaron's terrible job on the movie. I, having read the series, do agree that the film could have done well and made more sense with what had been cut. However, most forget to think of this movie as a movie alone--with no thought of the novel from which it was derived. Instead of comparing it to its novel twin, comparing it with its predecessors would be more accurate.As the series progresses, the stories, therefore the movies, get better, as well as the acting abilities. As the stories continue to get darker, the characters continue to mature. Radcliffe's performance, unfortunately, was a bit of a disappointment. Having improved since ""Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone"", his performance was still less than expected for the third installment and for the character he plays. He is Harry Potter, after all.Watson continues to improve, and she does not disappoint in her performance as Hermione Granger. She has grown to be one of the finest and most respectable teenage actresses for this generation. Grint has a natural talent for being Ron Weasley. It was almost as if he were born to play the part. He IS Ron. His performance was one of the most entertaining in the entire film. Comic relief is an important part in films which consist mainly of darker matters, which is what Ron brings to the film.The style in which this movie was set--more casual and laid back--was really appealing. It was refreshing to see that Hogwarts students aren't always in uniform, and everything is really comforting. This was by far the best way I have seen a Harry Potter film. Cuaron should have directed all three films. His style of directing was really riveting.Thus, I give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban a 9/10 rating. Fantabulous.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Absolutely fantastic. But not 100% faithful to the book.,"When I saw previews calling PoA one of the ""best films of all time"", I was worried. Since then, I've seen the movie twice, and could easily go a third.There are those who will watch the movie and realize a lot was left out, and complain that the chronology was changed. And yes, it was, but the movie was beautifully streamlined and devoid of the plot-cramming that plagued Chamber of Secrets. This time around, the plot was coherent, although did move along at a good clip.I'm continually impressed by the casting, I hope for big things from the main three. Even the new man for Dumbledore did a fantastic job. I can't complain in the least. Again, those overly faithful to the book will complain about this and that, but realize their complaints are not that the movie was bad, just not the same. On film, things need to change, and no crucial story elements were lost.The mood change between the second and third films is stark. Whereas the first two had a very jocular feel to them throughout, PoA maintains a steady grasp on the darker side. And although it's a minor point, the small things such as scene transitions and the movements from location to location are beautiful (the scene in Lupin's class with the mirrored closet particularly). Even the smallest details were tended to.Again, it doesn't follow the book exactly, which helps more than anything. Go see the movie, it's amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Harry Potter on speed,"OK, granted, this was a long, complicated book, thus it was challenging to condense it into a 2 hour movie, but there was very limited character development. The whole movie just felt rushed, from the very first minute, and it made the entire movie a bit confusing. The dialogue was so fast that the acting seemed poor. Basically this was a 2 hour movie that needed to be closer to 3 hours. And if they felt that they could not make the movie much longer, they should have cut out superfluous scenes such as the singing with the giant toads, or the part where Harry is flying around on Buckbeak's back (which frankly, looked so cliché and ""titanic-esque"" that everyone in the theatre laughed). Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew are very important characters, especially in later books (and subsequently movies) but they were not fully developed. I don't think it was even clear that they, in addition to Harry's father, James, created the Marauders's Map. The Prisoner of Azkaban was shot in a very different way from the first two movies. You can definitely tell this was a different director. Instead of focusing on the individual, it was ""bigger."" You get to see more of the Hogwarts' grounds, which was great. And this movie was funnier than the previous two. I also really enjoyed seeing the relationship develop between Hermione and Ron! I did not care for the new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon. He did not have Richard Harris's warmth, which portrayed Dumbledore's light-hearted humor.

A Review,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan that has been looking forward to this movie ever since the credits finished rolling for Chamber of Secrets. To say that I am disappointed in this film is a huge understatement. I shall start with the characters. The two most fascinating and powerful characters in the books and first two movies outside of the three kids are Snape and Dumbledore, Snape is reduced to a seldom used butt of a joke and Dumbledore has completely lost his magnificent presence and aura and is closer to a doddering old man. One of the most effective parts of the first two movies is the magical settings and costumes, these are completely missing from this movie. Hogwarts looks shabby and stark, Hagrids Hut more closely resembles a redneck trailer home. The students spend most of their time in street clothes, the entire 'feel' of the movie is more like a cheap imitation of 'Lord of the Rings' than the wonderful settings from the first two movies. However the most disappointing part of the movie is its plot/storyline... While the first two movies brought the books to life in a vivid and spectacular fashion with a faithful presentation Prisoner of Azkaban is a choppy, mutilated version of the book, completely lacking the engrossing nature of the book. Many important elements of the book were completely overlooked or 'changed'. The most important omission to me was the lack of any explanation of the significance of 'Padfoot, Mooney, Prongs and Wormtail and their relationships. Also the book introduced Cedric Diggory as the Hufflepuff seeker that beat Harry and brought about a level of animosity toward him by the Griffyndors... Cuaron seemed to approach POA with an intent to make it a combination of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Men in Black' it was a complete failure...",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban opens up a much darker and more complex world than the first two installments.,"Director Alfonso Cuarón creates a magical atmosphere where magic is intertwined with danger, and the story gains depth.

This is the first part where we feel Harry's real growth as a character - his inner struggles, dark fears, and new understanding of the world grow with him.

Meanwhile a prisoner has escaped the jail known as Azkaban who happens to be the man responsible for his parents death. This has led to Dementors, ghoul like creators, being everywhere around Hogwarts looking for the prisoner. Harry will look to make adjustments to his life while being hunted by the escaped prisoner and maybe someone else..This movie is directed by Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men) and stars Daniel Radcliffe (Horns), Emma Watson (Beauty and the Beast), Rupert Grint (Moonwalkers), Gary Oldman (True Romance), Alan Rickman (Die Hard), Warwick Davis (Willow) and David Thewlis (Wonder Woman).This is by far my favorite movie in the series. There is a good mix of magic, character development, drama and horror all mixed together. The film starts with an awesome bus ride to Hogwarts, maybe the most fun journey from our world to Hogwarts to date. The school lessons are always fun and the pictures on the wall were very well utilized. The wanted posters were awesome and Oldman was perfectly cast as the prisoner. The werewolves were fun and I loved the hippogriff. The ending was excellent and shined even more light on Harry's past and future.Overall this may be the best Harry Potter film and is definitely the best of the first three. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"I recall the controversy as this was released. Alfonso Cuarón consciously decided to darken this film, and the light-hearted stories of the first two are replaced by an edgier approach to this tale for our wizarding trio. The world's most wanted wizard ""Sirius Black"" (Gary Oldman) escapes from ""Azkaban"" allegedly bent on the destruction of ""Harry"". The script has more by way of addition to the original book, but in a complementary - not detracting way. As the children grow into young adults, we are exposed to a scarier side of their existence - the ""Dementors"" that are supposed to protect the innocent and the ""Boggart"" all serve to introduce a physical fluidity to this shape-shifting environment of peril in which they now exist. The presence of ""Valdemort"" becomes more omnipresent and there is so much more substance to the stories now. Sir Michael Gambon takes over the role of ""Dumbledore"" without quite the presence of Richard Harris, but we can tell now that this series is heading for murky, dangerous, waters...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
another interesting story,"My quest of watching the entire series of the Harry Potter movies continued with the 3th chapter: The Prisoner of Azkaban.With a plot that twists, some known actors but also new to the series and novel magic spells, the 3th Harry Potter movie is no different than the others, continues the story, adds to it and it's decently good. The way the students resolve the final puzzle in the end is also pretty slick.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is another interesting story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very upset Harry fan.,"It is very obvious that alfonso cuaron never read the series of books, if he did he would have never turned it into the rubbish that it is. Thanks a lot alfonso for ruining my favorite book with the dribble that you directed.I was waiting in anticipation for Azkaban to come out. When it did I have never been so disappointed in my life with a movie. The utter lack of very important storyline, like why was Harry's patrouns a stag, was left out of the movie. As a matter of fact the only people I have found who enjoyed the movie was people who didn't read the books. Plus the new Dumbledore was horrible. Dumbledore is supposed to be wise and grandfatherly, the new player was not convincing as either.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good adaptation,"Very faithful adaptation of the book but overall unsatisfying addition to the series. Radcliffe and Watson continue to grow into their roles but Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley has lost his charm. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are utterly wasted with almost no screen time to develop their characters.Michael Gambon is a poor substitute as Dumbledore. Perhaps, he could be replaced by a CGI Dumbledore.The characters of Lupin and Black were well done and certainly carried the film.My rating 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A new style for a great series.,"This third installment in the Harry Potter series sports a new style, much different from the previous two films' style. It turns the family-friendly franchise into a new, teenager-friendly offering, complete with teen angst, anger, and puppy love. The films are growing with their audience.The plot line of the film is fairly simple, but gets VERY complicated toward the end: Harry is entering his third year at Hogwarts, and he's going with the knowledge that there is a killer on the loose looking for him: Sirius Black. Mr. Weasley makes Harry swear that, no matter what, he won't go looking for Black. But, to quote Harry, why would he go looking for someone who wants to kill him? The mystery is solved in this excellently crafted fantasy film that combines good plot, artistic cinematography, and an excellent score from John Williams.The film hardly has any shortcomings. The actor who replaces Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, is in my opinion better as Dumbledore, but some people may not share my views. Also, the plot can get quite confusing towards the end, but it all makes sense by the end of the film if you've been paying attention. None of these faults are bad enough to affect the film much, though. It's an absolutely outstanding cinematic achievement, and it's worth a buy for sure. Go get it now! 10/10 from zero-hour-ii",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Bad Director,"The new director was horrible. Not even comparable to Chris Columbus. He changed the entire format of the school, Hagrid's hut was in a completely new place!!?? He left out a lot of important parts. For example, why was there a deer next to harry across the lake, he didn't mention that and yet he still put the deer in the movie. I am very glad there will be a new director for the 4th installment. The actors did a great job in this movie though. The end freeze frame was also very lame and cheesy. He tried too hard to focus on being comical than being true to the book. I understand that it is a long book and you have to cut things out but he cut out too many important things in place of not so important things. He also left out the whole cute story about how his dad was one of the guys that made that map he was using, just things like that which made book so good and heart warming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Lacking that bit of magic and sanity,"I was very disappointed by the changes in this movie. There was unneeded scenes of Hermoine achieving ""girl power"" as Draco gets beaten up... there's no ""magical"" feeling and all the wonderful music of the first two movies no longer exists... really lame jokes such as beating Ron's cast were scattered through out. everyone looks more ""hip"" with modern clothes. If anything, Potter has been dumbed down to standard pre-teen movie jokes. This was mostly the first half of the movie. The first half very much rushed the scenes of importance and jumped around so much that a non-reader would be totally confused. Instead of adding things that were unnecessary the huge plot of book three could have had more time to let each scene be presented. The Shrieking Shack scene was wonderful for the most part... the ""married couple"" line was exceptionally amusing. Oldman and Thewlis were superb... sadly Snape has little character in this movie at all. The ending on the Firebolt really destroyed the feeling of this being an ""epic"" sort of story... lack of closure. So, if anything I can rave about Sirius and Remus but otherwise, I found much of the movie ridiculous and unnecessary and lacking. 6/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the most action filled movies!,"I think that this movie was very well done. The characters were very well chosen, and it captured all of the fans' imagination! Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint were the best people for the roles. I think that Emma Watson is a great role model for all teenagers...especially me! Overall, it's one of the best movies, and I cannot wait for the rest of the movies! The movie was very well done and the cast worked the roles great. One of my favorite parts was when Hermione smacked Draco. Wow! What power! I think that they could have included more detail from the book. I am a huge Harry Potter fanatic!! I have read all the books more than once, and they I can never put them down! J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, and she captures everyone's imagination. All of my friends say that Harry Potter is the best movie ever!

HORRIBLE,I'm sorry i thought this movie was horrible. The director ruined it! From what i can tell lots of other people agree with me. Anyone who thought this director was good or have read the books and liked it is a complete moran! Where was Cho Chang? Dementors don't fly they glide!!!! I for one am glad the director is going. CHRIS COLUMBUS WE NEED YOU I CANT STAND THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! The actors were superb as always. What the heck is with these regular clothes? What happened to McGonagall taking the firebolt? Where is Pig? Ron needs more lines!!!!!!!!! Wasn't Hermione supposed to have a breakdown? Wasn't Ron and Hermione supposed to have a huge fight? Wasn't Malfoy and his crew supposed to come on to the quidditch pitch as dementors? HELLO!!!! This movie was ruined!!! The head on the knight bus? Harry was supposed to fret about the grim!!! Where was Dumbledore at the end! I used to be like glued to these books now i am more than ever!!!!! Checking their faults. Hogsmeade wasn't as i imagined it but i can deal. What happened to the grounds? Hagrids hut was closer to the water there were no hills. Hermione didn't wolf call so lupin would leave sirius alone!!!! Well I was really disappointed. I'm so ready for the new director!~Out~,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Exceeds the two previous movies,"Cuarón was a way better choice compared to Columbus! Columbus' versions were clearly meant more for kids than (young) adults, but Cuarón knows how to make a film truly for the whole family. Prisoner of Azkaban is of course scary for kids, but not too terrifying, yet still thrilling for anyone older.Visually Prisoner of Azkaban exceeds two previous movies. It's a lot different, considering how simple the first movies tried to be. There cinematography is astonishing and the camera moves in fun ways - like through windows or mirrors, and that always fascinated me as a kid. Even if movies are meant for children, cinematographers shouldn't shy away from eccentric, artistic choices because kids will love them.Also Prisoner of Azkaban rocks as an adaptation. It has scenes that didn't exist in the book and many details added by those who made this film, yet they all work. Those conversations between Harry and Lupin were always amazing and even if they weren't in the book or they were in the book but in a different form, those conversations were amazing and deep and gave... some hope to it. Also this is the only movie that has Harry's messy hair right.Prisoner of Azkaban really stands out from all the other Harry Potter movies. It's no wonder many claim it to be their favourite.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Emotionally rich & visually stunning,"The sheer emotion and the fantastic visuals of this entry into the Harry Potter series alone is enough for me to consider The Prisoner of Azkaban as the best in the series. It has a stroke of genius in its immersion that cannot be matched by any other one of the films in the series.Admittedly Alfonso Cuaron changed a lot of things when compared to the first two films by Chris Columnbus. Cuaron wanted to create an extremely dark atmospheric experience that can strike the fear in the hearts of the audience by use of its visuals alone, and he succeeded. The film is much, much darker than the previous two, and while it still has its joyous moments due to the fact that this is only the mere transitioning of the series into more mature territory, it is mostly a very serious film. Like the previous two, the narrative is once again outstanding, its non linear storytelling and use of time travel makes me also consider this film as my personal favorite narrative in the series, and the time travel sequence is quite possibly the greatest sequence in the series too. The introduction of the characters Lupin ( David Thewles ) & Sirius Black ( Gary Oldman ) also proves that like in the previous film, the Chamber of Secrets, the series manages to add new characters that are once again extremely interesting.This truly is the transcending film in terms of the three leads Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson, as they have evolved into great actors by this film ( Except maybe Radcliffe, who was still lacking emotional intensity in certain scenes, such as the one where he breaks down after eavesdropping on McGonogall and the minister. ). Unfortunately Richard Harris passed away before being able to take part in this third entry and thus was replaced as Dumbledore by Michael Gambon, who is admittedly not as good as Richard Harris, whose soothing presence had no equal. Gambon is not a weak link however, and plays Dumbledore to the best of his ability. David Thewles as Lupin is an extremely likeable but as later discovered also quite a troubled character, but the friendly & kind nature of the way his character is played is simply brilliant. It is ofcourse always a great idea to cast Gary Oldman in a film, as he is one of the most versatile and talented actors to ever grace the screen, and his performance in this film is once again nothing short of spectacular, since the desperation and will for justice basically drips from his face.The cinematography was great in the first two films, but is even better in the third, as it focuses a lot more on outdoor shots and on connectivity of its world than its predecessors. Cuaron wanted to show the audience how the world is connected, with various shots of the bridge making clear that Hagrid's hut is beneath it, and the courtyard before it. It is the most immersive of the series because it makes you memorize the layout with its beautiful connecting cinematography. There are also a lot more shots of beautiful gorgeous scottish-esque natural backdrops of the green plains and mountains, a bit in Braveheart's style, resulting in a visually very pleasing film. The previous two films seemed to be filmed on flat pieces of land which focused more on the sets itself instead of its gorgeous backgrounds.John Williams's score is very different from the previous two films too, since he seems more focused on creating a couple of simple melodies instead of the gigantic orchestral scores in the first two films ( Such as the beautiful score when Lupin and Harry talk about his parents on the bridge ). Buckbeak's flight is also quite possibly the greatest scene in the series due to Williams's incredible score and the gorgeous grassy cinematography, being in stark contrast to Harry's previous life as a neglected cousin of the Dursley's, wheras now he can truly taste the freedom, and it results in a truly beautiful scene.Harry's interactions with Oldman & Thewles's characters are simply dripping of emotion due to its fantastic humane dialogue ( Result of a great screenplay ) and genuine character bonding, and it is truly wonderful how the series make you care about its characters, although The Prisoner of Azkaban is definitely the greatest entry of the series in this aspect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"not a bad flick, but not so true to the storyline...","This will be short since everyone here pretty much has already said what I think also. The plot does not quite emphasize and skips over most of what the 3rd book was about.. I completely agree that Dumbledore did not possess that unique quality that made you fear nothing in his presence. He didn't make you feel AT ALL that he was the greatest wizard. They just skipped too many things. One thing I haven't heard too often was their trip to Hogsmeade... The person I went with never read the book and had no idea what Hogsmeade was, how important it was to the students, and why harry always had the cloak on him while he was there... I had to just about explain everything to her at the end.. If this director made all the HP movies, I would simply HAVE to read the book just to know what was going on.... It was a good visual, but the story lacks much desired by the fans, and by people just wanting to know why certain things were going on....",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great atmosphere but too little back story.,"The main problem with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the fact that it glossed over too many important things in the book. Also Lupin and Harry's relationship developed far too quickly and they NEVER mentioned who Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were. To me the movie felt like a poor summarization or book report of a great book. That being said the acting was good, the characterization was pretty good and the mood of the film was much more ominous. And seeing Hermione punch Malfoy was a real treat. If you're not a fan of the books the movie seems great. If you are you'll probably leave the theater thinking about what the movie could have been had it been longer or left in someone else's hands.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Won't disappoint true believers,"Saw it in a preview yesterday. I'm no HP fan, but I've accompanied my daughter (now 10) to all three movies. Hoped this one would have some (chaste) ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" teenage exuberance, but it's not much different than the other movies. This one is better--and probably scarier--but not much better. It's slow-paced until near the end, and, if you haven't the read the book, somewhat incomprehensible. Most fun is spotting familiar English actors--Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Julie Christie, Dawn French, Timothy Spall. Daughter complained that important elements of the book were omitted. Tried to explain that as Rowling's books keep getting longer and movies needed to stay more or less the same length, something had to go. She remains unpersuaded.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The third movie is even less like the book than the second...,"Did Rowling have to write another ""Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban"" for the film? It certainly has some likeness to the book, I'll say that much. In fact, there was some scenes after the werewolf that were what I had imagined it to be from the book, though that's nearly the end of the film. The rest of it, however was comprised of a rewritten story or highlights from parts of the book not shown in the movie. What did they film then? I guess you could say they showed enough highlights in the story that when piecemealed together, made it a movie. But there are some things in the movie that they touched only lightly on that never had any explanation in the film. Who is Messrs Moony Wormtail Padfoot & Prongs? Well okay, I guess if you watch the movie, you just think it's another Rowling name for a group of mischievous wizards. You'd never consider that Moony is Lupin the werewolf, Wormtail is Pettigrew the rat, Padfoot is Black the dog and Prongs is Potter the Pronghorn. Nor would you consider at that point, they were old school chums. What was the big deal about the Firebolt? Well if you just watched the movie, you'd think it was just an equivalent replacement to Harry's splintered nimbus 2000. You'd never hear about it at the beginning of the story and how it might be enchanted with charms or curses when he gets it before the second gryffindor quidditch match and has to ride an old worn-out broom. In fact, you would never know that he got to ride it on the third quidditch match and take home the quidditch cup at the end. At least in the chamber of secrets, the only major cut they made was Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party. But it seemed such a shame that they use such a wonderful actor to play Sir Nicholas only to take away his moment in the story. I am certain that people who have not read the book will find the movie quite interesting, yet somewhat puzzling. For the readers of this story, you may have also found it disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"Wacky atmosphere, lacking scenario, pathetic villains (speaking of Draco & Co, the Dursleys, Aunt Marge) and generally bad directing  especially regarding kids, Peter Pettigrew and Emma Thompson. It's clear that it's difficult to say at the tender age of 10-11 years if some kid will be able to act at all . Nevertheless, there are no excuses for letting a generally good actress entirely out of control. It was as if Mrs. Thompson played in a different movie. Thanks God there were also Allan Rickman, Gary Oldman and David Thwelis, so the movie wasn't completely ruined.I join those who are missing Chris Columbus and wondering what the fourth part will look like.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A bit rough around the edges, but it's still better than the other two","'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' opens with the young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), under the covers of his bed, doing what most mischievous 13-year-old boys have done at some point or another in the dead of night (Reading! Sheesh!). We're amused to see that Harry's Uncle Vernon is too stupid to catch him (as the villain always is), and so the film begins!Harry, who always seems to get himself into trouble, doesn't disappoint us in this movie. He 'accidentally' blows up his Aunt Marge, and is now on the run from the Ministry of Magic, whom he is certain will expel him from Hogwarts. Harry decides to take the Knight Bus, a violently purple triple decker bus, to London to retrieve some coinage from his vault. Now, the Knight Bus was pretty cool... at first. However, it got old quickly, and the shrunken Jamaican head began to grind on my nerves within 30 seconds. The entire scene was dragged out much too long.While on the Bus, Harry is told all about Sirius Black, the dangerous murderer who escaped from Azkaban; a feat never before achieved. Harry quickly finds out from Daddy Weasley that Sirius is after him, but Harry isn't overly concerned. Why should he be? He's a teenager! It's an age- old tradition that we ignore the sensible advice of elders.Harry boards the train, but his pleasure soon turns into misery when the Dementors get on the train to check for Sirius Black. What are Dementors? Good question, and a difficult one to answer. They're faceless, they can fly, and they look scary. Enough said!This film in jammed- pack with action, excitement, and... love. Make way for the hormones, because Ron and Hermione have already begun to not- so- subtlety crush on one another. The full extent of their relationship in the books were arguments, which OF COURSE means they love each other (*rolls eyes*). In this film, however, they begin holding hands and hugging, and even their bickering is borderline- cute.The art direction in this film is fantastic. The exterior is completely different, yet more natural. You actually believe that the kids are at a bordering school in Scotland as you watch. It's rustic, yet colourful and alive. Cuaron pulled it off in a way that no other director could, ESPECIALLY Columbus. A particularly impression CGI was Buckbeak, a hippogriff. Buckbeak looked so real, I was tempted to believe that hippogriffs really DO exist, and somehow the crew managed to cage a wild one.The acting of all the children has greatly improved. Radcliffe, in particular, has taken strides. He had a few poorly done scenes, such as when he blew up Aunt Marge in the kitchen. Another one that comes to mind was the infamous 'crying scene,' which was the source of so much grief at many a message board. Word of Advice, Dan: If you can't cry, kindly as your make-up artist for some tear inducer! Honestly, kids were LAUGHING at him at the showing I went to! However, I can't just criticize. His body language and his entire approach to the character seemed much more natural in this movie, and so I applaud him!Two new actors joined the cast this year: Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis, as Harry's intelligent Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Both were extremely well- casted, ESPECIALLY Thewlis.In conclusion, this film was great. It is much better than the previous two, yet it still has its flaws. However, watch it for it's beautiful art direction and well- done CGI characters!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Y Alfonso Cuaron tambien!,"The best thing that ever happened to the Harry Potter saga is the selection of Alfonso Cuaron to direct the film and bring the third installment to the screen. Mr. Cuaron is a huge talent, and his contribution to this movie is enormous.Credit must go to Mr. Cuaron in perhaps getting Daniel Radcliffe to be a bit less stiff than in the other two films before. Also, Mr. Cuaron has the advantage of bringing together most of the best actors of the English stage and cinema.David Thewlis excels as Professor Lupin. This excellent actor has never been better and it's a shame we don't get to see him much. What can one say of the tremendously gifted Alan Rickman? His contribution is also vital to the film. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is amazing. So is Timothy Spall, in the small role of Peter Pettigrew.On the other hand, the female roles are a bit anemic. One would have liked to have seen more of the incomparable Julie Christie, who is seen through a glass darkly! Emma Thompson is hilarious as Professor Sybil Trelawney.Let's hope that now that Mr. Cuaron has been found, the producers entrust him with the next films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
movie,"A much more mature movie compared to the other ones before it. This one lacks all the special effects of the two before it, however it was really good and I found that the lack 'whiz bang' effects were a welcome change. The storyline was much easier to follow because of it and the characters were more mature with just a hint of romance - and about time. A much more individual performance was given by each actor bringing each one into their own. Harry is finally more confident and his co-stars are less like groupies to him. Nice to see more than one character get the on screen attention. I love the twist of time storyline and the surprise about the prisoner. Who would have guessed! This movie is really worth seeing as the actors have really settled into the whole amazing life a Hogwarts giving them more time to personally find their own strengths. I can't wait to see the next one (but one year is too long) so I can again see the next development stage of these characters and their talent for tricks and mischief.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great book ruthlessly slashed by movie adaptation,"I am a very big fan of the HP books, and I greatly enjoyed the first 2 movies because they were so close to the source. However, 'Azkaban', the screenwriter and director chose to remove HUGE chunks of the plot, which rendered much of the movie unclear to anyone who has not read the book. They also chose to insert some much unneeded slapstick (Harry gets plastered on bus window, Hermione gets flung by tree) instead of the far superior humor already provided by JKR. I would have happily lost all the 'new material' to get back the scene where Ron and Harry are working on their Trellawny homework.

Third time's the (magical) charm!,"Harry Potter was a huge part of my teenage years, reading the books and watching the movies. I even successfully got my mother into it was well. The magic of Harry Potter can be appreciated by anyone young and old alike. I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter movies directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire fame, but this one surpassed both and even to this day I come back to this one more than even the sequels as well, courtesy of Alfonso Cuaron's masterful direction. He knows how to add what's both light and dark, young and mature into a perfect mixture. Michael Gambon is great as Dumbledore, replacing the late Richard Harris, David Thewlis has that conviction as Professor Lupin, and Gary Oldman has that edge as Sirius Black. There are many great moments in this movie, almost too many to name! From Aunt Marge getting her (hilarious!) comeuppance, Harry's first flight on a fantastic creature that he and his friends later have to save and then it saves them, to Harry learning an important, though difficult spell that he will have to use against frightening, hooded, soul-sucking creatures, to many playfully mischievious moments inside a cloak of invisibility, trying animal candies and more.

The new Dumbledore had two problems; his accent was a bit distracting and he had a McGonagall clone thing going on in his mannerisms. Hermione was no longer irritating, a feat I did not think was possible, although she did rather take over the story towards the end of the movie. Ron was sweet, Harry was better though still shaky in places and Malfoy was hot. Neville looks really different and both Seamus and the Weasley twins were leaps and bounds better acting wise. Crookshanks was perfect. The set and style were really really good. The Dementors were awesome and scary and Buckbeak was pretty cool.

"Too much, too fast","Harry Potter goes to Hollywood ... this movie is a two-hour-rush full of ""special"" effects. Large parts of it have the tempo of advertising or music videos. Alas, Harry Potter III lacks the charm of the books, it lacks the wonderful atmosphere of Old England so beautifully captured in the first two movies -- it lacks everything that made the previous films of the series something special, lovely.I would not recommend this movie to a 12- or 13-year-old, not only because of the many horror scenes (don't know what they watch on children TV today, but I think this is way too much for a child) but also because I wonder how many of the young watchers who are so keen on Harry Potter get the story right (if they didn't read the book which should not be a prerequisite for watching the film) -- e.g. the side-story of Harry not being allowed to go to the village and getting the map as a help.My conclusion: the director was not interested in the story, not in the characters, not in the atmosphere. All he tried is to make you shed as much adrenaline as possible. I hope they will make a more old-fashioned movie next time. It would suit Harry Potter much better.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Brilliantly done,"Prizoner of Azkaban is definitely one of my favorites out of the seven Harry Potter novels, although perhaps not my favorite. However, I can say without reservation that until the next two films come out and I can pass judgment on them, this is my favorite of the film series. Cuaron's genius at direction and writing is easily tangible in this instant classic.Azkaban starts much the same way as the previous two films - at the Dursleys. It sticks to the plot of the books well, modifying it where necessary. He first manifests his latent anger and frustration as an abused orphan by blowing his aunt up into a helium saucer and letting her float out the door. He goes on the run and ends up being picked up by the Ministry of Magic, saying that for his safety, he'd best remain indoors and out of sight. Over the course of the film, he learns that an ex-convict and alleged Death Eater, Sirius Black, has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban - a feat which has never been accomplished before - and he's coming after Harry to kill him. As Harry further unravels the mystery surrounding Black's escape and why he's the target, he learns something about his legacy which changes his life forever and sets him out on a quest for vengeance.As a film, Azkaban doesn't disappoint when it comes to pacing and inclusion. Many fans were disappointed when certain things like the Quidditch matches were taken out of the book - I wasn't. The film did a fantastic job of following the plot essentials, showing us Hogwarts and its students, the everyday student life, while focusing heavily upon Harry's character development from a child into a teenager. His supporting actors are no less influential - Grint as Ron Weasley serves perfectly as a foil for both Harry and Hermione, with some hint of the romantic tension between the latter and himself. He also provides, as usual, a conclusive source of humor and lighthearted comedy.Watson's character takes a turn for the worse, however. The first two films accurately portrayed her as the young schoolgirl whose firsthand passion is studies and bookish knowledge, often at the expense of her social skills. At the time of Azkaban, she's not altogether different in the novels, but the film seems to make her more fashion-conscious and emotionally turbulent, a characteristic we don't really see come to fruition until the next novel. Nevertheless, her partnering with Harry is what fleshes out most of her determination - and that's what truly matters.If you haven't seen the film, I highly recommend it as indicative of the feel of the Harry Potter books.

As a kid, I'm not sure that I would have understood everything that happened in the movie, but watching as an adult, I understand the interesting techniques and how this movie was better than the second one.As usual, everything is great. From the new, I would praise the development of the characters and how their transformation happens in front of the viewer's eyes, using interesting techniques that fit very well into the movie. It provides a new experience.However, two certain old characters changed a bit in character for me, and they were revealed very superficially. Perhaps to some extent, the middle of the movie is a bit long, but it didn't really affect the viewing experience.In summary, the movie is not a fluff piece as such. It brings character development, a new story and gives a new viewer experience. If the first movie was the opening of everything, the second one is more of a closed story, the third one gives an open story capable of influencing the next series of movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A wonderfully inventive and entertaining entry that starts the series' slow transition into darker territory.,"A change of direction helps bolster the film's darker tone, lending a slightly 'odd' feel to the piece, and a time-travel element introduced later on provides a refreshingly unique third act, but 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban (2004)' feels perhaps the least connected to the overall franchise, with its plot having little lasting impact aside from introducing some interesting new characters and concepts. It is an entertaining movie with several exciting, and occasionally somewhat scary, sequences, but it does feel slightly underwhelming on the whole. Still, it's a great film. It's a unique, enjoyable experience that sits comfortably among its peers. It also serves as a perfect transition from the earlier and generally lighter films to the heavier ones later on, though the transition is much smoother than you might remember and even the first flick has moments of proper grittiness in it. This film is the first in the series to properly capture the wistful tone associated with the character, too. Wonderfully inventive stuff. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Sorely needed: An extended version,"I had been looking forward to Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, since I saw the Chamber of Secrets ... and as the story goes, I was sorely disappointed. Having read the comments from ""movie specialist"" and critics in papers and on various TV-channels I had really high expectations - but I was let down. Why? Because although the movie had much better acting skills (at least from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint I was grieved to see Emma Thompsons characterization of professor Trelawney. Not good enough by a long shot. The editing was so so. The direction was probably very good from a movie technical point of view - but ...and it is a very big BUT:The film was not by a mile dark enough. The film was not by a hundred miles long enough. And the details were to scarce to get a real idea of the story.A personal message to Alfonso Cuaron? Make an extended version. At least 45 minutes longer. And the next time, if possible - make the werewolf believable. It was also a shock to see that the grounds of Hogwarts had changed as much as it had. Too much.

More magical moments, more action and more humor would have made this movie as spellbinding as the first two.Although Prisoner of Azkaban is definitely worth renting, it does not deserve the praise given to the first two films as it just doesn't quite pull all of them together.

"Maybe a little bit of lag towards the end, but very enjoyable.","I should start by saying that I really enjoyed the film. As many people are saying, it is a little bit more ""mature"" and even ""dark"" than the first two, a transition which I think worked out fairly well (though I still appreciate the first two for their own value). My biggest impression was that it really grabbed me at first (partially from having noticed the changes in style), but wasn't quite as exciting at the end. I was really looking forward to seeing Gary Oldman's performance, but was slightly disappointed to see that he wasn't in too much of the film. What part he did play, though, was quite good. I should also probably note that I say all of this having not read the book, so I don't really have any complaints as to what was left out, etc., and I'm inclined to think that it's probably better that way.

Alphonso Cuaron Steers Potter and Friends Into Stormier Waters,"It's the third installment of Harry Potter and already the child actors have done a lot of growing up. Visually and dramatically, they've grown into their roles, and director Alphonso Cuarón lets them flaunt that newfound independence in his only take on the series. The school feels more lived-in and tangible, as opposed to the amusement park it seemed in the first two movies, and its residents (particularly the three central Hogwarts kids) are less buttoned-up and disciplined, more comfortable with their surroundings. It's also darker and more foreboding, foreshadowing the idea that this series was headed into stormy waters.Adding Gary Oldman to the mix seems a good choice, though he does little more than snarl and growl menacingly, Michael Gambon plays a more vibrant Dumbledore in relief of the late Richard Harris, and the returning cast all do well in their established roles. The plot flitters around for quite a while, however, obsessing over excessive amounts of day-in-the-life snapshots and unrelated asides. That does confirm the sense of wonder that's been imbued in this world since day one, but it also makes the plot feel extra slow and padded-out.The effects work has improved since The Chamber of Secrets, even if it still shows some cobwebs (particularly during the whomping willow ride). That progress could be attributed to a strict limit on house elves and quidditch matches, which were both prime suspects in the more eye-rolling segments of the preceding film. Azkaban is fair enough, with a meatier plot and a more tangible landscape. And, huzzah, the greater narrative does finally begin to move somewhere interesting. Alas, I still can't quite figure what all the fuss is about with this series. Maybe one had to grow up reading the novels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Less a Harry Potter movie than an homage to Alfonso Cuarón,"This is the only HP movie to come out so far that I actually disliked. The biggest problem are the many unnecessary changes that Cuaron makes only becuase he wants to. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the Trivia section here at IMDB. There are two items listed as being ""In honor of Alfonos Cuaron's Mexican Heritage"" and not one but TWO director's cameos. More than anything that shows that Cuaron was more interested in himself than the work at hand.There are major changes not only from the book but from the previous films. Many of the changes alter the overall ""feel"" of the movie. The sense of wonder that is maintained and fostered by the first two movies and all the books is replaced by one of foreboding and dread.Overall, the film just falls flat because the director failed to understand the soul of the work.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the other 2 and the book.,"Having heard some good things about this third installment, and having enjoyed the first two films i was quite looking forward to seeing Harry Potter 3. The first obvious thing about this film is how much it has changed due to having a different director. Even though the book is darker the film is completely different. For a start, i don't think their is a brightly lit shot in almost the entire film!The acting is improved, as is the script, and all the children just look right. That's mainly because they have all aged, and are wearing normal clothes, so the film feels less Disney than previously. IT may be a departure from the book, but since JK hasn't mentioned the kids growing in 5 years, it seems more realistic. The new characters are OK, thewlis is impressive (which is a shock given previous work), oldman has little to do but is okay, and Emma thompson is plain weird.The most important parts of the book remain intact, but quite a lot has been ditched to keep the running time down. Unlike the last two films, this one retains a good pace throughout, while keeping the sense of wonder i enjoyed from 1 and 2. It's really a great film - good acting from a mostly young cast, great visuals (no dodgy CG this time), good story. My only bad point would be that i don't think it's a film for kids at all. Teenagers yes, younger kids no. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Keeping the kids entertained and telling a good story does not combine well,"The Harry Potter books are loved for their wealth of detail and twisting story lines. The Prisoner of Azkaban is in my opinion where JKR changes gear after the first two and gives us a great book. I fully accept that transferring to film is a tricky balance to achieve, however in my view there was more than enough to pull out of the book to make for a great movie - and they failed. I suspect that parts of the film had to be made less scary or cut in order to get a PG certificate, however I would dearly love for the darker tale to be told. What on earth is the graveyard scene in the Goblet of Fire going to be like if this is the precedent? It seems the series is heading towards a backlash from the older readers over dumbing down for the younger kids. I say leave the twists and have the kids use their brains - and I think and hope that JKR is with me on that one. I'm quite happy to answer any of the questions the young ones might have.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Thank God Potter exists,"Hollywood film-making has become a very well orchestrated business with movies being done to satisfy ""market-groups"" and not to satisfy artistic values. Well, the market-group that has emerged as the most powerful is the under 14 years old, as opposed to some years back where teenagers where the group to target.This said, its obvious why kid's books and comic books are made in movies and that all movies have become more light hearted - more kid-friendly. Harry Potter may be a direct commercial effort to drain the pocket-money of the under-14s that already have spent most of it on the books, but it (the whole movie series) stands as a nice example of film-making with a heart, resulting in very watchable and enjoyable adventures - even if you haven't read the books.Thank God we have the Potter movies - at least they are imaginative, original and not dull and predictive like any other film nowadays.As for ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" its obviously the movie (and book) where Rowling is the most inventive (with the cool time travel). May be for some it was a disappointing adaption of the book but it nevertheless is a wonderful cinematic experience.Recommendable for the moviegoer that likes to be lost in a different world in the 2 hours he/she is watching a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The book was better...But it was Great!!,"I really enjoyed watching this new installment of the Harry Potter series. I thought that the special effects were a brilliant part that helped bring Hogwarts, Buckbeak, and many other animations to life. Although I liked the book better, I do give credit to Alfonso Cuaron for giving the audience a good and enjoyable movie. He managed to use great special effects with a good story, although the book had a much better story, and I was more anxious to find out the ending of the book than watching the movie. And one part of the movie that I missed very much was Richard Harris who had a great performance in the previous installments. I think the new Dumbledore didn't have the voice and the look to make it seem that Dumbledore was one of the greatest wizards of the wizard world. Again all three young actors, Harry, Ron, and Hermione pull off another great performance together. Including the acting from Sirius, Snape, and Lupin who give outstanding performances that gives the movie a better feel. So I certainly await with great excitement the fourth installment of Harry Potter, which by the way is my favorite book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Changed Characters,"I liked the movie a lot because of the change. Overall, there are some characters that have changed like all of the main characters that are Harry, Ron and Hermione who are 13 but look bigger.

By the way, I loved the change that Alfonso Cuarón made to this movie and that is why I rated it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Journey Takes a Darker Turn!,"It's time for the third film of the series, and this one was particularly exciting with a stirring change in director.Alfonso Cuarón, who in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" replaces Chris Columbus as director, and, with great skills, shows what a Harry Potter film should look like. He has toned down the ""childish"" and silly parts, but retained the magical atmosphere and imaginative content. Cuarón, who is a very visual filmmaker, has managed to put a highly personal touch on the third film in the series, and what stands out most is the light and the photo - the handheld camera sometimes makes the film feel like a European independent film, which is a nice surprise. Harry Potter's magical world no longer feels like an unattainable, dreamlike fairytale world, but suddenly becomes darker and more ""realistic"".There's no question that Cuarón has put his stamp on this movie. The return of so many familiar characters will keep viewers comfortable, but the stylistic changes make it seem as if this Harry Potter adventure is taking place in a different universe. The most obvious change is to Hogwarts. Although outwardly the same, the school is photographed and presented in a manner that makes it more ominous and less friendly than in the previous two installments. And a seemingly minor yet significant alteration. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have abandoned the school uniforms and Instead, they dress in ""normal"" every-day clothing.The filmmakers are becoming less literal and more cinematic in their adaptations. A flaw of the first two movies is that they tried to cram every nuance into the screenplay - an act that had a negative impact upon the films' pacing. For this film script-writer Steve Kloves has pared J.K. Rowling's story to its essence, resulting in a more streamlined motion picture.Although Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stands well enough on its own, it has a ""middle chapter"" feeling. In other words, there's no real beginning or ending. Little is resolved and the film's climax is subtle. The villain of the first two chapters and the overall series, the dreaded Voldemort, is absent. His apparent replacement is Sirius Black, although appearances can be deceiving.And in a runtime of this length the film had little progression to the overall Potter story. Oh sure - moments of character development occurs. We learn a few things about Harry's background. The Malfoy/Potter feud enters another chapter. Some new characters are introduced. And we see the beginnings of a tentative affection between Ron and Hermione. But pretty randomly the film stars experience with time travel and, just out of the blue, begins to play modestly with deja vu feelings. The ""feel"" is totally different in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" from its predecessors, thus blame this to the account of change in directors.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but hoping for better","This is a good movie...but I really was hoping for it to be AMAZING...I think that Cuaron takes a bit too much liberties, especially in the way he has changed Hogwarts, and he cuts some parts that would have slowed the pace down a bit but that are really important...(Harry's patronus shape...who wrote the map...how Sirius knew that Pettigrew was at Hogwarts...Ron & Hermione that don't talk to each other for a while...). Anyway, has I say the movie is good, sometimes extremely good other times less; the kids are growing well in their roles, the choice for Dumbledor is adequate (even if he will always be Richard Harris in my mind), and the new professors also are well choose (especially Lupin)...so let's wait for the fourth one!!!!!!W HP!!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An unfortunate waste of time and money.,"Thus far this was the worst movie in the series. My family and I are staunch readers of the Potter series and were exceedingly disappointed in this movie.

I disagree with putting the Hogwarts students int to ""muggle"" clothing. It takes away from the feel of the movie. Dressing differently is part of the whole package. They are not meant to be like ""us"".I found the acting improved. I think Emma Watson's acting has improved greatly, although a little over acted.

After this movie I believe I will stick to the books and forgo any more of the movies, unless Chris Columbus is directing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A HUGE Disappointment,"I love the Harry Potter books, and I was thrilled with the first two movies. Except for Fawkes, who looks like a musclebound chicken, I thought that the producers had done an amazing job of bringing JK Rowling's vision to the screen. Ieagerly awaited the Prisoner of Azkaban, missed seeing it in the theaters, and finally saw it at home. The best thing I can say about it is that I didn't waste my time and money at the theater. The look of the movie was dark and dreary,which was bad enough, but the children were not in their robes, which wasmuch worse. They looked out of place in their street clothes, especially inside the castle. They didn't wear Muggle clothes to Hogwarts in the first two movies. Why the change? What really ruined the movie for me was the hectic pace andthe holes in the script. The third book had a lot of slow spots where thecharacters just talked-about the past, about Sirius and his relationship with the Potters, about Peter Pettigrew. There was very little explanation in this film. If you read the book you knew what was going on, but if you didn't you were left guessing about a lot of things. I particularly missed Sirius lengthy explanation of his actions after the Potters were killed, and I was surprised that with so many special effects they couldn't squeeze in the picture of Sirius as best man at James' and Lily's wedding. Without Sirius talking to Harry about what reallyhappened, Harry's sudden warming to him seemed forced and unnatural, andwithout explaining what Sirius had done to Snape, Snape still seems like an evil person who doesn't belong at Hogwarts. The bottom line? The characterslooked out of place in their street clothes and with all the holes in the script, they were either operating in the dark or using telepathy. I am looking forward to Rowling's next book, but I doubt I'll be very excited when the next movie comes out.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Darker, but better","The third movie is darker than the past two, but it is better. Director Alfonso Cuarón shows his talents in this film, but I can't say that I honestly mean that he is the most suited director for a movie like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. My feel is that some of the books elements come out wrong, even though this is the best Harry Potter so far. Of course some of this can probably be blamed on scriptwriter Steve Kloves. Some parts of the film seems a bit long, but that's a bit like the book actually.The cast performs good, and I can't say the lack of humor makes the movie worse, I would rather say that it actually cranks it up a notch instead. I read another comment commenting that the Americans don't understand the spoken word in this film and rather wants it dubbed(!). That's in my opinion the worst thing you can do to a movie. Even though Americans seem to like it, along with several European countries (they should all learn to read subtitles). I'm from Norway and we all learn English as a second tongue, how often do we run around shouting to get films dubbed? (just a little statement)Back to the movie: The movie stands well on it's own feet, but if you have read the book the experience is a bit different (sadly, you also miss elements from the books, but when each book grows in size, things got to be cut from the script so the movie doesn't double in length from the previous one.Alfonso is claimed to be a more ""emotional director"", and that's something that shows through the movie, and actually seems to go home with the audience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
That was such an incredible movie!,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was great installment from the book to the movie!! It was funnier and it showed more on Ron and Hermione's relationship!!

I can't wait to see Goblet of Fire next year!!! I hope Mike Newell does a great job on the next installment!! I do hope everyone comes back for the 4th installment!! They are a great cast and they do spectacular job portraying the roles!! One of the funniest scenes in Prisoner of Azkaban was when the aunt was blowing up and her buttons were popping off and hitting Dudley in the face!! The other part was when Harry was on the Knight Bus and the driver stopped quick because the old lady was crossing the road and Harry went flying into the window and his face was sticking to the window!!! there are even more funnier parts but if i write all of them i will be here for hours!!

Okay,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess.

When I read the books the characters look almost to a tee like the actors. The acting is good, Gary Oldman and the actor who plays Lupin do an especially good job.

"Feels more like ""Three Go to Hogwarts"" - no magic.","This film has no sparkle to it.The book which contains Oliver Wood's finest hour has hardly a mention of Quiddich when transferred to screen.The horrifying scene when Ron is attacked in his bed by a maddened Sirius seeking Scabbers/Pettigrew has been dispatched without a backward glance. The knife-slashed curtains have been abandoned as unimportant. Pettigrew never appeared on the Marauder's Map.Hagrid's hut across the lawns at the edge of the Dark Forest somehow manages to cling precariously to the side of a cliff. This will cause MAJOR problems when filming books four and five where important events happen at speed between the castle doors and Hagrid's hut.It must really have taken some doing to make Julie Christie look like a secretary - they couldn't have made Madame Rosemerta look less like a pub landlady if they'd tried. What happened to the 'sparkly high-heels'?!And - for heaven's sake - couldn't some middle ground have been found so that the children could have had a butterbeer in the pub instead of lurking in the doorway?! How are they going to set up the DA (Dumbledore's Army) in 'The Order of the Phoenix' in the 'Hog's Head'? That can't be tampered with - it's a vital part of the plot.And a word about casting - and for this I'm on a planet of my own! Gary Oldman is a wonderful, accomplished actor who puts his heart and soul into everything he does. But Sirius he isn't. Sirius was the last of a long line of aristocrats. He was outrageously goodlooking with easy, graceful manners and abundant self-confidence. Azkaban made him a nervous wreck but it didn't turn the Scarlet Pimpernel into Gary Oldman. It also worries me a bit how they're going to change the nerd in the Mirror of Erised into the Snitch-twirling, show-off James Potter who 'roolz the skool'!I agree that there was a need for a different approach from that Chris Columbus employed - Harry does need to grow up. But he needs to grow up 'magically'. There doesn't seem to be a lot of difference in approach between Uncle Vernon and some of the wizards in PoA the Movie.Lastly, special effects. Why ARE they so patchy in the HP movies? Buckbeak was stupendous - absolutely fantastic. Lupin's werewolf was abominable - it looked like something out of a cheap cartoon. The Dementors are, I think, a matter of opinion. They depend largely on what you saw in your head when you read the book. Personally, I would have found them far more threatening if they had been more like the 'Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come' in the old black and white version of 'Scrooge' (Alister Simm).

This film is certainly not 'Riddikulus'!,"The Prisoner of Azkaban, the third installment from the Harry Potter series written by J.K Rowling and directed by Alfonso Cuarón, is the movie that introduced me to the world of Harry Potter. I had not watched or read any books in the series previous to stumbling upon the dvd for The Prisoner of Azkaban, and as the credits were rolling at the end of the movie, you could see the astonishment and longing in my eyes for more of Harry Potter's story. This movie is truly impeccable, from the special effects, to the actors, to the storyline itself; you could say this was the movie that changed my life as I knew it.The movie opens with a scene that did not stand out to me right away but after watching the entirety of the series once, I went back for a second, third, and fourth viewing and each time I noticed more and more themes and details. Here, I noticed Harry standing up to Dudley (his cousin and childhood bully) when he taunts him and insults his dead parents, rather than keeping silent and repressing his anger, which is what Harry had usually done to comments like that made by Dudley and his parents. This interaction stood out to me because his decision to stand up to Dudley this time, and so early in the storyline, meant that the pattern of Harry's passiveness was broken and he was finally going to defend himself. I don't want to spoil too much of the film for you but you'll notice throughout it that my theory is proven correct.Another reason I fell in love with this movie is the dynamic change in Harry and Hermione's friendship as they get closer. Throughout the whole movie I was hoping and rooting they would become a couple because they would be absolutely perfect for each other. They are complete opposites but their personalities complement each other: Harry is impulsive and very much emotion driven whereas Hermione tends to thoroughly think her decisions through using logic and facts.Let's talk about the production of the movie for a moment, the budget for this film was roughly between $100 and 250 million dollars, and that money was utilized amazingly. The effects in this particular film were a combination of CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery which just means the special effects are created using computer software rather than old fashioned stunts or practical effects-which is the other special effect used. There isn't a lot of CGI used in any of the Harry Potter films because the director Alfonso Cuarón preferred using stunts to add a more sense of realism to the films. In an interview for Harry Potter: Page to Screen, Alfonso is asked why he doesn't utilize CGI and he responds with, ""Low tech has a certain charm, Because when you realize something was done practically instead of digitally. It makes it that much more real."" And that is true, a lot of the film feels very real. For example, the dementors and the patronus that Harry casted looked very realistic, as well as the magical animals; the hippogriff, centaurs, goblins, etc. While we know magic does not exist in the real world, watching the wands light up across the screen, objects whizzing about, and seeing things made accessible by the flick of a wrist makes you feel as though it could be possible in the real world, that it should be possible in the real world.Whilst watching the film The Prisoner of Azkaban, I felt many different emotions but one thing was for sure: this movie would absolutely become a classic and one of my personal favorites. One of my favorite quotes from the film is said by Sirius towards the end, he is speaking to Harry and says, ""The ones that love us never really leave us, and you can find them in here."" As Sirius is saying ""in here"" he touches Harry's heart and it was such a beautiful moment. This film is captured beautifully and the director did not leave out anything key from the books, rather all your favorite details are included and showcased during the film. Overall, I give this film a standing ovation, and I hope it leaves you with the same heartwarming feeling it left me with.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The book was just as great, and if you liked the movie you will most definitely like the book, and I recommend it as well.

"great movie , the evolution to the previous ones is huge .","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third in the franchise, and so far is the best , even if I liked Chris Columbus, the difference the direction of Alfonso Cuaron is huge , the cast is the same, the novelty is the excellent Gary Oldman as Sirius Black , and he is flawless , the direction of Cuarón is great , the film is more beautiful visually , I admit that scared me when I was a kid , the script is better, have fewer problems , the soundtrack is impeccable , the scene with the Gryphon is very good , the scenes are very good , has great moments, like the scene they each face their greatest fears , it's funny , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great film has great moments , not to mention the great cast, the best of the franchise so far .

Humanity at Hogwarts,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" stands out as one of the best films in the franchise, although that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good film. This third chapter in the saga offers a deeper look into Harry's mind, showing his doubts, fears and problems in a way that makes him more human and relatable. Alfonso Cuarón's direction brings a darker and more mature tone, which helps to differentiate this film from previous ones. Despite this, the film still cannot escape the series' flaws, with characters that do not stand out and a plot that continues to seem shallow. For those who are not fans of the franchise, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" can be seen as a high point, but still far from being a memorable or engaging film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not quite as good as the other two, but almost","I love the wonderful casting choices the directors of these films consistently make!  Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny was an inspired choice!  What a hoot.  I wish the filmmakers hadn't cut this film to ribbons, though.  Clearly, there must have been other scenes featuring ""the emmas"" (Watson and Thompson).  In the book, if I remember right, there are lots more sparks that fly between the two.  I wanted to see more of Emma Thompson!  Also, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was absolutely marvelous.  I sure hope he signs on for the future films.  He's always been a favorite of mine, anyway.  I was unfamiliar with David Thewlis, but he was awesome as well as Professor Lupin.  He managed to be weird and slightly menacing as well as a friendly mentor to Harry.  The film felt a bit ""rushed"" as many points were left out (who, for example are Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail, and Prongs??...the only reason I know is that I read the book.  I wonder if those who haven't were completely lost...would it really have taken THAT long to explain who they were???)  Many of the scenes felt rushed and the dialog was a bit contrived to move the plot along.  I know this is often the nature of the translation of books to film; I don't think this film would have suffered had it been 30 minutes longer.  But don't get me wrong.  IT was a fine film and we all enjoyed it.  Yes, it's a bit darker than the others (I was SHOCKED to see many many toddlers in the audience!!  Hello, people??  What are you thinking????  Do you not read?  Every review I've seen warns against taking small children to this as it is quite scary.)  but older elementary kids and up will be fine, for the most part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of three!!!,"As a Harry Potter Fans, this film can really satisfied me. It is full of excitement and fun. The acting of all actors, esp. Daniel and Gary Oldman is great. The story of the film is quite different from the book, but I think the changes are good. They suit the film. My favourite parts of the movie are the sense that Harry and Hermione go back into the past and the conversation between Sirius and Harry, very touching. The music by John Williams is excellent and I really hope that he can get an Oscar nomination. However, if the movie can explain more clearly about the relation between Lupin, Sirius and James,and why Harry's Patronum is Prongs, it will be better. This film is worth seeing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It grew on me...,"The first time I saw POA I was so disappointed I wanted to cry. I've read the books, so the unexplained parts didn't confuse me, but the people I saw the movie with, people who didn't read the book were left clueless. Now, I'm not one of those fans who wanted to see every sentence of the book on the screen, but important parts had been left out, things that needed explanation. If even just a sentence's worth, but should've been made clear. The names on the Marauder's Map meant nothing to those who didn't read the books, as did the reason for Snape wanting revenge on S. Black. The Hogwarts area layout change was quite rattling, although I find myself wishing things would've looked this way in the first two movies. I liked this arrangement better, but the difference was still jarring. The new Dumbledore was another shock, instead of the wise, twinkling, soft spoken old man we got a bit of a goofball. There is something ""off"" about Gambon's Dumbledore, he is a bit too loud for me, but since he had such a small part in this movie I'll wait for seeing him in GOF before I decide I really don't like him. Aside from him I found the entire cast excellent, Radcliffe and Watson more confident in their roles as ever, but poor Rupert Grint got the short end of the stick: he was more of a buffoon than ever. If that kid decides to leave the series I will not be surprised, his character is not treated very well. A pity, I really like him. Thewlis is great as Lupin, Oldman is just like I imagined Sirius, and Spall is delightfully revolting. I would've loved to see more of Alan Rickman, his character is another one not well treated by the screenplay. The rest of the movie is excellent. The music is beautiful, and the Special effects are incredible. The Dementors, the Patronus and Buckbeak simply blew my mind, although I thought the werewolf was a bit of a laugh. All in all, despite my first disappointment I learned to enjoy the movie. It simply grew on me, after I was finally able to slip over the unexplained parts, and just let my eyes go wide at the beauty of it. So this isn't a great movie, but certainly a pretty one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Cuarón was just showing off...,"Alfonso Cuarón claims that the film didn't need to be 3-4hrs long; well I have to admit he may be correct; the only problem is he forgot to explain what the hell was going on?He said that a novel-to-screen adaptation is the Directors viewpoint on how to best tell the story. Well that's fine, but you still need to actually tell the story. Don't you? Not one person, who saw the film, without reading the books, understood what was going on half the time, and the few sub-plots he left in weren't explained in any way, shape or form that could be understood but an outside observer! So doesn't that contradict his whole Directors Viewpoint theory?Cuarón was just showing off his excellent film making skills (No I'm not being sarcastic!) and decided to say F*#K YOU to all the Big Name Hollywood Directors by making a Art-House style Blockbuster, which would have been great, if he had bothered to pay attention to the actual story, instead of just concentrating on all the stupid things he chose to shoot instead!Don't get me wrong they were amazing, but so much time consuming crap was put into the film, that could have been spent on, you know, Harry Potter instead of showing off to the world that he's an excellent director... WE KNOW YOU ARE MATE! YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIRED FOR THE JOB IF YOU WERN'T...He made some excellent & much needed changes to the films, and we all must be grateful for that, but by trying to make a more intelligent film, (Which he did) he robbed us of many wonderful aspect of the Harry Potter world! Things we were all looking forward to being brought to life on the big screen...And as if that wasn't bad enough, he convinced Mike Newell to make GOF (Which is the same size as books 1, 2 & 3, combined) into a 2 1/2 hour movie!?!PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't let him near another Harry Potter film ever again!",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best of a Great Series,"Harry Potter 3 is the best of the series as it, like the book before it, takes on a much more darker tone as Harry finds himself the target of one of Voldemort's loyal supporters, the evil Sirius Black.This more than any in the series before it had the potential to go seriously wrong as this is the first of the Potter stories to really have more threads than the obvious ones of Harry's immediate quest. However Alfonso Cuaron has done a great job of making sure that these endings are ( mostly ) tied up while at the same time making sure that the main story is not slowed down or lagging.The performances of all of the children actors are good, but it is the supporting cast of the adults that really makes this shine. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are great in their return as the vindictive Snape and the rough diamond Hagrid respectively, while Michael Gambon, while not having the same presence as the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore, adds something of a twinkle that Harris seemed to struggle with in number two, perhaps because of his illness. Out of the newbies, David Thewlis is fantastic as Remus J Lupin and Gary Oldman is also very good as the enigmatic Sirius Black.Perhaps the last thing that lifts this movie over the others is the special effects, or rather the lack of them. Cuaron has made the use of magic in this one less like a laser show and it gives the whole thing a more intimate atmosphere instead of the slight heavy-handedness of the first two.Prisoner of Azkaban is a movie that is inundated with great performances that, coupled with great, subtle directing lifts it above the other two. I just hope Goblet of Fire is just as good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing film!!!!,"The third Harry Potter movie is without a doubt the best of the lot. In it, the heroes are revealed from the best sides, showing their unity and love for their neighbors, ingenuity, the ability to objectively assess reality and make informed decisions. The young wizards are no longer children, so they have to face more serious responsibility, they had to prevent the death of several innocent lives. In this part, they learn independence and grow up. At the same time, fascinating scenes and a time-traveling story thought out to the smallest detail amaze the viewer and capture the magical world throughout the entire viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Easily the best one yet,"For the first time I was actually entertained watching a Harry Potter film rather than just impressed.  The first two films in the series were certainly watchable but fatally flawed by their slavish devotion to the books on which they were based.  By trying to exactly replicate the novels, rather than be allowed to exist as movies, the first 2 were suffocated - not allowed to 'breath' as it were - and ended up coming across as merely mechanical exercises rather than entertainment in their own right.""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first time that a Harry Potter film exists for it's own sake rather than as a copy of the book.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves and new director Alfonso Cuaron are clearly not afraid to alienate the 'fans' who can't stand even the slightest deviation.  Here, the story is compressed and details altered in order to make for a better film.  By treating the story as a film rather than an adapted novel, the film is allowed to live.  Scenes flow rather than feeling forced.The acting is uniformly strong, the cast once again made up of Britain best thespians and strong child (now adolecent) actors.The effects are the best yet, owing as much to advances in technology as to their unobtrusive uses here.  Often, effects are 'thrown away' in the background or to the side, rather than highlighted front and center.At times, the story may be too compressed for the uninitiated, but, speaking as a casual Potter fan, I highly enjoyed this film and look forward to the next provided this is the direction they are headed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Good...finally,"At least...something wicked this way comes! finally, a good movie from an Harry Potter books. I live in England at the moment and yesterday I had the possibility to see the pictures. Best things about it: THE DIRECTOR: finally someone that's not scared to change something from the book! Oh don't worry, not BIG changes but that movie isn't only a replicant of the book and this takes the possibility to see the director' s point of view. I don't hate the Columbus' movies but they're TOO stuck on the books! No personality was in the first two movies! THE ACTING: especially daniel Radcliffe, that was very believable, particularly in the anger scenes. Nothing to say about Emma and Rupert: they were good also in the others. Bravo to Gary Oldman and to Twhelis: their characters are well playe by both of them. THE EFFECTS: after the disappointing phoenix of the Chamber I was very frightened about Buckbeak but the special effects team doesn't disappoint me this time. They were also good in creating the Dementors, especially, in making some differences from the Ringwraiths of LOTR THE MUSIC: John Williams knows that something is changed in the story and in the characters so he was able to create some marvellous new theme. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY: the third book is the one where the story grow and it makes in a very dark way...and so the photography of the picture. A very little scene were illuminated by sun; it' s always grey or dark because the story becomes so! This has a reflection also in the location. Hogwarts wasn-'t never so scary! there are also some lacks; I prefer to see more Ron and hermione scenes, especially when the two were quarrel in the books: it's a clear signal of the changing of their feeling for the other one. I hope to explore a little bit more Hogsmeade but this isn't a great mistake. Maybe also the Lumos effect to end a scene is too abused by the director but also this one is a little lack. So enjoy the movie. I gave it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but not great","I went along to this film expecting it to be pretty good. Not because I liked the other films because I only found them OK, nothing special, but because I heard good reviews, the trailers were impressive and because I wanted to see how the new director handled it.This film is a huge improvement on the previous two. The director, Cuarón does a good job. The film has a more stylized look than Harry Potter one and two but it still leaves much to be desired. The CGI was patchy in some areas, and astonishing in others. The Dementors are done well and I managed to watch the whole film without them once reminding me of the black riders from Lord Of The Rings. Which is quite an achievement in itself.The kids have all grown up loads and it suits them better. I didn't think much of the acting in the first film but the trio are on top form in this installment and looking generally cooler whilst doing it! All three are convincing and if certain aspects let down the film, it's not them.I think the problem with converting the Harry Potter films to the big screen is a matter of pacing. The books are so plot orientated that fitting it all in is naturally impossible. This film, like the previous two felt in some areas like a selection of the important bits in the book put into a number of short, individual scenes. However, this is coming from someone who's read the books and is sickening biased towards them so I couldn't speak for those who haven't.Overall I'd say this film was good, but not great. Cuarón is not afraid to change the story, which may annoy some and entertain others. He obviously has a good flair for action and the early sequences with the Knight Bus are fast paced and breath taking. This film is worth seeing and if you liked the first two you'll probably love this. But for the more cynical viewers among us, especially those who have read the books, it might feel like something is missing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The most intimate Potter,"This is a movie which demonstrates big-budget special effects franchises can be about something more.

Harry Potter and The Prisoner of ME!,"I must say I expect a lot from the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise. One thing that concerned me before I went that critics who gave HP1 and HP2 low ratings were now giving HP3 raving reviews.(To all of you Die Hard Harry Potter fans I warn you in advance that this review may be disturbing to your spirit) :)After seeing the movie I must say I was a little disappointed. I know that focus of this movie was a little more darker and now the kids of the movie were now going through puberty but this movie lacks something. First of all it was not as light as the first two movies. Even in scenes were the kids were simply having fun the movie was two dark. But I say it was too dark, because they went for the PG-13 rating (for the kids) instead of making it the fun loving Horror movie that this installment was crying out for.Another thing that concerned me was that J.K.R. gave this movie the thumbs up. Is she not as brilliant as we once assumed. Because as I writer I would have fough harder for the essence of the book to show through in this book.The absolute best thing about this movie was the justaposition of Harry dealing with his own personal demons (Dementors).This movie will do well, because HP has such a huge cult following. But one more movie like this and the HP fans will simply be nerds like the obsessed Stars Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek fans. God forbid that happens. This was the first franchise movie in a while that had a young and old multiracial following, but I felt that was neglected in this movie.I was honestly bored throughout parts of this movie. Oh my GOD they could have shelled out money for a good score. My little brother could have a better score with his 32 key keyboard. It's not liek they don't have the money.I've heard that this new director won 't be a part of HP4 so hopefully the new director doensn't choose to follow in his footsteps because of th critial acclaim.I give this movie a 6 out of 10.

'Prisoned' to Watch - Chirs Columbus PLEASE come back!,"Expectations for one of the most exciting story lines in this series is just overwhelming and this movie does not come close. I thought third time lucky would mean another chance at an objective analysis of this movie. No way. Such an ordinary feel for this magical series. I felt imprisoned to watch it with buckbeak providing much needed relief from time to time. One thing that HAS to be mentioned is the evolution of these kid actors. They have almost become adults but so much more could have been done with their talent.Chris Columbus - WHERE ARE YOU?? You left them at a time when they were just beginning to become more interesting. Darn, he would have cracked this story line and made this a $400+ domestic grosser in the US.Another given in this series that is cemented - Hermione will be Ron's gal (especially the scene where she leans on him instead of Harry).

Worst director in the Potter series,"So many things were out of character, and definitely out of pace with the previous movies. I understand that it strays from the book, the whole movie series has a life of its own and it has been great so far, leaving enough surprises to be found in the books for those who didn't get to read them first.Every character lacked identity for the first time in the series, which points NOT to bad acting, but to LOUSY direction. Dumbledore became the kind of school principal that everyone gets to hate too much instead of the wise old man he used to be, from his appearance, his lines, but most than anything his whole screen attitude. Same goes for professor McGonagall, and even Snape seemed less sinister and more fake than any other time.And off to the main characters, Alfonso Cuarón once again managed to try and ""Imprint"" His personal style thinking he is larger than Harry Potter and all of the magic that surrounds it, he added that grim quality which turns every single one of his movies into a ""want to make art even if it spoils the movies"", he gave Harry, Hermione, and Ron a ""bitter"" teenager quality that simply didn't fit. It was amazingly overdone and obviously he tried to hard, there are moments of brilliance among so many lousy embittered moments. Hermione lost her charm, Harry lost his cool and the feel he has in the books, and Ron came out as a completely ""gray"" character and Cuarón relied way too much in his ""pouty"" kind of performance, which in the previous films Columbus managed to make feel natural.Malfoy became just a cartoon in this movie, no opposition whatsoever and even his annoying nature came off out of character and fake.The story is really good even when Cuarón managed to make it a story with very little explanation which made it hard to follow at the start in his attempt to be ""faster"" in building suspense than Columbus did. Columbus is an artist and a magician in this sense, you don't need such hectic scenes to make a movie get off to a good start, Cuaron instead tried to give it a caotic and frantic kind of beginning which fell so very out of place.I'll buy the movie as well, since it's magically saved by the storyline, but it was a huge mistake to select this ""wanna-be artist"" director who is all the time trying to glofify himself at the cost of a very expensive, very awaited and very good movie.All in all it gets a 7 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Too fast, Too cut, Too short","This is hard to post this, but I'm disappointed with the third film. Oh, don't get me wrong, the style, the acting, the mood, the intensity and visauls... all were simply awesome, best yet in fact! I was even able to get past some of the major discontinuities.However, this film was paced too fast, almost as if everyone was over caffienated. All the scenes felt rushed. Very little was explained, too little detail, too many jumps from one scene to another - disjointed, not smooth.I mean, the film went from fall to spring (as evidenced by the Womping willow dropping, and then getting its leaves back) in less than 15 minutes by the clock! Think about it, 6 months of the school year went by in 1/8 of the film!! Rushed, rushed, rushed.They also changed the ambient ""situationals"" of several of the scenes, apparently all in an effort to get through this film as fast as possible.And finally, I think the smoking gun, is this film is 15 minutes shorter than the first two films, yet the story is longer and more complex. Why did they cut out so much? What were they thinking?No mention of Moony Padfoot, Wormtail?!!From what I can tell, this film basically went from the highlights of every OTHER chapter.Hopefully, upon repeated viewings this film will grow on me. But unlike the first two films, I walked out of the theatre feeling cheated. This film deserved to be 30 minutes longer. When the film came to an end.. my feeling was, ""that's it, it's over?""I think it obviously comes down to a combination of direction and editing. Was Alfonso on speed? Sure seems like it to me.Hopefully, they will come out with an extended version at some point, assuming they filmed more critical scenes. Please oh please, lets pray they did!Hopefully the new director, Mike Newell will do a better job for the fourth film, which is even more demanding of complexity, detail, pacing, and length.P.S.

Follow the Money with Warner Bros?,"Watching HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban is like having the suits in Hollywood tell you a bedtime story. --They always bring it back to the bottom line where THEY live happily ever after. It's not the story. It's not the art. It's certainly not the fans... It's just the money, the whole money and nothing but the money. Harry Potter is the biggest cash cow in the history of entertainment in any medium, and Warner Bros. has a good grip.It has only been a few years that the big studios have discovered that ""value added"" DVDs are the best thing for bottom lines since popcorn. This revelation has led to 3 (three!) separate releases of the Rings Trilogy (so far) -- each with successively more ""value"" treats: footage, making-of's, documentaries, voice-track commentaries, stills, etc.The first 2 HP movies have so far only been sold as the theatrical release DVD. But we have seen the ad photos of the ""value added"" versions. They'll be here soon. And we've seen a new edited version of SS/PS on NBC once (but not in their re-broadcast.) This means it is worth more $ as a DVD than NBC could afford. It also means that by movie 3 (and probably 2) they shot at least 1 and probably 3 hours of narrative footage to be re-edited into a PLATINUM or TITANIUM edition sometime in 2006. It means that the story holes in the theatrical release will be filled in to be enjoyed in the comfort of our own homes. It means the unexplained character shifts will be revealed as more deliberate and thoughtful acting choices. It means we might see Paul Whitehouse after all..And it means Goblet of Fire will be shot as a 5-6 hour movie, released as a 2:20 movie with plot gaps and missing characters. It means we will all buy the theatrical release on DVD; then we will buy the Extended Version DVD; then we will buy the I-VII set on 23 DVDs in an album with ruminations and interviews with long dead or retired Brit actors. It means that the movies we stand in line to see in the theaters will never be the whole movies, or the ""real"" movies -- and certainly not the best Hollywood can do. Warners will save that for the Diamond Anniversary Collection in 2050.Did I enjoy PoA? The look was artful. The jack-in-a-box motif was arty and the stuff flying-monkey-nightmares are made of. The little bird was distracting. The kids are learning to act. The spectacle is spectacular and finally treats HP as something other than the mangey illegitimate cousin of the Lord of the Rings.And the actual story has been clipped so tight that many of the reasons we love Rowling's stories have ended up in the ash can -- or more likely, in carefully noted files waiting to be re-edited into the movie for another release on DVD.I don't mind Hollywood making money. I like it. It means more movies. More spectacle! More stories! Business really is a good thing. But in Hollywood, passion for profit is only as good as its passion for story-telling.I also don't mind a movie short enough that we can all sit through it without too many bathroom breaks. Nobody wants to miss an important scene.... but we wouldn't have traded a minute of the 3-hours-is-not-enough Battle for HelmsDeep. And I don't look forward to to trading bathroom-comfort for the whole Goblet of Fire Tri-Wizard Tournament, the Christmas Ball, or the Quidditch World Cup.Yet, somehow, we know that is what we can expect. Warners will spend more money on the next HP film than has ever been spent on a motion picture -- but when we go to the theater for its release, we will only see about half of what what intended to be the final film. The rest will require a second purchase -- and a third and fourth.If this were McDonalds, we would be buying the bun first, then going back and paying 3 times as much for the meat -- three times that for the cheese and pickles -- and then we'd need to drive through and pay double again to get katsup and onions. Or we could wait until tomorrow and buy it all again -- frozen -- and pay them again to slap it in the microwave.It sounds like a really good idea if all they're interested in is milking the cash cow for all they can get. But if they're out to make an honest dollar, to satisfy customers, to offer value for $, or to offer people something they can enjoy with a smile, then maybe they should reconsider. A great movie -- will get repeat customers. A great DVD of the full version of the movie with value-added treats will sell beyond expectation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Potter Film: Alfonso Delivers,"I had my doubts about this film when I learned that Alfonso Cuaron was to take the director's chair, but they proved to be completely irrational. This film is easily the best of the Potters, excelling in nearly every area. Alfonso brings a new, very spooky quality to the film franchise that was much needed. His new Hogwarts set is perfect for the third film, which was meant to be dark and different. For instance, the pumpkin patch and the ""floating"" walkway give off a very mystical and Halloween-ish aura. In addition, Cuaron and the set designers actually reinforced the themes of the film in every aspect. The newly designed gears and clock chime in the castle reinforce time, which is of utmost importance in the film. Also worth mentioning is the overall look of the characters and visuals.The special effects of the third film far surpass those of the first and second, erasing all traces of cheese and campiness. The Whomping Willow scene with Harry and Hermione looks incredibly real, and is very exciting. The dementors are also incredibly creepy looking, which is the perfect effect for them. I also liked what was done with the students themselves. Instead of walking around in their school robes and looking incredibly dorky, Harry, Hermione, and Ron dress and act like normal teens, simply thrust into the wizarding world. Their lines reinforce this as well. I found it especially comical when Hermione sees herself outside of Hagrid's hut, remarking ""Does my hair really look like that from the back?"" Overall, this third film is ingenious, blending fantasy spookiness with typical teen behavior. A masterpiece on nearly every level.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disagree with review,"I could not disagree more with the review done by ladypythia. I am a humongous Harry Potter fan and was not disappointed. Granted some plot points were left out of the movie. However this is the fault of the studio who insisted on cutting and cutting, and the fault of the people who chose a person who was not interested in the Harry Potter world to direct. Cuaron did a good job, but had never even read the books before being asked to direct. He could have made the movie more all inclusive and from what I heard he did shoot more footage, but it all got cut. All in all I think what you get here is the best harry potter movie of the three in spite of all this. The mood that was created was better than the others and it sets the tone for the fourth movie which should be longer and more inclusive. Also, the issues that were left out are for the die hard harry potter fans, but for those who just want to see the movie and keep up they wont sit through a 3 and a half hour movie. So it had to be left with what it was to ensure that it would appeal to a broader spectrum of viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pretty good, pretty disappointing without a book","So, my fiancé and I wanted to rewatch the Harry Potter movies, so here we go! We felt liked we'd watched the first and second movies recently, so we are going to start with number 3.And I have to say I remember this as better. In hindsight, I think it's mostly because I was told this is the best movie that I told myself it had to be. Now that I see it again, there are a few things I'm not the biggest fan of. I haven't read the books, and I feel like there are scenes and elements here that will hit you a million times more if you have the books to fall back on. I simply don't have time to fall in love with these new characters because they are barely in the movie. Keep in mind, this is a long movie already, but I really need to be even longer in order to flesh out its plot and characters and even fix its plot elements that aren't explained here like the marauders, Harry seeing his dad and the entire time turner thing. This really needed more to really make more sense to me.After the Dursley's throw out Harry, he returns to Hogwarts. This year won't be quite, though, as a serial killer is on the loose. The infamous Serious Black.It's interesting to see how the kid actors grow ever so slowly. The standards of the main trios acting has risen a fair bit, and there are some great moments from Daniel Radcliffe in this movie. There are also some awful bits, but overall you would be satisfied with the acting. The kids are outshined by the adults, though! Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, David Thewlis all really giving power house performances here. It can be a bit distracting how much better the adults are, but I think the acting is solid.The biggest problem of this movie is what happens to any book turned movie. How do we tell a long story over a short while. Sure the story is fun and whimsical and there is some great set up, but before you know it's set up, it can feel a bit forced and the beginning of the movie can feel directionless, like there is no plot until the movie needs one. Furthermore, there are some grave context issues we, the movie audience, won't get without book context. Who and what are the marauders? Why are their names that? Who are they exactly? Why does Harry see his dad later? What is a time turner, and how does it work? There are too many elements not explained well, and this movie is long enough as it is. But it really needs more time to tell the story it wants to tell. I need to care about these important characters that will be even more important as the franchise goes on, but I am really not given much here to fall in love with important characters.Other than that, the plot is solid enough. Nothing special, but nothing bad. I must also say the time turner elements are well handled here. It is a good mystery plot that is revealed bit by bit and I find it really entertaining to see all the things set up, come back in bigger or smaller ways, even though the last twist is a bit rushed.The music for this movie is excellent, but that makes sense when John Williams is behind it. The movie has so many moods and shifts, and the music scores them all perfectly. I really liked the marauders map theme in particular!The overall magical world is also presented well here. I really love the different sets like the candy store and when you find out it's actually real it makes it even better! The atmosphere is in general fantastic here. The same with the creature designs, sure some of the effects have aged a bit purely and don't hold up, not speaking of some pure green screen at times. But the designs of the hippogriff and the dementors are incredible, and I feel like they hold up to this day.Harry Potter will no matter what be a big part of my childhood, and no matter my cynicism will always bring a smile to my face. As said, I returned to this movie remembering it as better, but It's most likely an effect of surrounding people telling you it's the best. It's well directed, well shot, and the execution is pretty good, but the story is rushed and isn't as impactful as it really should be. I haven't read the books and the context clues needed to make movie elements make just the slightest bit of sense just isn't here, and to me that's too bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off for a more adult stage for the series, without abandoning the fantasy elements and new Hogwarts","Alfonso Cuarón brought a different look and very pleased that the fans of the books, making The Prisoner of Azkaban, one of the most difficult and complex, one of the most lauded films of the franchise. The Mexican let go once the weather over the first two children and put Harry and the other students at Hogwarts during adolescence, leaving the plot darker, realistic, complex and dangerous. Everything is more compatible with the arrival of the main characters and the secondary stage of adolescence. Cuarón added more pace, humor and especially the adventure to the film, and the story flows without major interruptions. The direction leads to Harry Potter themes denser and deep, stirring with the past of the boy and bringing feelings such as anger, forgiveness and fear.This is the first film in the series that the script is extremely faithful to the book. Steve Kloves certainly faced a huge challenge since had a much more complex material at hand. He would have to deal with back and forth in time and several new elements without confusing the viewer, especially those who have not read the book. The Prisoner of Azkaban is the shortest film of Harry Potter, but his time perfectly encompasses the story, which always progresses. The film does not have many action scenes but that there are very well made, but in compensation the suspense is uninterrupted. Even being considered as an adaptation made to the letter, only a few facts are noticed really, as details of his father's friendship with Harry Lupin, Pettigrew and Sirius and his relationship with Severus Snape, the film is also not what it was for the house the screams, the film changes very quickly from Harry opinion on Sirius (one hour Harry thinks he will kill him and soon after already want to live with him). In the book they have a great conversation about everything that happened, in the film, Harry wins the Firebolt broom in the final scenes. In the book, he gets in the middle of the school year, when Harry did not even know him.
Many other elements are shown with anticipated mastery by production designer Stuart Craig, who had to worry about creating many other environments for The Prisoner of Azkaban. The Knight Bus arrives on the scene providing comic relief and to introduce to the protagonist about Sirius Black, who had escaped from Azkaban, taken as a maximum security prison in the wizarding world. The visual external and internal bus is full of details described in the books. We first representation in theaters at the Leaky Cauldron, many new environments of Hogwarts Castle as the new Hagrid's hut, located in different location of the first two films, scenarios for Divination Professor Trelawney and Professor Lupin, external scenarios never before explored in films like Hogwarts and where patios are managed aulasde Hagrid, the Shrieking Shack, further exploration scenarios in the forest, and the complex construction of the town of Hogsmeade. Often it seems like we are somewhere else and not in Hogwarts since explored many other local school and let practically the same as the previous films. For example, in one scenario, a source close to the entrance of Hogwarts, there are several statues of eagles eating snakes, which is a reference to Alfonso Cuarón and art direction did the image that appears on the flag of your country director, Mexico.Another point I noticed a sudden change to the previous movies is the issue of costumes created by Jany Temime. In class students are the uniforms, but we have noted a more modern style in order to dress these uniforms by students, with looser ties and different lengths, in addition to shirts out of pants in various characters. Already in the scenes that take place outside the classroom (which correspond to most of the scenes) are not all uniform, modern clothes for teenagers. The change is also reflected in the personality of the characters.If before the Goblin, the Three Headed Dog and even the house-elf Dobby (when compared to the perfection of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings) were heavily criticized, this production marks a revolution in the Harry Potter series in relation to visual effects. As before, several creatures were created with quality not seen in the first film. The look of the Dementors expresses very well what are the creatures. To get an idea, the special effects team took six months to create the final look of the guards of Azkaban. All scenes involving creatures are very high points of the film bringing great moments of apprehension. The animated rat Scabbers, filling Aunt Marge, and the creation of Buckbeak the Hippogriff flight with Harry, and especially the creation of Sinister and werewolf. The transformation of Lupin in werewolf close is one of the best parts of effects, as well as the movement of the creatures in the forest at night. The Whomping Willow had already aprecido especially in the earlier film, appears again excited competently and intelligently used marking the passage of time during the third school year of Harry at Hogwarts. No wonder that the film received an Oscar nomination in the category, losing the award to Spider-Man 2.John Williams composed the track again, but it does not shine as before. The track is interesting, goes well with the mood tenser and loaded and engages the viewer again, so much so that Williams was nominated again for an Oscar for best soundtrack, losing to Polish by Jan AP Kaczmarek track In Search of Neverland.
Cuarón uses photography darker and more gothic monuments (such as the statues in the yards of Hogwarts), and panoramic images and more open to show the grandeur of the scenery and to increase the suspense. There are scenes with gray skies and torrential rain, many night scenes and a few scenes with daytime sun. Cuaron also imparts a great pace to the film. The opening scene at the Dursleys, for example, is fast, but well defines Harry and his teenage side and contesting. The Mexican category is also given on plans drawn up throughout the film, which prioritize more outdoor scenes than impressive sceneries. The way Cuaron presents Dumbledore being played by a new actor comes with an expectation until he appears. We have to notice the train that takes students to Hogwarts through the rain, the movement of the camera during the fight with the werewolf Lupin as Sinister, always far away in the shadows, or the climactic scene near the lake when Patronum is conjured by someone mysterious when Harry and Sirius were surrounded by dangerous Dementors. Another scene worth mentioning is when Harry and Hermione set out to try to change the events using the setback. The camera shows them leaving the room, through the window of the school nurse and came when the two come running in the schoolyard below. The same movement occurs when they return to the same place, with the camera following the arrival in the courtyard, up and through the window, until they reached the room. Sequences are simple but well prepared and daring on the part of the director. Cuaron also has some amusing moments. The passage of the Knight Bus, or the scene where the maid of the Leaky Cauldron opens the door and comes a roar powerful, she says: ""I'll be back later,"" like a trivial, normal event (normal to the wizarding world). We also have the Marauder's Map, magical artifact useful for Harry.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off for a more adult stage for the series, which has benefited from the addition of Alfonso Cuaron who brought a new look, more realistic and copyright, which eventually became one of the most difficult films to be adapted a favorite for fans of Harry Potter. A film visually beautiful but different from the others in the series who knew better develop the characters and move past the protagonist, and rely on special effects very well done. All this without abandoning the fantasy elements and new Hogwarts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A decent film but still lacking,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is part of the highest caliber in literature. One that not only appeals to every age group; but shines with an excellent storyline full of plot twists and imagination. This book is part of the current most popular book series that has possibly ever existed. It is expected that the film interpretation of this book would be critically acclaimed with cleverness and great appeal to all audiences. Unfortunately this is not the case.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is directed by Alfonso Cuarón. After the first two movies were directed by Chris Columbus it seemed that films were not good enough for the plus- 10 million dollars that he was being paid. This turned out to be a dreadful mistake on Warner Brothers part. Alfonso Cuarón was definitely the bad choice to head the multi million dollar production that is ""The prisoner of Azkaban"". It is still questioned why Cuarón was hired for this job with his mere credentials being several low budget films, The Little Princess and the very disturbing Y Tu Mama Tabien. Cuarón brought his very unusual styles of directing to the mix. He adds very unusual cuts and makes a sub-par interpretation that would make writer J.K. Rowling ashamed. He doesn't bring the appropriate seriousness to the film as it often seems like a joke.The film begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) now 13 years old, starting his third year at Hogwarts. The wizarding world has been shaken up, due to the recent escape of Sirius Black from the wizarding prison of Azkaban. The significance of Black is that he was the person convicted of leading the dark Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents. It is believed that he is bent on finishing his task by killing Harry as well. Adding to Harry's troubles are phantom like creatures called Dementors. These heartless beings are sent to guard Hogwarts from Sirius Black. With all the stress of these terrifying beings and the person who gave away his parents location which lead to their death; Harry has become angry. No longer a helpless child Harry has grown up to become a darker and more powerful person.Harry reunites with his two best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) to continue the wonders of Hogwarts Wizarding School. Harry is helped by the new defense against the dark arts teach Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to learn to defend himself against Sirius Black and the treacherous Dementors. Harry doesn't ever seem to catch a break as his troubles only get worse.The movie overall is decent, the acting is surprisingly good for the young actors and the more experienced actors Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Gary Oldman all do terrific jobs of portraying their characters. However after the death of Richard Harris the role of Dumbledore was given to Micheal Gambon. Gambon however does in my opinion an inaccurate portrayal of the Headmaster failing to show the wisdom and care that Harris brought to the screen. Even so his appearances in the book are minimal as he does not affect the film in a big way. The CGI effects in this movie are excellent as the visual effects seem to get better and better. The realism in the broomstick flying and the creatures are phenomenal and the effects team deserves a pat on the back. Overall this movie is worth seeing for any Harry Potter fan, and should appeal for the average person to see it at least once. Unfortunately is seems like the opportunity to make a great film was squandered by Director Alfonso Cuarón and it is disappointing to watch and think ""what could have been a great movie""",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
How Could They Allow This Terrible Potter Sequel?,"I disliked this movie enough to write a review on it. I want to start out by saying I have been an unsuspecting fan of the Harry Potter Books. I picked one up as a test, and couldn't put any of them down since.If you liked the books and remember any of the content in Prisoner of Azkaban, you will find this movie insulting. They added dialogue that wasn't remotely like the book, focused on unnecessary special effects that did nothing for the movie, and worst of all, there was ZERO, ""I mean zero"" character development.There is a scene with a creature called a ""Hippogriff"" that depicts Malfoy just exploding verbally at the creature, with no impetus whatsoever. The two people and I who went, were staring at the screen like ""did I just miss something?""The random jumping of scenes and character moods was so un-potteresque that I am intrigued that they got away with releasing the movie. I would think that JK Rowling would be very angered by this movie. She has done an incredible job on her books, and this movie is just stupid.I realize that there was a lot of ground to cover in this movie, and I was wondering if that lead to the destruction of the actual storyline, but if that was the case, they should have broken the movies up differently as they did in ""Lord Of The Rings""I know I am probably biased by reading the books first and comparing them to the movie, so maybe I just can't step far enough away to appreciate this movie for what it is. But that isn't my fault. I loved the books, and so did millions of people.So in closing I beg the true ""Potter"" fans who read this to skip it. Wait for it on free TV, don't even rent it on video. Sorry to squash this movie so hard, I really wanted it to be good. But it was terrible. If I have to give one good note on closing of this review, I would say the special effects were very good.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter!!!!!,"Hey there. I've read all of the current Harry Potter books, and being in my late 50s didn't spoil the fun for me one bit. In fact I have a huge crush on Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Oh, I love Harry too, Daniel is a real cutey but, I feel so much for the Weasleys, all of them, because of how the horribleMalfoys treat all. It was like when I was a little girl and watched ""Peter Pan"" on TV for the first time, it was a play, and Mary Martin played Peter. That didn't matter, it was the adventure of it all that got me into wanting to read everything and anything I could on those sorts of adventures. Anything that took you away from everyday reality and lead you into another world! I never thought that I would actually get hooked on the Harry Potter books, but a young boy that I was baby-sitting for had gotten the book I think it was ""The Goblet of Fire"", for a Christmas present, and left it over my house for me to read. After I was through, I was thoroughly hooked. I had a sad feeling that the production wouldn't, no, couldn't be as magical as the books were. I thank heaven that I was wrong! To me it is right up there with the thrilling ""Matrix"" series. Yes, I say honestly that I love the Harry Potter movies, and I have seen them all to date, just as much as I loved, ""The Jungle Book"", the ""Star Trek"" series and the movies, the ""Star Wars"" movies, ""Blade Runner"", The TV series, ""Farscape"", ""The X-Files"", ""Star-Gate"", the movie and the series! I could go on and on, 'cause I am a SciFi fanatic! I even loved ""A Wrinkle in Time"", and if you haven't read that book, I really think that you should!!! You wouldn't be sorry! I loved Gary Oldman in Bram Stoker's Dracula, of course, but even more, I loved him in ""The Fifth Element""!!! Zorg was a fantastic character for him to play, and he played him to the hilt! I watch any movie that he is in, when it comes on TV, (He is one of my favorite actors, next to Mickey Rourke, you know)? I also love Jason Isaacs in his part, Malfoy, he is so sleazy, and mean. So different than he was as Mr. Darling and so good as Captain Hook! Or in Resident Evil, which are the only other parts I remember him in! Oh my daughter, Cherokee just told me he was in Elektra!!! Another great movie. I loved Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I'll miss him. I do think that Michael Gambon is doing a wonderful job replacing him. Many people I talked to didn't know the difference, but then they aren't videophiles, like my three children and I am!!! Anyway, I just wanted to give ""Kudos"" to the entire cast of all of the Harry Potter movies!!! You've made me so happy to be able to ""get away from it all"" in your cinema world. Thanks J.K. Rowling for the books. True gifts at ten times the price!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It was nice,"Hello! I want to first say that I'm not some twenty year old here to pick apart the movie, just a fifteen year old girl with the common persons review. Well, i liked it. Although it didn't perfectly follow the book (what movie does?) it was good. Here were some things i Didn't like though:The werewolf: He was bald. BALD. Need i say more?Sirius: OK, i loved the actor and all (he was good in the Scarlet Letter) but i think that he didn't do his best. Jim Cavesial (s/p?) would have been better.Dumbledore: I think everyone agrees with me that this Dumbledore sucked. The first one (i don't know the actors names) was better. I got the feeling that he knew EVERYTHING going on. HE was graceful, wise, and refined. This one was dressed as a hobo, had a PONY TAIL IN HIS BEARD and acted clumsily. The first one sort of glided. The second stomped. His hair was short, wavy, and gray. Overall, i hated him. If i were to say the one think i hated in this movie, it was him. Anyone would have been better.Alfanzo: Hated the director. Cristopher Columbus was way better. IT kept shifting to much and left little explanation. My mother, who has never read the books (but seen all the movies) kept asking me what was going on.Hermione: OK, first of all i LOVE emma watson. I just didn't care for her ooc (out of character) comment about her hair""Does my hair really look like that from the back?""Hermione Granger as J.K wrote her would have never , EVER said anything like that. I also don't care for Emmas short hair, and nearly going blonde. Its VERY OOC.Well, thats about it. Everything else was great.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"The original story may not be as wonderful as the first two, but it is the most connotative. To some extent, the film is the best in the series.

"Isn't really faithful to the book compared to the previous movies, but it's fast paced and keeps your attention for the most part","It's a shame some aspect of the movie is missing this time around, at least a lot compared to the previous two movies. Although this movie is missing some scenes I wanted to see from the novel, but I liked the fast pacing of this movie at the same time. But being more faithful to the novel while being fast paced would have been nice. Another thing that bothered me about this movie is the fact that the original actor that played Albus Dumbledore is replaced because of the unfortunate passing away of Richard Harris. The new Dumbledore lacks a lot of aspects that Richard Harris showed while playing the head Wizard of Hogwarts. The new guy simply didn't have the soft and yet someone you should never cross thing going for him, nor did he have that certain look in his eyes that showed wisdom. Yes, for some movies that is based on a book that doesn't go EXACTLY like the book doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. But like I said those scenes would have made this movie much better in my opinion. Even if I didn't read the 3rd book in this franchise and saw this movie after watching the previous two movies. I would have thought something was missing in this movie regardless. I personally thought it could fit a lot of the parts in the book in this movie since this movie isn't close to the 3 hour mark. On a positive note though besides the fast pacing, is how this movie somewhat atones for the stuff that is missing from the book and makes it a bit more lively and actually has a bit of satire. Everything seemed slightly more sharp including the humor. Also addition of Gary Oldman is always a plus.6.9/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Cliff Notes"" version of PoA still pretty good!","How do you fit a 560+ page book into a 2 hr. 20 minute movie? Well, the answer is, you don't. Kloves and Cuaron hacked and slashed the original story down to a barely passable minimum, which will no doubt be somewhat confusing to those who've not read the book. However, the original Prisoner of Azkaban story by author J.K. Rowling is so brilliant that even Kloves and Cuaron couldn't deal it a death blow.Things I liked:They actually did use some of the dialog from the book, word for word. Some of the scenes were exactly as depicted in the book. Performances by most of the supporting adult cast were absolutely 1st rate, especially Thewlis' ""Lupin"", followed closely by Gary Oldman's ""Sirius Black"". Maggie Smith is *always* great as McGonnagal. The CGI ""Buckbeak"" was entirely believable and 1st rate. William's soundtrack (scoring) was, as usual, very, very good.Things I didn't like:Harry's ""Titanic"" moment while riding Buckbeak. Cuaron's infatuation with Watson/Hermione, giving her all of Rupert's/Ron's best lines ... and inventing scenes and lines, just to be able to use her even more. Cuaron's pushing the ""sexual awakening"" aspect of supposed 13 year olds with scenes/comments, which doesn't happen until the 4th book, GoF. Cuaron's ""Blair Witch Project"" cinematography, which made the movie look like it was shot in 8mm film for an independent film fest. Cuaron's ""fades and transitions"", which were distracting, and had an amateurish feel to them. Anyone with a home computer and decent DVD Authoring software could have done better, with a bit of practice. Skipping important scenes, which would've given necessary information about character background, to flesh out the story, making it more poignant.Unlike all the so-called liberal Hollywood types who think Cuaron is brilliant, and that this movie is somehow far superior to the 1st two HP movies, I think that they 1st two movies were brilliant, and that this one is decent enough, given the hacked, choppy feel of it, brought about by Cuaron.As I said, its still good enough, and well worth seeing. It could've been MUCH better, with a better director and better, more fulfilling script. I intend to see it again, just to pick up on nuances I may have missed the 1st time around .. and to experience ""the magic"" of viewing the film with a theater full of Potter Fans.Seven out of ten ... definitely a cut above the ordinary, and, IMHO, better than all 3 LoTRs movies combined (but that's just me).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
New director and a better potter film,"I have to say I thought the first Harry potter film (Harry potter and the philosophers stone) was incredibly rushed and not thought through. It seemed as if the director was in such a rush to get the film on the big screen that he did not take his time to do it. The second (Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets) was better than the first but I still felt it was rushed.Now this film has been done a lot better. The graphics and acting have improved dramatically and the whole new dark feel of the film is what I expected Harry Potter should be like.

Best film of the year so far! Best of the three!,"I saw the film last night with great anticipation, and boy did it deliver! The whole look of the film looks so much better, the uniforms, the style, Hogwarts itself, Cuaron has done a great job too in creating a darker film. The film is rushed and yes there are bits from the book missing but I think Steve Kloves has done a great job in creating a screenplay perfect for the big screen. Remember this is a film and not a book! The problem with the first two was that they were too long especially Chamber of Secrets which, with the deleted scenes felt like  they were trying to film the entire book! This film though is perfect for timing, the Quidditch match is long enough as are the rest of the scenes. Everything rolled out quite nicely. I will see it again most notably for the scene where Ian Brown (ex Stone Roses singer) makes a cameo appearance! He is the first wizard you see in the Leaky Cauldron.

Good Film - Bad Book Conversion,"If I had not read the book before hand I would most certainly not have this lingering feeling that the movie is missing something.On it's own it is a chilling tale and one that is most enjoying to watch.

Beautiful--absolutely breathtaking adaptation.,"I might be the only one who thinks this, but in all honesty I think this is one of the best directed movies of all time. Alfonso Cuarón changed the Harry Potter series forever with his stunning, mature, and rather dark vision of Prisoner of Azkaban. Some of his shots are beautiful, especially when he zooms in and out through the clock tower when the go back in time. He is and extremely creative director and although he only did one Harry Potter movie, he has forever left his mark on the series.The acting from the young trio is also much improved--they seem more comfortable as students in their magical world, and definitely more comfortable as friends. They are growing up and dealing with many new issues and emotions, such as stress, despair, and anger, but also friendship and love. It is really amazing to just watch the entire young cast interact with each other in such a realistic way.The supporting cast is also great, especially the new additions of David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, who tries to be kind and helpful despite his inner torment, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, who, as usual, was flawless in his insane interpretation. Something must also be said for Michael Gamban, who replaced the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and seems to have added a level of seriousness and maturity that goes along with the kids' growing up. Everyone else does a fine job too, but some more that stood out were Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, and Fiona Shaw.However, I cannot say enough about the new vision this gives to the Harry Potter series. Even the landscape has changed to one that's much more wild and untamed, and the use of lighting made the entire film more grey. The costumes, too, are less childish, as the actors in a way got to dress themselves, and it definitely shows. This movie is really fantastic--there's just something about the story that gets to you. It's so imaginative, and really in the end the only enemy is fear itself. Nothing is necessarily defeated, just overcome, yet it is all the satisfying because of this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I thought it was disappointing but my friends enjoyed it,"I'm not sure if my expectations were just too high for the film, but when I left the theater I was left with the ""that's it"" feeling in my stomach. I was so excited to go, I had been waiting for what seemed an eternity to see the third installment of Harry Potter and it just wasn't as good as it could have been. By far the third book is my favorite in the series but the movie cuts out a lot of the personal interaction of the characters (especially Ron and Hermione). The movie just feels like it's moving too fast. One of my friends with whom I saw the movie, had seen both of the other two movies but had not read the books, by the end of the movie he was actually asking us to explain what in the world had happened, he had got entirely lost. This begin said, This movie was be far not the worst movie that I've seen lately. Some of my other friends actually thought that it was really good (although they were disappointed that there was not more Quidditch). I did think that it had superb special effects (as always). I just think that I liked the directing of Christopher Columbus better. Apparently, the fourth movie is going to have still another director so I'm hoping that the it will be better.

Opinion about the movie,"I thought this movie was a pretty good adaption of the book. It had even better graphics than the first two and you could see a more artistic taste to the directing. I thought that in some situations the movie didn't get descriptive enough and through off people who hadn't read the book. Things like not explaining who prongs, padfoot, wormtail and moony confused why they randomly were mentioned. Also when Harry received the Firebolt was a horrible timing and did not flow at all, it made more sense when he was giving it during the quidditch season. I think the movie should've also showed more quidditch scenes because they won the cup this year and there was quite a few chapters on it. I did enjoy the shrieking shack scene, it was very great portray from the book and it was cool to see it on film. I can't wait for this movie to come on DVD so I can buy it.

Very Disappointed,"I'm 16 years old and a very big harry potter fan i have read all of the five books currently written and am very much anticipating the 6th. after watching the third movie, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban i have to say that i was hugely disappointed. this move does not compare with the book, vital scenes were missed from the film which were great in the book. the layout of the castle grounds were changed massively, i feel that this let the film down. Dumbledores character was replaced (i know that this is because of the sad passing of the character who played dumbledores character in the other two movies) but their new actor (Ian Mackelen) i feel does not resemble dumbledore in anyway, the way he dresses, talks and even the small things like his beard. i feel that his acting in the third film does not even compete with the dumbledore who acted in movies one and two. this film for me, is unrealistic and does not come close to the other two moves. yes i know that the other two aren't realistic, obviously, but they made it more realistic that the third. ending was also poor, tiresome and very boring. as the characters go back in time with the timekeeper thing the whole scene becomes repetitive after watching the film for a second time i turned off at this point the rest of the film, i could watch over and over again but when it repeats itself i find myself bored. this part of the story is much better to read than portrayed at the cinema. i can read the third book over and over again enjoying it more than the last. even the whomping willow was changed, instead of having big huge branches and clubs for branches it was thin and looked like a regular tree. i also cant wait for the fourth film to be released, harry potter and the goblet of fire. the special effects should be awesome, i just hope that the fourth film does not let me down as the book is one of my favourites. maybe they should bring in the old director to put back the errors which were made in the third film such as the landscape of the castle.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disjointed and Lame,"I admit to not being a Harry Potter fan but I have seen the other two movies, and found them enjoyable so went to see the new film today.My main problem with the movie is it is so disjointed. It doesn't have a good, steady flow to storyline and jumps around way too much. You never get to see anything in the film play out from beginning to end....you suddenly join the action in progress or jump out of the action right in the middle and are suddenly at the end. I found that extremely annoying and it really hurt the film. Shoe me the whole Quiddich match...don't just join it in progress and stop it when Harry falls without showing how everyone reacted to Harry's fall. Things like this just ruined the flow and made it seem like there were huge plot holes in the film.They also didn't explain things fully in the film. They left out key parts of the book...like why the map was so important...and then would give you a rushed explanation later through character dialogue. If they had explained the map earlier, as well as the adult characters relationships to one another through their history, all the adult characters wouldn't have had to spout, in rapid fire delivery, loads of dialogue to explain their relationships with one another in the Shreiking Shack. Which left many adults in the movie theatre actually saying out loud, ""What the hell?"" and looking confused. If I hadn't read the book I would have been very confused as well which is a problem, you shouldn't have to read the book to enjoy the film. You should be able to at least get an idea of what is going on so you can enjoy it without prior knowledge of the story.Malfoy got very little screen time this time around and I seem to remember him having a lot more to do with the story in the book. The way that this movie made the relationship to Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione and Malfoy look pathetic. It truly made it look like the three were bullying Malfoy and not the other way around. This is not a good thing and I really feel it did his character a dis-service. He doesn't seem as menacing now and you actually start to feel a bit sorry for him because he appears so picked on.I did like the way it showed the surroundings of Hogwarts. The hillsides, lakes, and forests were stunning though, I kept expecting to hear the ""The King from the Golden Hall"", complete with Norwegian fiddle, from the LOTR soundtrack to start playing as the camera swept over the hillsides and forests or orcs to attack them in the forest. I think the director did steal a bit of the countryside idea from LOTR. It was nice to finally see the surroundings of the school because it explained what was so special about it.I also liked the transitions that showed the passing of time. It was done in a really nice way...the owl flying into snowflakes which turn to snow covering the ground....the tree losing one leaf and then suddenly dropping them all. That was well done.The kids playing Potter, Hermione, and Ron are starting to really relax in their roles and grow a little as actors. Especially Daniel Radcliff. I think that they should try to keep the kids in the roles they have as long as they can because it would be a bit jarring to have to recast them. I know that they are quickly growing up so this may be impossible.The Dementors were cool and would appear very scary to small children. The effect of ""sucking the soul"" out of people that they do would also scare small children a lot so it really surprised me that many adults brought their small children to this film. The Dementors and the werewolf would definitely not be good for small children to watch and may give them nightmares.It will be interesting to see where this series goes and how the, even longer, next book will be brought to film. Hopefully, it will not be as disjointed as this one.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually excellent book adaptation; a darker turn for the series,"The third film of the 'Harry Potter' franchise, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a very good fantasy film dealing with wizardry (though, if you are to watch this, you already know what 'Harry Potter' is about). With the change in direction, this film marks a deviation from the more childish style of Chris Columbus first two films, with a darker, more sinister tone employed by Alfonso Cuaron.Following their tradition, however, HP3 is visually terrific and has excellent special effects; in addition to Hogwarts enchanting visage, we now also have the Hogsmeade village to thank for the good photography. Also, much more of Hogwarts is explored now too; even in the books it feels as if we know very little of the place, despite all that happens.The creatures, like Buckbeak and the wraith-like Dementors, bring an eerie brilliance to the screen whenever they appear. Some of their appearances late in the film are great to watch; actually, most of the late portion of the film is excellent.The adult cast is excellent. Michael Gambon respectfully stands to the task of substituting Richard Harris, and both David Thewlis and Gary Oldman (excellent casting choices, by the way) shine in their scenes. The returners from the first two (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Griffiths and Robbie Coltrane, among others) also bring good performances again. Alan Rickman, in special, is excellent; his interactions with Thewlis are some of the movie's best. Emma Thompson is also present now, though she adds little (her character was one of the least interesting to me, and her acting was rather uneventful).The younger cast is the same as before, though admittedly more mature (keeping to the tone of the film). Emma Watson is excellent as a more serious Hermione, a truly promising actress; Rupert Grint is likable and funny, truly capturing the book's image of Ron; and Tom Felton does a good job as Draco (the character's flaws are the same as the books, nothing he could correct).I am not as sure of Daniel Radcliffe, though. He is more mature, and by now it's difficult to think of Harry without thinking of him as the character, but he still lacks a lot in the acting department. There are many good moments that end up lacking in the emotional aspect thanks to his weak acting; he never makes it work on sad, emotional scenes (when he is supposed to be crying, for example), and his facial expressions are often too overdone to the point of hilarity.'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is a remarkable screen adaptation that knows how to play the book's strengths while keeping true to its source (though unfortunately also keeping the book's weaknesses). Knowledge of the first two films/books of the franchise is needed, yes, but that is no problem as the franchise is a very enjoyable one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A refreshing new take on the series.,"The third installment to the Harry Potter series just got better. With a new director on the helm (among other things) the movie and its cast has grown out of its shell and into maturity.The movie is now no longer slow and is no longer trying to impress its audience. It is now more direct and less dragging, with much better and impressive shots from falling leaves to flying umbrellas to silly little blue jays. Almost every detail is rich with color and brilliance, nothing too distracting or too droned out. Each shot has a point and it is sure to make something of it. The film then proceeds to take hold of you for the next two hours and you won't even notice the time fly by.Most of the actors have also improved their presence. With the new director it was refreshing to see the cast do a splendid performance - a performance which definitely surpassed the previous film. Alas, we can't help but feel the absence of several actors in this film but the additions of new ones was thoroughly exciting.Their more relaxed outfits were also a pleasant scene than the previous films which often shows the cast in their ever so black school clothes. Here, the sexuality and maturity of the actors are accented by their clothes and by the complexity of their costumes.Growing out of its shell, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one very delightful journey. A refreshing new take on the series and a brilliant follow up on which Alfonso Cuarón did a magnificent job and surely deserves another take on the helm in the up coming chapters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
fantastic!,"I was surely NOT disappointed when I saw this movie, I thought that the change of director was the best thing that happened to this series. He didn't rely on too many special effects to create such a wonderful adaptation of J.K Rowling's third novel. It's great to see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint have really grown into their roles and I think we can expect even more greater things as each novel is made in the future.The only flaws that I can note is some of the important details from the book that they left out in the movie, I think they could have made it even more fantastic than it already is.Other than that, I'm looking forward to the next installment and the sixth novel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Finally, The Spirit of The Books on Screen","I love the Harry Potter books.  I've read them several times, search obsessively for information about the new books and, yes, went to see the first two movies.  They left me flat.  Yes, they hit the plot points of Rowlings' books, but (in spite of their special effects) they lacked, frankly, the magic.""Azkaban,"" on the other hand, abandons some of the major plot points of the book.  If you are somebody who wants to see the book on screen exactly as it was written, this movie will disappoint you.  Of course, let's not forget that there were plenty of plot points abandoned in the first two movies as well.Anyhow, if you, on the other hand, fell in love with the world of Rowlings' books, this movie is likely to be a delight for you.  There are tons of little details that don't scream out ""LOOK - MAGIC"" (like nearly every magic moment does in the Columbus films) and, as a result really seem magical.Some fine acting from all the cast members - this is the first time that, for my money, the kids really seemed like the characters instead of like children who were just lucky enough to look like the characters.  David Thewlis is an excellent addition to the cast as Professor Lupin.  The scenes with Radcliffe and Thewlis are among the finest in the film.At any rate, I give it a 10 out of 10.  It exceeded my expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
overall displeased..but it grew on me,"i was one of those readers who fell into the magic of hogwarts and loved the childish scenes portrayed in the first two movies. The quiddich scenes, the jovial music and overall juvenile feeling made those first two movies special. Now, with the third movie and a different director, you can expect a very different story. Apparently harry isn't a kid anymore because we aren't allowed to enjoy the movies like we enjoyed the books. not only is there a totally different feel, but the actions in the movie are jittery and some scenes are almost scary. The third movie completely changed the way hogwarts looks and how the grounds look. The new castle has this feeling of darkness, not the overwhelming happiness that harry originally felt by coming to hogwarts. I have seen the movie a few times since the first viewing, and i will admit it has grown on me. The new style is definitely an art, and should be respected. It is just sad to me that the magic of hogwarts will never appear the same..",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Visual magic and excitement,"I just recently watched HP and the Prisoner again this past week, after finishing the latest book. I was struck by how wonderfully magical the filming of this instalment has been created with fade in's (don't see many of those anymore), hilarious bridging scenes with the Whomping Willow, and the clock / time theme throughout. This HP movie has a vivid sense of humour playing against the rapid plot, and a screenplay that does a brilliant job of pulling together all the critical elements of Rowling's story. It's a daunting task to recreate something that has played through so many people's imaginations, but Prisoner has done a fantastic job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
OK,"Even more so than the previous movies, tons of content from the book was completely ripped out for the movie. In addition, more content was added that was not in the book, which the other movies didn't even really do, and this movie had it in bucket loads. Some of the twists were interesting, but at the expense of some of the important scenes in the book, they were unjustified. Although, it may be possible there are many additional scenes on the DVD or something, many of my friends seem to think this was possibly the worst of their movies so far. Personally, I also felt the movie to be a bit shorter than it could have been (length wise) and due to the increasing age bracket they wish to target, I don't see any reason with making it a bit longer than it was.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

This was a very light movie and is suitable for all but the most dangerously sheltered individuals.Things I liked:   Dogs and trees and pictures being intelligent - Emma Watson - Emma Thompson  only one forced smile out of Danny Radcliffe in the whole movie  many things happening in the frame besides what one would @ first notice.Things I had trouble with: Hagrid rolling over on the death of the hippogriff like it was nothing  the scar on the forehead moves  The Peeps in the audience feel somehow compelled to bring infants to the theater  the rat was not very rat like, and when he disappears over the cliff he looks a heck of a lot like a mouse  no foot prints in the snow when Harry attacks Malfoy.Just see it and make up your own mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magicians not to be messed with,"Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2004.OVERVIEWHarry (Radcliffe) and his pals Hermione and Ron (Watson and Grint) are now in their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry when news arrives of the escape from prison of the notorious murderer Sirius Black (Oldman), who is after Harry. ""Protecting"" the students are the Dementors, sinister wraiths that can suck souls from the bodies of their victims. Harry acquires a marauder's map which has special powers that come in handy as the story progresses, especially when a werewolf begins to prowl the grounds. Hagrid (Coltrane) introduces the three friends to Buckbeak, a hippogriff (half bird, half horse), who may be a match for the nocturnal beast. Most of the Hogwarts faculty is back, with some new additions, including Professors Lupin (Thewlis) and Trelawney (Thompson).REVIEW: 3 1/2 Java Mugs out of 4Harry Potter (Radcliffe) transforms an obnoxious dinner guest into a hot-air balloon. Hermione Granger (Watson) lands an uppercut to the jaw of the despicable Draco Malfoy (Felton). These aren't the well-behaved, precocious preteens of the first Harry Potter movie. They, along with their primary audience, are growing into teenagers -- and are not to be messed with.There's an edge to this movie, thanks to the brilliant direction of Cuaron, one of Mexico's bright young movie makers and director of one of the best films to cross the Rio Grande in recent years... Y Tu Mama Tambien.Though the story follows much of the formula of the first two episodes, sharp writing and directing elevate the material beyond author Rowling's rules of order. Especially effective are the tricks with time travel, which can be appreciated even more on a second viewing.Young performers Radcliffe and Grint continue their fine work, but the revelation this time is Watson's portrayal of the smart, assertive Hermione, a character who provides inspiration for young women in the audience and young actresses as well. There's been some talk of bringing on newer, younger child stars for future episodes, but I'd like to see these three actors take the characters into at least their late teens.As for the older players, there seems to be an endless supply of great British character actors who can be called upon to fill any vacancies among the Hogwarts staff. New for this outing is Gambon who capably fills the Dumbledorean robes of the late Richard Harris; Thompson as the hilariously nearsighted tea-leaf reading Sybill Trelawney; Thewlis as Professor Lupin, the Dark Arts Defense teacher with a suspicious surname; and Oldman as the dreaded Sirius Black who is in dogged pursuit of Harry.Shot in England and Scotland, the look of the film complements the mystical material very well, while the computer graphics, animation and the other cinematic ""magic"" add to an enjoyable experience for the entire family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The best Harry Potter movie,"Cuaron puts the vision of a great director in the Harry Potter world, and the result is the most enjoyable film of the saga. The photography and design of the wizarding world is a big plus point of the film: simple but with great meaning and substance. However, the transition of the trio to his teenage version seen somewhat forced, botched. Especially in the dialogues and some situations that seem obvious for this purpose. Yet, some scenes featuring the boys have an interesting force. The acting is not the strong point of the film, as many want to believe, but the cadence and the visual art. Cuaron manages to, however, succeed and provide the most interesting film in the series (even for non-fans)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the New Lease of Life,"Harry Potter is one of those phenomenons that you either get or you don't. Having a little sister who has read all of the books and is properly immersed in Potter-lore I can understand to a certain extent why kids are so enamoured by the boy wizard. I myself have read all the books over the last few years, which I enjoyed even if they were relatively unremarkable.Being a keen film goer I have seen all the Potter films on the big screen and also on DVD. Whilst I could happily sit through the first two films they never particularly grabbed my attention, they seemed more focused on getting over as much of the information from the books than being cinematic entities in their own right. Admittedly the Chamber of Secrets marginally improved upon this but still lacked a voice of it's own. Chris Columbus shouldn't be overly criticised for his Potter offerings, it was a wise choice on his behalf to stay faithful to the books as much as he did or face the consequences of disappointing a sizeable proportion of the worlds child population. As a result of Columbus' offerings Cuaron has a much easier starting position. It is readily established that the cinematic Potter can stand on its own feet, and this allows The Prisoner of Azkaban to spread its wings a little more than its predecessors.It has become clichéd to say the film is darker than the previous outings (see the Lost World: Jurassic Park or Back to the Future II) but in this case it's true, not just in tone but in the look of the film. Hardly a frame goes by where the mise-en-scene is not shrouded in shadow or the action pounded by rain. In terms of the story (many claim Azkaban to be the better of the Potter books) there is an improvement on the first two films, with a significant change to structure, which was already becoming tiresome (welcome to Hogwarts, something strange is going on, quick Harry face Voldemort). Credit here must go to Cloves who was again on screenplay duties, who now seems comfortable enough with the material to be able to steer away from the source more effectively this time around. The result is a much better paced script that is structured more like a film than episodes 1 and 2 which were if anything guilty of being too worthy to the book, which does not make for a good film (Does anyone remember Sphere?).The truncated script is served well by Curaons swift atmospheric direction.Even though Hogwarts had magic in the earlier films Curaons vision of the school is something else altogether more mysterious and often sinister, which suits the storyline and the theme of self discovery, the passage of time and the realisation of the adult world. Curaon and his director of photography Michael Seresin use the camera wonderfully to further evoke these themes. The camera passes through the workings of the Hogwarts tower onto the faces of the main trio on numerous occasions each time effectively reinforcing the narrative not detracting from it. The cinematography allows the audience to become more involved with the events rather than just a voyeur.Despite the shorter running time and general better pacing the principle characters are given more room to grow, we get a much better feeling for the way relationships are developing between the principle trio, especially Ron and Hermione. Unfortunately due to the more streamlined script some of the more interesting elements are left out including any real input by Snape (the always enjoyable Rickman) who is Potters Trump card a character of genuine interest and divided loyalties. Although by sideline some elements of the book it does give the main actors opportunity to shine, the three main kids whilst not outstanding are now much more comfortable with their roles, I genuinely hope for the sake of the films they are not replaced. In terms of the adults both Thewlis and Oldman come out with their reputations as serious actors untarnished, Blacks (Oldman) first encounter with Harry is a genuine standout moment. Also of note is Gabon as Dumbledore who while he does not exert the same ominous presence as Richard Harris provides a much more enjoyable headmaster and a far more likable character.This is however not to say the film is without fault, the Dursleys prologue has now become tiresome (I've heard a rumour they are to be dropped from Potter 4). The first half of the film whilst enjoyable stays too close to the format of the previous films, the major changes only come in the third act. Most disappointing for me however were the dementors, whilst they were an impressive design and had some genuinely creepy moments I thought their potential was somewhat wasted considering the importance of their presence. Although I have sung praise for the shortened script elements which will become of importance in later films have unfortunately been glossed over which may create problems later on but all in all Potter 3 is a highly entertaining family film7 out of 10Oh and before I finish. Those who remember the geography of Hogwarts from the first two film may also be a little confused by the sudden tectonic activity that seems to have afflicted the Hogsmead area. I personally prefer the setting in the stunning Glencoe but some may be perturbed by the lack of continuity, children can however be persuaded it's magic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best so far,"A much better plot, and excellent acting by the three pupils - probably because they are now older and therefore more capable - makes this the best of the series so far.With the setting now firmly established (and surely everybody who sees this has already read the books), the beautifully realized and somewhat extended Hogwarts is now relegated to the background. The mechanics of the wizard world and the operation of the school are all observed, but not laboured, allowing the storytelling to flow more easily.Maybe it is the timing of the release, away from the traditional Christmas slot, but the replacement of Columbus as director makes the whole thing less sweet and, ultimately, more satisfying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
a perfunctory mess,"This time around, I feel that too much of the story was sacrificed in making the film shorter. Characters, especially new ones, are not as fully developed as they should be, and explanations of past events are hurried. Also, I don't feel that enough time was taken to build a feeling of suspense and mystery. I was glad that I had read the book beforehand; otherwise I might have been confused about just who had done what to whom.On the other hand, the film had a darker tone, which will serve its maturing audience (and cast) well.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) enters his third year at Hogwarts, amid perceived threats to his life from the man (Gary Oldman) who escaped from wizard prison.Finally, after two movies they got it right. This chapter catches the spirit of the novels almost perfectly and far better than the previous adaptations. The cast is coming into their characters perfectly, the performances are getting better with each film. The scenes are edited together with much more fluidity than before. This feels like an actual movie and not a screening of scenes from the book. And this film has style; the camera no longer just sits still but moves all over the place. Credit must go to new director, Alfonso Cuaron. Taking over from Chris Columbus, he has succeeded at making a fantasy book look like a fantasy movie and not just a movie with fantasy elements. I hate to see him step down; hopefully he will return for another one. Another welcome addition is Oldman; he is a wonderful actor who plays his few scenes perfectly. My only complaint is the young actor's costumes. It's a bit jarring to see private school students in normal, everyday teen wear.

the best so far,"'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' sees Harry becoming an older and more rebellious character, this time wanting to escape the escape prisoner Sirius Black. In this story, Potter learns even more about his parents and about himself. This story and film is much more darker than the previous two, and although there is too much to fit into the film, the editing was done well to allow the most important parts crucial to the films success. I would recommend reading the book to get more of the depth of the story because some parts had to be cut out completely, and these are no-doubt relevant to what happens later on. Mainly, these were more character-focused scenes to build up the characters rather than action scenes.The film is also less innocent than the original, and there is more detail in the scenes and more character to these scenes. It's very good, and this is a sure winner for Potter fans. Even if you're not a Potter fan, you will enjoy it. Just don't forget to read the books!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Continuity, What Continuity?","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban lacked CONTINUITY with the previous Harry Potter Movies. Taking the reigns from Chris Columbus was a huge task and unfortunately Alfonso Cuaron wasn't up to the task. The first thing that you will notice during is that the cinematography is quite different than the previous movies. I know that the third installment of J.K. Rowling's series was darker than the other two books but Alfonso Cuaron actually made the cinematography darker also. It reminded me of the SciFi movie ""Pitch Black.""Creative differences aside, the Prisoner of Azkaban also lacked the accuracy of the other movies. For example, in the first scene, Harry is reading his text under the sheets using his wand for illumination. Why isn't this a violation of the edict that underage wizards can't use magic outside Hogwarts? Harry's trip on the Knight bus was very good. Harry's arrival at the Leaky Cauldron and meeting with Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic wasn't bad but what happened to Harry's trips to Diagon Alley? It would have been nice to see Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor and Quality Quidditch Supplies and get introduced to the state-of-the-art racing broom, ""The Firebolt."" The Hogwarts Express coach was downsized so much that getting two people, even underage wizards, into the cramped seats seemed almost impossible. What I missed the most was the splendor of the Great Hall. In this movie, it was downplayed so much that it could have been just another room at the castle. It also took me a while to recognize tiny, white-haired Professor Flitwick because he was transformed into a choir conductor with a Prince Valiant haircut and black hair color. I could go on about the lack of continuity. Such as the relocation of the castle and grounds, change in the location of the Gryffindor common room entrance, A new Fat Lady, lack of any real Quidditch matches even though Quidditch played an important part in the book, and a pitiful whomping willow but you get the picture. One of the best scenes in the movie should have been Harry rescuing Sirius from the Dementors. We expect to see a blinding, silvery Stag that charges across the lake to save Sirius. What we get is a silvery image crossing what appears to be an inlet about the width of a small pond shot from a distance. Yes, the flying scenes with Harry and Buckbeak, the hippogriff were great but took too much scene time from the other significant story threads. Like the introduction of Cedric Diggory who will play an important role in The Goblet of Fire. Last but not least, Harry's Firebolt was introduced in the last scene and it looked like it was fitted with ""stirrups!""This was a very disappointing movie. Some critics say that the acting was greatly improved but as fans of Harry Potter I don't think we were expecting performances worthy of ""Citizen Kane"" or the ""Grapes of Wrath."" What we expected is a good fantasy adventure that kids and adults and see together that continues the story about a young wizard learning about his heritage and facing very difficult choices in life. The chain of continuity was badly damaged with this installment. Let's hope the Goblet of Fire can restore it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Soon Harry realizes that things may not go as they planned for him or his friends either.Director Chris Columbus does a fantastic job in portraying this movie from J.K.

Although, it may not portray the book in the exact order of events, but it does indeed give the story fluidity and meaning like Harry Potter has never seen before.The movie does not go along with the book that it is based on, and skips on a lot of major details which is explained in the book. Yet the film does give the book meaning as it deserves. The director could have done a better job on the special effects shown in the movie, especially with the werewolf.

Details left aside,"This installment of the Harry Potter series had many highs and many lows. With the new director you could certainly sense a different feel for the movie. From the opening camera shot that wasn't as clean as the past two, to the beautiful camera angles throughout the movie, Harry Potter 3 had an independent film's artsy quality. The beautiful way in which it was shot aside, this movie was very rushed. I felt many of the important details were left aside and shouldn't have been. The lack of explanation of Lupin and Sirius was the most disappointing. Those of us who have read the books understand their importance, but those who watched this for the first time were left in the dark.There wasn't even the buildup in the movie about Sirius that the book gives its readers. And holes with the map and the fact that the names on it include Harry's father were awful. Now I did enjoy parts of it. The special effects continue to improve, as do the actors, but I feel the true story was lost with this new director. I look forward to a change in the position for the next one. Oh, and one last thing. The new Dumbeldore was insulting. You can't replace Richard Harris, but you can find someone who doesn't make a mockery of the role.

Don't miss!!!,"I think that Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is a great movie. I just watched it.It's the best one from all the Harry Potters I havewatched.I recommend it to all the true members of the story.Almosteverything from the story is in the movie(well not everything,it's impossible).There are also great computer effects(not as good as in ""Lord of the Rings"").The movie is stretched on 2 CD's.Of course if you haven't watched the other 2 of them I don't recommend this one to you.It's not that you won't understand anything,it's just that the feeling isn't the same,so if you want to watch this Harry Potter you better watch the other two movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A completely disappointing film.,"This film style was a turn for the worse in Harry Potter. The filmquality was grainy. It looked like it was shot in the 80's.Taken as a whole it seems to miss the key concepts of the Harry Potterbooks. The books are a coming of age story. They are aboutfriendships. Somehow the movie completely forgot to develop thefriendships at all.The plot felt disjointed. There was no flow to the movie. It was likejumping around the book and reading a paragraph here and a paragraphthere but the dot's didn't connect.By comparison to the previous two HP films, this one strayed from beinga mystery suspense novel and instead was a 2 hour and 15 minute versionof the last 2 minutes of a Scooby Doo episode.Thoroughly disappointed. Bring back Columbus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost a Masterpiece,"Right away, you can tell that a much more talented person directed this. I noticed the better performances from the kids, the camera-work, and the stylized way it ended. You just couldn't ask for a better director. We still get some of the good qualities that made the first two movies into entertaining adventures like the humor, special effects, the musical score, and some likable characters. My favorite character is still Snape but I went on to prefer Prof. Lupin instead, I felt sorry for him at the end. Another character that stood out for me was Buckbeat, he has to be one the most beautiful non-existent creatures to ever be made by CGI.Just when I thought the film was going to be over, there was still more left and it made everything more unpredictable. I was utterly mesmerized and impressed by the last scene with Harry and Hermoine. It made me think and it made me realize what a genius J.K. Rowling is. I really am missing out a lot by not reading these books. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is almost a masterpiece and so far, it's the best of the series and also the most unforgettable.9.5/10Rated PG(scary moments, creature violence, and mild language.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My own review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"So was the latest Harry Potter Installment worth the wait?I would say YES. The film itself is made very well, special effects up to standard and best of all, the scenery was excellent.Surely Alfonso Cuaron has done us proud? Well, Yes and No really. Read on....Standing at 142 minutes, you fail to realize that time has gone so quick. As the credits for the movie rolled, I thought, ""my god, is that it?"". I could have easily sat there for much longer, perhaps the length of a Lord of the Rings movie.The downfall with this movie is that is strays through the book too quickly. At one point, I thought I must have fallen asleep because we got from one section of the book (in the film) to another, within a blink of an eye. So much has been cut from the book and I think this is its downfall. Obviously, for those people who do not read the books, they would not see anything wrong, but for the book fans, some may be disappointed. Major plots in the book are cut into 1-2 minute scenes and some important facts have been missed out. A lot of characters from the book were not used either and those that were, so little time on the screen- ie, Mcgonagall. She was only in a few scenes, as was Dumbledore himself (Michael Gambon--Well done!!) and Snape--compared to the book was hardly present in the movieI give this movie 8 out of 10. For the normal viewers, you will Love this movie, for the fans-- very very good but it felt like a rush to get to the end and there was a lot of plot holes and parts of the book that should have been there",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Do you think that Cuaron actually read the book?,"Because I'm willing to cut the guy some slack if his decision to make Hogwarts and Hogsmeade look like ""prisons"" if it was all just a huge misunderstanding ... i.e. maybe Alfonso Cuaron thought that he was designing sets for Azkaban rather than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or maybe Cuaron got all confused and thought that HARRY was the prisoner of Azkaban, thus designed a bleak setting for the young wizard.This was a bad movie ... poorly acted, characters not ""right,"" choppy editing, no flow at all, and the entire main plot was missing. If I hear one more comment about how this movie was a ""coming of age"" flick for Harry, I'm going to scream. PoA is all about James Potter and his school days ... it's about Harry finding out more about his parents. It is not about adolescent angst. Again, I ask, did Cuaron or even Steve Kloves (screenwriter) for that matter READ THE BOOK?And honestly, who would care whether or not their parents signed permission slips for them to visit Hogsmeade if Hogsmeade actually resembled that awful place Cuaron gave us in PoA? The only place kids could go was the candy shoppe. What was up with making The Three Broomsticks a bar where underage people could not go?Of course Jo Rowling is out there spouting the company line --- ""best of the three"" blah, blah, blah. What can she say other than that? They've allowed her to ""consult"" on the films out of courtesy only, she's already sold the rights ... Warner Bros. could do whatever they wanted with the material now.They should have waited until all seven books were completed to make these movies for several reasons. 1.) A real Harry Potter fan may have grown up and taken on the project with a loving treatment of the material (ala Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh for Lord of the Rings) 2.) It wouldn't be so bad cutting parts out if they actually knew where the story was headed and how it was going to end. It would be a lot easier on fans to watch it then. 3.) Poor Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint would not have been foisted upon us. Those kids need to rethink their career choices ... they stink.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the three made so far,"While I would have liked to see better explanation of the Marauders, I really think this one is a superior movie to the first two. The kids are all getting better, and the CGI this time was wonderful. Buckbeak was breathtaking. The patronus was so well done, and the imagery was just beautiful.Whoever's responsible for casting is to be commended.

"Finally, a real film","Having been deeply disappointed by the first 2 films, which missed the mark utterly despite the great cast and attention to small details, i went in to Azkaban thinking that it couldn't get much worse.. And i was right!Azkaban is a good film, made for all ages, not just 6 year olds, with well-timed (rather than ridiculous unnecessary over-the-top) action scenes countered by plenty of moody and intelligent dialogue. Cuaron manages to build the tension throughout the film, as do the books, and this time Cloves/Cuaron made a good job of condensing a long story into an exciting movie.See it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wasn't able to capture the book's power, but technically remarkable Potter film","As an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, I'm a bit disappointed the very first time I saw it. At first, I find the minimalist approach rather awkward given the ""loud"" first two films. When compared to the experience I had with the book, it lacked the powerful drive of the story. It was also disappointing to find out that they excluded many twists and other amusing details that were found in the book. I thought that the film brought injustice to an avid reader, but I also thought that it was also unjust to undermine the film's quality.The visuals were impressive, and the unique storytelling was a breakthrough in the series. It was certainly better than the first two because it was a sublime Potter movie, a film that may be enjoyed both by children and adults alike. It's quality is close to the films that you see in a critic's top ten of the year; and yes, it can be a critic's fave.I watched the film for the second time, no longer as an avid reader; thereby watching the film just the way it was, as a standalone film without any comparison to the book. The experience was much better this time. Disappointment transformed into amusement and even admiration. There were lots of humor ""bits"" in it and most of them were not easily noticed (some were rather dry actually). They could be found even in scenes where they were least expected. Just let the director take you, and you may find amusement in many of its details. I think that Harry Potter was at last given a chance to show its magnificent and competitive side in this adaptation.Relative to the performances in the first two films, the acting has improved. Harry, Ron, and Hermione owned their characters more. The new Dumbledore was energetic, and I thought he was fascinating although he wasn't able to get the mysterious and gentle side of the late Richard Harris' Dumbledore. Not all acting were very convincing for me, but at least it was much better this time. The direction was great. Alfonso Cuaron gave a sophisticated approach to the film; it was also a film that adults may enjoy too. The musical score was minimalist, and it had many ""little"" tunes in it. Additional themes were composed by John Williams, and I could remember best the music during Buckbeak's flight and the theme during the time when Harry and Lupin were talking about Harry's parents. What I find lacking in the score, however, was a unifying theme given a more varied landscape of music. Speaking of the effects, Buckbeak, the Whooping Willow, and the dementors were the most impressive creations. The downside, however, happened during the werewolf scene. Other than that, the scenes looked vibrant, and they were colored such that they looked less monotonous, as opposed to the palette of the first two films. Hogwarts and the surroundings looked better in this film.The third film improved many things about a Potter movie. It was not close to the book's power but it managed to capture its essence. As a film, it was a bit short to be called a masterpiece, but the production quality was already remarkable for a Potter movie. It could disappoint as many fans as it could, but I think it was generally a good movie to watch. To the avid readers, may a modified viewing approach work on you; but I think this movie will work best on those who have not yet read the book but who have seen the first two films already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Best Harry Potter movie yet, but ...","I have read all the Harry Potter novels so far and I saw the first two movies before I watched 'Prisoner of Azkaban', which is definitely the best Harry Potter movie yet. The acting skills of the youngsters improve steadily, the CGI was nice but not breath-taking and there were some tense and exciting moments. Cuarón did a much better job than Columbus, that's for sure.So far the good news. The whole movie was totally messed up by the worst adaptation I've ever known. It was completely disorderly, unbalanced, indistinct and without any structure. The movie starts way to fast (you only have to blink after Aunt Marge's blowing up or Harry is suddenly in Hogwarts), the mid part is an incoherent pack of randomly taken fragments of the book (with leaving out lots of important stuff and mentioning vague, further unexplained elements: Snape taking over the lessons from Lupin, Trelawney making a creepy prediction) and the end isn't too long but also not very interesting. After Black is saved, Harry suddenly receives a new broom, he flies with it, and BAM! the movie is done ... The pacing was horrible. I also didn't like the 'restyling' of Hogwarts and its students. There weren't hardly any resemblances to the Hogwarts from the first two movies and the school from the third movie. Hagrid's hut is suddenly replaced, there are Stonehenge-like structures, the Wood has a totally different look ... not to mention the fact that the students almost never wear their costumes anymore, contrary to the first two movies.I rated HP1 4/10, HP2 5/10 and this one 6/10 (so maybe number 7 will get a 10/10?)",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great, but not my favorite as it is for most","Plot: After blowing up his aunt Marge, Harry returns back to Hogwarts to find that mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban. Soul sucking beings called dementors are placed all around the school. At first trying to stay away from Sirius as much as possible, Harry soon learns that it was Sirius that sold out his parents location and led to their deaths.Review: Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one is often considered the favorite among most of the viewers. And while I love it, and say it is a rather good adaptation, I still find this to be one of the weaker films in the series. To me, it relies so much on looking nice.Now as a film, this could be the best of all of them, the lighting, direction, acting, and overall production value are amazing. But as an adaptation it falls short, such as the fact that it doesn't explain who the marauders are, and it never explained that Harry dad could turn into a Stag, so when Harry said his dad saved him, it didn't make any sense. So overall it's the best adabtaion we would get for a few more movies, but it needed to explain the back story a little more.This is the first film in the series to get a new director after Columbus, taking over is Alfanso Curon, who definitely knows how to make a film. His style is obvious as the whole way the film looks is definitely darker than the other two. The whole movie is darker as well, with Harry nearly escaping death several times, and finally learning more about how his parents died.This is also the only film in which Voldemort doesn't appear at all. And the first film in which Micheal Gambon plays Dumbledore, replacing the late Richard Harris. A lot of fans hate Gambon as Dumbledore, saying he is too mean and doesn't look the part, but I think he does a pretty good job, just no where near as good as Richard Harris. Granted his beard looked off, but he definitely acted just as quirky as Dumbledore should have.Overall, as a film it's absolutely fantastic, and even as an adaption, it's still pretty good, but it isn't my favorite in the series as others say.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Cuaron skipped the backstory and apparently assumed everyone has read the book,"For anyone who hasn't yet read the book, you'll do yourself no true service by seeing the movie. Harry's interaction with Dumbledore (the school's headmaster) is overwhelming absent. The parts of the story that are filled in by 3rd party dialog or interaction between Harry and other characters is woefully excised and any character development of Hermione dealing with time, her pet cat or her budding relationship with Ron is completely left out. Cuaron's version seems to be directed at hardcore Potter fans who might not mind the How's of the storyline and simply want the MAJOR plot points to fit between the books and the movie adaptation. Columbus' first two versions were true not only to the basic premise that there exists a miniature magician named Harry Potter and that he's cemented into some life and death struggle with the arch villain, Voldemort; those first two films were true to the nuances of the story. They followed the character development and told the backstory so that if you hadn't read the book (as several adults around me hadn't) you could still see the movie and not miss a beat in discussing Harry's life with your eight-year-old nephew or niece. With this installment you would be left to believe that Dementors are ghostly spirits who migrate with pack mentality and that Harry himself could lift off the whole lot of them from Azkaban just by mastering the Patronus curse (the book leans more towards a few Dementors circling him and some other people rather than 30 Dementors). I'm interested to see based on Cuaron's development (or lack thereof) of the Dementors how a future director will handle Dumbledore's assertion regarding who the Dementors will side with in the coming battle when Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge decides to try and hide that Voldemort has returned to human form in book 5 (Order of the Phoenix). Perhaps they are just Biblical demons and Voldemort is the devil incarnate. I like this story because it provides a whole new universe; a new context for fantasy and myths. Cuaron totally dropped the ball on explaining the Dementors and making them less demonic and more of a new type of creature like the books seem to imply they are.The movie further leaves out any back story regarding the difficulty of becoming an AniMagus (as Harry's father, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew did) so that never is Peter or Sirius Black's mystical ability to change into animal form even commented on other than when Ron says something to the effect of ""It's a trap! He's the dog. He's an AniMagus, Harry!"" No mention of why Sirius, James and even Peter decided to work so diligently at this magic trick that requires registry with the Ministry of Magic.Cuaron totally missed the opportunity to present a wonderful and engaging story by throwing in his unseasoned transitions such as Hedwig's flight from Autumn out over the lake and into Winter. Neat transition and I liked seeing Harry behind the clock hands but in my opinion Rowling tells a great story and Cuaron should stop screwing with it just to show that he is a ""visionary.""I saw ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and I liked it. Not something I'd take my nephew to see but it was a decent story with a nice message that it didn't have to smack the viewer in the head with. You got the point at the end. Harry Potter's storyline ain't Cuaron's venue. He's edgy and it works when there is no preconceived ideas or framework into which it needs to fit. Here, in this movie, it blew big chunks of flubberwurms.I liked the acting but the movie got in the way IMO.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fabulous animation! Fabulous acting! Fabulous music!,"Now, I own this movie and one night when I watched it at home, I was fascinated by it. I think that the main soundtrack to it really fits in with the genre. The music sounds like magic! Another thing is, the acting is outstanding especially by Rupert Grint. He's a brilliant actor when it comes to being scared. But my favourite thing about this movie is the animation. The hippogrith that Hagrid owns looks real. The domentors look really freaky and all this clever animations look like it's actually there! But the reason that it lost a mark was because Albus Dumbledore sounds younger than the second and the first and I understand why. Also I thought Dumbledore's last actor was better than his new one. But I still think the movie is fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

It FEELS like the book,"A guy walked straight up to me at the end of the movie and asked what I thought, and I answered right away that it had the exact 'feeling' of the book. It totally felt like 'Prisoner of Azkaban'! Yes, loads (lol) were missing, but I felt none of it during the film... unlike the jarring missing parts of 'Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone', which I still adore none-the-less.There's a part in this book called 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' that I remember my dad reading to me. Something along the lines of that it's hard to write a 100 word paper on an entire building, but one could write a 1,000 word essay on one of it's bricks. I think Cuaron applied this simple, yet very effective lesson to 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. He's done away with trying to cram as much in as possible and fleshed out what otherwise would have withered into faded memory. Just look at what he's done to Daniel Radcliffe. Before, his character was almost forgettable and the fangirls glommed onto Tom Felton and Sean Biggerstaff. Now that Cuaron was able to focus in on Harry and get a stronger performance out of Dan you see thread after thread of girls on the messageboards going completely ga ga over him. It's not just because puberty is unfairly kind to him; he was pleasing to look at even back in 'David Copperfield'. It's because Harry is now a character you can FEEL for. There's something sexy about a tortured character, no matter what their age, and in 'Prisoner of Azkaban' Harry's tortured soul has been amplified threefold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but too much changed/left out","Overall, I didn't mind the movie. I mean, once again, the visual effects, acting etc. were very good. But the most disappointing part was the fact that they changed the set. For example, the books say the Whomping Willow is a tree by itself in the middle of the grounds, and it was in the 1st and 2nd movies, whereas here it was in the middle of the forbidden forest (and even that wasn't scary, eg. where they met Buckbeak). And since when did dementors fly?? Also, i can't believe that the director left out Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup, that is such an amazingly happy and brilliant part of the movie.The acting was once again excellent, however there certainly wasn't nearly enough teaching/classes. And what's with the Patronus being a sheet of white light? I mean, I know we saw Prongs near the end, before Harry goes back in time, but when Harry was actually producing the Patronus, there was no Stag. And speaking of things being left out, or put in in this case... where on earth did the Director get the idea for a choir, and seriously, wasn't Harry's flight on Buckbeak just a bit long. If he'd cut the choir and made the flight a bit shorter, perhaps there would have been more time for the more interesting parts of the movie.Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with The Prisoner of Azkaban. I was expecting the same set as the first, didn't happen (much to most ppl's disgust) and there was way too much information left out. I know they have a time limit, but still... I sincerely hope that for The Goblet of Fire, either 2 movies are made, or they find some way to squeeze all the info into one 2.5hr movie (i'd go the 2 movies myself)!!!Anyways, that's just my view... I did like the movie, but there was too much non-continuance from the first 2, and not enough fun.At a last thought, in the previews, i completely loved the hand of the dementor on the train... but i really didn't think that they were scary, if even a little too close the the Ringwraiths..

Another great Harry Potter installment,"We now come to ""year #3"" of the ""Harry Potter"" films. After inflating his uncle's sister's with his anger and unconscious magical powers after she insults him and his parents. Harry runs away from the Dursleys, and is also afraid he might get expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside the school.Harry took the ""Knight Bus"" to the Leaky Cauldron pub/inn. There, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge tells Harry he will not be expelled. But he was a bit...miffed at Harry for running away, when a supposedly dangerous criminal named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison. Later on, Harry was also informed by Arthur Weasley that Black will likely come after him.Harry journeys to Hogwarts with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. On the train they share a compartment with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, who is sleeping when they enter it. Abruptly, the Hogwarts Express has stopped and a phantom creature called a Dementor boards, searching for Black. The creature has a profound effect on Harry, causing him to faint. Lupin awakens and repels the Dementor. At school, Headmaster Dumbledore informs the Hogwarts students that because Black has escaped, Dementors have been set up around the school as a protection. In addition to Lupin's appointment, Hagrid was also to be the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. As lessons begin, Hermione frequently arrives at their various classes by appearing out of nowhere. Lupin's lessons prove enjoyable, as he teaches useful spells and helps less confident students like Neville Longbottom. However Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class does not go as planned, and on the first day, Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the Hippogriff Buckbeak into attacking him. His father successfully has Buckbeak sentenced to death; those Malfoys really p*** me off! So that's all I could say. You'll have to watch the film and see how it ends. I loved watching Hermione giving Malfoy a slug in the face, and I think Lupin has to be the funnest D.A.D.A teacher. Anyway, the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" goes very well with the first two Harry Potter films; another great installment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not that great,"My wife & I REALLY wanted to like this movie. We really did. We tried as open-mindedly as possible. We finally managed to stay awake for the entire run on our fourth try. The plot is vague, the pace is slow, and the film wanders about in a floundering sort of way. Characters are thrown in at the last minute (eg: Peter Pettigrew) who are immensely important to Harry Potter's life, but about whom the movie manages to make us care just about zero. ""Azkaban"" touches on much but delves into little, including feeble and fleeting flirtations with Hermioine's maturing sense of sexuality (Who's hand is she holding now? Is that HIS neck she's hugging? Why is she wearing that undersized sweatshirt instead of the Hogwarts robe?).The truth is the movie does have some fairish moments. The special effects are fine, especially the bit with the hippogriff, but not exactly breathtaking. Some plot developments are never really explained and, worse, some are utterly unnecessary (to wit a certain professor's alter ego). ""Azkaban"" is unfortunately too sluggish, uninteresting, and globally incoherent to be much fun. We'll probably see ""Goblet of Fire"" but not because of this regrettably forgettable movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I know some people can go into the theatre and love it after never having read the books, but for most, it falls flat without the background the book provides.For the loyalists who constantly say that the movie lacks what the book has, I say, you can't put it all in.

A movie worth seeing again,"This is a movie worth seeing again. I read the book more than 3 times. So I went with the eye of how the book was adapted to a screenplay. The basic storyline was there. But the way it was presented really branched off from the book. Which I found very interesting, but also exciting. I think any true Harry Potter fan would have sat thru a 3 hour Movie, so the movie director could have showed some of the details that were left out like how he really received the Firebolt or how Snape was really involved in the end book. Daniel, Emma and Rupert were superb in this movie. Emma Thompson role as Professor Trelawney was exactly has I pictured from reading the book.

Epic Sequel,"Charming and Extraordinary
As with previous Potter films, this one is wonderful. The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts.Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a slightly different character in this film as the anger inside of him for what happened to his parents has grown over the years. This made, for me, the film much more enjoyable than the first and second.As one would no doubt assume, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the character Sirius Black is nothing less than perfect. However, Sirius Black seams an unlikely roll for the talented Oldman. I enjoyed him more in other films, such as 'The Professional' and 'Immortal Beloved'. Let us hope he has had the chance to 'play it up' a bit more in the much anticipated 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.The original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. Williams has created memorable compositions such as the theme music to 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.Overall, any age should enjoy this film. The visual effects are not the most spectacular I've seen, but fantastic enough to take your imagination away from the real world for 141 minutes. Even the closing credits are kind of cool.Now, go watch the film. You'll be glad you did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

For every kid,"I didn't really wanted to see this movie. Why? Because I was 24 years old student who really grew up from this kind of movies. Luckily, that year I was involved in a project of helping problematic kids. So I had an eleven years old boy to look after. Naturally when we decided to go to the cinema together he was the one to choose the film.I won't describe the joy of the kid and just say that he loved it. As for me, I don't really remember when was the last time I liked a movie that was meant for kids. And maybe it's not because I grown up, but because of the movies that are made. To me this levels with such greats as ""Neverending Story"" ( Only the original) and ""Thursday after rain"". Of course the visual effects of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" are awesome, and the colors are very unique and interesting but these are not the main points. This movie shows creativeness, imagination and kindness of heart which most of the movies lacks.One of the best in it's kind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Did not enjoy as much as the first 2,"I would prefer Chris Columbus to direct the next Harry Potter installment. I found this installment slow and plodding. Everyone says that this installment is darker - well - Duh! - the third book is darker. I found the actors less like they are making new discoveries about themselves as budding wizards and more like bored old pros. Because of this shift, the devil-may-care feel of the first 2 seems to be lost.What seem to be a balance in the first 2 movies between what appealed to adults and to younger viewers was skewed in this movie toward adults.I found myself several times bored and falling asleep during this movie. I look forward to the next episode of Harry Potter - Hope Chris is back.Andy Smith",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst of the Three by far,I will tell you....the third installment goes almost completely away from the book. I was flabbergasted to see the Alfonso was allowed to butcher JK's book as much as he did. It was really sad. As I don't want to ruin the movie for others I will not go into detail except to say that the movie strays from the book on several occasions. There was little to no flow for the first hour of the movie and it seemed like it was a mish mash of scenes just thrown together. All I can say is thank God Alfonso won't be directing any more of the movies. The saddest part is that the acting was so over done that it lacked the punch and the zest of the acting in the first two movies. Even Daniel seemed to be lacking his typical flow.,3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Moose Hole - Review of Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban,"For the first time a film adaptation of one of the series of wildly popular Harry Potter books is presented with the most unaccustomed challenges, ones the previous two ventures had not met up with. First, Chris Columbus, who had directed both the Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, has moved into the producer's chair in order to give Alfonso Cuaron, director of Y Tu Mama Tambien, a chance to take a stab at the fantasy series. Secondly, though the previous feature films had enjoyed fruitful success at the box office during the Thanksgiving holiday, the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first film in the series to open during the summer. Perhaps WB is trying to prove Harry Potter can have just as much success at changing venues as Pixar did last summer with Finding Nemo? Maybe  The most notable change for the series of film adaptations is the particular demographic it is attempting to play to. Though the first film was aimed mainly at the tweener and teenage crowds, the third movie will shift swiftly by aiming for a more mature audience, namely teens and young adults. Will too many changes all at once be too much for this film to handle? There is no doubt its opening weekend will bring in big numbers, so its final evaluation will depend mainly on the reaction of movie-goers and, of most concern to WB executives, the fans.The story once again follows the adventures of young Harry Potter, now a teenager, just as he is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After an incident in which Mr. Dursley's snobbish sister, Marge, is blown up like a balloon after angering Harry, the wizard in training goes on the run and catches a ride aboard a bus, on which he hears about the new danger that threatens his life. For the first time, a man has escaped from Azkaban prison, the place where the wizardry world's most notorious criminals are held and Sirius Black is no different. Word going around was that he was once a trusted friend of the Potter family but unbeknownst to them he was following the dark path of Lord Voldemort, which led him to betray the Potters and reveal to the dark lord their whereabouts. Though Voldemort's following is long since disbanded, his time in Azkaban prison has led him to go mad, swearing to return to the wizard world and finish the task that his master was unable to do  by killing Harry Potter. With Black on the loose and young Harry attending school, dementors, evil creatures which guard Azkaban prison, have descended upon Hogwarts in an effort to capture the madman. But instead of presenting Harry with a finer sense of security, they present a darker threat to him, one in which he must find the light within himself to uncover additional clues needed to unlock his mysterious past. The story for Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban presents not only a continuation of the Harry Potter plot line but is successfully able to mature its stylization and atmosphere along the same lines as the series' continually aging audience. As with the previous two films, the Prisoner of Azkaban never once feels dragged on longer then it should or hurried up too quickly. It leaves the audience feeling at the end as it should, not longing to continue this particular storyline, but anticipating an entirely new adventure in the next adaptation.Though a considerable amount of the cast members from the previous two Potter outings have returned, the younger actors and actresses have gone through a considerable change, namely puberty. This doesn't hurt their performances in any way and actually contributes significantly to the idea of the series of films maturing along with its characters and audience. Daniel Radcliffe's performance will obviously be the one most critics will focus on out of all of the children and they should see a heightening sense of his acting abilities especially as he becomes ever more accustomed to the character he is playing. Depending on whether he will stick around or not, as well as the question of whether there will be, a seventh film, Radcliffe should be able to present one hell of a performance then and his maturing actions can be seen in this film. The most notable addition to the cast, at least to fans of the film series, would Michael Gambon taking on the role of Professor Dumbledore after the recent passing of venerable acting talent Richard Harris. Though his performance doesn't quite match up to Harris', Gambon gives it his best shot and maintains a certain level of charm about the character that had been seen in the previous features. Gary Oldman, notorious for his villainous roles in movies like Bram Stoker's Dracula and Air Force One, slips perfectly into the role of Sirius Black. The only disappointing aspect to his character is that not nearly enough of him is shown in the film as much as the advertisements imply. This isn't necessarily a bad mark against the film, it's actually quite reasonable considering the source on which the film is based on  it's just an annoyance. And Alan Rickman, reprising the role of Professor Snape, presents another amusing performance, though not as seen as the character had been in the previous features.Overall, director Alfonso Cuaron picks up right where Columbus left off but, in the process, stylizes the third adaptation to his own specifications and presents the most mature and darkly toned Potter film yet to grace the screen, which, in the end, makes it all the more spellbinding. With that in mind, those parents whose younger children were little more then skittish through Chamber of Secrets will have greater difficulty getting them through Prisoner of Azkaban despite the shorter time length. The best option is to view the film for yourself prior to finalizing a decision as to whether your child should see it in theaters or wait for them to mature and catch when it arrives on DVD over Christmas break. The dementors alone are enough to creep out even the most confident of adult viewers  what do you think they will do to a sensitive six year old? The rest of the film comes complete with 'jump' moments, murky atmosphere, and ominous musical score which are more then enough to set a little child up for some sleepless nights. So for the most beneficial viewing experience for both the child and the movie-going audience around them please take proper precautions prior to venturing out to the local Cineplex this summer. This is not to say that the film is a horribly frightful experience  in fact for teenagers and young adults it should be quite an entertaining film, with a wonderful blend of slight humor, eerie chills and whimsical fantasy. The only major flaw seen in the film is the level of confusion that is presented when all the pieces of the puzzle come together and the truth about Sirius Black is revealed. It's hard to describe without giving anything away but when it does appear in the film, relatively near the end, be sure to pay attention to details and actions of the characters or else it will leave slightly confused as to what is exactly going on. Other then that, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban fails in its attempt at being one of the bigger surprises of the summer, especially for those who enjoyed the previous two films, but succeeds at being one of the more enjoyable experiences of the season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Michael Gambon,"I was very disappointed in the portrayal of Dumbledore by Gambon. Richard Harris brought dignity and a sense of stature to the role , mainly thru his wardrobe. A wizard in his position should be dressed in grandeur, not in what looks like a night robe and skullcap as portrayed by Gambon. I don't think he changed his clothed once in the movie where Harris had many different robes and hats (all wizard approved). And his dirty fingernails...yuck! He must also use ""just for men"" to remove his white hair and make it gray! Peter O'Toole would have been a better choice and wished those involved would have listened to Harris' family on this matter. From what I see of the previews of the Goblet of Fire, his attire and bathing habits have not changed. D.L.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Finally, a cinematic Harry Potter!","No longer a disney magic kingdom Hogwarts, but a mystical place of the imagination.  Not a rote by the numbers read along with the story film, but a cinematic vision of the book.  Of course there are more differences but the spirit is truer.  It will get harder and harder to keep all the details of each book as the books get longer and longer.  This director took the bull by the horns, wrestled with it, and put his stamp on it.  I find myself so enthralled with his vision that yesterday I just had to visit Hogwarts again and took an extended lunch hour to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 4th time.  Went back to work humming Double Trouble.  I do think that the Mauraders Map and the relationship of Prongs, et al. especially with the shape of the Patronus could have been explicated in just a few more lines with Sirius and the final Lupin scene, and needed to be. But when I compare how rote the other films were, especially the 2nd, and I think of Buck Beak dragging his claw in the loche and the four seasons of the whomping willow, Harry's talks with Lupin, all the details that just melt into the affectionate yet dangerous landscape, well I just sigh with happiness that there is finally a HP movie that I like as much of the books. I had almost given up.  Gets a 92 from me!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best film yet!,"Alfonso has done a fabulous job with the latest installment in Harry's journey. Prisoner of Azkaban has more mature, darker tones than the previous two films and gives glimpse of what is to come in the rest of the books.All the kids have grown as actors over the years and it's obvious in this film how talented they've become. The additions to the cast in David Thewlis, Gary Olman, Timothy Spall, and others are perfect as our favorite characters from the book.For those that have read the books a few things have been changed but the main story lines remain the same. For those that haven't, the story should flow nicely with the previous movies and be easy to understand.If Goblet of Fire continues with the example Cuaron set it's sure to be just as enjoyable!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Film is the Knight Bus,"I was disappointed with this film. Caught up in the Potter excitement, I stayed up to watch the 12:01 am premier, only to find that the whole feeling of the movie was like the Knight's Bus. That is - the movie moved swiftly, allowing for brief passing glimpses of the story, all in order to get to the destination (the scene with Sirius, Pettigrew, Lupin, et. al). While I think the visuals were MUCH better than the previous two, I don't see how anyone who hasn't read the novels could even begin to comprehend the story. I understand that Cuarón felt he didn't need to explain things as it was in the first two movies, I felt no connection with Lupin or Sirius, and felt that the other well established characters were caricatures, not developing individuals. This is not to say that the acting was bad. I think everyone did a fine job, there was just too much emphasis on hitting certain plot points along the way to the climax. My husband described it as picking certain pages from the book and throwing them on the screen, with no previous or following pages to help you understand the significance. Perhaps fewer individual scenes would have been appropriate in order to develop the storyline.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie gives me the creeps.,"I went to the library the other day, ready to pick up my DVD copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when I picked it up though, I swore to myself as I reserved the wrong Harry Potter movie, it was Azkhaban. I didn't really want to see it again. I wasn't sure why, I knew I liked the movie, perhaps it was because I had seen this not too long ago. But nevertheless, I started to watch it again. About half way through, it dawned on me why I wasn't too thrilled to see this again.The Dementors.Seriously, those things scared the WILLIES out of me. Something that sucks your soul out? Nuh-uh. Not for me.Luckily, I knew how this ended, so I kept watching.Dang, maybe I should say something about the movie! OK, HPO and friends go on another magical journey. This time Harry must come face to face with the man who possibly killed his parents! I liked this one (except for the Dementors EEK!) I found it fitfully amusing that David Thewlis, Gary Oldman AND Alan Rickman all threaten each other with sticks, (Let me repeat, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman have it out in a HARRY POTTER MOVIE) and all the kids are great as usual.Great stuff!

Decent fare for non-readers. Some fans will be disappointed.,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) goes through his third year at Hogwarts and has to deal with convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison.Ironic that my favorite of the first three books should prove to be my least favorite movie. Whatever magic and energy is powering this film, it's not Rowling or British. Cuaron is a fine director, but was a bad choice for director. He's too breezy with the material and whips through the plot with not enough of the book's charm. Once the kids get to school, everything gets pretty not fun. The Dementors are wonderful creatures and are done to terrifying effect, but are not explained very coherently and some other vital stuff will be lost to people who didn't read the book.There's some fine humor and dark atmosphere, but a lot of the humor is gags and pratfalls. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Hermione Granger) are sidelined to doing this one routine and are both wasted. In fact a lot of the cast is criminally underused. True, Quidditch has been established as one of the ""gimmicks"" in the series, but this movie could've really been livened up had they included the fantastic Quidditch Final,but Cuaron couldn't be bothered. He was too busy doing long tracking shot after long tracking shot back to the Whomping Willow again and again. We REMEMBER, okay? A line of exposition would suffice to make everyone remember about it.The movie seemed like more of a companion guide to the book. Some of the best things in the book were absent and the magic had more of a creepy ""Day of the Dead"" quality (talking shrunken heads. Why are they all Jamaican?) The kids are acting better. Gary Oldman was good. The movie in general, was good, but disappointing for me as a fan. It seemed like Cuaron found it a chore to be dealt with. Some fans may not mind.

"Wow, and I didn't even LIKE the first two  (***1/2)","I was thoroughly lukewarm on the first two Harry Potter films, and though I was a little intrigued because this new installment was directed by Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""), I still wouldn't say I was looking FORWARD to it.Boy, am I glad I went.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is one of the most thrilling big-screen experiences I've had in quite a while.Harry (a quickly maturing Daniel Radcliffe, and all the better actor for it) is now in his third year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and has just received word that a dangerous murderer named Sirius Black (an enjoyably berserk Gary Oldman) has escaped from prison. Black was a friend of Harry's parents who betrayed them, leading to their deaths, and now he's after Harry.That may sound like a pretty spare story, but it's all the movie needs. From beginning to end, it's one amazing, creative set-piece after another.Maybe I just didn't notice before because I didn't really care for the films, but was Hogwarts School always this beautiful? The grounds of this school are absolutely breathtaking. I'd go to school there in a second.Even though I was intrigued by Cuaron directing the film, I hadn't really expected his style (as opposed to the apple pie non-style of the previous director, Chris Columbus) to have an impact on such a mainstream, multi-million dollar commodity as a Harry Potter film, but I was thankfully wrong. In addition to the more whimsical and amazing visuals, Cuaron actually brings a lean and mean edge to the film. That's right, I said the new Harry Potter film actually has ""edge"". Not a whole lot, but certainly more than the previous films. The story moves quickly (even when it takes its time), it's genuinely exciting and sometimes scary, and what happens to the characters actually seems to MATTER.There's also a rather brilliantly done time-travel twist near the end, which is actually what's responsible for me raising the star rating by half a star.After this rip-roaring, exhilarant film, I'm actively looking forward to the next Harry Potter film, which has never happened before. At least I am if Cuaron's directing it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Darker style,"This film has a darker style than the previous Harry Potter films which really fits the tone of the story.

Good film.,"It was a good film overall. The scenes would occasionally stray away from the book, but heck, remember the Shining? An excellent film, sometimes completely different from Stephen King's version. I'd give the shining 8/10. It was important to show the relationship between Harry and Remus Lupin as the movie did. The trio of friends has grown as well! This probably makes the film more popular for the youngsters! :-D Anyway, the hipogriff was cool. Like I said before, it was a pretty good movie! I just had one problem, I just HATED Gary Oldman as Sirius. I wanted Sirius Black to be at least SOMEWHAT handsome! A charming film, really.

And because more new characters have been brought into the new world of harry potter so over all i give this film 8 out of 10. i would recommend this film to anyone because it has been put together with such skill and perception that it is a masterpiece that every one should have the chance to see such a spectacular film and get pulled into the magical world of harry potter,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Taking things up a notch,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is stronger than its predecessors. Ironically it starts off slow, the very beginning is trivial and a nod to the younger and earlier films before it gets darker and more eventful. Harry and his friends evolve from children into young adults and as they mature so does the story and filming. Curan does a decent job in pulling this film together. We see a very eventful film unfold in the second half. Sirius Black is not whom he seems to be after all and we see some interesting twists and events. The film really takes things up a notch in its final moments. Some themes are well illustrated, we see isolation in certain scenes with Harry. The first two films made it clear that Harry was special and is already well known in the Wizard world. The Prisoner of Azkaban builds on this theme nicely. Harry does have the support of his friends but we are increasingly seeing him take on more responsibility and live up to his magical destiny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first two...,"In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was in fact better than the first two movies. The Sorcerer Stone was not bad at all as it was putting the set for the characters. Lots of CGs, kind of a 'kid' movie with lots of ""oooh"" scenes like the Quidditch match or the Troll rampage.The second movie was a big disappointment, at least for me. Almost all the same recipes from the first were used again (and I do know it's sort of a ""ritual"" in the Potter books, at least the first four, to start at Harry's Uncle house, then trip to Hogwarth, then something ominous happens, Harry and Ron goof around while Hermione reads, they confront the evil, they win) but bringing nothing new really. The tone was a bit darker -leading some kids to be scared, sorry guys, it seems the franchise will address its protagonist's age, which means it could get darker and darker- but nothing was done to go beyond the first movie as for the character's psychological development.This new Harry Potter redeems the serie in my eyes, as obviously the director has chosen to not only respect the key elements of the books (Quidditch game, Hogwarth studies, opening scene at Harry's uncle, etc.) but added a lot of wonderful scenes that were lacking in the first two episodes (Fantasy'ish landscape surrounding Hogwarth, The Hyppogriph flight scene, the bus scene, the inn, the village under the snow etc.)This is where I realized that the first two movies were so centered around Hogwarth and diagon alley, that you could have believed all the existing wizards lived in those two places. This movie definitely expands the scope of the serie, and brings the best epic finale scene yet, while having a much darker tone as well. Kudos to Daniel Radcliff also for bringing a darker side to Teen Harry Potter at the beginning of the movie. No more Oliver Twist clone ;)I give this opus a 8/10.

One of the worst...,"This film is painful to watch. The tone is way off base. There's something contrived in its whacky feel, shifting away from the grounded feel of the first two films, something Columbus got right, capturing the 'spirit' of the books, a feel which was natural to the characters.The film ought to be judged as a Harry Potter film, and as a film in itself, it is out of place, and this is to say nothing of how poorly the plot and content of the book is treated. It's as though Cuaron is imposing his personality and ideas on the film, instead of really trying to serve the franchise and maintain a sense of continuity with the previous two films and book.I dislike the artificial wackiness he injects into his direction, and in the screen play. It's a shame, because the young actors are getting better, but their characters, along with all the others (just look at the Minister of Magic in the beginning scene!) are forced to dance to a try-hard funny tune, piped by Cuaron, and it results in a painful display.This was the beginning of the general decline of the films - films I enjoy watching on one level, merely because it's Harry Potter on screen, but a little extra length, humility and faithfulness in dealing with the source material, would have resulted in a far better film series.I dislike the feel of this film more than the Goblet of Fire, but somehow Newell managed to be even less apt in translating the book to screen than Cuaron, and that is quite a feat!",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Progression,"Harry Potter is without a doubt the best contemporary fantasy today. The books are yes, better than the movies, but can be brought to life through the films. With that said, I must say that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best film adaption of the current trilogy. The actors were amazing; the set, as much as it changed, was fulfilling; the story was faithful despite minor alterations; and lastly, the wizard world was greatly explored.

Disappointments include, the werewolf and Dumbledore not being silly enough.

I loved this movie - of the 4 this is the one i can put in and enjoy over and over.,"If you have not read the book you may not understand a couple of items, but you won't really notice them or think about them for long, if at all (ie. the stag, etc.). If you have read the books you must separate movie from book. Hey, I'm a Lord of the Rings fanatic and am completely able to LET GO of the many areas of lost content that leave most of the story unexplained and just ENJOY THE MOVIE. Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the 4 - the first two were just too childish and sort of lame to enjoy if you are over 14, and the 4th was inexplicably odd - I have no idea why the characters whined so much and had inner fighting for no apparent reason and it was too dark and depressing, leaving nothing at the end to really care about - ie. why would i want to watch these characters again? Azkaban is a great time - much improved acting, great characters, engaging story - this is the HP that made me actually care about the characters, especially Harry, and the more I watch it the more moving and interesting it gets.

enjoyable entry in the series,"Harry and his wand-waving friends return in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the third in the series of high-flying adventures by British author J.K. Rowling.This latest film finds a more grownup Harry being pursued by the evil Sirius Black, who has just performed the unprecedented feat of escaping from a prison for wayward warlocks. As Sirius moves inexorably closer to his intended victim, Harry learns some surprising details about the murder of his beloved parents.""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a pretty decent installment overall, although it could use some tightening here and there to make it more streamlined and evenly paced (the film runs an overlong two hours and twenty-two minutes). The production design and special effects are as stunning as ever, as once again we are transported to a visually beautiful world of unbridled fantasy and imagination. One of the reasons why the Harry Potter works are so popular is that they root their stories in characters who are realistic and believable, so that even amidst all the riding of brooms, casting of spells and reciting of incantations, Harry, Ron and Hermione are able to keep their feet on the ground and their hold on the audience.Although many people have noted a ""darker"" element running through this film, I really didn't see it, and, in fact, I think ""Prisoner"" is less intense than the second - and best - installment, ""Chamber of Secrets."" Although there seems to be enough creativity in the original concept to support a few more ""Potter"" movies, even Potter-maniacs may feel that at least some of the bloom has begun to fade from this particular rose.

"good movie, one bad actor","First of all I would like to say that I really enjoy the Harry Potter movies although there are some things that need attention I thought that in Harry Potter 1, 2 and 3 Daniel Radcliffe's acting really spoiled the film because once you notice it, it's all you can think about and the bad thing about bad acting is that you really do notice it.Thankfully the acting in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire improved greatly. I heard that Daniel Radcliffe actually had to have acting lessons for 'the Goblet of Fire' because otherwise the director wouldn't direct the movie. I do like the fact that this movie is so similar to the book although naturally a few things had to be cut out and sometimes it doesn't completely fit so it's a necessity to have read the book. I love the setting and I'm glad that this movie had become a bit more 'grown-up'.

"My first Harry Potter movie.  All I can say is, hype is overrated.","I've heard both sides. The Harry Potter movies are brilliant!...and the Harry Potter movies aren't all that fantastic. I've heard the same about the books. What I remembered quickly after seeing this film, is either way, don't believe the hype.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was an interesting experience. Having never read one of the books or seen the previous movies, I was tempted to try a little of both before seeing this movie, but decided to give in. I was happy with my choice. Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson made a great team and carried the movie well from beginning to end. (I'm not sure why IMDb lists them - Grint and Watson - so far down the list of cast - to me they were the prominent figures). I was impressed with their abilities in the film and would be interested to see them outside of the Harry Potter genre.The special effects in the movie were decent, though the werewolf effects were a little weak. I enjoyed the flying scenes and the comic relief on the bus as well as from Rupert's Ron Weasley. The ending was a surprise and I thought tied up the story nicely.My only disappointments in the movie were three. First, I would have liked to see more from Maggie Smith in this movie. Perhaps it is because her character in the book has a small role, but such a wonderful actress as Ms. Smith is one I always enjoy. Second, and this is more of a personal annoyance rather than disappointment - Alan Rickman's character ""Sererus Snape"" was pretty distracting. I didn't care for that character much. Last, and this is entirely unrelated to the movie's production - I think I would have enjoyed it better without so many young children in the theater. >From smells of diapers, to cries and jumping around and sudden outbursts - it became a little distracting. But, what can I expect from a children's cult movie?All in all this was a fun movie to see and it has turned me on the possibility of seeing the others.

horrible...below my expectations,"not at all like the book, why does harry use magic in the beginning of the movie?, why doesn't the new Dumbledore actor at least act like dumbledore?, why does snape use an electric projector?, why are they always in muggle clothes? AND TOO MUCH INFORMATION WAS LEFT OUT, JEEZE, if you haven't read the book you wont be able to follow it at all, so if u haven't read the book, don't waste your time and money with this movie. i prefer christopher columbos more than the new guy, i mean seriously, hes changed the WHOLE story around. it barely looks like harry potter nemore. he wears goggles for the quidditch match...seriously, MUGGLE goggles...and they're in the forbidden forest so often. i think the new director alfonso should have at least looked at the 2 previous harry potter movies to KNOW what the harry potter storyline is. um what else is there...oh ya, the scene where daniel radcliffe was crying, possible the worst crying scene i have seen in my...past 2 weeks.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Movie!,"This was a really good movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I have watched it about 5 times now. The story lines are engaging.I would say that the acting is phenonmenon. I am glad that Harry Potter is growing up so now that he can fight evil like a man. The 2 other characters are very entertaining. Omini and the red head boy. I am so glad they picked these three kids to be in the movie. I heard that there was a major attack on the Asian girl playing Harry potter's new girlfriend. I don't understand what the jealousy is about, if you really take a good perspective, harry potter, the real boyis still single, he is now the richest young man in the UK and yes, you have a chance to marry him, but you might have to fly out there to meet him first!http://localsandtourist.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great stuff !,"While the first two Harry Potter movies were fun and entertaining The Prisonner of Azkaban gives you something more substantial. Watching the movie really gives you the feeling of being immersed in the magical world created by J.K.Rowling. I've read the book a couple of years ago and it was a true pleasure to see the people, monsters and artifacts of Hogwarts (all of which I had already almost forgot).The script of The Prisoner of Azkaban is tight and does a good job of bringing together the best elements of the novel. Sure the director has taken a few liberties ( notably with the dialogs ) but unless you are a Potter maniac chances are it won't bother you. As a result the movie is well balanced ( this time, thankfully, we don't have to go through an over-long Quidditch match...). The rhythm of the movie is flawless : after a long enough first part which lets you appreciate the depth of Rowling's imagination, the action gets rolling and don't let go. The special effects are mostly of great quality, my favorite being the talking paintings and the Marauder's map. The animation in the sequence where Hermione gets molested by a tree is way too blurry, though.A weakness of the movie, in my opinion, is that the Harry Potter character, seems a bit flat. With all the wonders around him I didn't care much what happened to him. Maybe it's also got to do with the somewhat flat acting of Radcliff. And the girl playing Hermione gives a poor performance : the only time I liked her acting was when she was running.. But Ron is great so it evens out !So The Prisoner of Azkaban is a great adventure movie in the same way Indiana Jones 2 and The Goonies were more than a decade ago (Ah those glorious movies of my youth !). They are thrilling and exotic teen movies and that's a nice combination. When the 7 Potter movies are complete I'm sure the third one will stand out. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Things are getting pretty dark...,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter film that is not directed by Chris Columbus. The film is directed by Alfonso Cuarón and it really shows. This film no longer has that magical feeling throughout that the first two had. Instead, the characters are not always surprised and shocked when something magical happens and instead they act a lot like teenagers. The movie is dark, and it really shows how the characters begin to grow up as that magical feeling no longer exists. This is a good thing, in my opinion and this movie is superior than the first two as well. The story is deeper and we get to know some pretty cool characters, it is very dark and very well constructed. But what makes this the best Harry Potter entry so far is the cinematography and directing by Alfonso Cuarón. Every shot looks beautiful, raw and phenomenal. The special effects also get much better in this one and it's just a better movie overall. The pacing is great and the acting is very good as well. This is a great fantasy movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
what a great movie this was.,"Ah, watching this was very much like the book's lines were mended into pictures. Well... almost most, they are indeed a great film.Shortly before this film was made, i was worried that the new director will kill off Harry Potter and turn this into some ""Dangerous mind on magical school of death."" but i was wrong. The director was good. Not brilliant, good. but that's still good.The personality of the cast was magnificent. And the Hippogriff, oh my god, he looked so real. I mean really, real. As if he existed. Not some phony graphics you see on computers that looked clunky and cheesy with no personality. This bests the graphics along with Gollum and Dobby the house elf.I never expect Gary Old man or the other guy who plays Remus, sorry Remus, but these two are my most favorite characters in the existence. i always picture Remus as a great father figure. I always wished he were my dad. but that ain't happening folks. Not that i don't like my dad.Sirius Black, i pictured him more handsome but frightening looking because be has been sent to azkaban for twelve years.Remus Lupin, i was thinking of young Obi Wan Kenobi. But hey, it wasn't that bad. Sure i mean, the mustache thing? Bad. get rid of it next time. But they were great. Their acting was great. I was afraid that this actor who portrays Remus would act like Lockhart or Quirrell. But he was close to what i pictured him.now, the thing i love the director about, he got rid of some scenes that seems too repulsive in the book. Sorry JK Rowling, but your story had bits of nauseating moments. But love them all to death still.Well... i hope the next sequel will be the biggest hit than this. Let's hope. but not too high.

"Maturing cast, new director.","The latest of Rowling's offerings to make the screen has all of the humor and interaction of the last two, but not as much of the magic (pardon the pun) of the previous editions. The new director, Alfonso Cuaron didn't pull off the same adolescent light-heartedness that Chris Columbus was able to portray in his two takes, adding a rather gloomy look to the film.The story line was parsed a bit too much and made the character relationships in the film hard to grasp, unless you: A)Read the book B)hold a degree in sociology or C)you were just there for the popcorn. And can someone please tell me why Harry hasn't fried Malfoy? The romantic tension b/w Hermione and Ron is overplayed and the interaction of Harry and Sirius Black jumps to far too many conclusions without any reason why. Harry goes from shock and fear about having an alleged psychotic killer-wizard out to finish the apparent job he did on his parents, to being reservedly giddy about moving in with him.The acting on almost all counts was stellar. The young troup is coming of age and have those problems to deal with, but Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch, as is Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson.I did enjoy the film and recommend it to both the avid Potter-ite as well as someone who simply wants to do the escapism thing for a few hours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Shouldn't be held prisoner,"I've been watching the Harry Potter movies despite being the one person in society who hasn't read the books, and I've been enjoying them. The series got a new director for ""The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" and that's immediately apparent not just from the name on the credits but from a noticeably different stylistic feel. As a consequence, the strengths and weaknesses of the third film are balanced a little differently from those of the first two. One of the most immediately arresting, memorable, and commendable things about ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the extraordinarily imaginative and well-realized visual style, far outpacing the already-impressive first two films. It's packed with stunningly-created sights such as the aunt who is blown up like a balloon, talking shrunken heads, crooked offices, and rather haunting moving mugshots on the newspapers. I even loved little touches such as the addition of a uniform number and realistic-looking sports equipment to the quiddich game. I don't know how much of this stuff was described is prose form by J. K. Rowling and how much was created for this film, but I'm hugely impressed: I feel as if I could pause the film at any shot and spend fifteen minutes examining the background.I also appreciated Alonso Cuaron's approach to handling scenes. There was a little bit more down-to-Earth realism cutting through people's interactions in the magical world in the film, and I appreciated that. Again, little touches such as Harry Potter's reactions to his uncle's family's obnoxiousness, the very authentically middle-school was Draco Malfoy and friends circle round to gang up on the heroes, and little offhand indications of running jokes between characters that we now know have known each other for a while (""How is it she knows everything?"") make a big difference. There is a strong strain of dark humor running through this particular film, casting special light on officialdom's obliviousness to the fact that Harry Potter might want to know there's a convicted murderer chasing him down, and I appreciate it. Character-wise, the leads are growing up enough to get some more satisfying development, and Harry Potter himself especially is becoming a very rounded character with a stubborn, anti-establishment streak that I enjoy. Due to a sad death among the cast Michael Gambon is called upon as a replacement -- he avoids imitation and is as excellent as ever.In many senses, then, I found this film superior -- but unfortunately the way its plot is handled felt a little unsatisfactory to me. After a certain point where a major twist occurs involving how we perceive one of the characters, a number of things start failing to make sense to me or to be explained. I think issues of what actually happened between Pettigrew, Black, Lupis, and Harry Potter's father are only hinted at here, with the expectation that fans already understand them. What's more, they are sprung upon us very quickly without much of a lead-in. In all I found this stylistically a joy and far ahead of it predecessors, which were no slouches, but the muddled plot line mitigates that somewhat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Terrible Directing leads to an extremely disappointing film,"Well I just saw HP3 and I must say that I am very disappointed. So many plot elements were left out (quidditch cup; moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs remain unexplained) that I had to sit down with a friend who had never read the books for half an hour afterwards to explain pretty much the entire story. Also, I do not get the same feel for Hogwarts and the wizarding world as when Chris Columbus directed. I mean, the kids were wearing common street clothes most of the movie, which was ridiculous. Hardly any actual ""wizarding"" took place, and the climax scene where Harry produces the patronus was terribly done. During the first two movies I felt like I was taken into the wizarding world, whereas in PoA I felt like I was watching some kids running around trying to solve a mystery while some neat special effects happened. I am extremely disappointed and I'm just glad that the next movie will feature a new director.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfect for the Whole Family!,"I am shocked to see that this movie is not getting rave reviews from everyone! I am at a loss to see where anyone could criticize it; I assume they must be fans of the movies only and not the books. Yes, this movie is ""darker"" than the previous two. Readers of the books will know that each book leads Harry one step closer to the eventual (long-awaited) ultimate showdown with Voldemort, so each book is a little darker, and a little more suspenseful and thus each movie will be a little darker and more suspenseful.The three young actors in the Harry Potter series become more and more delightful with every movie. Their acting skills improve with age, and according to my pre-teen son and daughter, so does their ""hotness"" level. My husband and I, my four children and my own parents (ages ranging from 2 years to 51 years of age) all went to see this movie together. We all came out loving it and each of us had a favorite line or scene from the movie. There is something in it that each and every person can enjoy.While it can be a little frightening for the younger kids, and I wouldn't recommend it to parents whose young children are prone to nightmares, it is a fun and wonderful movie. The scenery of the English countryside is absolutely breathtaking and scenes with Harry and the Hippogriff flying across the landscape are amazing - you would swear that the creature is real!There were parts of the movie that were hilarious as well. There are also some cute moments between the group of friends and we start to see a young romance blossom.Overall, I think it touches all of the ranges of emotion, has some amazing actors and actresses, terrific special effects and beautiful scenery.

The magic darkens,"After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry at age 13,"First off, I'm a fan of the books. I have read this particular chapter, or should I say year, several times. My feelings on the film are as follows:There are many new things to talk about this time out. First, Dumbledore's replacement. For those not in the know, Richard Harris passed shortly after the second film was finished. To me, he was the perfect Dumbledore right from the beginning and I had a hard time seeing a new face in the role. Michael Gambon was satisfactory but too many key elements from the character are missing. Instead of playing Dumbledore as a wise, kind and somewhat tired old wizard as Harris did, Gambon seems more energetic and detached from the main characters. I felt as though he and Harry's relationship took a step backwards from the previous movies. I felt as though Harris' performance was closer to Dumbledore as written in the books.Second, we have a new director. Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron steps in and to my delight has given the series a fresh and interesting approach. He approaches the darker tones found in the book with vigor and panache. I was very happy with his visual style. It was very bold and edgy, yet full of emotion. Yeah ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" dude. Way to step up. Great job with the dementors and Sirius Black.This is what I consider the turning point towards maturity for the characters in the books. I was very happy to see that this transition was also made in the film version.8/10Also, I would like it to be known that this is one of John Williams' very best film scores, and that's saying a lot.

The move was good but true HP fans will be in for a shock at the things that where left out of the movie, it is a must to read the book first.I hope that JKR takes a hard look at this film and puts her foot down with the next movie and keeps it very close to the book, the new director needs to take a leaf out of Chris Columbus's's book of Dir.

Watchable,"I only watched the first two Harry Potter movies because I am in love with Emma Watson. I thought both movies were, otherwise, unwatchable. The Prisoner of Azkaban is different - it has a rational plot and believable adult story line. The star of this movie is Hermoine. She gets all the witty lines and all the good scenes. Emma Watson has improved greatly as an actress. It's truly hard to believe that she was only 12 when they first started filming it(13 in later scenes), she's incredibly mature for her age. Except for a preposterous grab of Harry's shirt in the tree swinging scene, a lack of fear in a werewolf scene, and a silly line regarding Hermoine's hair in a serious moment - the movie is quite believable within its magical boundaries. The time reversing sequences are exceptional with Hermoine taking charge. The intelligent plot twists are an unexpected welcome addition.

Likability still intact despite director fault,"In his third year at Hogwarts Harry Potter (Radcliffe) is under the watchful eyes of the Dementors, soulless creatures on the hunt for murderer Sirius Black.In the third instalment of what surely is now the biggest franchise on the planet, Harry and friends head back to school which is darker and more dangerous than ever before. We say this with every film but this was truly the point where the franchise went from family entertainment to dark and dangerous thrills.Chris Columbus dropped out of his director chair to be replaced by an unknown Alfonso Cuaron, and when reviewing all the films it is evident to see that this change was the biggest mistake in the franchise.Filled with awkward shots, an essence of predictability and many insignificant filling scenes (frozen planets, trees and clock gazing), Cuaron's direction is unbelievably inadequate, particularly for this dark transition. The adaptation of wide angled lenses gives too much information to the scenes and feels inappropriate in context. The camera is always on the move also. It never stays still and we never get a chance to settle on the moment which is a real pain as the significance of scenes is never properly justified. However if there is one thing the director handles well is the arrival of the Dementors. On the train the characters first encounter the Azkaban guards and the slow approach goes so well with the notion of the book you are right there in the heart of the moment, uncontrollably transfixed with the dark ghost like character.This was always debated to be the least thrilling book out of the franchise. Whereas Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets had a mystery to solve, Prisoner of Azkaban sits back and lets the tale come to the characters. Events happen and move on drawing all to a major finale which thankfully livens things up. The book had its moments and where this is still entertaining the fact is this is where the books became more like a soap drama than a family entertainment film.The young stars shine once again with Watson in her best role to date. Gary Oldman's Sirius is what the book represents and Michael Gambon's adaptation of Dumbledore does not do justice to Richard Harris' reflection as the Wizard.Despite the faults in direction and lack of story, this 2004 picture will still grip, shock and entertain with its stunning effects and bouncy performances. The fact is the likability is still intact and will please any fans of the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Darker, More Mature Potter","While Chris Columbus did do his job making worthy adaptations of the first two Potter films and had the loyalty of fans of the book (myself included) they lacked much, entertainment being one of the biggest, as they felt more like a vision with people talking from the book rather than an actual movie. But the Harry Potter series has now met Alfonso Cauron, who proves to not only manage to give the Harry Potter series some much needed spunk and maturity, but also proves to make it a good movie on its own merits.Part what makes Prisoner of Azkaban such an improvement over its predecessors is that the young actors seem to have gotten the space they needed. It's hard to get young actors/actresses to get a particular role right and still make them feel comfortable with their career, but Cauron seems to have taken pressure off of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson's shoulders. The older performers in the movie are also given time to let the audience get acquainted with who they are.Prisoner of Azkaban is also much darker and mature but also more humorous than the previous installments. The mood of the story and movie not only looks dark but also feels dark and it helps to reflect on the younger roles of the movie by making them seem all the more mature. But even with this, the movie manages to crack a few jokes to make the viewer get a chuckle or two here and there and it helps to provide a brief relief from the seriousness from the film, and a little humor never hurt anyone right? But most of all, this third installment proves to be far more entertaining above all. Unlike Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, which felt much like a bunch of actors and actresses efficiently speaking word-for-word from the book , Prisoner of Azkaban liberates itself from the book but manages to keep much of the sufficient details from it in the movie and in the end it pays off as a much more fun to watch movie.Serious Harry Potter fans might feel somewhat betrayed by Prisoner of Azkaban and how it shares only the main plot details from the book, but casual movie goers will find a tasty and ultimately satisfying treat in it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Close...but no cigar (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),"This was a fun film, well told. The change to a darker, more adult theme is set up from the start with grainy film and hand-held camera work (two Columbus no-nos). It is interesting to compare it to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The themes of growing up, leaving one's parents, the inevitability of fate, the possibility of glimpsing the future... it's all in the two of them. Some of the visual stuff is great: the train icing up when the Dementers appear for example. BUT, but - as so many have said, and I have to enter my ha'penneth - this cuts too much from the book. There needs to be more dialogue - difficult when the director obviously was trying to keep something visual and pacy. But so much was left out that is intrinsic to the wonder of the book, which is so moving and wise (yes, really!) The connections between Pettigrew (Wormtail), Lupin (Mooney), Black (Padfoot), and James Potter (Prongs) are not touched on in the film AT ALL. And Dumbledore's final conversation with Harry, when he says it is our choices as much as our abilities that determine who we are. I know that a film can't be a book, but sometimes, just sometimes, you can do something even better. This falls between two stools - too faithful to be a complete re-imagining, too faithless to fully convey the reason why the books are so successful.

movie magic,"If you are one of those HP fans who list every departure from the books, don't watch this this film, it will only infuriate you and ruin the whole experience. You want the unchanged story? Read the book, it's excellent.However if you only want to be entertained for two hours and see a good fairytale/fantasy picture, this is the film for you. The story is the best yet for Harry Potter it's twisting and turning, yet it is not unfollowable (even my grandma understood the story). The new director is simply brilliant, he didn't want to copy&paste the whole story into the silver screen, he just wanted a great movie so he took the scenes he needed and left out what he didn't.He even changed many things established in the first two films, but to the Potter universe's benefit: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry never looked and will never look more magical (at least in the 4th and 5th movies), it's as the castle is truly alive, not just a Gothic background.The special effects are great, better than film 2 and a lot better than film 1. John Williams's new score is excellent, it serves the new atmosphere really well, he rarely used the full orchestra. He didn't reach his 'Hook' or 'Home Alone' level, but this score is still very good.The teenage actors are okay, not brilliant but okay. Daniel Radcliffe couldn't properly channel Harry's emotions yet, but he is fairly decent (he will get better in later films).The adult actors are excellent, especially the newcomers. Gary Oldman joins the cast as the resident threat to Harry's life, he is maddened, he is tortured soul and you never know what he'll do next. His presence looms over the picture with much more strength than Voldermort's did in the first or second film.Michael Gambon's headmaster Dumbledore is very intelligent and somewhat crazy (like in the books) and more energetic than the late Richard Harris's, yet he is not the more aggressive Dumbledore we'll see in the 4th film.David Thewlis is also very good as professor Lupin, an old friend of Harry's deceased father, his scenes are warm and touching. Emma Thompson... she is magnificent, you'll see. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Robert Hardy and Maggie Smith are all returning, Coltrane and Rickman are simply stellar.To sum it up: great story, brilliant new designs and atmosphere, excellent special effects, very good music and magnificent actors, BUT: if you are a hardcore fan and hate when the filmmakers change things from the book, do not watch this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A healthy blend of fantasy and suspense in an easily manipulative world.,"With two Harry Potter films firmly under the belt and many other books, the phenomenon that is Harry Potter is easy to recognise and will stick with generations to come, but how does this film match up against two other reasonably successful films? Surely the curse of the sequel has to strike sooner or later. Not necessarily.Chris Columbus is something of an auteur when it comes to family films given the fact 'Home Alone' (1990) and 'Mrs. Doubtfire' (1993) are two easily recognisable films when it comes to the genre and the first two Harry Potter films were a healthy way in which to introduce the series. This third one takes it up a level.Oddly enough, the film starts rather blandly, almost randomly, and it takes a while to get to grips with the world of the film and in which the characters live in. This may be easier for others depending on your taste in film and knowledge of Harry Potter though. We're given a rather ridiculous and unfunny introduction to Harry Potter at home during the summer and the reminder of the cruel setting of which he lives. Everything here seems a little too forced and it's as if it's mandatory that we are told, once again, Harry isn't happy at home. It's unnecessary.Once the film gets going, we are thrown into the world of magic and of Hogwarts, the superb setting for the film. The fantasy element is amazing and it's easily to get lost in. This is clever as you need your brain active for this film in order to follow the plot's twists and the time travel element when they arrive but at the same time, there's no shame to just simply relax and let Hogwarts take you wherever and engross you with it's entertaining quips that it has. Some techniques that I'm a big fan of in this film is the one used really early on which sets up an uncomfortable feeling you have throughout the film. Here, the example is when our three heroes are on the train and dialogue is used to build up a disturbing and uncomfortable feeling for characters know as 'dementors'. This is done, as I said, early on in the film and sets the scene brilliantly as the threat of them is there throughout and we know what they're capable of and what a threat they are. The technique is also used with Sirius Black's character.Following on from this dialogue technique, the use of a rather disturbing and eerie scene so early on and so soon after the dialogue is another good way of making an effective film. We are told of the beings and then suddenly, we are confronted by one and we're left with the feeling if 'Hold on, this is too soon! I need more time to digest this stuff!' Clever film-making.This happens through out the film and the timing and placing of the horror, the fantasy and the comedy, which has a couple of reoccurring jokes, is very welcome and very well done. It makes the film so much more clean and well put together. There's also a very pleasant feeling of ambiguity flowing throughout up until round about the start of the last act which keeps everything very mysterious and suspenseful. This, along with my last point, keeps the film going beautifully.Apart from a bit of 'poker faced' acting from the heroes, nobody else puts a foot wrong in the acting department and one thing I didn't like was the confusing way in which suddenly everything is un ravelled following a plot turn. Although I'm alien to the book's content, it didn't work well for me and had to have it explained afterwards.Don't be put off seeing this film, as it is enjoyable with a nice blend of almost everything.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Delight for Fans of the Book,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the most enjoyable and entertaining of the series so far.Director Alfonso Cuarón and adapter Steven Kloves just assume we've read the books and seen the other movies so focuses on new main plot points with little time spent on explanations and side stories. So while this not a good entry point for neophytes, it's a barrel of laughs and excitement for fans.The kid stars and co-stars are growing suitably along with the story line and I certainly hope they can continue with each movie, as their characters fit like gloves.The adults continue to be a stellar representation of British talent, though they ham it up a bit too much, with the addition of David Thewlis as the first nice guy defense of the dark arts teacher who surprisingly could have seemed a bit more tormented about his monthly problem, Emma Thompson playing the clairvoyant as just plain batty, Michael Gambon a bit too twinkly in replacing Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Timothy Spall literally as a rat.The very long, and visually delightful, closing credits show the extent of the special effects, but we do see them all on the screen.

omg,What happened to this movie? I don't think it was as good as the first 2 movies! The first 2 were awesome! I really believe they should have never changed directors! From what I heard this director never even read any of the Potter books! The actors and actresses were awesome as usual! And maybe they could have spent a bit more money on making professor Dumbledore a bit more like the original Dumbledore! This one seems to be way more younger then the first one! With all the special effects they put in this movie they could have done something with his voice to sound older and to make him look older! As I said before kudos to the actors and actresses for their hard work! The story did not follow the book what so ever!

BY FAR the worst film in the series!,"You can watch the entire Harry Potter series and skip this pointless borefest entry and yet NOTHING would be lost.Terrible new characters, a convoluted storyline with zero suspense, a beyond anti-climactic ending that will have anyone with an actual brain saying ""......that's it??? where's the epic 3rd act!?!?"", and the single biggest offender of all: HORRENDOUSLY BAD ACTING across the board, especially from the kids with just one or two lines, who the hell cast these beyond talentless children?!?1/10 (would give a straight ZERO if available)",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of three.,This is definitely the best Harry Potter movie to date. I am actually quite surprised that this film got by the MPAA with only a PG rating (It really feels like it should have been PG-13.) And that's a good thing. Cuaron's direction is much darker than Columbus' previous two and the three main leads seem more comfortable in there roles than ever before. The performances are much stronger and the subject matter is much more developed than what we've come to expect from this franchise. Cuaron's transitions between scenes and the note on which he ends the film (Does anyone remember freeze-frames?) really add to the visual style and in my opinion give the film a much more ominous impact. Not to mention that there is barely a frame in this film with any sunlight (Think Tim Burton's Batman.) The end result is a very engrossing and entertaining mainstream film that will be enjoyed by even the most sophisticated moviegoer but may actually scare the little ones a bit!,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Comments on Movie,"Having read the book prior to seeing the movie, it was very good. However, having gone with others who had not read the book, a lot was left unexplained. I found myself explaining 1/2 the movie to them so they would understand. Otherwise, a true joy as always - My son and I look forward to the next one! There were spots that seemed slow and unconnected. But again, if you read the book those lapses disappeared. It was nice to the kids in ""street"" clothes , they seemed more real. It was also nice to see Hermonie show some true personality this time around. She is really coming out of her shell and showing her true colors. The humor in the movie was great too. It broke up the dark and sometimes depressing theme. I would love to know when the next book (book 6) will be out. I can't imagine how she could end with only 7 books. Hopefully she will see fit to continue on with this story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A definite improvement,"Compared to the previous two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has improved drastically. Although many avid Harry Potter fans (one being myself) are a bit disappointed with the many changes, I think that those specific changes can be overlooked with how well this movie has been directed, written, and acted.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all grown so wonderfully... and in only a year. If they can do that in a year... let's see what they can do in many years. Daniel Radcliffe was very tight and nonemotional in his two previous movies... yes he was very good... but again, not very emotional. In the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise, Radcliffe has really shown definite improvement. It's as if you can really relate to the character now. When he speaks in the movie, it isn't as if he is reading off the script... but actually adlibbing everything... which is very good. Emma Watson has definitely grown into a beautiful young woman. Even at a ripe age of 13/14... 16 year old boys (ahem my brother) are practically in love with her, and girls just love the way she presents herself. She is probably one of the only great young acting girls to come around (especially when you compare her to Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan who cannot act worth their life). Rupert Grint presents comic relief... and wow is he hilarious (Especially his dream scene). I love how oblivious he is to everything. And how laid back he is in interviews.This movie is finally almost doing justice to the books",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another great installment of the Harry Potter universe,"The third Harry Potter film didn't disappoint. Harry Potter, being angstier than ever, goes further down the trouble-making route but this time, he's under the impression that an escaped convict is after him. To protect him, dementors are placed around the perimeter of Hogwarts to protect him. Dementors might just be my favorite entity introduced in the Harry Potter universe so far - their aesthetic of hooded entities with skeleton arms that float around like a smoke cloud is frightful; their aura sucks the joy out of everything around them and leaves the atmosphere freezing wherever they go; and, if that's not scary enough, their presence makes you relive the worst experiences of your life. On top of that, we have the dementor's kiss, which is described as a faith worse than death - it sucks your soul out, leaving you living the rest of your life as a shell of a person.The story might be my favorite overall, though the movie doesn't do the best job of explaining the motives of Serius Black - it's not made clear how he found out where Peter is hiding, which prompted his escape from Azkaban. Although there were glimpses of newspapers with pictures of Ron's family in Egypt, I don't believe it was hinted that Sirius saw them, watching the movie it just looks like Sirius spent 13 years in Azkaban and decided to escape all of a sudden.Even though were some other minor inconveniences that did make the movie enjoyable but felt unexplained plot-wise, I'd like to focus on the positive: the time-traveling laws, presented in the movie, were executed magnificently. Reading it was cool but seeing it executed on the big screen felt even better. The whole encore act of the movie did have that satisfaction of explaining a lot of questions, which kind of makes me want to rewatch the movie just to see all those little bits that felt random but, in fact, were significant.Overall, great movie. I finished the 4th book already, so I can't wait to watch the 4th movie next weekend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Harry Potter Film So Far,"As many fans of the series will agree the third book, 'The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" is the best book. Similar to its literary counterpart, the third installment of the Harry Potter movies is also the best so far!Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and gang are in their third year at Hogwarts and new dangers and adventures lie around the corner. Primarily, Sirius Black (Gary Oldham) is a prisoner who has escaped Azkaban prison and is believed to be after Harry. This is because Sirius supposedly played an integral part in the death of Harry's parents.The film-making, along with the plot, become considerably darker. Many scenes occur through thunderstorms and ominous dark clouds. The lighting hardly ever gets light or happy, but rather filled with an abundance of black and gray tones.But what makes this movie the best is the plot. You must compliment the director completely for letting the amazing plot and storyline carry the movie. He does not try to overact, overproduce or over-do any scenes. He just lets the characters develop in the scenes and the plot carries the story from there.This is the best of the first 3 Harry Potter films and contains a more mature watch-ability level than the two previous films. This is a movie that older children, young adults and parents will all enjoy.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"I paid to see a movie, not a piece of art!","Alfonso Cuaron has made a common mistake among directors these days: just because a movie pretty doesn't mean it's good.Yes, I admit, Azkaban's visuals - and how Cuaron uses them - are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The Dementors are unfaithful to the book, but still genuinely scary, and Buckbeak looks incredible. In fact, I would have rated this movie lower had it not been for these spectacular effects.Cuaron seems to have a very claustrophobic sense of directing, keeping everybody intense and focused on one shot and not allowing anyone to breathe while a line is being spoken. This results in some extremely tight and stiff acting from some incredible acting. In fact, only the three new adults - Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis - seem free from Cuaron's grip.The script is okay; at least it doesn't try to cram everything in like in Chamber of Secrets. However, this time it does the opposite: it focuses too much screen time on visuals and not enough on important elements like plot, acting and storyline.In conclusion, this movie could have been so much better. I don't recommend seeing this movie if you have already read the book, because you will be gravely disappointed. For the rest of you, it's an okay way to kill two-and-a-half hours.

fun for all ages,"After many years of avoiding the harry potter films my mum invited me to sit down with her and watch a few. after watching the first movie i wasn't particularly surprised or looking forward to the next films. i read the first 3 books when they were first out and was looking forward to this film remembering that i enjoyed the story. I think the choice of getting in the new director was a masterstroke, although the first two films were aimed towards the younger audience this one was less predictable and far more entertaining. Without initially realising it director Cuarón was involved with both Y tu mama tambien and Great expectations(or which i enjoy both), i was still keen to look up what he had done previously.i thought this movie was well worth watching and was entertaining for those of all ages, and i don't mean that in the same way as monsters inc. which people say its suitable for all but is only really suitable for kids and simple adults. Its got unpredictable twists and luckily the numerous deus ex machina's take on believable explanations due to a twist!in a fantasy world of werewolves, wizards and witchcraft the main characters take on more adult attributes and work together to protect Harry from the ghosts of his past.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What I Thought,"I honestly thought that this was the most brilliant of the three movies. All three of the kids have grown so much as young actors and actresses. The performance given by Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), and the chemistry between him and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) were completely brilliant. The only lacking part of this movie was the quidditch scene. Brilliant and beautiful as it was, it was cut way too short (around five minutes, mostly of Harry dodging dementors), and this is a problem as this is many young children's favourite part of the Harry Potter movies. Both Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger)have transitioned gracefully into teenagers, both very good looking, while Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley)has kept with his character's lanky, less smooth looks. Congratulations, Alfonso Cuaron, 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantasy is great!,"I am from Bulgaria, but my mother works now in England. I loved Harry Potter the moment I saw the first film. Then I saw the second one. These films were so fantastic and sweet, that I asked my mum to send me the books, so I could compare them with the movies.

One of my favorite books...not my favorite movie.,"Like many Potter fans, I felt that after number two much magic was lost in the series. However, JK Rowlings ever increasingly better plot lines make up what the movie lacks. This was one of my favorite books, so despite a lot quirky things added(hem hem, shrunken heads anyone??), I still found ways to enjoy this movie.The actors have grown up a lot, not completely for the best. Dan Radcliff is not yet good at pulling off emotional scenes-I sincerely hope he gets better as he matures. And I found Emma Watson rather annoying, to be honest. However, Rupert Gint as well as the Weasly twins have matured well, and I feel are absolutely perfect for their roles.The adult actors are also wonderful-Alan Rickman is still brilliant as Snape, Gary Oldman was cast well as Sirius, Lupin, McGonagall...Alas, Alan Rickman no longer can bring his magic to the movies. I really didn't feel any connection to Michael Gambon, but maybe with time..Not the best movie, but very good actors and plot make up for the set/director changes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A dark and enchanting chapter,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" directed by Alfonso Cuarón, is the third installment in the Harry Potter series and marks a noticeable shift towards a darker, more mature tone. This film introduces us to the enigmatic Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner believed to be a threat to Harry.Returning to Hogwarts for his third year, Harry discovers that Black's escape from Azkaban prison is connected to his own past. The introduction of the Dementors, the chilling guards of Azkaban, adds a new level of menace and tension. The film skillfully balances the magical adventure with more profound themes of fear, trust, and identity.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to grow into their roles, delivering performances that capture the complexities of their characters' emotions. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin are excellent additions, bringing depth and intrigue to the story.Cuarón's direction brings a fresh visual style to the series, with creative cinematography and a more dynamic use of special effects. The time-travel sequence is particularly well-executed, offering a thrilling and clever twist.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a compelling film that successfully expands the Harry Potter universe, blending darker elements with the enchantment of the magical world.

A young wizard must overcome his fear of the evil dementors and save himself and his friends.,"This movie is outstanding! There is a lot of suspense and many exciting parts! Some younger children might be scared of the dementors and other creepy parts, but children 10 and over should be fine. The movie is almost as good as the book by the same name which was written by JK ROwling. Many parts from the book are included in the movie. An interesting thing about the movie compared to the other two is that the actors are wearing normal ""Muggle"" (non-wizard) clothes instead of the Hogwarts robes. I think that this takes away from the ""magic"" of the movie, but the movie is good just the same. This movie is a must-see especially if you have read the book!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This is the film the first two should have been,"Cuaron's adaptation may stray from the source material far more than Chris Columbus' previous films did, but he's managed to capture the spirit of Rowling's world far more successfully. Several scenes in this film had more heart that the previous movies combined. A fantastic, warm, scary and pleasing fantasy. The kids shine as Harry, Ron and Hermione, while Gambon's Dumbledore has a liveliness befitting the character that was absent in the late Harris' portrayal. Gary Oldman is in the film for far too brief a time, but his presence looms large, and he's certainly arresting -- no pun intended -- when he is on screen. Buckbeak is a far more effective use of CGI than any of the previous creatures, as well. Is it wrong to want a hippogriff of your own?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a step forward for this franchise,"I need to preface my comments by stating that I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter novels, which means my opinion of the films are somewhat colored by my opinion of the books. While I enjoyed ""Sorcerer's Stone"" as both a book and a film, they were both, at heart, stories for children. I thought Chris Columbus did a good job of capturing the essential nature of the book, and I appreciated the effort. I gave ""Sorcerer's Stone"" an 8.""Chamber of Secrets"" is my least favorite book of the five, and so I was not surprised to find that I didn't like the second film as much as the first, either. I give credit to Columbus for, once again, staying true to the spirit, and mostly to the word, of the book, but he was working with inferior material. I gave ""Chamber of Secrets"" a 6.In the books, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" begins the maturing of the material. Author J.K. Rowling writes her novels in a more complex and adult style as the characters in them grow from children to young adults. As a result, I have found that I appreciate and enjoy the later books in the series more than the earlier ones. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first book to take that step toward more advanced storytelling, and it is my favorite of the first three books, but unfortunately that isn't true of the films.I found that ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" does not live up to the book in a number of ways, but that comparison may not be fair, as many films cannot address all the material in a book's pages and thus fall short. On its own merits as a film, however, I still find that this film is flawed. First of all, it felt rushed. Cuts between scenes were often harsh. The movie takes significant leaps in time that don't feel that way due to quick edits. This and certain unexplained plot and character changes left me thinking that a lot of film was left on the editing room floor. For example, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) seems to bond awfully quickly with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), and I kept thinking that we were missing some scenes that included just how their relationship developed.Another problem I have is that some of the child actors aren't very good actors. I thought this really showed with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Draco (Tom Felton). While their talents sufficed in the two previous films, in this one, they fell short. In don't know if this is due to the difference in directors or if the actors aren't up to the task, but their performances in ""Prisoner"" were a distraction - not good.Third, the choice of Michael Gambon to replace the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore was an unfortunate one. Mr. Gambon is a fine actor, and he brings a vigor to the role that Harris could not have provided, but he lacks the screen presence of a legend, and the magic of Hogwarts seems somewhat diminished.Lastly, characters that were well established in the first two films got short shrift this time around. Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) has little more than a cameo appearance. The wonderfully creepy Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) plays a much reduced role, and we never see a potions class that I can remember. Ron's siblings are barely seen. All of these characters are a big part of Harry's world, and that world seems much changed without them.Then we have areas where the shortages from the book detract from the film for those, like me, that really enjoyed the printed version. For example, the origin of the Marauder's Map and the identities of ""Messrs Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs"" go unexplained. Dedicating five to ten minutes of footage to this might have gone a long way towards explaining Harry's relationship with Lupin and also why he warms so quickly to Sirius Black (Gary Oldman).Another issue is that the films are coming out too slowly, and the kids are thus aging faster than their characters. Harry and company are supposed to be 13 in this film, but they look more like 15. This will only get worse if they continue to have more than a year between films.Does anyone else find that the film version of Draco Malfoy is a wimp? He comes off as much more of a villain in the book. Maybe this is due to the shortcomings of Felton as an actor, but I blame it on the script and the direction. And his cronies Crabbe (Jamie Waylett) and Goyle (Josh Herdman) aren't near as threatening a physical presence as they ought to be.Enough complaining. There are still lots of things that are right and good here. The world is still magical, and in this film, more fully realized. Other reviewers have talked about the darker look, but I find this appealing and fitting to the nature of the story. Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Hermione) are fine young actors. (Watson is going to be a real beauty, too, and this is yet another departure from the book, as Hermione is supposed to be buck-toothed and frizzy-haired.) The wonderful adult supporting cast is still there, supplemented this time by Emma Thompson (as Sybil Trelawney) and Julie Christie (as Madame Rosmerta), along with Oldman and Thewlis. And the new version of the Whomping Willow is a fun bit of comic relief. Hogwarts is still a fun place to visit at the movie theaters.I give ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Special effects were good and I think that the direction was better than the first two movies but overall it just didn't work.

"Of course its not the book, but...","When I went into the theatre, I knew just as Cuaron did, that every page of the book would appear on screen, but I think he did a great job of capturing the essence of the book. I mean it is ultimately about Harry and his journey of accepting his fame and trying to understand the events in his past while trying to deal with adolescence. This film is really fast paced, and I completely understand why some fans will hate it, but it gave me the same feeling I got from reading the book. Whenever I sit to read the books it seems like the pages go so fast, and Rowling always leaves me wanting more, and I think Cuaron really captures that feel. No film can ever really be as good as the book....there is just so much characterization that must be left out, but I think this is the best attempt so far for the three feature films. Visually it was so spectacular! Buckbeak and Hogsmeade looked exactly as I pictured them and the cast was great, even though Micheal Gambon can never compare to the perfection of Richard Harris, I just wish I could get to see more mischief from the twins, because they are the comic relief in the book and they kind of lighten up the mood a bit.

The incredible camera work and rich images combine with the deep understanding of the world to achieve a grand visual poetry.

The weakest of the three to date,"The Prisoner of Azkaban tries to dazzle us with action, suspense, and special effects. These elements, I believe, take away from the character development that made the first two Harry Potter movies worth watching. This one feels a bit more like a video game than a movie, trying to cram as much excitement in as little space as possible. This is probably a great movie for children, but it fails to draw in discriminating adults the way the previous installments had. In the next installments, I can only hope the director reduces the tempo and pays more attention to the individual characters.

Could this be the worst book-to-film translation ever?,"Could it be?This is so far from the source material that you must ask yourself what happened. Someone in the long order of crewpeople involved with this film must've gotten something terribly wrong for it to turn into this. Sure the main plot and all the most important scenes are there, but the end product here feels like a film where they've taken parts from one half of the book, placed it in the wrong order and then thrown in a little action from the other half of the book. I'm sure most of you agree with this? At least those of you that read the book. Some short 20 minutes or so into the film we're already more than halfway through the book and many key scenes have been dropped. And what's with the ending? Are they serious? This is from the middle of the book if I don't remember something completely wrong here, and the fact that they actually skipped almost everything quidditch, which is one of the most beloved ingredients of the Harry Potter books puzzles me. This is something that will disappoint a lot of children during the week.Don't get me wrong. I DO understand that sometimes drastic measures has to be taken in order for the film version of a book to not be overly long. I also understand that some scenes that are less important has to be thrown out and other scenes altered or sized up.

Entertaining,"Darker in tone than the first two films, with the nightmarish dementors circling Hogwarts and threatening to suck the soul out of both Harry Potter and Sirius Black, the wizard who's broken out of prison with the apparent intent to kill him. Aside from the menacing Snape and annoying Malfoy (who happily we get to see clawed by the hippogriff and punched in the face by Hermione), there is also a werewolf about, the look of which in that dark forest was pretty scary. Even the quidditch match is played in a howling storm. Is all of this darkness a metaphor for the turbulence of adolescence, with the three heroes beginning to mature and face the real horrors of life, both present and past? Maybe. There are also some really sweet little moments, like when the friends console each other gently when one is crying, or when Harry is told that ""the ones that love us never really leave us.""

Much better style than the others.,"I just saw Harry Potter 3. Wow, a lot of changes, in a good way. First off, Daniel Radcliffe's acting is still as crappy as usual, but not as bad as Malfoy. The thing that amazed me the most was the very different style of cinematography, which is dark, grainy, and much better than Columbus's boring Directing. You can definitely see the change. Well, unfortunately this movie started off a little slow. I felt like there was a lot of missing material and was a bit to short (142 min), considering how big the book is. There was not as much action or comedy in this installment which left it a bit bland. Bottom line is: Slower than the other HPs, better Directing, still crap acting (Daniel Radcliffe).

"OK, but could have been outstanding.","The film version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is not that bad. Acceptable, in fact. What upsets me is it could have been so much more.This is the first novel in JK Rowling's series that really delves in to who Harry Potter's parents are. It's the big mystery up to this point. Who were they? What was their life like, and why did they meet their end? These are the questions answered by this novel.Sadly, the movie does a terrible job answering these questions. There is so much rich dialogue between Harry and the adult characters in this book, yet the filmmakers have shortened it to such an extent the message is lost. There are such great scenes between Lupin, Sirius, Snape, Harry and other key characters in the novels that would have been stunning between these fine actors, but they don't get their chance. And those bits of dialogue that are included are not sold in their proper way, just not played as they should have been so their meaning is lost.The filmmakers did an outstanding job with the three young characters. Their respective actors are definitely improving, and they have been given some very good dialogue and good direction from Alfonso Cuaron. They are indeed the stars of the show.Not overly impressed with Gambon as the new Dumbledore. The stupid pajamas they had him wearing for the duration of the film took away his authority and power, the costume department did him a major injustice.The effects are excellent, but I'm not thrilled with the cinematography. The colors are washed out, it's very brown. I think that's part of the statement: the message of the film is darker. But they can have a dark film and still make it stunning as well. It's almost as if they stopped watering the grass at Hogwarts over the summer.Overall, I think the desire to go darker was wise, but they only did it in a visual sense. Dialogue-wise, they are still talking to children. They need to ramp it up in subsequent novels, and stop shooting for that PG rating.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Azkaban's Prisoner almost ruined Harry Potter's magic.,"Reviewing in 2020 , Harry Potter third magical outing is very different from first two films which contains more as drama magical mystery movie. There has some controversial issues for this movie i have heard before but myself realize the fans can be satisfied at the end of the film. Overall it's slowly paced engaging Young Potter's drama in his third year with some horrific visuals and excellence of Young Hermione survive to great film.The story starts as Harry Potter as usual starts from his uncle house but he get from the house this time more earlier fashion reason of some wizard work from him and he really forced to get out as himself , there has some fast introduction of the prisoner of azkaban who is Sirius Black and wizard transportation make so wild as early start up. Moreover he met up his two best friends and the trio making way of return the Hogwarts for third year . Dementors to suddenly board the train, searching for Sirius. One enters the trio's compartment, causing Harry to pass out, but new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin repels the dementor with a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that dementors will be guarding the school while Sirius is at large and Hogwarts groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. Without any spoiler to revealed Harry Potter will have to learned about Sirius , who is really he is , what more problems happening in Hogwarts and how he overcome from the Prisoner of Azkaban.The director Alfonso Cuarón has delivered decent job in this film with directing this trilogy .Steve Kloves screenplay has been questioned in first an half but he really nailed to second half of film which really makes great at end. John Williams music and background is key role in this film too as previous outing . Michael Seresin is Cinematographer done basic and good job but with sometimes dull but it's neat. Steven Weisberg cuts was brilliant . Overall the technical of films makes running time of movie fair with 142 minutes.Characters such as Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin has decent performance which major for the screenplay of film. Michael Gambon first outing as Albus Dumbledore does great replace for the role never felt mischief anywhere, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley really was bonding in support of the movie and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger really has more adventurous show she more then enough for the role more then Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in the film but anyhow he is starman for the show .Overall not best of trilogy but it's among fantastic second half screenplay.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
disappointed,"I was really disappointed w/the third movie. The new director really screwed up some key things. I hated the fact that he changed the scenery. I hated how he left things out and rearranged the storyline. From what I heard about the film, the director was trying to make this installment more ""real"" and a little darker than the previous two movies. He wanted to show that the kids were growing up. That's fine. However, these stories aren't based on anything ""real"". They're fantasy. I liked the magical quality of the first two movies. I liked seeing all the neat magical gadgets that I'd read about in the books. And I definitely appreciated the first director's efforts to stick to the books as much as possible. All the little details that make Harry Potter so special were totally discarded for the third movie. If I was JK Rowling, I would never have approved this screenplay. When the third book is longer than both of the first two, and the third movie is NOT as long as either of the first two movies, that is a dead giveaway that the story has been totally cut up and screwed up. VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED! I hope that the next director will do a better job w/#4.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The film is not bad, but there's a big lack of magic!","In general I enjoyed the movie, but I was not pleased with it. The hippogriff was really well made, hagrid was taller, as tall as he should be (in the book), but that's about it. The movie was too fast, there were no transitions and it should've been much more longer, at least 3 hours. There was no Christmas, Halloween, nor any other scenes that would bring warmth to the movie. In general, it was much too dark and Hogwarts was too small from the interior. The 2 first movies were much better, because they had more magic in it, by that I mean that they were more enchanting to the eyes. Cuaron tried to do a horror movie, Harry potter is suppose to be wonderful, but the prisoner of Azkaban was not! It was a good movie, but only ordinary and it don't deserve to be in the top 250 best movies from IMDb, so an average of 7.9 is much too high for a movie like this. People aren't enough subjective, they loved the potter saga and they voted with it... they rated that movie too high.Thanks",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Surgeon's General Warning: If you love movie 3, don't read this!!!","Although this is my favorite of the 3 so far Harry Potter movies, there are also several things I dislike about it. Let's start with the good. Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (I really hope everyone who's reading this knows who they play but if not: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger) have totally grown into their roles. They are are amazing actors and I loved every one of their scenes--and since the movie is focused around one or all of them at all times, this was really what made the movie work for me. Also very good were Madam Rosmerta and Severus Snape. As for the bad...I'm afraid there's quite a few things. Number one being Dumbledore. I absolutely loved the Dumbledore from the first two movies. I thought he was amazing; he really embodied the character. This guy--Gambon or something?--is pathetic. I'm sorry; he's just not Dumbledore. I am especially disappointed about this because in books 4-6 Dumbledore has some great lines and I'm hoping that he won't mess them up but predicting he will. Numbers two and three are Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. Lupin was this greasy-haired, weird man; totally unlike what I imagined a friend of James Potter to be. Sirius is supposed to be handsome. And I'm a woman, guys, and...he's not. What else? Well, there were the Hippogriff, werewolf, and Dementors. The Hippogriff is supposed to be made of glorious colors. He was gray. The werewolf...well, I don't really know what a werewolf is supposed to look like, but I feel he could have been much more scary. And the dementors come in about where the new Dumbledore does. In the books, Jo says clearly, several times, that Dementors GLIDE. Didn't catch that? GLIDE, people. These dementors FLEW. ?????? Sorry? Maybe I missed something, but Dementors don't fly...that is, if this movie was really what I thought it was--an adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and not some weirdo's take on Jo's story. Their hands also looked like they were made out of strips of black garbage bags wound into some sort of hand shape. There were too many pointless scenes that could have been the funny lines Jo has written. All in all, I loved the trio, but hating mostly everything else. I would watch this if and only if you are a Harry Potter fan. As for movie 4...even critical me says WHOOHOO!!! If you've seen the theatrical trailer, I'm sure you agree. It looks outstanding! Go see it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Treat For Fans, Mediocre For Others","I'm not particularly a fan of Harry Potter, although I understand the over-hype and fever thats hit the young impressionable youths of the world. The movies are always just a little over-rated due to the expectancy of them. Yet regardless of this they remain entertaining with a good contrast of British cast with only a few exceptions (Oldman). I acknowledge Gary Oldman as a good actor for his diversity of roles (Murder In The 1st - 5th Element) and he plays his role very well in this. Daniel Radcliffe is a bit weak in the lead and although it is a role that carries pressure with it hand in hand he does his best. Radcliffe for his age is not a bad actor but not a very good one, the same could be said for his counterparts (Grint and Watson). Although this cannot be overcome the fact the cast is mainly youngsters takes a chip of the overall acting quality as none of them are outstanding, and few satisfactory. The movie is made primarily for youngsters, the dark contrast of Cuaron's directing clashes with this leaving a mixed mood of film. This is not always a bad thing but for something that should be consistent its a disadvantage. Grint adds some comic relief whilst Watson looks good for the young men watching. The Potter films are average in an ever growing fantasy genre but will be forgotten soon after the hype which is catapulting it to such success that the second movie is the third highest grossing. Then again Titanic wasn't the greatest piece of film art, when putting any Harry Potter film next to any Lord of The Rings film it puts into context the sheer mediocrity of the Potter films, only catapulted to such extreme success due to the volatile and fickle interests of a young and naive audience. Overall, entertaining if your into fantasy, average if your not. 6.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as the book,"Widely considered the best book in the series, Harry Potter part three is cracking read.  A darker addition to the Potter canon, it deals with the escape of murderer Sirius Black from Azkaban (not a middle eastern country but a wizard prison).  Apparently responsible for betraying Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort, Black is now after Harry too.  His friends and teachers all want to protect him, but Harry has something else on his mind: revenge.It's therefore a great shame to report that this instalment, despite a visual makeover, a new director, and better performances from the lead actors, remains depressingly pedestrian in comparison to the novel.  All the keystone events of the book are present, yet the screenplay shows undue reverence to the source material, again forgetting the adage `Show, don't tell'.  For example, just as the first film ought to have opened with the murder of Harry's parents, this one ought to have opened with Black's dramatic arrest after his apparent murder of Peter Pettigrew.The Dementors, Ringwraith-like guardians of Azkaban prison, are initially frightening but fail to remain menacing as the film progresses.  Not enough effort is made to make us afraid of Black.  Key moments of emotional weight from the book are skimmed over, especially in the finale.  The performances are OK, especially from Daniel Radcliffe who has improved tremendously, and Gary Oldman is well cast as Sirius Black, but one expects better from Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman.  The only really memorable turn comes from David Thewlis' Professor Lupin.On the plus side, John Williams' music score is very good; building nicely on his outstanding score for the first film he contributes some fine new themes here.  Special effects look great too, especially Buckbeak the Hippogriff, a bizarre cross between an eagle and a horse.  The cinematography is fine, with the Glen Coe locations looking very beautiful. And director Alfonso Cuaron gives the whole piece a stylish makeover, clearly taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book.That said, this is not a huge improvement on films one and two, and given the source material should have been far better.  The real problem with the Harry Potter films is they still feel like a franchise following a formula, which is remarkable considering their unpredictable plots.  The old cliché is once again true; it's not as good as the book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A huge improvement over its prequel,"After watching The Chamber of Secrets I was a bit skeptical to continue watching the franchise. That was what I had in mind when I began watching this - Will it also show filthy, cringy characters? Is there going to be terrible CGI with literally no beautiful locations? Are there going to be tons of disgusting scenes? Turns out this movie is better in terms of all those things. And definitely worth a watch if you haven't done it already (I know you muts have, I am the only 90's-born stooge who still hasn't watched this series).The story this time takes a much dark, complicated turn. In the beginning of the movie itself Harry kills his aunt, or so it seems since it has been left ambiguously. He doesn't even hesitate from using his magical powers to scare his family anymore, although it is never explained how his uncle knows that he's not allowed to use his powers. This time, just like every other time he is to escape from home and go to Hogwarts station. But this time he does it in a bus being driven by a ghost. I like how every time Harry has to escape from home it always happens in a funny and wholesome manner. Those are the scenes that I could watch forever without getting tired.As the series is progressing, Harry Potter is having a higher budget, which is clearly visible by the fact that now it is following the ""show, don't tell"" principle of storytelling way more often. And that's why the story is using a lot less runtime giving exposition or conversations but rather on actually doing things. I learnt this the hard way. I was doing my project on my computer while watching the movie on the phone, and I missed a lot of scenes and had to rewind to see them again. This is a habit that I had developed from the last two movies of the franchise. And I'm really happy to see that supposedly the Potterheads must have really enjoyed seeing it in the theatres or wherever they saw it. They wouldn't have wasted any time on the talkikng scenes like sci-fi movies normally do.However, I am more used to having Harry Potter having a simple story, just like the movies of that time like Narnia and Lord of the Rings. I was doing a project while watching the movie on my phone, so I stopped seeing the movie for like, 5 minutes and by then everything had changed. I never understood when Harry and Hermione went to the past and what exactly were they trying to change. I also didn't know who that guy was who sat on the flying creature and flew away. Also what finally happened of the Dementor, I completely missed out on that part.There is something about the Harry Potter movies that stops me from wanting to watch them, and I have no idea why. I also get this feeling with Stuart Little and Narnia. So I can't say for a guarantee that I will rewatch it to watch the scenes that I skipped. Although this movie is a major improvement over Chamber of Secrets, it doesn't match the standard that Sorcerer's Stone has set. I have heard enough about Harry Potter and how much it means to everyone, but personally for me it's not a franchsie I could possibly bond with for some reason. I hope I change my mind soon after future movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Things are starting to get better!,"Unlike Harry Potter 2, this film showed a lot of improvements on the screen in terms of things that I characterized as bad in commenting on the previous sequel to Harry Potter. Compared to the previous sequel, this sequel shows better acting and an increased presence of uncertainty and drama which is good. The actors have matured and their acting skills have slowly begun to improve (although they have shown very good skills as beginners in their work in the first part of Harry Potter). In that sense, I would like to thank to the screenwriter for throwing out unnecessary dialogues and dramatic breaks, as well as the directors who removed children's facial expressions from actors and thus opened the way for the Harry Potter franchise to move from the children's world to the adult world. In my opinion, JKR took a short ,,break,, in writing story for filming this part of the movie, because it is obvious that the story is not as interesting as it was in the first two parts of the film. But that's ok. It is important that all of them react in time to the question of making the unreal become real, both by writing and screening. In this sequel to the film, the emphasis is on mysticism and the relationships between people, both for solving the mystery in this part and for evaluating the characters themselves, and I support that. What is missing in this part are those interesting activities, events and actions that complement the film itself, which in the case of the theme of this film is already accustomed to his audience because they are constantly hungry for magic, strange and new things and knowledge from the world of magic. I liked the inversion of mysticism regarding the original suspicion of Sirius Black, which later got its positive turn, as well as solving that mystery with a part of returning time. What I would work on a little more is the relationship between Harry Potter and his family with Draco Malfoy because it is still childish and pathetic and deserves a more serious and realistic look. The part with the Dementors deserved a longer and more meaningful epilogue as well, and the evaluation of Professor McGonagall's character should be done urgently, she seems to be becoming an old grandmother who doesn't know what she's talking about or where she is and her position is quite demanding.
I will see this sequel as a break, as I said, and an opportunity to turn Harry Potter into a more realistic magical world, if it can be called that at all, and catch the train to gain a big name in the world of cinema, both in the field of action and in the field of filming. We are waiting for the next sequel to see what has been done on this issue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic,"Taking the fantasy for granted, it's doubtless that these movies of Harry Potter's saga are indeed and above all, well made. The visual part (special effects, landscapes and the magic of Hogwarts castle interior's) is fascinating. And the stories reveal a limitless and rich imagination that enslaves you. The story of this particular movie is full of spectacular moments, some adventurous and hazardous while others are dazzling and some others humorous but all of them making sense, taking of course the fantasy for granted as we said above. Their rhythm is almost hallucinating. The majority of these wizards (the young ones and the adults) are intrinsically human creatures and behave humanely, displaying humane feelings of love, hate, fear, distaste, friendship and solidarity. The actors and actresses who play their roles, do it in a very efficient and beautiful manner. In short, a movie that in the end leaves you in a good mood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This was NOT an enjoyable movie.,"I'm not sure what movie others were viewing but the Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban I saw was a badly disjointed cinematic effort which left my date totally confused. Those who have not read the books or at least seen the previous two movies had no chance to follow the storyline, if indeed there was a storyline. The seemingly endless movie was more of a series of out-of-context skits strung together for over two hours. The misery ended for me and I sincerely hope other Harry Potter fans avoid this one as a true stinker.Defects included a failure to fully introduce two central characters, Herminone and Ron; failed to introduce other key characters like the Weasley twins and Mr. & Mrs. Weasly and why these characters are important to Harry. Professor McGonagal, a key figure in ALL of the Potter novels, is almost left out of the movie and the animosity and its back story between Malfoy and Harry is never explained. The new broom from Sirius was given midway through in the book and included a delightful side story but it was a toss away scene at the end of the movie. The director didn't even bother to explain the cloak of invincibility that was used in large parts of the movie, what it was and who it first belonged to and how Harry came into possession of it. The endless failure of the director to clue in newcomers to the Potter saga makes me wonder if he ever read the book himself.If you must see this movie, Please, read the books first.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It's getting Better every Time!,"Nothing is better than knowing that people learn from experience. The producers knew what we wanted, and gave us a third magical experience, on a high quality level. The third one is made way different that the two previous ones, you will see that they look different, but it's not a big problem. The director tried to make it darker and more mysterious, a hidden past full of secrets to reveal, and he did that amazingly good. The script was tight and didn't waste time, the runtime was fine, and the scenes were full and finished, I didn't felt that something was missing in them. I appreciate the character development, as well as looking on Harry's family from different sides. The Harry, Ron and Hermione trio was once again a great and entertaining friendship, they are showing very clearly that every relationship in any way has it's up and downs, and that it isn't easy to handle the problems all the time. The new teachers introduced in here, for example Professor Lupin, was a great addition that spiced up things and leaded Harry's journey very good. The rector, Dumbledore, was more in and out and wasn't much included, but I don't think he has too be always on the picture. The scenography was great, more darker in here, the nature of Britain and the wonderful sky is a nice look for the eye. The music is classic, and I can't argue about that. The third part was more psychological, the feelings and expressions is a much more important part than ever, and I liked the issues and feelings they got to go through. In the end, the third part of Potter was once again a banger, it's rewatchable, and I really recommend it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not quite all there,"I am going to start by saying how much I have loved the Harry Potter books; their growing complexity and J.K. Rowling's ability to have the characters mature is amazing. Unfortunately, the movie adaptations are falling away from quality of the original written work. The Prisoner of Azkaban is visually stunning and the casting is superb, but the filmmaker is assuming that the audience will have read the books before having seen the movie. This is probably a fair assumption, but it was in the omission of minor details that bothered me the most about this film. A few extra lines of exposition would have made all the difference in the world to the quality of the film and its continuity.For example, it was never explained why Sirius Black chose this particular time to escape from Azkaban, it was assumed that the audience would know. Also, how did Professor Lupin know how to use the Marauder's Map, only those who had read the book would know. Otherwise these two instances leave gaping continuity holes in the film. These would not have been difficult holes to patch and it would have been worthwhile for audience members new to the film. On the other hand, the time turner is dealt with quite well and the emotional impact of Harry creating the Patronus is heartfelt without being overwrought.I hope this is not an indication of what is to come for The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix, books that are even more complex and detailed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing!  Just don't skip the books in lieu of the movie!!!,"I was really disappointed with this outing, though I realize I may be prejudiced because this was my favorite book of the series. I knew that having a new director would give a different look, I just don't think it was necessarily a good thing. There were some major things left out that could be confusing to anyone not familiar with the books. For instance in regards to the marauders map...they never explain just who Prongs, Wormtail, Padfoot or Mooney are. There may be something wrong that I know this at my age without having to reference the book...but I love these stories and its disappointing to see them tweeked on the big screen. There is also Harry's patronis taking the shape of a stag...that is never explained either. Further they didn't explain a lot about what an animagious is. Like I said, I know the books so well...maybe that is why I didn't care as much about this rendition. See the movie......but please....read the books! They are so much fun!!!!!!

Best of the moves,"The Harry Potter books used to be my favorites (until I discovered Tolkien), and like the books these movies can't hold a candle to the LOTR films. However, this was definitely a good film, the best so far. The Chamber of Secrets was my favorite in the series, but this movie is much more well done. Still, so many major details were omitted from the film, things that didn't necessarily confuse me, but disappointed me, especially more info on moony/wormtail/padfoot/prongs, because those names symbolize so much throughout the book (like Harry's stag patronus)and even more they are important in the fourth and fifth books too. Also,I thought Emma Thompson was awesome as Professor Trelawney (my favorite HP character), but was underused. The Quidditch Cup was a hilarious scene from the book, an extra 15 minutes or so wouldn't hurt the running time of this movie, so why not include it? Maybe I shouldn't, but I can't help but compare it to LOTR, which is unfair, but still. PJ's changes from the LOTR novels made relevant sense (except for the omission of Glorfindel) and didn't bother me but these HP changes are just too much. Also, in the books Hermione was mildly annoying yet amusing, but in the movie she was downright grating on my nerves. I wanted Malfoy to punch her instead. There was too much sexual innuendo as well...This is a good movie,very well done with nice scenery but I think you can appreciate it more if you HAVEN'T read the books, because then the omissions won't be as glaring and noticeable. Still, 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Director for Best Installment,"Of the first five Harry Potter novels, The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite. It was as if J.K. Rowling had spent the first two stories on a steep professional learning curve, gradually improving her prose while she was finding her feet stylistically. Only in the third book was she so able to focus on the story, weaving an ingenious plot which builds to an immensely satisfying conclusion. I was pleased to learn that a new director had been found to tackle the Prisoner of Azkaban, and the results are, in the main, wonderful. The music and visuals are great, with Hogwarts looking better than in the first two films. There is often so much background detail in each shot, that you will have little chance of taking it all in until the film reaches DVD. The Dementors are scary (though the full horror of their soul-leeching kiss is not really dwelt upon) and the animagus / werewolf effects are effective too. Each of the three lead players has enough to do to develop their character a little more. The assurance of Emma Watson's level-headed Hermione is such that having her, and only her, squealing in every scary scene is a bit difficult to understand. The time traveling plot mechanism is well handled, and unlikely to confuse even younger viewers. This makes it odd that the film makes no effort to state clearly who the characters Wormtail, Moony, Padfoot, and (most importantly) Prongs are discovered to be. The obvious clues are all there, and readers already knew, but at what moment did Harry, Ron and Hermione share this realisation? Overall, this film is well worth going to see.

Another great film in the series!,"This was another fine adaptation of the Harry Potter books, and one could tell that a different director was at the helm. I came away wanting more though, because the action / story made the time go by so quickly. I thought there were a number of things that were left out of the film that will be important in the later films (in terms of the story). For example, there was no mention of the fact that the names from the Marauder's Map (Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prong) were Harry's Father and his friends. That is important because they picked on Severus Snape as a classmate, which explains why Snape treats Harry the way he does.Still, the film is great and I hope Warner Brothers will take a lesson from Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) and consider filming the last three movies close together so we do not have to lose this cast as they grow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Fantastic,"Harry Potter and The prisoner of Azkaban ----- 9/10From a film viewers perspective this film was extremely entertaining. Definately the best of the 3. The characters have grown and seem quite comfortably playing their alter egos, fingers crossed they don't change actors. It was a pleasent change having director Alfonso Cauron take over the ropes from Chris Columbus who did a great job but didn't make the films his own, he was faithful to the books in all persepctives, which don't get me wrong is not a bad thing, but cutting certain scenes out and picking up the pace a little would've made the films far more enjoyable than what they were, they were still great films at that though. Cauron definately saw this film as a chance to show us his creativity and spin on the potter universe, he probably cut too many scenes out especially involving the scene where Harry is caught under the Whomping Willow with Sirius Black, i don't need to say more for those who have not seen the film, but this could've been done so the audience of non-book readers could've picked up the story alot easier. As noted before the film had opened, this third outing is much more darker than the first two. It darker than the darkest parts of 1 & 2 combined and some scene may scare younger children, but made for a far more enjoyable experience for those older fans. The camera work is very stylish indeed and I was glad to see more artistic angles were taken during the production. Finally the quiddicth scene was so well done, you could actually belive this was a real game, shows how much CGI has advanced since 2001 when the first film was released.Overall, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban was a well rounded, stylish, entertaining yet dark film.

My review,"This film marks what I hope to be a turning point in the books adaptation to film, although I should say that I find the first two books somewhat duller than the rest of the series so far.Its darker, a lot darker than the others, Cuaron has done a fantastic job in really bringing the world of the books to life. The Dementors are especially disturbing, you get a single flicker of their mouths, and it's the stuff of nightmares. I will only mention the special effects, as special.The photography is awesome, Seresin pulls off some true jaw dropping panoramas of the Scottish countryside, with close ups on par with his best in Angel Heart. Magic, rather refreshingly features everywhere, and you really get the impression that you have entered a world filled with it.Lupin is portrayed brilliantly by Thewlis, just as I imagined him from the books. Rickman is as amazing as we have all come to expect. Ratcliffe, Watson, and Grint are all light years better than they were in the previous films, we can only hope that these up and comings don't end up as typecast child stars, that would be a waste. Oldman, unfortunately does not really get a chance to emerge as a character due to what seems like heavy time constraints. I look forward to seeing what he does with Sirius in the Goblet of Fire.Which leads me into my only complaint of the film, its been heavily edited to fit into a time slot. This is annoying because you get the feeling that a lot more was filmed and cut out. Overall it just about gets away with some of the story changes, making some composite scenes work quite effectively. I am personally hoping for a directors cut in the near future, as the tapestry that Cuaron weaves is rich and vibrant. A big thumbs up, I don't understand why they are changing the director for the next film though...Oh, did anyone else spot Ian Brown (Stone Roses) stirring a bowl of pea soup magically in the Leaky Caldron :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie was excellent!!!,This movie was great! The kids get better and better in the acting. they were a lot less tense this time around. I feel like a dork cuz I am 21 and like the Harry Potter movies. I never read the books but if they are like the movies they are great. J.K. Rawling has a very wild imagination. It would be great if we could all have friends like those 3. The effects in it are great. The scenery is awesome too. The bird type creature cracks me up. I think I would have a heart attack if I ever seen one of those. It would be great to fly on though. Whoever did they casting in these movies sure did pick a great Harry Potter. Looks just like him. He is adorable.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Sometimes, Change is Good","I have been reading some of the comments and reviews for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and most of what I have read have been comments on how disappointing the overall movie itself was. Especially to the people who have read all of the books and who are adamant on staying faithful to the books and having the whole story involved in the film. Some of the comments I agree with. Like for instance, the movie was a little bit choppy, certain scenes in the movie were not explained in full detail, and at times the scenery and props like the Whomping Willow , Hagrid's House, and Hogwarts itself was completely invisioned in a different way than what we were use to in Chris Columbus'first two versions and that can be a shock and in a way weird to us fans but Columbus and Cuaron' are two totally different directors and they each had an interpretation and vision of what Harry's world would look like. To me, Cuaron' captured a more realistic approach to the film and he allowed a more dark, organic, and even daring feel to POA. I think he did a great job of combining more natural elements with the world of magic. There is nothing wrong with change if you have an open enough mind to except it. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are growing into young adults with adult problems and adult situations and the overall tone of the film coincides with that growth. I give the man much respect and props for being so bold as to completely unveil his version of POA without the sugarcoating and child like qualities that the first two movies had. Harry Potter is geared towards children but all children grow up. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, like I said before in my first review, has it's minor filming flaws but was fantastic in my eyes and I can't wait for all of the other films. I will be very interested in how Mike Newell will interpret Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best in the series,"Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter film. It is the only one in the series that shows the magic of the HP universe while presenting a film mature enough for adults but fun enough for children. Where this film completely beats the others though, is the pacing. Excluding the Shrieking Shack scene, the film never seems rushed. And unlike the films following this one, at no point does a non-fan sit and wonder whats going on. The directors and writers of later HP films trip fail to explain simple plots, but PoA does it with little fuss. Little scenes relevant to the main story appear in between classes, so that the plot keeps moving, something that a film like the Order of the Phoenix, failed at completely.The director in this does very well. The awkwardness present in some scenes in other HP movies is not present here. Scenes are shot through nice camera angles, and the director takes full advantage of the brilliant setting by showing quite a few long shots of the castle. The audio is quite great as well.The acting is an improvement over the last two films, but not great. The only other complain I have is the rushed climactic scene where the trio meet the antagonist. They do a poor job of explaining the twist in the story. One does wonder why the producers spent so much time on classes and then rushed the main part.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow they have grown,"Its amazing to see how all the the kids(teens) have grown since the first movie. Which Rupert, Daniel , and Tom look rather cute I must say. And to me I think Tom has grown the most out of them all. I can't wait to see how they all look by the end of the all the movies. And I can't wait till the final book. Its going to be amazing. And its sad that Richard Harris has died but they did get a good dumbldore. I'm truly looking forward to my Harry Potter Movie Marathon. Thats gonna be fun! What else could I say to use up the rest of lines so I can have this comment submitted. I'm not really doing much rite btw.

The first HP movie that lived up to the books - really great,"I have to say that the movies keep getting better. The first was a dog. This one was really great. The Hippogryph was unbelievable. I don't think i've ever seen a non-humanoid monster look so real. There were some shortcuts in the story line that, had i not read the book, might have left me a little bewildered. But i did, and i loved it! Very exciting! Hope the rest turn out this good..There have been some posts that claim this movie is too dark, i would agree that it's not as ""zany"" as the first movie. But at this stage of the book series, the story gets darker. If you want Zany go watch an Adam Sandler movie. This was a very good portrayal of the book.Matt",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
THE MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC,"I recently saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and I thought it was fantastic. I am a 30 year old, African American woman from New Jersey and I love the Harry Potter series. I know that the series is geared towards children but I just love the series so very much. I have yet to read any of the books but I have seen all of the movies and so far this one is my absolute favorite. This movie is so terrific and so different than the other two films. I love that the film was geared towards more darker, scarier and adult themes. I also loved the fact that Harry Potter is growing up and he is showing a more emotional side to himself. I am glad that we get to see his anger, his sadness, and his strength. I like the way he stood up against the Dursleys, I loved how the students were relaxed and wearing street clothes, I liked the guys hanging out just acting like teenage guys. The special effects were amazing, I loved the blossoming romance between Hermoine and Ron even though they pretend to hate each other. Daniel Radcliffe is turning into a seasoned actor, Emma Watson has grown into a beautiful, strong, and smart character in the film, and Rupert Grint is just a red haired cutie pie with great acting and comedy timing. All in all I thought the movie was great. I love all of the changes and all of the characters and if this is the growth of Harry Potter then they are definitely going in the right direction. This is the best film so far and I predict that its just going to get better and better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
the best yet,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best yet. The plot was amazing and all the humor in the movie made it even better. Alfonso Cuarón did a great job taking over as director.Daniel Radcliffe(Harry) is excellent as always as well as Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermoine). Unfortunetley for all you Malfoy lovers out there this will be his last movie I believe. =(The whole movie in entertaining and very twisted. You'll be guessing what happened the whole movie. There are very good special effects that seem to make the movie more interesting than it already is.I give it a 9 out of 10.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Embracing the Dark Side with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"As Harry Potter embarks on his third year at Hogwarts, the magical world he inhabits takes a subtle yet captivating turn, shedding its whimsical glow and embracing a darker, more mature tone. This transition, under the artistic direction of Alfonso Cuarón, is not a departure from the series' essence, but a natural progression that mirrors the growing maturity of both the characters and the audience that eagerly await their adventures.The introduction of Sirius Black, a convicted murderer and alleged accomplice to the dark wizard Voldemort, casts a chilling shadow over Hogwarts, infusing the story with a suspenseful edge that heightens the anticipation and intrigue. As Harry grapples with his past, his connection to Voldemort, and the lurking threat of evil, the film takes a deeper dive into the complexities of human nature, the enduring power of friendship, and the delicate balance between light and darkness.Cuarón's cinematography masterfully reflects this shift, moving away from the vibrant, fairytale-like aesthetic of the earlier installments and embracing a more muted palette, characterized by shadows and muted tones. This change in visual style enhances the film's emotional depth, creating an atmosphere that is both unsettling and captivating, mirroring the growing darkness that permeates the story.John Williams's iconic score, a hallmark of the series, continues to weave its magic, seamlessly blending moments of suspense and wonder with themes of loss and redemption. The music complements the film's darker tone, adding depth and emotion to the narrative, while still maintaining the touch of magic that has captivated audiences worldwide.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, the trio of young wizards at the heart of the story, deliver their most nuanced performances yet. They capture the growing maturity of their characters, as they navigate the challenges of adolescence alongside the escalating dangers of the wizarding world. Their chemistry shines through, and their bond of friendship remains the cornerstone of the story, providing solace and strength amidst the darkness that surrounds them.Gary Oldman's portrayal of Sirius Black adds a layer of gravitas and complexity to the film, while Helena Bonham Carter's rendition of Bellatrix Lestrange perfectly captures the character's sinister charm and ruthlessness. Together, these new additions to the cast enrich the narrative, adding depth and nuance to the story, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is not just a darker chapter in Harry's journey; it's a more mature and sophisticated one, reflecting the growth of its characters and the evolving expectations of its audience. It's a film that dares to explore the darker corners of the human psyche while still maintaining the magic and wonder that has captivated fans worldwide. For me, this is the pinnacle of the Harry Potter film series, a masterpiece that seamlessly blends adventure, suspense, and character development to create an unforgettable cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Just perfect !,"I just loved the movie, and i'm going to check him out a second time in the movies !It think it is just great that you see the actors like daniël and emma and rupert evolve like they evolve in the story. I am now reading the fourth story of harry potter 'the goblet of fire'. I think it's a movie that anyone must see, it doesn't mather whether you are old or something, just go and watch the movie ! Or buy, borrow it on DVD when he comes out in the videostore (I'm sure as hell going to buy it). But aren't there rumors going that daniël is going to leave the movie after the fourth is recorded ? they are saying he is becoming to old ?

"Visually stunning, but edited poorly","This movie is visually as stunning as anything I've seen in a long time. I'm excited to see it several more times, and I'm looking forward to Curon's handling of the next movie and more.However, I think Azkaban has been edited poorly. There are several dropped threads and essential information that is simply dropped. If you are not a fan of the books and have not read them, you will be, unfortunately, very confused during Azkkaban. If you've read the books, you can follow the plot, but you will similarly miss several important aspects.Dropped threads include: no explanation of who the makers of the Marauder's Map are, (so no explanation of why Harry's Patronus charm looks like a deer); Ron and Hermione's fights due to their pets is very minimal, although it is an essential aspect of the books. Lastly, Harry gets his Firebolt at the end of the movie, which seems a nice reward - but the book used this more as a plot device to push the relationships between the main three characters.The changes aren't all bad, and Curon has certainly tried to make his own movie, instead of just following the books by chapter and verse. However, I'm hoping Curon has followed Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings format - I hope he has another half-hour on his cutting-room floor that he can release on DVD as an ""extended"" edition. This movie sorely needs it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Every Viewer Of This Film Is A PRISONER Due To The Fact That This Is The Best Instalment Of The Series,This is a great film and storyline. It really joins the series together. Everyone stepped up. The cast really pushed themselves for this film. Director Alfonso truly turned this storyline and film into a sensation. Rowling clearly planned this instalment to the point.I gladly enjoyed watching this film like all the other viewers and fans did. This film may not be for every viewer due to the darkness but it truly turns the series around. All of viewers of the series watch the cast grow in each film of the series. It is very impressive to watch them grow and learn as each of their careers become bigger. Fan and viewers of this series would very much enjoy this instalment.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better Than the First Two in Nearly Every Way,"This film improves on the previous two in nearly every single way. It looks a lot better, whether we're talking about the special effects or hogwarts. Speaking of the way this film looks, it is one of the best looking Harry Potter films. In my opinion, even the music got better! Overall, this was a great adaptation of the equally enjoyable book that made me very excited to watch Goblet of Fire.8.8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Dark, and Bloody Brilliant!","No, I haven't read the books; I am more of a Thomas Pynchon reader, but I actually adore these films while I detest mainstream cinema. The direction in this film is much more thoughtful than the previous two. The camera angles are highly effective at setting the mood and intensity of the scenes, and the cinematography is more organic creating a ambient magical realism. The acting is brilliant, to state the obvious and expected, and there is a bit more humor and emotion in this version.While I hear this is a less faithful adaptation, it is the best of the three as far as the film making and storyline goes. Pure Cinematic escapism. It certainly has a little more of an indie aesthetic to it rather than that glitsed and polished Hollywood style of the previous two. A very soulful presentation. Perhaps a little intense for the little munchkins, but nothing too terrible. Buy them an ice cream afterwards, and they'll forget all about the spooks. God bless Gary Oldman!

"RATED 7.7? How is this Possible, These movies are horrible!","Like so many others I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books. It is a totally different story when it comes to the movies. For example I've never seen worse acting in a series of movies before. Yeah I can understand that it is hard to find good 12-year-old actors, but I want to puke every time I see Daniel Radcliffe try and throw out a punch line. In the first two films it was a treat to see one real actor in Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but their replacement is a different story. Maybe I am being too hard on these sad movies because the books were so good, but could they have done no better? Maybe they couldn't afford any better, I mean how much has the three films grossed? Only 2.5 Billion? (Joking) I give this movie a generous 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as I remembered,"This is another puzzling result for me. While reading the book, I was building up watching the movie so much in my head as this was my favorite movie out of the first three, but I couldn't help but find it lacking.Now this film is not bad, not at all. To say this movie is bad would be wrong, but what it does suffer from is the unshakable ""incomplete"" feeling. The film doesn't rush the plot, not completely, but it doesn't ever find any sure footing in pacing or its storytelling. It's far better than its predecessor Chamber of Secrets, which was quite literally all over the place.Now I'll say something else that I'm sure will be unpopular. I honestly didn't find the book to be all that much better, either. The film cuts through the majority of the book to focus on the primary plot. J. K. Rowling, in my opinion, stretched things out to focus on subplots and events that were not all that interesting. Granted, some of these subplots and events are crucial to the overall plot. I still couldn't help but feel that the book scenes lingered and felt longer than they needed to be.Now, some of these details are good to have for background knowledge and could be used to fill in the gaps for the film if the writers and filmmakers inserted those details. But they seem transfixed to just hitting those major plot points, which is a shame because it gives the film that rushed feeling.Irregardless, while Prisoner of Azkaban has its issues, both book and film, it's still an enjoyable entry in the Harry Potter series.IMDb: 7/10

"not the best, but the most well done all around","Where it's sequels and prequels lack, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is better. Unfortunately, it doesn't match up to 'Chamber's' excellent suspense and story, and the action is nowhere near 'Goblet'. But what you do have is a well rounded and fun flick for the whole family. Filled with a stellar cast and a great coming of age story, Harry Potter 3 is a real winner.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown) is now 13 years old, and preparing for his third year at Hogwarts with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). After a weird series of events, Harry finds out that a serial murderer and former Voldemort supporter, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), is out of the wizard prison Azkaban and has his eye set on his next target: Harry.The cast is excellent, but the first notable change is the fact that Dumbledore is new. Richard Harris passed away around the same time that HP2 came out in theaters, so Michael Gambon has taken over the role. He is simply adequate, because he lacks the fatherly affection that Harris had perfected in the 2 movies previously. The trio has certainly grown up, both physically and in terms of skill. As usual, the best is Rupert Grint's Ron, who is terribly adapted here. Most of Ron's lines in the book are said by Hermione, which is not fair to Rupert. Emma Watson is nice as Hermione, and her character has more mystery to her this year, more than ever. You'll like Hermione, but not as much as the boys. Dan Radcliffe is good as Harry, and this is definitely his best film playing the boy who lived. His only bad scene is the emotional scene, but he was only 14 when he made this, so I can let it slide. He gives us what we've been looking for in Harry: a hero. Harry is a hero in this film, no doubt about it. The rest of the cast is perfect. The new Defense teacher, Remus Lupin, is one of my favorite characters in the books, and I must say that David Thewlis nails the part very well. I love him as Lupin, the friend to Harry's father, and the calm and intelligent teacher. Alan Rickman is wonderful as Snape as usual, providing that mystery that makes his character so intriguing. The last cast member I'll review is Gary Oldman's Sirius Black. I can't do too much without ruining the plot, so I'll just say that Gary does typical Gary things here, which is great.The film's direction is its strongpoint, as Alfonso Cuaron directs it much better than Columbus or Newell did in the other films. He totally reverses what we're used to in the Potter world, and makes the characters like they should be: teens who don't care about uniforms. Good music and costuming as well make this an enjoyable watch. Steve Kloves...well...he's not that good of an adapter, but I have to say that this is his second best job to date, as his best would be Sorcerer's Stone. Overall, the animation is good, the music and costumes are good, the writing is above average, the acting is superb, and the direction is superb. Harry Potter 3 is a great threequel that does a good job of helping Harry grow up.8/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Editing cut out important detail,"This excellent film was easy to follow since we had read the book with our kids. However, had I been the director (not much chance of that) I definitely would have explained the meaning, on the Maurauder's Map, of ""Mooney (Lupin), Wormtail (Petegrew), Padfoot (Black), and Prongs (Potter's dad, James). The context/depth of their friendship was absent as was the significance of Harry's Patronis - the stag. The degree of Petegrew's betrayal can't be fully appreciated without that background. Without the book, following the reltionships would have been confusing. Superb, even touching, scenes of Harry having several discussions with Proff.

The best so far.,"Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is a curious movie. It is probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, being a bit more sinister & gothic in both the look & content. It has, on the whole, better performances from the cast than the other movies. It doesn't seem to drag like the first 2 did in places. And the special effects are dazzling. Yet, as I pondered the movie a couple of hours after I had seen it. I found myself thinking `Yes it was probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, but what was missing' Well I eventually realised what was missing after watching the HP & the Chamber of Secrets' with my kids later that evening. I shall come to the missing ingredient a little later. It's Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts School of Wichcraft & Wizardry, & yet again he is caught up in mysterious goings on. The mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard's prison `Azkaban' & is making a B-line for Hogwarts & in particular, it seems, Harry himself. It transpires that Sirius Black was the wizard responsible for the Death of Harry's parents, at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. As a result, the guards of Azkaban, or Dementors (think floaty Ringwraiths), have been stationed at Hogwarts to try to stop him. They do seem more intent on trying to suck the soul out of our hero. (That's what a Dementor does to its victim. It sucks all of the goodness out them until they are nothing but a living shell of a human). Add to this a Werewolf, a Hippogriff (a half horse, half eagle that can fly) & a menacing black dog that seems to be stalking Harry, & you have movie choc full of mystery & marvel. Now to the positives & negatives. Alfonso Cuaron has managed to get the best out of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). He seems to be more at ease in front of a camera, when delivering his dialogue & you get the feeling that he has actually been given the proper encouragement & coaching. He seems to be a far more confident actor than the wooden puppet of the previous films. The other child actors are also very good, with both Emma Watson & Rupert Grint (Hermione Grainger & Ron Weasley) showing that they could have big careers ahead of them. In fact, the cast as a whole are pretty damn good. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane & Dame Maggie Smith all slide comfortably back in to their usual rolls & are, as usual, excellent. The new members of the cast are also very good, with David Thewlis excellent as Professor Lupin and the magnificent Gary Oldman (chewing up & spitting out every scene he is in, with relish) as the sinister Sirius Black. The actor with the hardest job out of the whole cast was Sir Michael Gambon. He had the unenviable task of replacing the late Sir Richard Harris. Thankfully he slips in to Dumbledore's robes with the minimum of fuss, playing it more as a bumbling old hippy rather than the imperious & imposing Harris' Dumbledore.The only real disappointment in the cast is Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney. She over compensates for limited screen time, with over the top, hammy nonsense. The visual effects, as you might expect, are top notch. Cuaron seems to have taken a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book, letting the visual effects fit around the movie rather than the George Lucas style of let the visual effects be the movie. The pacing of the film is just about spot on as well. It's not too long & it manages to stick to the book fairly well (although the lack of explanation about the origins of the Marauders Map was fairly irritating).But. There were a few minus points as well as that missing thing I mentioned earlier. Again, as with the first two movies, Alan Rickman is woefully under-used as the bitter & twisted Prof. Snape & the same goes for the glorious Gary Oldman & his movie stealing performance. And the biggest thing to be missing was a standout action set-piece.In both previous movies, there have been major spectacular set pieces that have really stuck in my mind. In the first one (The Philosophers Stone) there was Harry's first Quidditch match & the Giant Chess match. In the second (The Chamber of Secrets) there was the flight to Hogwarts in the Weasley's Ford Anglia, another impressive Quidditch match, the escape from Aragog's lair (Aragog is a giant spider) & the battle with the giant Basilisk (Snake). Yet in Azkaban, there is nothing that stands out (apart from performances which some would say isn't a bad thing). Harry Potter films need a good set piece or two. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good action sequences. The journey by Knightbus, Quidditch in a thunderstorm, a Hippogriff flight sequence & a werewolf/dog fight. It's just that you get the feeling that you've seen similar before, so there is no real wow factor.On the whole this is a mightily impressive movie. Alfonso Cuaron delivered a movie as magical as the first two movies but with more depth & much better performances by the impressive cast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dementingly Good!!!,"An excellent interpretation of the book (the best one). The performances of the three leads were vastly improved and David Thewlis' turn as Lupin is a highlight. However, the real hero is Alfonso Cuaron who has created a mesmerizing movie which fully encapsulates the darkness of the Prisoner of Azkaban and is wonderfully shot!! The cinematography was spot on as Hogwarts and the surrounding countryside has never looked so beautiful. The Dementors are just as imagined and the cinema was full of fear everytime they appeared. All in all an excellent movie in its own right and one which will get multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magical,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is easily my favourite of the three Harry Potter films so far. The real magic of this film is that, simply put, it is the first in the series to really make optimal use of the medium of film to look at some different aspects of the world of Harry Potter.In the movie, we see things that were not in the book, but could have been. From a simple and quick scene of the boys in Gryffindor trying candies that make them sound like different animals, to the very vocal shrunken heads that show up on the Knight Bus and in the town of Hogsmeade, and to the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes made to Hogwarts itself, we get little glimpses into this world that we haven't seen before, even if we've read all of the books cover to cover and back again.With that in mind, ""Azkaban"" is remarkably faithful to the book. The core of the story is there, and the characters really come to life. Some of the details are glossed over, and one of our family's favourite minor characters, Sir Cadogan, is given short shrift (take heart, he does show up in the deleted scenes). Nevertheless, the humour of the book and the essential nature of the characters and the story are captured in this film almost perfectly.Running heavily throughout this film is the theme of time. Anyone who's read the book already knows why this is, but from the moment the students get to Hogwarts one can't help but notice the gigantic pendulum swinging back and forth in the entrance hall, or the massive gears of a clock, always moving, in the big window at the front of the school. The change of seasons is also handled in a very clever visual motif. In the last 20 minutes or so of the film time is an even stronger presence, as even the music takes on a steady rhythm, like the ticking of the clock. Time, its passage and its usage, is a very important theme to this story, and the film makes good use of it.In terms of the technical aspects, ""Azkaban"" also makes a standout impression. The visual effects really do the story justice, and are seamless rather than a distraction. Even more than that, the design of the film really captures both the wonders and the horrors of Harry Potter's world. The changes made to the look of Hogwarts work to its benefit, and the design of Trelawney's classroom fits her personality perfectly. The design of the Dementors, on the other hand, is absolutely blood-chilling -- even more frightening than I had imagined them. The acting, particularly that of the kids, has undergone vast improvements, and the addition of talents like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black certainly didn't hurt. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise was David Thewlis, who portrayed Professor Lupin perfectly.I've been pretty harshly critical about John Williams' music for the previous two Potter films, as I felt that his work for them was bland and unremarkable, and the series deserved better. Finally, for the third film, we got it. Williams' music for ""Azkaban"" is rich and adds depth to the story. At times he adopts a classical, almost baroque style in the music, while at others he allows it to be more whimsically modern. The music for the last twenty minutes or so, with the aforementioned theme of time worked into it, is one of the best pieces I've heard from Williams in a long time. My hat is off to John Williams for finally giving Harry Potter the music he deserves.Alfonso Cuaron, who takes the directing helm for ""Azkaban,"" has really done something amazing. Throughout the film he walks the fine line between the scary aspects of the story (very scary indeed) and the humorous ones (very funny indeed), so that neither seems out of place, even when they're happening in the same scene. His attention to detail is outstanding, and the result is that we see in ""Azkaban"" many complex scenes with multiple events happening at once. The main characters may be having a discussion, while in the same room we see ghosts chasing one another in the Headless Hunt, or chairs putting themselves on a table, and remarkably it never gets confusing or overwhelming. These things add to the effect I mentioned earlier, of exploring the world of Harry Potter more fully while still telling the story. For the first time in this film one really gets a feeling for the richness and breadth of that world, as we have already seen in the books.My family and I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter films immensely, but for me, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first movie in the series that I felt truly lived up to the book, not only because it stayed true to the essentials of the story, but also because it felt free to explore new aspects of the world of Harry Potter. Part of the magic of the books is that they give us new wonders to enjoy, and finally we have a film that weaves the very same spell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Could I have asked for a better movie?,"Before anybody reads this, I want you all to know that I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and I am a fan of each and every one of them. Saying that, I'd like to express how much of a fan I am of this movie. I must confess that I was a little disappointed that the explanation of Harry's patronus and how it relates to the Marauder's Map was left out, but everything else about this movie made up for it. The music, special effects, acting, scenery, and surprisingly dark and stylish cinematography are all high points of this film. The book is something else, but this movie stands out on its own. I was so astonished and excited on how different this film was from the others, and I think that a change in director was very necessary, and it worked out fantastic. I am an avid fan of both books and movies and their adaptations, and I am able to view a film separate from it's book. This is a brilliant film and I still find it very enjoyable while being a fan of the book as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too dense,"Though the filmmaking was excellent, and the music... FANTASTIC ! I think the story was too fast. I have not read the book, nor I have read any HP book, BTW, but I think this desserved to last at least 90 more minutes. Many events such as the quidditsch match or HP adoptive family have been neglected. Actually, there were lenghty moments as well, like the bus ballad or Harry flying across the lake but I can accept these part were that lenghty (not long). So, the perfect Harry Potter would be as dense as the second one, as magic as the first (which benefitted from the surprise effect) and as intimate as this one. I also loved the fact it didn't have a real climax but rather soemthing really cleverly put together instead, I won't spoil around but I liked the way Harry could get two views of the same scene. Anyway, it was good enough to get a respectable 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hey,"The movie is very good. I gave it an 8, but if you haven't read the book there are going to be parts where you won't know what's happening because they cut out some of the main points to make sure that the movie didn't run too long. So my suggestion is to read the book first or if you've already seen it and haven't read the book read it now. And the fact that the books keep getting longer is going to be a problem when making the movies because they, everyone involved with the film, have to cut out a lot of stuff so that people will be able to sit through the whole movie. Otherwise, and again, it was a very good movie and I recommend that you see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This is my favourite fim of all time.,"I think this is one of the best Harry Potter films. And I guess lot of watcher agrees with me about that. We started to see more magical devices and creatures in this film. I really LOVE this film's plot so much. It has timetravelling and such an amazing cast. There is a lot of things about before Harry's like that fans always had wondered. I am really happy about that as a big fan of it. My favorite film kind is fantasy and sci-fic. That's why I watched lots of films in that categorys. And in my opinion Harry Potter is one of the best films ever in that categorys. I also read all of the Harry Potter books like a thousand times and this film was really fits good with books. It is because of the director. The directors always had changed in Harry Potter. And I think this flim's director was way better than the last ones. And althoug I love it's dubbed version, I'll always prefer subtitles. Because I like actors and their accents and acting skills so much. I love Harry Potter films so much. I was a kid when I first watch them. And I started to watch them whenever I am want. But most of the time I watch them whenever I felt sad, anxious, stressed, upsad etc... Bassicaly when I felt something negative because they make me feel really good. So it's my confort show. Like Emma Watson (one of the stars in film) said ""When things get really dark and times are really hard, there is something about Harry Potter that makes life richer""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Expectations met...,"Out of every Harry Potter movie I have seen, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best thus far. It fulfilled and exceeded my expectations in each area-it was funny, serious, scary and mature enough to keep me intrigued. It is wonderful to see these young actors taking on roles that in some areas of the world are hard to make believable. With their talents, enthusiasm, apparent dedication to the film and a great script, they have made the Harry Potter series what it has become: something for everyone.I have read the books and I must say it is a true pleasure being able to put characters' names to faces-It makes the reading experience so much better.

A positive comeback.,"I am uneasy person with long sequels and I was prepared for a disaster when I started to watch the movie. I am not Harry Potter fan either so after the over-boring Chamber of secrets, my expectations towards this one were even lower. Luckily this part was a positive surprise. It was but a darker and more exciting sequel it was also funny to watch. It seems the creator team really paid attention to the details and didn't rush with this part same way as with the previous part.The new creatures, ""the demendors"", were very interesting and frightening and gave the movie totally new power and danger. The overall tension of the film was also way darker than in the first two. This time the danger was something real and in presence all the time.On the other hand the movie had not forgotten the humor either. The first episode in ""real"" world was refreshing and very fun to watch.In the Chamber of secrets, the wonderful outdoors were more forgotten and we spent unnecessary long time inside the dark halls with little of interesting details. One of the few scenes outside in that one were actually inside a greenhouse which points out how forgotten the outside world really was.This time we will see the wonderful visual side of Hogwarts once more and it is even more detailed than in the first one. The creator team seemed to have realized the infinite possibilities what kind of a world they can create and how well the nature can be combined with it. Along with the nature we will be introduced with several new interesting creatures of the wild too that all have their meaning and part in the movie.The growing up of the actors bring the own spice to the movie. It opens up the chance for elements which were not possible with the children. It seems the old actors are starting to get used to with their roles since they felt more comfortable and seemed to handle their characters better than previously.The biggest flaw with the old movies was the way most students were left behind and the ""hero trio"" seemed to have the spotlight on all the time although the events were supposed to affect the entire Hogwarts. This time that matter feels more logical because the danger is more centered to Harry Potter, not to the overall school life. Also the teachers seem to be more alive and actually take a contact with the events and the students. In the first movies they seemed to wish someone would get hurt.It still doesn't mean the movie is perfect. It has its own flaws with some of its illogical and slightly paradoxical scenes. Also although the movie lasts for nearby 2½ hours, it still feels like it needed something more. It doesn't fill the idea of a complete feature film with the beginning, the halfway and the ending. To be honest the sign ""to be continued"" would have suited to the ending very well.Overall the movie is a refreshing return to Hogwarts. The story has gained a new strength the actors are more confident with their characters. Also the atmosphere of the magical world lingers in the movie again. As a non-fan, I found this movie to be a far more successful sequel than the previous Chamber of Secrets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Darker, deeper and better. The best 'Potter' so far.","My Take: The best of the novels come to the screen as the best of the blockbusters.Even as an avid fan of J.K. Rowling's bestselling enterprise that took the teenage generation by storm, I wasn't able to read the first two books in the series before having seen the movies, which were instant blockbuster attractions at their best. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was the only book in the series I have read so far, and the film adaptation, directed by acclaimed director Alfonso Cauron (1995's THE LITTLE PRINCESS), is the best and most entertaining of the series so far (even with the inclusion of later chapters GOBLET OF FIRE and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX). All from the brilliant characters, exuberant special effects and elaborate plot twists, PRISONER OF AZKABAN offers it all in yet another involving and intriguing fantasy adventure.It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year in Hogwarts, and its gloomier this time around (and not just because Cauron gave Hogwarts a gloomier makeover). Harry, along with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are thrown in to a gloomier adventure shrouded with peril and mystery when a convicted murderer named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the ""inescapable"" Azkaban prison with rumors all pointing to his vengeance on Harry and his family. See, Black is supposed to be the evil Voldemort's (aka ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"") shady accomplice who led him to killing Harry's parents, but I bet you all know that. Harry wants to avenge his parents death of course, but the plot grows thicker than that and they (and you) are thrown into a bigger, more exciting adventure than you expected.The characters are as attractive as ever and the special effects are more seamless, but what makes AZKABAN superior to the previous films (which are both still grand in fashion) is the darker, more efficient directorial approach by Cauron. Filling in from his predecessor Chris Colombus, Cauron does everything Colombus has offered us in the previous films with the addition of a whole lot more. Although I feel that comparing this both Cauron and his predecessor Colombus give their own style to their own adaptations, I agree with other critics saying the film as the one that definitely doesn't feel like reading the books in style (not that I felt both previous movies, which I loved, felt like on-screen book-reading). Cauron isn't afraid to risk a little from the fans by altering some elements from the book, making the film much more than an impressive adaptation but a perfect stand-alone effort that would be more pleasant and fitful to the series' non-fans. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the kind of movie the words ""movie magic"" is meant for.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
So So,"OK ! I had the pleasure of watching this at the Odeon in Leicester Square on the 31st, part of the reason I enjoyed the film was down to the excellent atmosphere created by so many fans in one place, and the sheer scale of this old theatre.I've read the books so many times, but wouldn't really call myself a potter nut, and found the film to be good, but not as good as I thought it could be. The acting is great at the whole atmosphere of the film is spot on, a lot darker than the previous two but it fits in with plot line perfectly. The bad points all stem from the sheer length of this book compared to the previous two. Where as they were fairly short books and therefore translated into scripts without loosing to much plot, obvious sacrifices had to be made to squeeze it all in. You really need to stop thinking ahead in this film, and don't assume you know what sort of dialogue or scene you are going to see next just because its that way in the book.A great film none the less, and heres hoping that the next film will be just as good .. who knows though, after all the books keep getting longer ..",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A slight improvement over the second.,"I liked this one better than the second one. I don't know what it was, but something about this movies tone and mood, as well as the way it was crafted together gave me a better feeling for it. Now directed by a new director, a lot of things have changed, including the cinematography, the visuals, the plots, and altogether the directing. This one is more adventurous, more loose, more fitting with the book, and a lot more progressing.Harry's third year consists of a serial killer whose escaped from Azkaban named Sirius Black, (Gary Oldman) trying to find and kill him. This causes Harry to be extra cautious this year, trying to avoid both him, and the dreadful dementors of Azkaban trying to find Sirius as well. Like I said, progresses the series quite well. The first two were very similar together, with similar looks, settings, and costumes. This one goes a little less decorative, but still exciting.The music score is still by John Williams, which will never die. The plot holes are a lot more clean, and the suspense is 10x bigger. Its also a lot more emotional, talking a lot about Harry's parents, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin, was a good friend of James and Lily Potter.Doesn't refer to the other as much, but maybe thats a good thing, to focus more on the main plot. Also has really cool new material in it, introducing us to new and magical things that you wish you could do.Still could have a little bit more to it. Still doesn't compete with the original one, but still one of the top ones of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A dark and a mysterious film,"Played by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Gary Oldman, the soundtrack was written by John Williams and is based on the novel written by J. K Rowling Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the most mysterious and complicated of the first three because in this film we see the mysterious past of Harry Potter and in which they involved one person that everybody describe as ""devil"", ""the worst person in the world"", ""traitor"" and ""the one who killed their friends"", but the film is not just dark and mysterious just because of the incredible story that J. K wrote once, it's awesome and darker because of the style that director gave to the film, the different sets, the color palette, and I think the most important things: he gave an identity to each Hogwarts house and every character and Cuaron did a great job keeping the mystery of Sirius Black, in spite he left many important aspects that are only mentioned in the book.And we need to mention that Harry Potter was dubbed in Spanish by talented people as Victor Ugarte, Rodrigo Murray, Priscila Reyes, Damian Alcazar and Jesus Ochoa.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The only magic from this movie came from the wands!,"As a Potter fan who has read all books and read them to my children, I was very disappointed in this film. It was made for adults and not for the children which it was intended. It felt like a bad 1970's art-house movie, scenes were uneven, lacked any explanation for those few people that never read the books (like my husband) and even felt amateurish. Who was the man handling the camera in some of these jerky shots? For as much money that these movies made, the special effects were pathetic. I mean look at the butterfly as a short example, this isn't IFC this is Hollywood, use that money!!!!!!!!! True many of the story lines were true to the book but so many that were used were not explained fully and became an inside joke to many that read it. I love the fact that everyone is growing and aging in real life and we can grow with them, but I felt Columbus gave us the magical sense from the books, wonder and awe. So much was filmed outside (yes Hogwarts castle was wonderful to see from all angles) but it seemed the basis of this movie was scenery rather than character depth. No blame to the characters in the movie they were awesome as usual, I feel the director was not the right choice for this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hogwarts Gets Moody,"In the magical world of cinematic sorcery, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" stands out like a Hippogriff in a chicken coop. Director Alfonso Cuarón took a swig of Felix Felicis and transformed the Potter franchise into a darker, more stylish beast. Gone are the days of candy-colored wizardry; welcome to the era where Hogwarts robes are a bit more worn and the Forbidden Forest actually looks forbidden. It's like someone told Cuarón, ""Make it spooky, but make sure a 12-year-old can still watch it without needing a night light.""The time-turner sequence? Cinematic gold. It's like ""Groundhog Day"" with wands and a werewolf. Watching Hermione punch Draco again? I could do that all day! And let's not forget the Knight Bus, stretching and squeezing through London like it's in a city-wide game of magical Tetris. The Dementors, though, are the real MVPs. They float around Hogwarts like gloomy goth balloons at a depressing birthday party. Whoever thought soul-sucking misery could look so cool?However, I deducted half a star because, let's face it, Harry's hair in this one was a bigger mess than the plot of ""Goblet of Fire."" And while we're talking about hair, can someone explain why Professor Lupin looks like he's been living off coffee and despair? ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a ride on a Firebolt: fast, thrilling, and it leaves your hair a mess. It's the cinematic equivalent of finding a secret passage in Hogwarts - you know you probably shouldn't go in, but you just can't help yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
WOW!!!,"I was very very surprised with the quality of this movie. Cuaron is just what the series needed, he is fantastic director,I don't mind the changes in the Griffindor entrance, or the location of W. Willow or Hagrid's Hut, or the fact that Harry got his Firebolt at the end of the term or other situations of the book that got the ax because of time limitations. I say that those arguments against the movie are miscellaneous, even when I adore the books and in fact have read them 5 times each. The scenery, the special effects are better, the camera angles, the movie is funnier, darker, and much more enjoyable to watch and it is not only because the story is better. Well yes the story is much better than the previous books but Cuaron had a lot do with the fact that The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the 3. Also, I have to add the magnificent cast who were perfect in every way in their portrayals, Dan Radcliffe(Harry), Emma Watson(Hermione), Rupert Grint(Ron), Gary Oldman(the Prisoner), Maggie Smith(Prof. Minerva M.), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), David Thewlis(Lupin) and even Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) for which I had reservations(because I wanted another actor who portrayed another wizard ""Gandalf"") but he was also very good and exceeded my expectations just as the movie has. I give this movie a 10 and hope Cuaron does come back to direct the Order of the Phoenix or one of the other remaining stories and I also hope for no more changes in the actors PLEASE the series would never be the same if they change any of the actors who portray the main characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great cinematography and music, my favourite Harry Potter movie","Chris Columbus did an excellent job setting up the world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts with two exciting kids movies which adults could also greatly enjoy. Alfonso Cuarón manages to capture the same sense of magic while taking things to the next level in various ways.The kids are given more individuality in the way they wear their school uniforms and also get to wear more casual clothes. Apparently much of the filming was moved to Scotland and there are lots of gorgeous landscapes, some beautiful views. Overall, more time is spent outdoors, showing things we have yet to see. The cinematography is very creative. There are many impossible shots, including some which pass through mirrors. They make you pause and think, wait, how'd they do that? You can't just say ""cgi"" because you can see the actors clearly and the camera seems to move smoothly. However it's done, it's impressive, draws you in and makes the movie much more fun.The story is just as good as the first two movies, giving us some more insight into Harry's parents and what happened leading up to the fateful night he received his scar. One of the new characters is Lupin (David Thewlis) who becomes a kind of paternal figure for Harry, helping him develop useful skills and understand his own emotions. Gary Oldman is excellent as always, in this case a crazed murderer but entwined in a mysterious past which we gradually learn more about. There are plenty of twists and turns in the plot. One popular device is made use of, perhaps better than in any other movie. There are a number of nice details which enhance it greatly.There is a theme of light in the movie. Finding light in the darkness. Finding hope and inner strength at the right time. Lifting yourself up by your bootstraps. This movie is in many ways more personal than the previous two. It is less epic in scope and more focused on betrayal, lies and finding the truth. And also about inner conflicts. It's hard to say much else without giving things away.This movie touches on themes of sadness and fear more directly than most movies ever do. They're universal emotions that everyone can relate to. Our childhood might not be the same as Harry's, but most of us can relate to distant happy memories which we can't even tell are real. We all yearn for some lost golden age from the past from time to time. Many of us have times when we realise we'd falsely judged someone, not knowing the full truth.HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban is also full of humourous moments, clever details which are easy to miss in the background, multiple seasons and cool transitions between them, creative ways of filming scenes and moments of true pathos. John Williams' music is great as always with two stand-out parts being when Harry rides Buckbeak and the theme Window to the Past. This is one of the best fantasy movies of all time - I wish Cuarón got to direct more of the HP movies!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Internal/darker Harry Potter,"So I never saw the second Harry Potter, but a few weeks back on a bus to New York City, I saw the third Harry Potter film. Sure the conditions were less than adequate for viewing such a would-be mega movie, but it managed to keep me occupied on the trip down.So what can I say? It was entertaining enough. At times I had a hard time following the storyline or the significance of the various elements of the film. This one also wasn't able to pin down what it was trying to say as well as the first one, although it appeared to be similar in tone, despite the overall ""darkness"" of the film. I think the film would've benefited tremendously from a larger screen presentation with a proper sound system, so I'm going to adjust the final score +1 because of the limited presentation facilities onboard the bus.That said, the film is a bit internal. There's a lot to learn about the world that the film tries to express and although a lot of it isn't necessary, it's all hinted at, which made me feel like I was missing out not reading the books, at the same time, it also made me feel like the film wasn't self-contained enough, not knowing the significance of the creatures, spells and etc. occurring in the film.Anyway, it was entertaining enough for a bus ride and I'm sure it could be even better in a proper environment. 7/10 (6/10 on a bus, adjusted for poor viewing environment/sound).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the greatest,"for me , the film concentrated on being scary ... it was over all a waste of money for everyone who worked on this film... to think the director / script writer didn't go in depth with the characters enough was just plain stupid... it had the potential to be a great film , after all it was my favorite book... it was also way to short ... and very very choppy... i did like the depiction of the dementors and i do like how the character of Sirius and Remus came out ... just next movie i hope they try to be more about the feelings of the book , than trying to scare people... i did enjoy seeing Harry's aunt blow up...and the fact that all the characters have slightly evolved... well thats all i guess , i would have liked it a lot more if it were in depth just even a bit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"I'm 27 and I love Potter... is it good, Doctor?","When they released Harry Potter's first movie I must confess I was a little bit reluctant; I mean, I thought it was gonna be such an stupid thing like all those Walt Disney 90's products (Mermaid, Alladdin, and so), those movies that are to be watched by stupid children. Anyway, I decided to watch it (I hadn't read none of the books neither), and it was quite a surprise. It reminded me of some great fantasy movies that I've always loved such as ""Labyrinth"", ""Neverending Story"", etc. I really liked it, and I liked the second part two. Mr. Columbus made an outstanding job to be enjoyed by children, adults, grandpa's Now this ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" came with some changes: first of all the director wasn't Chris Columbus anymore, and instead of him they recruited Alfonso Cuarón (""Y Tu Mamá También""). I thought that he wouldn't be as good as Columbus, just because he has no experience on filming fantasy stuff, full of special effects and with a big big budget But then again I was wrong: Cuarón has demonstrated that he is as good in this genre than in any other else.""Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban"" is the darkest movie of this series, full of terrifying creatures, and with a nice plot. You won't look away for a second all along its 140 minutes of length. The story it catches you, that fantasy world, Howard's, the teachers, the talking pictures!, and some secrets that are revealed. The starring trio does it as well as in the two previous parts. We've lost Richard Harris as the director of the school (rest in peace, Mr. Harris), but Michael Ganbom makes a honorable substitution. We got some new teachers two, such as Emma Thompson's weird character (look at those glasses!!!), and last but not least, we got the Prisoner of Azkaban: the histrionic (that's why I love him, any problem about it?) and excessive Gary Oldman.The best that someone can say about a movie like this is that it is QUITE an entertaining artifact. I like drama, and social cinema but from time to time you need to go back to your childhood, and escape from this adult world watching movies like Harry Potter's ones.My Rate: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best  So Far,"This movie is by far the best of the three Harry Potter movies already released. Compared to the other two, this one has much better directing. The acting skills have improved, especially in the children, perhaps due to the actor's maturity. The new scenery in this movie is really fitting: the rolling hills, the steps down from the castle, the bridge: it fits the magical, historic, and mysterious mood of the books and the idea of Harry Potter's world. Many arguments have been made that its inconsistent with the writing in the book, which is true to an extent, but one must realize that exact following of book plots does not always make a good movie. In this respect, I thought the editing was very good. Complaints: Although a much better movie singularly, there is a definitely rough transition between movies 2 and 3. Also, the Dumbledore from movies 1 and 2 was better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"visually enchanting, but flawed","ah, the third installment of the harry potter saga. it's probably the prettiest and atmospherically the most magical of all harry potter movies, however! oh, there's a big ""however"", and the only way I can describe it aptly is - well, it's stuttering!let me explain this - if one has read the book, one might be surprised at the mix-up of many a detail - chronologically, situationally, character-development wise. this film is bold enough to not be afraid of a change here and there. what was borderline hate in the book has turned into a very early blossom of romance in the movie. what took a few good chapters in the book only takes a single clever scene in the movie! brilliant! but with this brilliance there's also darkness - the film has distanced itself from the book enough to make the viewer think it has all it takes to have a proper structure and meaning, it makes the viewer think that the movie can stand on its own legs! alas, it can not. by distancing itself from the book with so many changes it hasn't been able to build up its own foundation. important scenes from the book have been cut short or out entirely to anger of the devoted fan of the book, yet the scenes almost unique to the movie do little to fit in with the whole story, at best. at worst, they make, well, no sense.and all together this creates a problem of pacing - some scenes rush by in mere seconds, while others surprise you with their lack of sense, leaving you dumbfounded as to what they mean in the context of the whole movie.it doesn't help that the acting's really weird in this one. it's almost campy at its most dramatic, yet it's also a bit more interesting than the previous hp movies considering the lead actors are a bit older in this one.still, I feel great sadness. a magical movie, but deeply flawed for me - no longer being true to the book, yet not being too well on its own. 6/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

My son read the book, so I picked it up to make sure he read it, and was really good.

The second was the Marauders Map, how did Prof. Lupin know how to use it. That shows just how close the four friends really were and why everyone thought that Black was so evil their nicknames on the map were not even mentioned. Hopefully, that will be on the DVD.

A serial killer has escaped azkaban a magic prison for the worst of the worst of criminals. This so called serial killer searches for harry potter with some unlikely news.This was the best of the three movies so far but they left even more out of this one.

Excellent,"Darker and a lot more magical than the two previous movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban comes highly recommended. The three main actors have all aged but this works better with the heavier subject matter of the third installment of the Potter franchise. Michael Gambon is excellent as Richard Harris' replacement for Dumbeldore and after about half of the movie you fail to notice the actor has been changed. Emma Thompson and Dawn French are amusing in supporting roles. My only gripe is that the excellent Alan Rickman as Professor Snape was once again criminally unused, and overall it's astonishing how little screentime the A-list actors receive! Draco Malfoy is also totally useless in this movie - what happened to that boy? I figured by now he'd been inspiring fear, not laughs. Perhaps not suitable for very younger children - my 3 1/2 year old found the werewolf scenes a bit tense, to say the least. My eight-year old loved it, however. Overall, a strong 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magical third outing for Harry and friends,"After the disappointing second HP film I found this to be a welcome return to form. Prisoner features a strong plot, neat dialogue and the usual powerful supporting cast to back up the child stars. I have not read any of the books, so am unable to comment as to whether the rather long time it takes to get to any action is due to the screenplay or source material. However, this more adult and darker episode (allowing Oldman, Thewlis and Rickman to up the dramatic ante) should please fans of the books and casual observers alike - plus, having well established Hogwarts in the first two films, little backfill is necessary.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't expect sugar and spice,"As a true Potter addict, this is by far my favourite of the three. But don't expect any nice sugariness as we saw in the first two. With Columbus gone, we are left with the darker effects of Mr Caurons direction, which makes for a more grown up and serious Harry Potter. Viewers will note that the pictures might seem a bit cold and blue and that some of the original set has been moved around, just some little touches added by Cauron. Gone are the cheesy lines from the first books such as Harmiones obsession with Harry's broken glasses. The young actors seem far more at ease with themselves in the skin of their characters, showing greater maturity and understanding. You will also notice the humour that comes under the hand of Cauron. The new soundtrack, again by master of film scores John Williams, is very different from the often repetitive music from the first two films in the series, not as catchy but more devisive. Fans of the book will not be disappointed with this reproduction, but be warned that some scenes are a little disturbing, even for some sensitive adults, and not all children will be impressed. If you are lucky enough to have your hands on the DVD, don't forget to check out the extras disc for some truly entertaining moments with the Shrunken Head, engaging interviews and fun games.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
liked chamber of secrets better,"well well well - what can i say - it is a great movie - well done - visually it is a treat. it starts with the usual drama of how harry is being treated badly and his dose of sweet revenge - perhaps a bit overdone and it is beginning to look dated. the bus to the leaky cauldron is terrific. superb editing and a nice tension mixed with some comic elements - not kiddish at all. the main reason this movie falls below the second one is because the plot is not well developed by the director. i don't feel the angst for the escaped prisoner and i keep asking myself what has he done - of course, of course, he has been involved in the murder of his parents you dumbo - that qualifies for him to be hated so much, to be imprisoned for 12 years......wish the director had some visualisation of the murder of Harry's parents or about Azkaban and its horrific nature etc. or simply about Siruis himself...the movie almost starts with the character in it and goes no further to create that tension to dislike him....i did'nt develop strong feelings for Sirius black and there the plot feel a few notches compared to the previous movie the chamber of secrets i felt here the story line is a bit weak. the chamber of secrets had a great ending with the fight sequence with voldermot et al. the ending here - the tim e travel etc is lever but not so engaging and feels a bit affected...the dementors have been conceived very well...the cold, dark, menace they are comes across superbly. hermione's character is well developed while Rons's roles is too shallow. Harry of course is the hero and has done a great job. some predictable elements like poor malfoy getting bashed up etc...and i wonder whether it was at all necessary to have the divination teacher ( emma thompson)...felt very flaky and purposeless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
the scar - right or left temple,"In the scene after Prof Lupin demonstrates the way to get over the worst fears - i noticed harry's scar was on his left temple...did I make a mistake or was it wrong..did anyone else notice?a small point but i suddenly felt that there was an error and...i asked my wife who was in the movie but she could'nt say for sure...the dementors looked meana nd cold,hermione has shaped up well, cuaron deserves credit for allowing the character to mature wisely.siruis black doesn't evoke any emotion in me at all..he is as cold as the dementors.i loved the werewolf scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Harry Potter now has more storyline, mystery and entertainment- enough to fill your satisfaction","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the one Harry Potter I remember.Harry once again takes the trip to Hogwarts, ready to go to school. But, things do not happen very smoothly. First of all, he learns that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, and may be searching for Harry. Second of all, during the train ride to Hogwarts, Harry gets attacked by Dementors, which are creatures who know how to replicate your worst fears and memories.If anything, Harry Potter remains to be a fun movie, even if Harry's worst fear is fear itself, is unrealistic, even for a fantasy film. (and a but clichéd too) Everything is different from the older ones. There are new teachers, new spells, new creatures, and even a great twist at the end. I'm not sure if this is the best of all the Harry Potters, but it certainly ranks among that region, at least until I see the new one.8/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great acting, true to the book in spirit and detail.","It is such a thrill to see a fine book become a fine film -- more so in this than even in the previous two films in this series. The kids are becoming quality screen performers, and the adult actors are uniformly of high quality. The look and feel of the film are very true to the book, and yet it is clearly very cinematic, not literary, in plotting and style. Our whole family, all fans of the books, enjoyed it immensely.David Thewlis and Gary Oldman really captured the spirit of their characters, their relationship with Harry, and the sense of their relationship with Harry's parents. Emma Thompson is a delight as Professor Trelawney -- one hopes that all of these fine actors will still be available when their characters return in later films. Michael Gambon had some big shoes to fill as Albus Dumbledore, and (speaking as a true fan of the late Richard Harris) Gambon did an excellent job making Dumbledore his own while maintaining the continuity of the character from the previous films. As for Robbie Coltrane, he's a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliant,"It was the greatest film ever! It's exciting and a bit scary... The pace is great, you fly through the story, so there is enough time to show the important bits. There are many things directly taken from the book, and if you are a huge fan like me that's nice. And Sirius Black, I think they couldn't have casted a more brilliant man than Oldman. He's wonderfully crazy and weird. Not so great is that when you haven't read the books you'd probably not understand everything. There's no explanation of Potter, Black and Pettigrew becoming Animangi for Lupin....And you wouldn't recognize james potter....but ahh what the hell, It's an amazing movie....you should all go see it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
After all this time this is still my favorite!,"This is the best movie from all the Harry Potter series. Alfonso Cuaron captured the magic and so many little details from the book perfectly.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/Falls Short,"I am sure that Harry Potter fans will turn out in true form to see this movie. The reputation of J.K. Rowling's story and Steve Kloves' (screen writer) adaptations of previous books have been exceptionally well done.In The Sorcerer's Stone a new and fascinating world of fantasy was opened up and Chris Columbus did an impeccable job of making you believe in the existence of that fantasy world.In The Chamber of Secrets you expected action and you GOT action. For some of us even more than we wanted. Ewwwwww, Spiders! Chris Columbus once again did not disappoint his audiences.With two extremely well done movies as predecessors, the third film promised to be just as exciting and well done. You could feel the excitement and see the anticipation on every face of the audience as they entered the theater. We left disappointed. Gone was the excited buzz of chatter after the first two movies; people left this one in stunned silence.The story-line itself left much to be desired, jumping all over the place and veering completely away from the book in several instances. Unfortunately, the veering left excitement behind and bordered on mundane.So, what saved this movie from actually becoming mundane? 1. Excellent graphics exceeding those of the first two movies. The ""blowing"" up of Aunt Marge, the transformation of Peter Petigrew, and the knight bus adventure are some of the scenes that will certainly impress the viewer.2. The characters make-up and costuming, fabulous.3. The set, exactly as you would picture Hogwarts to be from the books. In Azkaban the setting should be darker and it does not disappoint us.4. The actors were right on with one exception. Michael Gambon's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore fell short. He simply was unable to portray the quiet strength people have come to expect from Dumbledore.Alfonso Cuaron's direction did not make the cut with me. He had it all; characters, setting and plot....he just didn't make it work.Steve Kloves, stop attempting to ""improve"" upon J.K. Rowling and continue to follow her lead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Want to visit Azkaban,"The movie is still very good and start with a strong moment: harry used magic outside Hogwarts. And the new movie begin with this. The movie is pretty mysterious, have some interesting revelation that keep the interest until the end, we know more of Harry. The Danger here is Sirius Black in this movie it seem to be. I enjoyed also Lupin; he helped a lot harry but he s not what he seem. And the other interest here is the monsters who take all happiness from you. The end is not similar than the previous movies it dont really concern Voldemort. Its more arround Sirius Black. Still very interesting and enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it!!! =P,"The new director is awesome. Not necessarily for kids.. The dementors kept you on the edge of your seat! I don't know why everyone says harry looks too old for his age. HE'S NOT AND DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. Adam Lamberg from Lizzie McGuire was 16/17 and playing a 12/13 year old. It's a trend and true. Look at the people in their same grades in my school. A few have beards and mustaches growing! It's crazy. I loved had much darker it was. Very good! The new director would be wonderful for the fourth movie, but he's not going to direct it :frowns: Professor McGonnagol could have shown up more and some more humor could have been shown, but Ron had me laughing! SO did the shrunken heads. I want to ride the night bus! That rocked! I like how Harry is about the only hot guy there and Hermione is very pretty. The movie is good to not be based on good looking people, no offense because I love every character and wouldn't change them for the world. Good movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter is back for his best film yet,"The start of Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is threatened by the escape from Azkaban Prison of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), Voldemort's murderous henchman who betrayed Harry's parents, getting them killed. Along with this pals Hermione and Ron Weasley, Harry must try to stay one step ahead of Black while dealing with the new school year and the horrifying Dementors, Azkaban's jail keepers that now surround the school.After two sold entries in the Harry Potter franchise, the third film really kicks things up. It's a fantastic film with gorgeous special effects and lots of entertaining moments. There's a new switch behind the camera and I like Alfonso Cuarón more than Chris Columbus. Alfonso Cuarón put a lot more ""magic"" and soul into the project while Columbus made the first two films kind of bland. He is a very vanilla like director whereas Alfonso is more fast paced and exciting. This entry is a little more different since they leave out more parts from the book and it's more action. This didn't bother me because the film was more energetic but non readers of the book may be annoyed by this.The acting was pretty good and it was a lot better than the first two entries. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter and he's improving. He's still lacking a little in the emotional scenes though. Emma Watson plays Hermione and she's probably the best of the three. Rupert Grint was okay as Ron though he is the weakest of the three. There is a new Dumbledore in this film as Michael Gambon replaces the late great Richard Harris. He doesn't play the role as well but it's still pretty good. Emma Thompson plays Professor Sybil Trelawney and she does a pretty good job. However, her character isn't in the film that much which is too bad. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was okay, nothing really special.The only problem I had with the movie was that it went by too fast. They could have added some more scenes so the story was told better. Besides for that, the book's magic seems to have been captured. The dialog is all sharp and funny. The direction is great and the acting is good. The special effects are amazing and the film is just beautiful to look at. People who are bashing this movie are most likely just bitter book nerds. Not all of them are but it seems to me that most are. In the end, the movie is great and it's worth checking out. Rating 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing!,"This is by far the best Harry Potter yet. Alfonso Cuaron has an amazing vision. The screenplay writing is ten times better than the previous 2 films. They left out much of the book but kept in what was central to the plot. Visually, the film flows & Cuaron does a great job of keeping the story moving along without skipping a beat.The acting has only gotten better among Radcliffe(Harry Potter), Watson (Hermione Granger), & Grint(Ron Weasley). Grint has shown that he can be a real comic relief (the spider dream moment makes me laugh just thinking about it.) Watson is really coming into her own as the brainy girl who just keeps getting prettier. And Radcliffe....not only has he gotten incredibly adorable (he has total heart-throb capabilities), but he's really starting to shine as the lovable orphan destined to save the magical world from Lord Voldemort. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black & David Thewlis gives a flawless performance as the Dark Arts teacher with a werewolf's curse. Emma Thompson pops in and is brilliant as Professor Trelawny (exactly as I pictured her!) The cast of teachers (Rickman, Smith, Bradley, & Coltrane)is always great. I wish there was more of them but there will be plenty to see of them as the movies progress. Micheal Gambon takes the reins as Dumbledore. There is a slight loss of presence & warmth that was once there with the beloved Richard Harris. But Gambon brings his own ""magic"" touch to the role that I'm sure will grow with each film.Over all, I LOVED IT! The film is hilarious although darker than the first 2. This movie has definitely lost it's cheesy Disney-like quality & embraced the fact that it's a whole darker realm of mysticism & magic. I cannot wait for the 4th one. I only hope that Cuaron will come back for 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Do not expect a replica of the book,"I have been a Harry Potter fan since the books came out in the USA in 1999. To me, the books will always be a wonderful escape from reality. Prisoner of Azkaban just happens to be my favorite of the series.I have never been disappointed with Cuaron's work. I feel he has immense talent as a director.This film was superbly done. However, in order to appreciate this, you have to look at it just as that: a film. The acting for these films just keeps getting better, and Gary Oldman was PERFECT as Sirius Black. It had a very nice flow, and the score is the best so far of all three.If you are expecting it to be just like the book, prepare for disappointment. Very much has been changed, left out, etc, and I made the mistake of seeing the film with the book sitting in my lap.If you have not yet seen this film, my advice to you is this: Go with an open mind. This is a beautiful piece of film history, and should be appreciated for all that it is. I give it a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best in the series so far,"This is my favorite one in the Harry Potter series. Now that he's aged more, you can take this movie seriously.I so far went to go see all of the Harry Potter movies in theaters. The first one was good, the second was better, and this one was pure magic. I remember when I went to this one, the line at the movie theater reached to the end of the building. This was a really popular one. Luckily I arrived early, and had to wait only about an hour.If you want a good movie to see, I encourage you to rent this movie. Most of you will probably buy it after.

Fabulous Filming Amidst the Fatal Flubs,"I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter. I probably have the books memorized. And ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favorite of the books. So I was well psyched for the movie. And it didn't disappoint. For the most part. The actual cinematography was so much cleaner and better than the first two films. The visual effects were also much tighter and more believable. Sirius as Snuffles was so well done, with a nice tip of the hat to ""The Nothing"" from ""The Neverending Story."" Lupin as a werewolf was pretty cool, not because it was necessarily well done, but because he was clearly a werewolf and not a regular wolf or dog. The new look of the Hogwarts castle and grounds was really more with the mood of the books, if not consistent with the other movies. My main complaints are that the director (Alfonso Cuaron) had never even read the books before being approached about directing ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", so he didn't have any investment in the series or any passion for it. Also, he took a lot of the fun and humor out of the story and kept in things that were unnecessary or lingered too long on certain subjects. The scene where Malfoy, Crab, and Goyle dress as a dementor to scare Harry is one of the most hilarious parts of the book, and I was incredibly disappointed about its disclusion. Finally, why why, oh why, did they change Lupin's relationship from being best friends with Harry's dad to Harry's mom. Lupin's friendship with James Potter, and thus with Sirius and Wormtail is MASSIVELY important to ""The Order of the Pheonix"" and it is just stupid and confusing that the relationship was changed.Although I like Cuaron as a director, these films would benefit more from someone intimately acquainted with these books and the story, and someone who would keep in the important bits, trim out the unnecessary stuff, all the while keeping the humor and essential story details intact.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A good movie but it does not capture the essence of the first two,"I have to say this is the worst out of all of them in my opinion, but it is still a good movie. I think that this movie is the least exciting, and is the only one that doesn't have much involving Voldemort which i think is what made this a tad less interesting. I also didn't like the demetors but some how it seemed like they were taking the place of voldemort(besides Serious black). What i personally thought was the best part of this movie was when Hermionie punched Malfoy in the face, that was the best part of this movie to me. So to conclude my comment i have to say that it was kind of a let down to the other Harry potter movies but still a good movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A MUST watch,This is one of my favourite Harry Potter films. I am a huge potter head and I can tell you that this movie made me that way. I loved the first two of course but this one was special. It really sets the stage for the next movies to come and turns the mood into the dark setting it needs to be. The actors are really developing who they are at this point as well.

A rather good Harry Potter movie (at last),"After seeing ""The Chamber of Secrets"" I promised myself not to see another HP movie in my life again.I'm not among those great fans that get angry at the huge but inevitable cuts that transform the very long HP books into an affordable screenplay. That's absolutely fine with me.But I have to say I'm among those people that do not like Chris Columbus's (er) talent as a director.This new HP by Cuaron is rather different, in that you get a lot of beautiful images, as Hogwarts is presented in a darker, yet more elegant way.The special effects look better, maybe because there is no 'final monster' to spend gazillions of money for, and so they could concentrate on those effects that are throughout the movie.The new characters add a new interesting twist, especially Prof. Lupin, whose final lines seem to allude at things that are definitely not meant for kids.Let's give it 7 out of 10.Shame on the producers that have given the fourth installment to Newell. We'll see if he can do better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the best Harry Potter film,"I think this isn't the best harry Potter film, because the characters are sometimes not like the book and many important things are selected.But the three child actors have been great. Only the screenplay is wrong. I think Rupert Grint is the best actor of this movie and i do not understand, that he wasn't nominated for any award. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were nominated , why not Rupert? And sometimes the window blinds don't work like they should. And why there is a choir, it isn't any in the book? Did the director or want to lose more time???? And I think the child actors will be to old in the next film, but casting new kids isn't right, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Funniest so far,I saw this movie yesterday at a screening in Chicago. I thought there was more humor in this film than the other two. The characters are older and this makes them better actors. There are some new additions to the cast and they add a lot to the film. Harry's uncle is meaner then ever.The new director did a good job of being true to the book. The action focuses less on life at Hogwarts this time. I wish there was more Quidditch. The special effects were good. The end gets a little confusing because there is a lot of time travel. The movie is not too scary and it is probably appropriate for all school age children. I think people of all ages will enjoy this movie. I will probably see it again.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Relationship between Lupin and Sirius,"Maybe I am right out to lunch but did anyone else catch an idea that Lupin and Sirius were more than friends? They seemed very close (that was a really tight hug when they first saw each other again) and the comment about ""did you take your potion today"" sounded very much like an old couple where one person asks the spouse if they took their blood pressure pills today. Also when Snape burst in and said they were quarreling like an old married couple... And lets not forget that Lupin was leaving conveniently when Sirius was on the run. Who else could have told Sirius that Harry's broom got trashed so he would send a new one with a Buckbeak feather?  Why would Sirius care about quidditch? Only a person close to Harry like his teacher would have known how much he loved the game. {and I am SO not getting into the scene where Lupin is packing because ""parents wouldn't want someone like me teaching their kids--so so SO not going there, nice substitution of the werewolf allegory}I'm not trying to get dirty minded about this, it just seemed to me like they were close. I have to admit I haven't read the book yet but I will.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I loved this movie really much,"By this point the series has found its place between dark and light, fear and wonder, childhood and adulthood, strangeness and conventionality. Cuarón is an excellent director who can seemingly take on any film that comes his way, and, as with every film in the series, there are some good newcomers here - Emma Thompson is shown only glimpses, but she is very good; Gary Oldman is a fine addition, and the appearance of Dementors marks one of Rowling's most powerful, enduring and meaning-filled creations. Compared to the first two films, the film has taken away some of the fat, but it's still too long--otherwise, it's probably a series at its peak.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too much change and opportunities missed,"I'm a great fan of the Potter series! Having said that ... I was disappointed in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie. Things were changed that added nothing significant to the movie. Example, McGonagall! She had such a small part, nothing about her clothing should have changed. Also the trek to Hagrid's cabin became a climbing adventure for no good reason. Energy was spent watching the scenery and distracting from the story. This movie was full of these unnecessary changes. So many opportunities were missed to promote continuity and join the series, not step off in a different direction. The actors did a fabulous job but the director missed opportunities again in not capturing proper emotion during a scene. Ex. Sirius and Harry! Harry is just realizing that his dream may be coming true to leave the Dursley's. He's found a family in Sirius! Sirius is thinking back to fond days with James and the more innocent days of teen year friendships. These are heavy emotions that are part of Rowling's story. The scene missed it! In a fast paced story line, the opportunity was gone. Subtlety and feeling is what brings magic to this story! This movie lost some of the magic!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Not wild about Harry,"Harry Potter is a sequence of stories beginning with Harry as a child, and then growing up.  Nevertheless, it is a kids story, and this film lacks that kid element - unless we have demented kids running around.This particular story, The Prisoner of Azkaban, sets up Potter's mid-kid crisis so to say.  He finds a friend of the family, but realises his own magical strength as a wizard.  It's one of the most important stories in the series, but this film depicts a real dark side which I would never allow my kids to see.  Columbus did a great job in the first two movies, endearing us to characters such as Weasley, Malfoy, Granger, Dumbledore, Snape, et al. This director's version made it all about Potter.  One character can be a movie, but with the talented experienced theatrical actors such as Smith, Gambon, Rickman, and Thompson - they went to waste!  Potter's father, if you read the books, was a slime bag - an arrogant man with an ego bigger than Aunt Marge.  Sirius Black was his partner in crime, so birds of a feather flock together.Albeit it's a good series of reading, the movies need to bring some compassion of the characters, which the first two did.  It'll be interesting to see how the next director does with Goblet of Fire.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best So Far...,"It's most definitely the best one in the series of film adaptations so far. The humor throughout the film, makes the 2 hour and 19 minute running time fly by.

He did a magnificent directing job. The film takes the heart of the novel and portrays it well on-screen. Though, die-hard Potter fans may notice some major scenes missing from the film that were in the book, they will not be disappointed by the film.

The best Harry Potter film so far,"By far the best Harry Potter film yet, but it still left me feeling disappointed. Cuaron has taken the franchise and improved it, he has made it grow up along with the characters. The film was scary at times and moving at others. The special effects where the best yet and very rarely looked CGI which was surprising. The acting was a mixed bag however. Only a few stood out; Oldman was brilliant if a little underused, Emma Watson was outstanding and a talent to watch but poor Harry Potter can no longer carry a film, the scenes with other people in were more entertaining. It's also a big shame that there was only one Quidditch match in this one, also how long would it have taken to explain the authors behind the Maurauders Map?8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Happy Birthday Julie,"I have seen a lot of movies over the years with Julie Christie. My favorite is Heaven Can Wait. But, her role in this movie is the very antithesis of the lovely Julie, that it is appropriate on her birthday.She played Madame Rosmerta, a minor role in a great film with the usual cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Yes, I watch harry Potter movies. I have even read all the books three times each and anxiously await the next book and movie. Life is too interesting to get stuck in just a few types; whether it be books, music, movies, or women.This was director Alfonso Cuarón's (Y tu mamá también ) greatest film.

"As a film very good, as an adaption from a novel not so good.","As a film very good, as an adaption from a novel not so good.What I mean here is that the film looks lovely, the actors (children as well as adults) give creditable performances and the special effects are well produced, as a film there's little to criticize. The problem comes from the fact that you only get a skeletal sketch of the novel itself.Most people have criticized the film for not explaining fully the marauders map for instance, however, the problem goes deeper then this. The time it took for harry to produce a petronus was greater, giving Lupin and Harry time to converse (I don't remember walks on bridges or woods). But what I found most astonishing was (unless I've missed it) the lack of explanation as to why Snape loathed the Potters, Sirius and Lupin - this is really quite central to Snape/Harry relation, and if it was covered it was fleeting. All in all the novel had a good deal more depth and detail then was in the film. Perhaps if the director didn't waste time on unfunny shrunken heads he could have added more detail that was actually in the book.If you haven't read the novels or are quite content with the essence of the book then this should prove to be a very enjoyable film. If you have read the novel you may find yourself grumbling slightly under you breath but you will still enjoy the film - just don't be too literal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst Part About Prison is the Dementors,"Possibly my favourite book in the whole series, and the film did not disappoint. With the change of directors there were definatley a difference in mood and setting. The castle and the grounds was what I noticed most when this film first came out. I enjoyed the aesthetic and landscapes, but also felt it lessened the immersion as it wasn't the same as the previous two films.David Thewilis portrayal of Professor Lupin was marvellous. And Gary Oldman is always fantastic.I always enjoyed this story as it was the only one where Voldemort isn't directly involved. Of course it revolves around the same story and what he did, but it is its own side piece which separates it from the rest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Story lost me a bit,"LUMOS MAXIMA!! Let there be light.The third in the franchise, and we followed Harry Potter and his friends in their third year. It's worth noting that the director changed from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuarón.Even though this is the third, I'm still amazed at the new magic tricks that the source material created. They also became goofier and funnier. The CGI was decent for the most part, but some were noticeably bad.The biggest change from the first two was the story, which became more complexed and involved playing with time. This came with a problem for me: in the first hour and a half, I felt like the story was going nowhere, and the pieces were random. However, the ending act tied everything together and explained what happened a lot, perhaps more than it needed to, but probably for the young audiences to follow.Even though it's 20 minutes shorter than the second one, the runtime still felt very long, mostly because of the set up that seemed to go nowhere at first. It would be better if the story moved faster and connected the pieces sooner.Overall, I'm still amazed at how well and creative the script and source material used its universe to entertain audience. The story was more complex, which was good and enjoyable, but nonetheless still felt too long and lost me couple of times. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining and creative film, but a bit hard to follow","This movie is as entertaining as any other Harry Potter flick, but I feel the story was a little too convoluted. Lots of new characters suddenly introduced with their backstories explained in seconds, overlayed on top of other unrelated plots happening at the same time, it's all a bit much. I did really like the sections closer to the end though, they were nicely done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Fun, dark ride","If you enjoyed the first two movies, be warned: There are plenty of differences in this third installment. With a new director on board (Alfonso Cuaron), the tone of the series has shifted somewhat, to a darker, more serious Harry Potter universe.If you've read the books, you should also be warned: There's a lot of stuff in the third book that doesn't appear in the third movie. Part of this is out of necessity, as this film is a bit shorter than the first two (while the book is longer), but even so there are characters from the book who don't appear in the movie and story threads that aren't satisfactorily resolved.The crux of the story is that the man who led Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban Prison, presumably to hunt down the offspring of his onetime close friends - and kill him! The guards at Azkaban, the Dementors, are out in full force to track down Black and return him to prison. Ah, but these are no ordinary guards; the Dementors - dark, faceless beings in black cloaks - feed off a person's emotions, eventually sucking their soul out, rending them helpless. The Dementors personify depression in the extreme, you see.Harry first encounters the Dementors on the way to school aboard the Hogwarts Express as they search the train for Black. It's not an enjoyable encounter for the boy wizard, who faints dead away.Later, at the school, it's learned that Black is getting closer and closer. Will he find Harry?New to the faculty at Hogwarts are Remus Lupin as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor (a position that is empty at the end of each book) and Sybil Trelawney as the Divination professor. Both figured into the plot of the book, but only Lupin gets any real screen time in the movie. Lupin, played with effortless panache by David Thewlis, winds up being a confidante of Harry, and he has more than a few secrets in his closet as well. Also, taking the place of the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore is Michael Gambon, while Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is promoted to the position of professor.There are two main plotlines at work here: the anticipation of the arrival of Black and the revelations of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Harry's parents. We learned a bit at the end of each of the first two HP films, and this one too takes its sweet time in clueing us all in.A new director and tone can lead to some dangerous uncharted waters, and expectations must be tempered somewhat. Please do go to this movie expecting the charm of the first two; this is not your older brother's HP. As Harry himself matures, so must his movies, and this one is more cynical and downbeat at times than either of the first two in the series. This matches, at least somewhat, the tenor of the third book itself.Cuaron's direction is excellent, and his little touches are abundant (such as the rearranging of the Hogwarts grounds, the use of the Whomping Willow as a device to show time, and endless presence of a giant outdoors clock). The movie doesn't lag too much, although it's possible that a newcomer to the HP oeuvre might not pick up all of the plot threds.The cast does a good job, I think, in maintaining the spirit of the previous movies and books. The young lead trio (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) are aging quite well; in fact, I think Watson is becoming quite a wonderful young actress. (Grint, by the way, holds his hamminess down to a dull roar.)They're well supported, of course, by a who's who of master British thespians, from Thompson to Thewlis to Alan Rickman (still delightfully creepy as Snape) to Gambon to Maggie Smith to Coltrane. Any British actor who's anyone wants to be in these movies, and that's high praise indeed.The special effects, too, aren't second rate. Buckbeack the hippogriff looked positively realistic (although Crookshanks the cat looked laughable).HP:PoA is well worth watching, especially if you have little munchkins in your household who have been clamoring for it since the last Harry Potter movie. But beware, there are some scenes that the younguns may find a bit more unsettling than either of the first two movies.My score: ***1/2",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Good, but disappointing","I've been weighting for this movie to be released for over a year and when it finally came out I couldn't wait to see it  wish I could say I had the same feeling after.The movie, like the other 2, explains the storyline well but it seems as if it has slowly moved itself away from the true Harry Potter theme. It shows the characters out of Hogwarts uniform constantly. This is a good thing because it shows that they are real people but there is a limit.Some things aren't emphasised enough, for example, the amount of time Harry spent practising the spell which repeals the dementors. In the book he spends hours practising the spell but in the movie its like he does it once and the next time can do it 100 times more powerful. Another disappointing fact is the fact that Hogwarts, Hagrids Hut, the lake and dark forest have been shifted around and split up  this also separates the movie from the true Harry Potter theme.It is a good movie which shows another side the characters and a darker side to Hogwarts but is disappointing because of the separation in the movie to the book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Movie of 2004,"Harry, Hermione, and Ron are back. And better than ever. Alfonso Curon really surprised me with this peice of work that is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alot was cut, sadly, but that was only to help propel the story futher (I hope we get some kind of director's cut or  S**t load of deleted scenes on the DVD). The big three are at there best. That goes double for Dan and Emma, this is hands down their best preformances yet (Plus, Emma has never been so sexy). It is going to take alot for Any other film this year to impress me.

best hp movie,"This movie fixes everything that went wrong in the others. the first two had (in my opinion) underdeveloped snape compared to him in the books. here, he gets more screen time. so does the current defense against the dark arts teacher, who has much more screen time than the teacher from the sorcerers stone.the characters start changing. in the first two, the students are always in uniforms. here, they start wearing more regular clothes that (i assume) is better fit to their personalities and what they go through during the movie.it's more memorable than its predecessors. i personally think that the chamber of secrets was the worst movie out of the original 8 movies (by no means bad, but not as memorable as others). this movie has more memorable characters and scenes.lastly, the tone it took on. the first two felt very like two family and kid movies that a six or seven year old could easily digest. this one starts venturing into the darker side of the wizarding world, from color palettes to fears to more frightening moments. by no means am i saying this is not a family movie, as they all are, but it starts taking on more mature themes and approaches to the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Imagination abound,"From writing, acting, directing, production elements are all wonderfully melted together to create a brilliant continuation on the previous Potter series. Just the thought that this whole thing started from the point of view of a mother trying to enrich her child's life with more beauty and wonder is an astounding thought. She certainly deserves to be honored as the mother of a decade. My children and I were absolutely carried onto a journey of the mind and soul. Like all the Harry Potter series, you always felt safe knowing that no matter how tens it gets, the hero will once again emerge.

"""Potter"" is sharper, smarter with new director Cuaron","Producer Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films made of the Harry Potter series of fantasy books by J.K. Rowling, couldn't have made a better choice than stepping away from the camera and giving the reigns to a seasoned director with a fresh perspective. It's what makes ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" go from merely good to great.Director Alfonso Cuaron, who brings his fantasy experience from the mid-'90s film ""A Little Princess,"" adds a layer of complexity, maturity and beauty to the Harry Potter universe that had been just a bit too fantastical and gimmicky under Columbus' direction. Though the second does this better than the first, the third completely outdoes both.In this chapter, Harry (Radcliffe) heads for Hogwarts with the knowledge that an infamous Dark wizard named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizard prison of Azkaban and is out to find Harry and kill him. Along the way Harry must learn to overcome his fear of the Azkaban prison guards out searching Hogwarts for Black -- ghastly creatures called Dementors -- during which he learns a bit about his parents. New to the cast include David Thewlis as new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and ally of Harry's, Remus Lupin, a nearly unrecognizable Emma Thompson as Divination teacher Professor Trelawney and Michael Gambon as the new Albus Dumbledore after the sad passing of Richard Harris. All are great, even Gambon, who adds a youthful vigor to Dumbledore despite the true magic that Harris brought to the role.A lot has also changed visually in ""Azkaban."" There seems to be more of a sense of realism to the characters despite the fantasy world around them. Cuaron has the main trio of Harry, Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) in modern dress most of the film (whenever they're not in classes) and this really helps make them seem more like the teenagers they are. It makes us identify with them more. Even when they are in robes/proper dress, they do what Catholic school kids with uniforms would: loosen the ties, unbutton a couple buttons -- Cuaron's image is not as neat and tidy of a fantasy world. This is more of a young adults adventure story, not a children's fantasy. Then again, the books are heading in this direction and it's only appropriate.The sets are even more beautiful and Cuaron's attention to the seasons changing helps emphasize his themes of time while grounding the narrative of the film. Steve Kloves, adapter of the first two books, has clearly by now honed his craft. He has much better ways of working in the information of the book visually than through dialogue. Cuaron's vision makes that seem all the more apparent. What you see in ""Azkaban"" just has so much more weight to it. There aren't nearly as many visual effects or interesting nature sequences that are just there to be pretty. All of it has a purpose with the exception of Harry flying around on Buckbeak the hippogriff for a few minutes, and even that lets John Williams take his great score to the next level.""Azkaban"" is easily the best Potter film to date and it's one of the shortest, so that gives you a sense of how much more improved the entire process was this time around. This film really lives up to the book more than any other in entertainment and maturity. It's a shame Cuaron didn't stick around for another go.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Nice conversion, although really missed some parts of the story.","The books growing thicker it's more and more difficult to fit in all the essential stuff in 2 and a half hour (max).

By far the best Harry Potter film yet.,"Cuaron is the best thing that happened to the Harry Potter series. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is darker then the other two Potter installments, which is important for the subject matter of the film. ""Stone"" and ""Secrets"" were too cheesy concentrating too much on little details within the stories. Although ""Azkaban"" differs in many way from the book, it is easier to watch because the plot flows better. The scenes end the begin in a much smoother fashion, probably an addition of Cuaron. The only criticism I have is the ending, there has yet to be a Harry Potter film where the ending leaves me completely satisfied.

Of course, there is a concern for Hogwarts as the inevitable fight between good and evil continues once again. Yet, I found the eventual plot twist so distasteful and unbelievable that it crashed my suspension of belief & ruined the film for me.This movie is a bit darker than the previous two films before it.

A Mature HP Movie,"A great movie, by Cuaron. A mature tone setting which sets it out from its prequels. Although a major part from the book has been excluded, still the rest stands out as OUTSTANDING. Especially the scenes of the Marauder's Map. Also there are plenty of comedy in the movie. There is a hint of a budding romance between Ron and Hermione, Harry's two best friends. Also the sound and music of the movie is especially awesome. John Williams has left all of us spellbound by his ingenuinity. The portion where young Professor Lupin tells Potter about his parents is magnified by the outstanding slow background music. (A Window To The Past) And most important of all is the deadly ""villain"", Sirius Black, who also happens to Harry's godfather. Although this movie lacks Quidditch, it has Buckbeak the Hippogriff flying over the Lake in the Castle. Overall it's a definite must see for all HP fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: A Timeless Journey into Magic and Friendship,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, the third installment in J. K. Rowling's beloved series, continues the enchanting saga of the young wizard as he navigates the challenges of adolescence, friendship, and the ever-present threat of darkness. In this captivating tale, Rowling skillfully weaves a tapestry of suspense, mystery, and heartwarming camaraderie that captures readers' imaginations from start to finish.The story kicks off with Harry spending yet another dismal summer with the Dursleys, only to be thrust into a whirlwind of events on his thirteenth birthday. The escape of Sirius Black, a notorious supporter of Voldemort, sets the stage for a riveting adventure that is as much about self-discovery as it is about the battle between good and evil.One of the strongest aspects of this installment is the development of characters. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter their teenage years, their personalities deepen, and their friendships are tested. Rowling masterfully explores their emotions, making them relatable and endearing to readers of all ages. The introduction of new characters, such as the enigmatic Professor Lupin and the unforgettable Sirius Black, adds layers to the narrative, making the wizarding world feel even more expansive and immersive.The plot is intricately crafted, with twists and turns that keep readers on the edge of their seats. The revelation of Sirius Black's true nature and the shocking identity of the traitor, Peter Pettigrew, are expertly executed, delivering moments of both surprise and heartbreak. The use of time travel through Hermione's Time-Turner adds a fascinating dimension to the story, allowing readers to revisit key events and witness the characters' bravery and ingenuity firsthand.Rowling's world-building continues to shine in this installment. From the whimsical Knight Bus to the majestic Hippogriffs, each magical element is described with vivid detail, making the wizarding world feel incredibly real. The introduction of the Dementors, eerie and soul-sucking creatures, adds a chilling atmosphere to the story, highlighting the darker themes that run throughout the series.At its core, *The Prisoner of Azkaban* is a tale of loyalty, courage, and the power of friendship. It teaches valuable lessons about standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming darkness. The bond between Harry, Ron, and Hermione serves as a beacon of hope, reminding readers of the importance of unity and solidarity in the fight against evil.In conclusion, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* is a literary gem that continues to captivate readers with its magical charm and compelling characters. Rowling's storytelling prowess is unparalleled, making this installment a must-read for fans of all ages. As the series progresses, the wizarding world becomes richer, more nuanced, and utterly enchanting, ensuring that readers will eagerly anticipate the adventures that lie ahead for Harry Potter and his friends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,"What comes to the mind when magic is heard- none other than Harry Potter, What can you do if things go wrong- simple travel to the past and mend the things-- haha.

Magic with elements of friendship, sacrifice, betrayals give this movie a great stature. Enjoyed it all through.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Two Thumbs Up.,"The first thing you will notice about the third Harry Potter movie is that the direction is completely different from the first two. Azkaban is much darker, more enchanted and, let's face it, a much more grown up movie than the previous two. Harry Potter is growing up! And whether this is a good or bad thing is left for the viewer to decide. One thing for certain is the series is truly going down a more darker, more sinister path.After exiling himself from his muggle family world, Harry finds his way back to Hogwarts with the knowledge that a prisoner of Azkaban escaped and is set to kill him. Harry learns more about himself and others as he deals with puberty and his newest opponents, the Dementors.If kids thought the Chamber of Secrets was dark and long, you haven't seen the Dementors yet. Prisoner carries a sort of dark artistry that enchants Harry Potter instead of taking it away from the movie. Where the first two were more plot-driven and focused solely on the characters, Azkaban concentrates a little bit more on the world of Hogwarts and assumes you probably know of Harry, his friends and his mainstay teachers. With a lot of patience, since the movie is long, and a fair grain of salt for the plot twists and time travel toward the end, Harry Potter 3 is a good movie that makes well use of Hogwarts that adds to the series more than taking away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Prisoner to the Series,"The Harry Potter books and films have entranced people all over the world and it is easy to see why.Again they have stuck to the books which is a great decision. The darker atmosphere is very prominent, which I think is helped by the main characters entering Pubity.The Acting is superb just like the two previous instalments, most of the actors and actresses are able to capture the essence of the character.Next on the list is the soundtrack. This aspect of the film is splendid and adds to the dark tone of the storyline.On the other side of the coin are a couple of problems. One. the design of the werewolf. To me it was designed to look purely cruel and evil without any animal instincts whatsoever. Two, the choice of Michael Gambon as Dumbuldore. He seemed unable to get into the character as Richard Harris was.My last word is wonderful. What I love about the Harry Potter films is the dark atmosphere and not overdoing the blood and gore.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great movie!,"I enjoyed this movie much better than the first two Harry Potter movies. I will have to completely disagree with the people who said that if you have read and loved the books, this movie will disappoint you. I am huge fan of the books, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book in the series.Anyone who goes to a movie based on a book KNOWS that it's going to be different. No one should have been surprised by that. Even the first two movies changed things. The problem with the first two movies was that they tried to do so much (yes, including Quidditch) that didn't have all that much to do with the actual plot of the book that the movie went too fast and felt too condensed. They tried to do too much for their alloted time.POA was much more focused, and yes they changed a few things around plot-wise that did catch me off-guard but it was done well. The visual effects are amazing in this movie, much better than in the first two. The three main actors are all much improved in this movie, kudos to them. I would have liked to see Maggie Smith in the movie more, but overall this movie is very very enjoyable. It does, however, require more of an open-mind than going in expecting it to be exactly the same as the book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"As an adult HP fan, I was disappointed in POA. I believe the director did not read the books or watch the films or if he did, didn't understand them.Snape in SS and COS was scary. In POA, he just looks like a very ugly, silly cross dresser. In the other films, you see him be unnerved by Harry. (Watch SS and COS's scenes with these two.)McGongagall who had come across as strict, but with an understanding of kids now is depicted as cross, uncaring and almost mean.Another thing I did not like is how the kids wore their street clothes at Hogwarts. It made Hogwarts less magical. Before, the distinction between Muggle and Wizard worlds was made with their clothing. It just felt wrong, like seeing your teacher show up to class in their nightclothes.Hermione, once intelligent, is now portrayed as cross, moody, and unable to be understood. Ron is now the dumb sidekick. What a waste of talent.Some of the few good things seen are Harry's self doubts, pain, and humanity. At one point in the film, his emotions are so raw, his actions and words just hit you, as if you are feeling the emotions with him.Harry's pain, his rage, and so many emotions all at once coming to the surface to be voiced as they had not been before. Seeing Harry discover the past that is his, known to all but him, finding who he is now and searching for his place in the world, especially the Wizarding world, you feel for him and want to help him. That is Daniel Radcliffe's brilliance, not anyone else's. His interpretation of this side of Harry was done to perfection.Harry's conferences with Lupin, expressing his fears, and confiding in him. I was also impressed with Lupin not treating him as a silly child, but someone closer to being a man and giving Harry honest answers, even if Lupin had no answers or the answers were not what Harry wanted to hear.The bones in the story are strong, but this director goofed more than he didn't. Had this movie been done by someone who understood the movies, it'd have turned out so much better.I think Steve Kloves, JK Rowling and other PTB (powers that be) need to BEG Chris Columbus to take the director's chair again. He GOT the movies. He understood how to do the difficult task of putting Harry Potter on film, capturing the magic, wowing audiences, and still being very true to the books.I in no way blame the actors. They all did their best to give the stellar performances but with lousy direction, even the best actor cannot shine.These actors have only one chance per movie to get it right. I can only hope that Goblet of Fire and if the sixth film is made, that more care, time, and talent comes from the director of those films. However, if the PTB get it right and get Columbus back in the director's chair and give him free reign, I know the true magic of Harry Potter will return.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Missing key elements,"This is a good movie that Potter fans will enjoy but it is not up to the level of the previous two. Less time is spent with the adults and there is considerably less magic by everyone except Harry. Richard Harris' replacement seems lost in his role; is he wise or lost in the school? The answer isn't clear and I wasn't sure if I even wanted to spend the time seeking the answer. The plot line is razor thin and the climax is a mere bump in the storyline. Lots of surprises as to why the second week ticket sales drops so sharply. Funny thing was is that I wasn't surprised as all. One can only hope this movie is a segway to something greater else this series has run its course. One last note, you can tell how much everyone has grown up since the last movie. Unfortunately, many of the classmates are not present in the background. Mr. Longshaft was good in the first two movies but is both absent and not even mentioned in the third.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Efficient screen adaptation---a change in director makes all the difference!,"Very happy to see this film and eager to see it again, unlike the 2nd in the series!A change in director makes all the difference! Careful editing and the improved sets also helped greatly. Most notably the Whomping Willow is now outside the castle walls and given vastly improved rendering!The screenwriter appears to have hit his stride with this the 3rd in the series: seamlessly altering details of time and place for brevity without losing important exchanges between the characters and information for the uninitiated audience. He'll need it even more for The Goblet of Fire; so, I write this in eager anticipation of that product!Standout Excellent Scene: the confrontation in the Shrieking Shack. Oldman is brilliant as Sirius Black, as is Thewlis as Lupin.A solid film.I was a little disappointed about the delay of arrival of Harry's broomstick until the end of the movie, when it was to have arrived at Christmas however; but, that really doesn't figure largely in the advancement of the plot (until the next movie) and so it is totally forgivable along with all other such story alterations.Similarly I would have liked to see the Divination classroom more in keeping with Rowling's original description of having to be accessed from a trapdoor; but, that's just nitpicking. The actress playing Treylawny is a dead ringer for the part---excellent casting all around!I will definitely buy this film for my collection, and seek to see it again before it leaves the theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The telling of the third book in the Harry Potter series.,"This movie was a huge disappointment. Major points were left out while minor or unimportant points were embellished upon. This movie needed to follow the book more closely and probably be longer. (How did they expect to make a longer book into a shorter movie?)The information that they left out of this movie is imperative to the story and I am not sure how they plan to continue the movies without it.Many characters were also a disappointment in this film.

"A Good Movie, but not True to Harry Potter","I preface my comments by stating that I had exceedingly high expectations for this film. Harry Potter is one of my many obsessions, and after watching the trailer, I was sure that this film would be by far the best of the three. I was, however, disappointed. The cinematography was beautiful, and most of the acting was much improved (aside from Radcliffe's pitiful crying scene and Hermione's pathetic dependency acts), but the movie was so poorly thrown together. The first twenty minutes were hilarious. I was rolling in my seat laughing as Aunt Marge blew up, busting buttons (which consequently hit Dudley in the face), and the Knight Bus was equally amusing. Sadly, however, once you get any farther, disappointments ensue. The set is entirely different. This isn't necessarily always a bad thing. The set was much extended, but certain aspects of the it were noticeably different. The whomping willow decreased to about half of its size and also changed locations.The chronological order of the events in the movie were also rearranged, as well as leaving out many important aspects of the novel. Maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I personally really liked how the movies followed so closely to the books. Peeves is still missing from the story, many important conversation in general (particularly between Harry and Lupin) are taken out, Harry finds out all of the information about Sirius and how he is his godfather in a completely different fashion, Harry receives the firebolt (without any explanation as to how he got it) at the very end of the movie, and most annoyingly and obviously, everything about the bond between James, Peter, Sirius, and Remus is left out. It did not explain at all who Prongs and Padfoot and the like were at all. So much was left unexplained, and as a whole it was very very rushed and choppy.Many beg to differ with my opinion and perhaps I need to see it again, but I thought Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a good movie alone as a movie, but regarding the true feeling of Harry Potter left much to be desired.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

just a kids movie - a good one though,"I confess that I did not read any of the Harry Potter books, and I am afraid I will not have the time to do it during the current reincarnation of my soul. This being said, I am judging the film by what I saw on the screen, and I cannot refer to the many details the book afficionados seem to be that familiar with. My opinion is that this film belongs to the category of kids film, and should not be over-estimated or over-judged beyond. It is actually quite good in its own terms, and doing good kids movies should not be under-estimated in a world poluated with that many bad taste or plain boring movies targeting young audiences, unfortunately many claiming Disney descendence, or even bearing Disney labels. My young teen-age soon enjoyed the film, and so did my wife and myself.The good parts are the overall atmosphere, darker, and less surprising if you saw the previous films in the series, but still very consistent and catching. Computerized film graphics is by now an art in itself, and the makers of this film master it fully. I did not like that much the horse-bird character, which looks like being intended to generate some affection, but fails to bear a personality as some other recent film monsters.Acting is good, with the kids trio, now on the verge of their teen years growing up still as a consistent team, although Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter seems to have less acting resources than Emma Watson in Hermione, who may develop into a real screen star. Interesting to guess how the makers of the series will deal with the inevitable growing pains and crisis of the young actors. A good team of good and better actors surrounds the kids, with Michael Gambon having taken over the key role of dean Dumbledore after the passing of Richard Harris in a flawless manner.Sure, the fans can and will build a world around the books and the films. Even for the non-initiated or beyond the age groups, like the ones I belong to, there is enough good stuff to enjoy in this film. 8 our of 10 on my personal scale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
IMAX version is stunning!,"I just saw Prisoner of Azkaban on IMAX and it just blew me away, it was so immersive. The big detailed picture and the amazing soundsystem made this the best Hollywood movie I have seen in the last 5 years.Cuarón had a good story to start with. I thought the screenplay was a good adaptation of it. I have not read the book, but the movie was tightly scripted, had a good pace, and enjoyable from beginning to end.Good directors are effective at evoking a sense of place, and I thought that Cuarón did this especially well. The sets were detailed and evocative, and the CGI was used well to make these mythical places (and creatures!) come alive. Too many Hollywood movies these days are piling in the CGI. Cuarón is an artist and he knows how to make a big impact with a little well used CGI. And again, with the IMAX picture and sound it is incredibly immersive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Disapparate Me, Please!","Being an avid fan of all of the Harry Potter line of books I was positively salivating in the queue to see the latest installment of the movie. And quite honestly I was a bit disappointed. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry James Potter), Emma Watson(Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint(Ronald Weasley) all gave their wonderful performances but there were moments in the movie that I did not care for. My main problem was the extra footage that did not belong or add to the storyline i.e. The Frog Chorus, the shrunken head on the Knight Bus. These items were fluff and was not part of the original storyline. I believe that these two parts should have been omitted and their monies used to make Lupin a more realistic werewolf. I am sure that Alfonso Cuarón is a wonderful director but he did not capture the vision as did Chris Colombus had in the previous Potter movies.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Completely outclasses the previous two,"I am stunned to see opinion so strongly divided on this film, with many deriding it as a great disappointment and as the worst of the three Potter films so far. Personally, I believe the film to be in a completely different league to its two predecessors, surpassing and outclassing them so astoundingly it's almost embarrassing for poor old Columbus.New director Alfonso Cuaron's marks are all over this movie. Where the first two films exhibited an unadorned, functional narrative lacking any film-making flourishes or cinematic flair, Prisoner of Azkaban is a joyous treasure-box of celluloid delight. Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets contented themselves with simply going through the novels' plot joylessly and mechanically - Azkaban, on the other hand, weaves a spellbinding visual tapestry of a magical world, relying on all the non-narrative techniques open to cinema to bring this world to life.Thus we have beautiful, rich cinematography (too many examples to mention, but the frequent use of wide-angle lenses to juxtapose foreground with background stands out, and just check out the shot of Harry riding Buckbeak as he glides over the lake's surface), a Hogwarts that has changed considerably (into something much more magical and majestic), and direction that frequently borders on the genius. From the hand-held camera in the early Dursleys scene, to the 1920s style fadeouts (which I thought were a nice touch), to the visual delight of the changing of the seasons, to the seemingly constant motif (right from the opening scene) of going through windows (and even mirrors), there are so many wonderful little touches in this film that, after two viewings, I can already see that it will be one to repay many repeat viewings.It's not a perfect film, however, and what's frustrating is that it's so very close to being a masterpiece. Its one great flaw is that it fails to properly explain the backstory linking Pettigrew, Lupin, Black, James Potter and Snape, as well as their link to the Marauders' Map. Just ten more minutes of running time expended on this and the film would have been a solid-gold classic. As it is, the title of flawed gem will have to suffice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Darker, More Complex Adventure That Casts a Spell Despite Some Flaws","The third installment in the Harry Potter series, ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" is a step up from the previous two films in many ways. The plot is more complex, the acting is stronger, and the visuals are even more stunning.One of the strongest aspects of this film is the development of the characters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are more mature and multi-dimensional, and their relationships with each other are explored in greater depth. The introduction of Sirius Black, played brilliantly by Gary Oldman, adds another layer of complexity to the story and provides a new dynamic for Harry to grapple with.The plot itself is darker and more suspenseful than the previous films, with the escape of Sirius Black from the infamous wizarding prison, Azkaban, serving as the central conflict. The film's director, Alfonso Cuaron, does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of foreboding throughout the movie.Visually, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a feast for the eyes. The Hogwarts castle and grounds are more detailed and intricate than ever before, and the cinematography is more creative and visually stunning. The addition of new magical creatures, such as the Hippogriff and the Dementors, adds to the film's fantastical elements.However, the film is not without its flaws. Some of the scenes feel rushed, and important plot points are glossed over or left unexplained. Additionally, some of the humor falls flat and feels out of place in the film's darker tone.Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a strong entry in the series and a significant improvement over the previous two films. While it may not be perfect, it is a spellbinding adventure that leaves viewers eager for the next installment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Beautiful and delightful are the 2 words that sum this film up,"I went to see this in Imax which made it a lot more fun! It was the opening day and I was sooooo excited, Not only do I get to see the now mature and hot Emma Watson again on film, I get to see one of the 5 books that made me read and get some knowledge into my brain put on the screen. I had trouble thinking that the director of a raunchy sex film would make a good adaptation of Mrs.Rowling's perfect story. he turned out to be a great choice! the movie is superb in every way. The only put down for me was that Harry got his Firebolt at the end. The werewolf was cool, too! Dementors are actually scary, and the monster book of monsters was kind of freaky! I give this film a perfect 100%",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
great movie,This movie is a refreshing new look at the world of harry potter and his friends with a new director it is perfect as it adds a different style and view of the book i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Alfonso Cuaron on creating such a great movie the whole cast have grown up in appearance and in their roles from the very start you can see the cast as mature teenage actors Daniel Radcliffe delivers a good performance as Harry whereas Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint(Ron) are also very good.This darker and more exciting year at hogwarts is beautifully directed and the cgi is far superior to the first two movies maybe because they were a bit rushed.the time turner sequence is excellently executed i loved it.Harry is about to start an ordinary year at hogwarts(well ordinary to him)talk of a mysterious escapee from azkaban prison fills the air with this mysterious Sirius Black coming straight to hogwarts and Harry Potter and a new defence against the dark arts teacher this is going to be a eventful year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES...,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the series so far...truly an 'atmospheric' film...,"If Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the true coming of age story for both Harry and for the series in general, then Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the spiritual coming of age for the series; something which the film adaptation emphasizes subtly but brilliantly. The story itself is a departure from the previous two books; both Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were all Harry and his friends exploring all the wonders of the wizarding world, specifically Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. True, there WERE villains to fight and challenges to overcome and danger, but basically, for all intents and purposes, the first two books are very well-written and elaborate children's fantasy books. Prisoner of Azkaban is different; there is a constant atmosphere of depression, of darkness and evil lingering in the air. Harry is no longer a small innocent child opened up to a world of wonder; he is instead a young teenager filled with emotion, at one point prepared to kill a man he is convinced was responsible for his parents death. Such fantastic elements and trappings as a flying car, a three-headed dog or a giant chessboard are traded in for werewolves and Dementors, the latter personifying the atmosphere of evil and darkness lurking over Hogwarts and over Harry in particular. If the book is a departure from its predecessors, the film is doubly so, for it deviates from the two previous Potter films directed by Columbus both in plot as well as in overall direction (not surprising since we have a new director at the helm, Alfonso Curaro). There is a marked stylistic difference from the previous films-Hogwarts is no longer a wonderland of magic and fantasy, it is a dark ancient castle bubbling with mysterious and invisible forces, some of them evil...danger may well lurk in its every shadow! This transformation is not just something you see, you feel it, quite literally! Add on to this the fact that Harry is the prime target of an escaped convict believed to be a vicious mass murderer, and that he is dogged by omens of death (the Grimm) everywhere he goes, not to mention being particularly susceptible to the despair spread by the Dementors and you get the idea of the atmosphere that is being skillfully and subtly crafted here. And yet, as Dumbledore rightly says early on in the film, 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of places'. For it is in this films that Harry first truly finds a mentor (he and Dumbledore have barely shared any screen time at this point); in Remus Lupin, his new Defence Against the Dark teacher, who teaches him to combat his despair both literally by teaching him a spell to repel the Dementors, and figuratively by offering him moral support throughout the film. One of the few shortcomings about this film was that a lot of the expository dialogs from the book were left out, presumably to maintain a fast pace, in stark contrast to the previous films which were almost word to word adaptations in most regards; while these omissions do not ordinarily detract from the story in any way, die-hard fans may find their absence disquieting The performances are spot on, as expected in any Potter film, though Lupin comes across as being more confident and assertive than in the book (a small liberty) and Draco Malfoy seems reduced almost to comic relief. But overall, my review is an appreciation of the film as a whole. This is definitely the best film in the series too date...it clearly surpasses its otherwise excellent predecessors, and none of its successors have succeeded in coming close to matching it; though Half-Blood Prince may well be the one that beats it when it releases later this week.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better then people think,"Don't let the naysayers talk you out of seeing this movie. It is beautifully filmed, with wonderful transitions from scene to scene.The acting is what it is, but I've never had a problem with any of them from the previous movies, and the story stays fairly faithful to the book itself.There are a couple diversions from the written word, but they work well for the flow of the movie. Again, good enough to see once, maybe even twice!If I do have one gripe, I would have liked it to be a bit longer, if for the simple reason that they could have given more time to the text material. Of course, the Goblet of fire (the next in the series) will probably have even more of the source material cut out of it for timing purposes. So be forewarned. :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not what you might expect from the book,"One should never judge a book by its movie or vice versa, this makes rating ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" very difficult. Having read books one to five and being somewhat of a fan of the series, the movies naturally are always worse than the books. Rowling brings so many details, so many sidelines to the story which later reappear or converge to the final act. This and the sheer size of the books make the adaption for the cinema very difficult (perhaps a four-to-eight-hours-miniseries per book would be more effective).PoA is no different, and being the book I liked the most, I was not sure what to expect. The first two movies tried to show as much as possible (with an incredible pace in the second movie which ruined a lot of moments - like the shown winter's day which was over in a few seconds), but the third one tried to steamline the story and rewrite it at some points. They even brought in new scenes which were not part of the book (where did they find the time for that - well, they've cut a lot of other scenes). So, the third movie is ... difficult to describe. There are some surprising scenes, but most of the story stays the same, so it is very predictable if you know the books but perhaps incomprehensible if you don't.Overall it is visually stunning (especially the Dementors and the Hyppogriff), so it's worth for that, the actors however ... for Hermione and Snape they were brilliant, for Harry and Ron they were ok, for Dumbledore not as good as the old one, but I was disappointed with Lupin. One of the effects of the books was, that you build up an image of a character. Lupin always seemed to me as a good-hearted person, which was forced by circumstances outside of his control to live a life of an outsider, thus being forced to be very poor although he is capable of so much more, which he can rarely show - but even with this burden he always seems to look on the positive side, never giving up. The Lupin in the movie just didn't have this battered but fighting style. At the moment I am not sure if I want to see the next movies. Seeing one and two was like reading the books a page per second, seeing the third was like reading the story retold by a stranger (recognizable, same plot, but different), and I wonder how the next one turns out.I suppose I'll stay with the books and let the story play in my head, using some of the actors of the first movies to flash it out (nope, not Lupin), but without the cuts or funny but meaningless additions of the movies. So, if you do not know the books, shame on you but you'll probably enjoy the movie, if you know the books and liked them, be wary, the movie might not be what you would have expected from the book.All in all, I would only give the movie a 2/10 - sorry, but if you know the source it was not a good adaption (although perhaps no good adaption is possible).",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Harry Potter Movie so far,"This is the best of the Harry Potter movies. The critically acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron brings his own unique vision to J.K. Rowling's wonderful story. He adds nice touches like the showing the Whomping Willow snagging passing birds. This movie can stand apart from the books and other movies as a good movie in its own right. It has poignant moments between Harry and his friends and with Professor Lupin, scary moments, and of course lots of adventure. The only complaint that I have that the movie does not explain why Harry thought the Patronus that saved him was from his dad. The book explains that his dad's Patronus is in the form of a stag.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best yet - totally engrossing!,"Now, I'm a total fantasy junky, but I didn't think the last two Harry Potter films were all that good. I enjoyed them, but I felt like they were slightly detached and not as fluid and magnetic as they could've been. I'm totally disappointed that they released this film when they did because I'm positive that the release date is the only thing that caused it to open poorer than the previous two. This film is far superior to the other two in every respect. The story is more intelligently translated to screen, the characters more genuine, the effects superb, etc. In short I find myself jaw on the floor, in rapt attention for the entire duration - which is pretty dam good considering I'm a 26 year old guy. I might even go so far as to say that it exceeds even the beloved Lord of the Rings series in fantasy accomplishment. It's truly awesome. The pace is nearly breakneck, the creatures utterly terrifying (yep, even to a 26 year old guy) and believable, the magic magical, and I could go on and on. I just adore this film. I really hope that this new director returns for some of the future ones. He - more than Chris Colombus - has an incredibly visceral style that you can't help but be drawn in by. He doesn't move the camera just for kicks, but he also doesn't leave it completely static for every scene either. His style is mature and effortless. If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to catch it on the bigscreen. I'd really like to see it again, perhaps even above seeing some of the new highly anticipated films.

10/10 stars,"I loved this film and I just can't get it out of my head.Even though PoA is much darker than the first two films,the magic is still there and the cinematography is just amazing. The visual effects are much better in this film and Cuaron has managed to catch the spirit of the book, even though several scenes are missing. The whole cast is fantastic and I think that Radcliffe has matured soooo much. Best of all was Alan Rickman, who managed to steal every scene he was in, with his wonderfully creepy Professor Snape!! My only complain is that the film is slightly too short and I hope that the DVD will contain an extended version.10/10 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better With Time,"I was never a huge fan of this movie. Everything changed and we feared the loss of Chris Columbus at the helm. With the unheard of director at the time, I feared that we would lose the fantasy element that we had with Chris Columbus, especially when Alfonso Cuaron started talking about ""coming of age"" rather than pure unadulterated magic.I am however delighted to say its ""stood the test of time"" and I think will continue to do so. It is quite an accessible and should be remembered quite fondly.It's somewhat more professional than the first two films in the franchise and it's good to see the young cast fleshing out their roles a little more - they're not so stiff. Having just read Book Seven, the Deathly Hallows, it's quite intriguing to re-watch this movie and recognise the fore-shadowing.Despite another tired clichéd and familiar sound track from John Williams, and another linear, disjointed scene-by-scene adaption by Steve Kloves, this is a fine movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprise,"I don't understand why so many people aren't pleased with this movie, I think the other 2 movies don't even compare with this one.While the first 2 are produced for the eyes of max 10 years old children's, this one is more entertaining for adults also. It's very spooky and has dark characters(even good ones).The Guardians of Azkaban(wraiths) are probably the most interesting characters in the film. The werewolf was a bonus(interesting new vision of a werewolf).I recommend this movie only for those who didn't liked the first two. It's great - vote 7 -",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A good movie  but it leaves out so much of the book!,"If you are a Harry Potter fan without the benefit of reading the books, then I am sure you really enjoyed this latest movie, and perhaps thought it was the best of the trio so far. Most of the fans of the books have said the same thing to me, they were a little disappointed at how much was left out.Having said that I am not comparing the movie to a book for the purpose of this review, so I will say the special effects were outstanding as always  I don't know how they achieve a lot of what is on screen, especially the flying Hippogriff, but it is so seamless that you really don't think it's a special effect at the time, it's only after that you think back on how good the effects were.I would have preferred there to be more subplots in the story, as there certainly were more in the book, but for some reason they left them out.The young actors are growing up in their roles, and I didn't find there was anything wrong with their acting at all, although some people have made comments about their accents being hard to understand. Obviously these people are not British because the accents are not at all hard to understand, but to someone non-British they could be  much in the same way as I struggled to understand some of the accents in Cold Mountain, etc.I think in the next movie I would like there to be more interaction with the adult actors  especially the best ones, like Snape and Hagrid, and perhaps for it not to be quite so dark (I don't mean evil-dark, I just mean dull-dark!).I gave this movie a 9 out of 10  it was exactly what I wanted and expected, and I enjoyed it greatly, I can't wait for November 2005 now for The Goblet of Fire!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Cinematic Masterpiece,"After seeing the magic of Chris Columbus and finding out that he left the franchise, I would never say that they would be able to find an another perfect director for the following movie.

Comparing it to the rest of the franchise, the sets, props and cinematography is completly in another league.

The movie Captures the book's Magic,"The film centers on the escape of the sinister Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) from Azkaban Prison; Sirius was convicted in Voldemort's plot to murder Harry's parents, and now it's suspected he must finish the job by killing Harry. As Harry returns for his third year at Hogwarts, grim wraiths named Dementors are stationed at every entrance to the school to ward off Sirius, but the Dementors are hardly reassuring, with their trick of sucking away the soul essence of their victims. Harry, too, has developed an edge. We first met him as the poor adopted relative of a suburban family that mistreated him mercilessly; this time, Harry is no longer the long-suffering victim but zaps an unpleasant dinner guest with a magical revenge that would be truly cruel if it were not, well, truly funny. Harry is no longer someone you can mess with. I like what Cuaron does with the look of the picture, but found the plotting a little murky; just when we should be focusing on exactly who Sirius Black is and why he killed Harry's parents, there is the sudden appearance of a more interesting if less important character, Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), a real rat who undergoes a change of purpose. Here I savored David Thewlis as a teacher too clever by half, Emma Thompson as the embodiment of daffy enthusiasm, Alan Rickman as the meticulously snippy Snape, Robbie Coltrane as the increasingly lovable Hagrid, and Michael Gambon, stepping into the robes and beard of the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore. But the world of Harry Potter remains delightful, amusing and sophisticated; the challenge in the films ahead will be to protect its fragile innocence and not descend into the world of conventional teen thrillers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A new director, A new formula but the same old magic.","I have just got back from the cinema, where I caught the first showing of the latest in the Harry Potter saga.I'm still a bit lost for words so forgive me if some of the things i say may not make sense. Woweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. (did you understand that?)Daniel Radcliffe seems more man now than the mere boy we met in the first movie and Emma Watson is also on the bloom towards being the newest English Rose. No doubt the two of them will be setting teenage hearts fluttering worldwide this summer. Stand aside Orlando and Keira, you have competition.This was the first Harry Potter movie I watched after having read the book and unfortunately I feel the adaptation was poor. The story was told adequately enough but I feel that several events from the book that would have made for entertaining cinema were omitted and several interesting facts essential to addicts of all things Potter were also overlooked. Like the origins of The Marauders Map for instance.I also found that from out of nowhere we were onto the climax before we knew where we were and we had not yet managed to build up the suspense we should have been experiencing for Harry's first face to face meeting with Sirius Black.In the book, Rowling had used her story telling talents perfectly and by the time this meeting takes place we would all have rather died than to have put the book down. Here, I was startled when I realized what part of the story we were at and then tried to remember whether I had fallen asleep or not as it seemed a large proportion of the film appeared to be missing.Despite this it is every bit as fascinating and awe-inspiring as the other two offerings and if, like me you are a fan of Harry Potter and his magical world then you will not be disappointed.I was also impressed by the depiction of both The Dementors and Buckbeak and they were on film exactly as I had pictured them in my mind as I read, as was also the stag shaped patronus.Sir Micheal Gambon steps into the role of Prof. Albus Dumbledore and although he is an accomplished actor who adopts the role exceptionally well, one cannot help but miss the late, great Richard Harris. I'm sure that over the years and with four future Potter yarns planned, we will all grow accustomed to Gambon, but to me the role was haunted by Harris' ghost which therefore distracted me in my efforts to believe that this is supposed to be the same man from the previous two movies.Having logged on to IMDb I checked out the castlist and it is great to see a movie (an American movie mind you) filled almost entirely with home-grown talent. Gary Oldman is as dominating as ever and Alan Rickman is at his ""freak me out"" best. Also a return for the likes of Sir Robert Hardy and Dame Maggie Smith and the ever watchable Julie Walters are a blessing.Fans of British comedy will also be amused by the cameos made by the likes of Dawn French, Lenny Henry and Paul Whitehouse.To me however the best performances are made by David Thewlis as Prof. Remus Lupin, yet another Defence against the Dark Arts teacher, and Emma Thompson as the comical yet scatty Prof. Sybil Trelawney the Divination mistress. I have never really been a big fan of Thompson's in the past as I found her films a little to ""arty farty"" for my tastes, but her roles in Love Actually and Azkaban have lead me to believe that she is the possibly the most gifted and natural actress around today.Another hit for the series which leaves us awaiting Goblet of Fire (my favourite book) with an impatient lust.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Took a dark turn here and it was certainly a move to the future.,"Now this is my least favourite of the series and I just cannot place my hands on why, the film has stellar acting performances by all cast and crew and the film keeps to the book quite well but the only problem was, was that it did not keep the same vibe the 1st and 2nd one had. In this third film, Harry becomes a lot more wise, he is now having to face Demeter's and is continuing his feud with Draco Malfoy but overall I do not think the film came off. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and I love the ultimate darkness of the films following but there is something about the unfolding of this one that does not feel right.

A Thrilling Third Installment,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban gives us a glimpse of the rest of the franchise. The plot follows Harry Potter as he is again faced with a new rising threat. The movie is the most engaging in the franchise. The lore is much deeper than the previous films, the stakes are greater, and there is hardly a moment without suspense. This movie is a magical roller coaster for all viewers. The flow of this movie is perfect; it glides more smoothly than cream in coffee. The theme of this movie revolves around 'everything is not always as it seems' and 'true friendship saves the day'; themes seen throughout most Harry Potter movies. The characters and acting are on point. The dialogue has layers of depth and closely relates to the books.

Very good but feeling rushed,"The best Harry Potter movie yet?! Arguably, no. I would say that this film is on par with the last two - all entertaining and magical films.I was a bit concerned that by having a new director the feel of the series would change for the worse. However, new director Cuaron has proved me wrong and made a sterling film. Granted a lot is missing from the book and explanations to why things are happening are rather lack-lustre or just missing altogether. Its quite easy to see where scenes have been enhanced from the book to make them all the more thrilling and I could spend ages moaning about which bits they missed and should have put in but the crew has done well to fit all the book into just over two and a half hours of film. I'm just glad it has been a while since I have read the book!Cuaron's take on the scenery in and around the castle we got to know so well in the first two films breathes new fresh air into the series and adds a bit more excitement to the film. There are new robes, the tables in the great hall for each house have been re-arranged and now to get to Hagrid's Hut you must cross a long wooden bridge. Michael Gambon replaced Richard Harris as Dumbledore perfectly and performances from Emma Thompson (Trelawney), David Thewlis (Lupin) and Gary Oldman (Black) were all very good. I also have to say that Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson appear much more confident in their roles this time round and turn out their best performances yet. My favourite parts are firstly the way there has been a bit more humour injected into the film; secondly, the way the night bus was portrayed; and last, the way they did my favourite chapter in the book, 'Hermione's Secret' because it turned out just as I had imagined!Overall, a very good film. Not quite how I imagined it, feels a bit too rushed in places but very entertaining none the less. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I was more neutral on Michael Gambon, but Richard Harris left big shoes to fill. I will be curious to see how he tackles Goblet of Fire. The kids are really becoming quite gifted actors and are growing up so quickly. What a difference between the three movies. The cinematography was very unique in this one and there was much more of a feel to the castle.

The best of the Harry Potter films so far.,"I thought this was the best of the Harry Potter films so far. Quite possibly because I couldn't remember the little details in the book, and it had been years since I read it. The first two movies, although good, didn't seem quite like what I pictured. Because I had little preconceptions, I liked it more overall. I thought it was very easy to follow, and a cute movie. It's nice seeing the main actors older, and acting more like teenagers. Their non-uniform attire also makes it better, in my opinion. The effects were good, and beautiful backgrounds only added. Some construe it as darker than the others, and perhaps it is, but only a little. The characters are growing older, after all.

I have read many of the comments placed here and it is clear I am in a minority because I haven't read the books. As a non-reader I am happy to report that this movie is by far the best.Maybe the Director has left Mike Newell some explaining to do for the next instalment but he still created a very enjoyable stand-alone movie. There were no holes or blanks for me so let's hope I remain in touch with the whole story purely by watching the movies. If this isn't the case then I will have to take time out to read them, clearly it won't be a challenge.Everyone can enjoy this movie, for heaven's sake will all you armchair critics please stop over-analyzing!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Something Wicked This Way Comes...,"This is a wonderful movie. It's very gripping and the special effects are beyond brilliant. It's much darker than the first two, and we are introduced to three new characters, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Professor Trelawney. Oldman, Thewlis and Thomson deliver fantastic performances as the three newcomers... The Dementors are crossovers of Wraiths and dark ghosts, and they left much of the audience in awe. Even though the director left out quite a few of the parts from the book, this movie doesn't disappoint at all. It's fun, and it really captures the imagination of even those who aren't Harry Potter fans. I just hope the Goblet of Fire is half as good as this one was - I'll be very satisfied indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Rich, atmospheric, and one hell of a ride.","Chris Columbus's two Harry Potter films were good, and they did a fine job of setting up the Harry Potter universe; but there was something missing from those films. They both lacked a style of their own. Now comes Alfonso Cuaron, whose Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has style to burn, as well as plenty of substance. Screenwriter Steven Kloves makes many noticeable changes to J.K. Rowling's masterful novel, and the result is a great script. Kloves brings in his own dialogue, and it works; there are plenty of great one-liners. Several subplots had to go to make the film fit (I missed the Quidditch Cup storyline most of all), but it was all for the best. Among the regular castmembers, Emma Watson continues to be the big discovery of this series. Hermione was already my favourite character in the books, but Watson takes the character several steps higher. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint also do great work here. Michael Gambon is great as Albus Dumbledore, bringing to the screen the quirkiness and uniqueness that was largely absent from Richard Harris's portrayal of the Headmaster (no offense is meant to Harris, who was in the twilight of his life at the time, and seemed too tired). David Thewlis is wonderful as Professor Remus Lupin, although I hadn't pictured Lupin as having a moustache. Gary Oldman, likewise, is excellent as Sirius Black.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
harry potter 3 is the best movie yet!,"i totally loved the book and the movie but found that the movie didn't have some of the key aspects the book had like who Padfoot Prongs Moony and Wormtail were and it also had other little bits that were left out or changed. I didn't really think the new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) was that great, i mean his acting was all good, but his voice (which he cant change so no offence to him) his voice didn't really work with Dumbledore the character. MY favourite character was Sirius Black! and I'm a bit sad we didn't see more of him, but oh well, Gary oldman was really really good even if it wasn't really what i thought he would look like never the less he was GREAT! Professor Lupin was really good too, unfortunately in the movie a lot of his parts were cut down, where as in the book there was a lot more of him. over all Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was EXCELLENT!!! i really loved it! Looking forward to the FOurth movie WHICH IS OUT SOON!!!!!!! YIPPEEEEEE cant wait to see more of Sirius even if its only gunna be a little! Also looking forward to when the 5th movie comes out..that if it does come out, cause i haven't heard anthing about it.see ya's all! SIRIUS ROCKS! GO Gary Oldman!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Because I'm nice,"I mean i thought this movie was boring and childish and lord of the rings was 100% better. I'm sorry but i thought the books were boring and the movie were even worse. I mean bad acting and bad effects, to computerized and not believable at all. I mean the only character i liked was Malfoy, because it bad but i mean i like the bad guys. I mean i don't know what else to say but this movie was very disappointing and upsetting at the same time. I'm sorry but LOTR'S thats where i'd give a good review. I mean i think the HP movies are aimed at younger audience but it sure seems like it, and maybe thats why i didn't like it but my sister is 23 and she loved it so i mean i guess if you've read the books and you're a devoted fan then you'd totally love the movies!",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Harry At His Most Magical!,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third in the series of books and movies.  For the third installment, Alfonso Cuaron takes over for Chris Columbus as director.  And he truly shines as he takes the helm! ""Azkaban"" is my favorite of the Harry Potter movies!  The imagery is beautiful and amazing, such as Buckbeak the hippogriff's appearance.  There has been much creative license taken with the original book, we must admit. But a few of the changes could be called improvements, such as the development of the Marauder's Map.  Anyway, I'll be looking forward to what Mike Newell can do when he directs the fourth installment, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
By Far the Best Harry Potter!,"First of all people lets stop comparing ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" to the novel, after all, how many movies are as good as the book? I've never read any of the books & in a way am glad I didn't, as it may have ruined this incredibly fine cinema experience, though I doubt it.Now, let's compare this film to the other two ""Harry Potter"" films, which is a much more fair comparison. For me, ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a far improvement over the first two. While the first two had their childlike fantasy charm for us grownups, there was nothing really in these rather thin films to keep anyone extremely interested over the age of 14 with their rather thin & banal plots & long running time. When making a child fantasy film that the adult child in me will love, I need a stronger & darker plot, characters filled with complexities, credible dialog, darker stronger special effects, more adult content, & a great sense of wonder. Here ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban fulfill all these requirements in the same grand sense of the king of all child fantasy films ""The Wizard of Oz."" I'm not saying ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is near the masterpiece that ""The Wizard of Oz"" is, but just like that great film I had a great sense of wonderment as I watched the story unfold. Just like that great film there were dark & mysterious characters that were not at all quite what they seemed, & finally like that great film Harry just like Dorothy is searching for the way back home to his roots.I felt this film was an incredible improvement over the last two; much credit has to be given to the director who handled superbly the maturing Harry into a young man with real issues that we all can relate to. Even the look of the film has matured; the camera work was just incredible! The special effects fantastic! I've never seen Hogwarts look more real, wonderful yet foreboding at the same time. The creatures were done with a true sense of realism that is sooo needed for a film like this to succeed; my only complaint (Spoiler) was the rather weak & childish looking Werewolf. It reminded me of the Pink Panther. Maybe it was meant not to scare the kiddies to much, but then again the truly malevolent Dementors surely were enough to scare any 10 year old, so why make the Werewolf so...well...un-Werewolf like? Also one complaint about the plot is the character of Malfoy, he was just to weak & wimp like, it would of also been nice to see his father again in this picture, but with that said I can not really fault this film at all.""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" truly enthralled the child in this 43 year old body, I would highly recommend this film to other children of my age & younger & older. A truly magical experience, let the child out!****1/2",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Finally it did it...,"Watching this movie was a an experience much alike reading the books... It contained some of the same magic emotion...After watching the first two i was disappointed... They were OK, i guess... But they never grabbed me like this one did...Reading the books is always better... You get more into it, and the feeling is then more intense... But this is almost the same... It is the perfect translation from book to film...I am ever so grateful for the director switch...Altough i adore the cast... They are all so sweet and perfect for this type of film...-Harry Potter fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it but they missed major parts,"I really enjoyed the film, but i had to constantly keep in mind that i could read the book again if i wanted a better version. As humans we all have faults - the director and screen writer are human in the fact that they did not follow this book. Why is so important to follow it? Because it is bloody good! All of the suspense and emotion was taken out (for the most part) I would think that viewers who have not read the books would be confused at times. Curon says that the left out parts will be incorporated into another movie - but with what time? Books 4 and 5 are both longer than book 3 - so how the heck could they fit those missing parts into one of the other books? Plus there was a lot of wasted time on artsy poses and things that were not in the book- so why add it if they wanted to make it short and sweet?aside from the missing pieces of the book - I did love the movie!Molly",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The wait is over!,"I've been eagerly awaiting this film and was not disappointed. I caught a midnight show and not once did I start to fall asleep.Right away you notice a different director is at the helm, which added a nice touch. Also, there was not a lot of dilly-dallying like in the beginning of the books. Now the movie did follow the book (I think my favorite of the series) and didn't add anything new, there were some things left out (as always).Overall I loved the film, it was much more intense then the others and definitely the best so far. I do wonder how some children will react. The intensity is very high especially at the end. The dementors were everything I thought they would be but what a child might think of them could be very different.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Read The Book,"I think the only reason to watch any of the Harry Potter movies is to be able to hold on to that Potter ""magic"" a little longer and to be able to see the perfect casting that was done on all the films. The perfect cast only falls short on one occasion and that was the Dumbledore replacement. I just never believed he embodied the humor and deep strength required for that role.Anyway, that said, I saw this film before I read any of the books and walked away not having a clue of what it was about. I saw it twice and still couldn't figure out what it was about. After I finally got around to reading the books and saw it again, I was able to make some sense of it. The problem was, by then I saw how much they left out and so it was unsatisfying for that reason too. Of course, it looks great but that's as far as it goes, particularly if you've read the book.I cannot understand why, when these books and films are so enormously popular worldwide as they are, why the film makers are not willing to turn each book into 2 separate films? There is SO much material, so much that is vital to the story and then to cut it out just to keep the film around 2 hours in length is criminal. Given that the cast is so strong, I can't imagine a remake in years to come ever being better than this one. My fondest wish is that they will at least do this for the last 2 books. Make 4 films please!!! People will go and love them and the film makers will make tons of money. What's wrong with that?! Think ""Lord Of The Rings"" and all the Oscars they received..... Oh, I hope they do Harry justice in at least the last two books!",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth the wait,"The third in the Harry Potter was definitely worth the wait.  I didn't get a chance to finish the book before going to the movie so I cannot comment on how it compares to the book, but I loved this movie.  The film is literally darker than the previous two movies.  There are a lot of scenes where it is raining or snowing outside, did I go into The Day After Tomorrow by mistake? Just kidding.  Anyway, Harry must unravel what The Prisoner Of Azkaban has to do with before he gets killed.  The actors are all superb, particularly the actor who replaced the late Richard Harris as Dumblebore. I like how the main characters are growing up in these movies.  I look forward to seeing more adventures of Harry, Hermonie, and Ronald in Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but not as good as the book.,"This movie was great! But seeing how Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book it didn't live up to what I thought it would be. I would have been very confused if I hadn't read the book. And some things just p*** me off like how Harry didn't get the firebolt until the end, and how they didn't say who Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs were. But overall it was good. The scene where Lupin turns into a werewolf was great. I pictured him as more of a wolf though. And who else thinks that Ron and Hermione are going to start dating in the seventh or sixth book? I love when Harry blows up Aunt Marge! I'm kinda a Harry Potter addict. This was truly a great film and you should go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
