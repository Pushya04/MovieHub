"Phenomenal acting, not personally gripped by the story","It has been a while since I watched a film where the acting and casting is so damn convincing - I have to start this review by saying that.The plot is definitely off the beaten track anf the writing very very much a breath of fresh air.Unfortunately this is a film that can come down to tastes quite a bit when the reviews come round, and although I can't necessarily critique it specifically, there is something about it that I just couldn't get gripped by, and the ending didn't truly satisfy me (though the end scene itself is probably the high point of the movie. Confusing review, I know)This is not a negative review by any means, but 8-10 are reserved for films that truly get you talking, or have a huge emotional impact in my opinionAs a recommendation, this film is a definite yes. I believe that I am on the side of people who this genre doesn't appeal to much at all, but as a piece of film and a showcase of acting, it is utterly utterly great.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Excellent, gutsy filmmaking","This is a compelling family drama charting one man's rise and fall as he ruthless exploits oil in the American west. It has everything you could want from a great Hollywood movie: subtlety, excellent acting, a thoughtful and intelligent script and quite wonderful cinematography.It's a film in which the oil is a supporting character in itself, and the series of unfortunate deaths and accidents that beleaguer our leading man reminded me of Emile Zola's excellent novel, Germinal. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another assured performance here, living and breathing rather than merely acting his role, and watching his growing feud with the slimy preacher is the stuff of great cinema. All in all a wonderful, epic film, old fashioned in the best possible sense.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Truth Hurts,"People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways.What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us.Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The most flamboyant  portrayal of materialism and its alienating effect ...,"It's about expansion, it's about capitalism, and whatever that caused the demise of the Wild West myth. ""There Will be Blood"" looks, smell, feels like a Western but this is an Anti-Western more than anythingThere's so much to say about this movie but it left me speechless at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis was hypnotic, giving a performance that reminded me of Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane"", and Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" ... He's definitely one of the greatest actors of his generation, especially in this performance that probably best defines the alienating effect of materialism. The 40's had Charles Foster Kane, the 80's had Gordon Gekko and the 2000's have Daniel Planview.Indeed, ""There Will be Blood"" is not your typical 'soul corrupted by money and/or power' drama, as I said, it's all about materialism, ending with a pocket filled by gold and a heart made of the same stone you've been working on all your life, it's trusting anything that has a specific color, a specific smell, working on a land to find a greasy black liquid gushing from its womb, and never, never trusting or giving any credit to ""nothingness"" or ""abstraction"".Daniel Plainview considers these abstractions with the most profound disdain. Nothing is free, nothing comes from nothing, nothing is unsubstantial. If one claims to be your brother, he has to prove it, if one should make a deal with you, he should talk business and not about education ... not because it's personal, not because it has nothing to do with business, BUT because it is NOTHING and nothingness irritates Plainview as if the only thing he could believe on had to be material. The rest is nothing, feelings are nothing, believing is nothing, these so strong and noble words for us, well, Plainview doesn't give a damn about them...And more than anything, above all these abstractions, there is religion, God is Daniel Plainview's archenemy  this is the ultimate masquerade for him, the cancer that gangrenes the progress, an evil that transforms people into sheep, almost like animals, the biggest hypocrisy of all  Plainview, the capitalist, almost shares the same opinion than Marx who thought religion was people's opium. And because Plainview despises this hypocrisy, he tries to exorcise his hatred by using religion to achieve his plans, exploiting it, like he exploited his adopted son. No feelings, no sentiments, everything should serve a palpable purpose. The end justifies the means.And ultimately, he gets rich at the end, he's a respected and feared tycoon, as the purest and most implacable illustration of the American dream. But is he happy? no! because power, prosperity, those are still empty words ... he believes in material, in things, in stuff he drinks like the iconic 'milk-shake' metaphor that still resonates in my mind as one of the most memorable hymns to greed and pragmatism. Plainview is greedy, but not evil, evil is still too abstract a word; because it implies the use of one own conscience while Plainview's conscience was dedicated to one goal: getting bigger, possession, expansion, territoriality.And are we to blame him? Let's not forget the bleak cinematography at the beginning of the film where we could feel, the stink of the oil, the hardness of the rocks and the land as an incontrollable enemy ... let's not forget that Plainview spent half of his life stuck alone into dark holes made of land, stone, metal, oil, and raw matter, so close he could almost feel them, so close it became a part of him ...""There Will Be Blood"" is the quintessential film about materialism and its alienating power, when all that matters is matter!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be a Masterpiece. Daniel Day Lewis is HIM,"This film is masterpiece on all levels. The acting from everyone, but especially Daniel Day Lewis, is amazing. The writing, is superb and fits the time period. The on location shooting, phenomenal. The script and direction from Paul Thomas Anderson has never been better. Yes, this is a slow burn, but on multiple rewatches, it doesn't feel long. In fact the slow burn feels more nuanced every time I watch this picture. Oh and we can't forget about Robert Elswit's gorgeous cinematography of California in the late 1800's. It's one of the best movies shot on film of all time, and he deservedly won the Academy Award for this. I love ""There Will Be Blood"" and it's reflection of capitalism and religion that can be seen even to this day. Thank you PTA and the rest of the cast and crew for creating a truly cinematic experience that will last forever in my head, and one that I will continue to revisit for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Remember Those Hollywood Studio Epics? Me Either. But We're Covered.,"The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been a contender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. But I'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it. Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damned refreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshine Lewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn't gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past...",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"One of my top five of all time, For Film viewers not movie goers","There Will Be Blood. Chilling, Sublime, perfect.First I must say the Soundtrack is amazingly disturbing and sets the tone of the film from the first scene. Many forget the amount of mood that sound sets.The film held me enraptured from first to last second.The story is perfectly displayed. Ever thing is laid out before the viewer in an intentional pace.The film is for viewers with imagination and foresight who can see through the shams of modern movie plot and into the realm of literature.The acting is simply stunning. Daniel Day Lewis can portray lines with a single expression and does in this film.I'm sure many will not enjoy this movie and all I have to say to them is go watch Transformers 2 again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unapologetic Tour de Force,"PT Anderson's name already means something, or I should say something else. His self assuredness alone gives me shivers. A modern artist with such clear and severe vision of the world. Boogie Nights, Magnolia, even Punch Drunk Love have an Wellesian disregard for what's in or out. His films are landmarks that may infuriate some, confuse others and mesmerize the rest of us. Here, with the rigorous tale of an impervious oil man, PT Anderson outdoes himself. He has Daniel Day Lewis as his accomplice in a performance that would be as difficult to match as it is difficult to describe. There is a monstrous beauty here that not even a broken nose can disguise. The saga is filled with long silent moments of tension that take place in a cinematic canvas and an actor's head. PT Anderson must have known that this was going to be, not only not a mainstream opus but a hard pill to swallow. I for one stand up to applaud his daringness.",,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best of the last decade,"There Will be Blood! What a fine film! In fact I would go as far to say it is one of the best of the last decade. Visually, it is stunning, I loved the skillful cinematography and shots and the scenery was amazing. Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.There Will be Blood is brilliantly directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and the characters are intriguing. In fact to me the character of Daniel Plainview makes the movie. Magnificently portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, he is quite complex- while monstrous and cold-hearted, because of his love for his adopted son I wouldn't necessarily call him completely evil either. Paul Dano also does a fine job as Eli Sunday.Overall, a truly fine film and one of the best of the last decade in my view. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The parts were greater than the whole,"This is a most difficult movie to comment on, and I find it hard to put into words as to the reason. I think I enjoyed the movie, but how, why? Did I enjoy Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal as the leading antagonist? Most defiantly. DDL has provided us with many memorable performances and his role as Daniel Plainview is no less in intensity as was Butcher Bob, nor any less authentic as Nathaniel Poe. Did I enjoy other aspects of the film? Sure! The period piece was of considerable interest; how oil can transform your life, for better, worse or otherwise. The cinematography was beautiful and telling. I fully appreciate the hard, dirty, bone weary work that this occupation would entail. The rag tag day-to-day existence for those working the oil fields, and the land from whence it came. The score too was beautifully blended, adding to the epic scope of the experience. Paul Dano was very convincing too as the prophet/preacher of the small community where Plainview acquires vast tracks of land. His character was equally complex, and I felt he complimented DDL quite adequately. Even the story had many merits, as we came to understand the type of people who produced oil, and how the product of its labor and influence can impact those who were associated with its extraction. So one would think that the buzz and hype around it in February 2008 are worthwhile, yet I cannot seem to agree. There is something missing, something that falls short of the expectations. Too many people are of opposite opinion regarding this movie; it is either a masterpiece or drivel. I find it is neither, although I am much more likely to lean towards the former. For that reason alone I should be what, somewhere five or seven on a scale of 1-10? Perhaps it does, I just wish I could feel it. So should I give it a 7 and stop wasting time lamenting over it? Yes, a 7, for reasons I can explain but not feel confident about. It pains me to do so, therefore I can only conclude that my expectations for this movie were not met.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Stunning,"This film raises the game for everyone out there. I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental). Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is in a league of its own: his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions, are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy Lee Jones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggering performance) can't quite attain. I will watch this film again and again simply to see something so raw and so moving and so gut-wrenching. This is why I love movies; this is what made me want to make movies when I was fourteen years old.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Powerful Blow,"Who is Paul Thomas Anderson? There is something about him that does't belong to this earth. That could be a compliment or not, it's all up to us. That's what make his cinema so damn unique. At the end of the day it's all up to us. But the abrasive way in which he visits universes and throws his views to us is so powerful, so arrogant, so enthralling, so infuriating that the experience leaves you baffled and suspicious. but also enchanted, transformed. Here, Daniel's saga could very well be the saga of a Hollywood maverick. So little time for sentimentality. Daniel Day Lewis seems to understand it all and he adds his unmistakable humanity to another monster, after his butcher in Gangs Of New York. His performance goes beyond anything we've seen recently anywhere. From Upton Sinclair to Paul Thomas Anderson via Daniel Day Lewis an unmissable work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film that will leave film-goers pondering for a long time,"PT Anderson delivers perhaps his best work with ""There Will Be Blood"". Unlike ""Magnolia"", the film's daunting runtime is not very daunting whilst watching it. All acting in the film was solid, even the work of the child actors. Daniel Day-Lewis in particular delivered a truly phenomenal performance, capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity, and comedy simultaneously, at many points throughout the film. At no point does the time period distract from the power of the film. Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve too deep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past. This is not the case for ""There Will Be Blood"", as human interactions are the focus of the film. Johnny Greenwood's chilling score is very strong, benefiting from the elegant minimalism that he show's in the band Radiohead. The cinematography is also spectacular. Robert Elswit beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters. All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing a maniacal and, shall I say, oily character","I had heard about what a great movie ""There Will Be Blood"" is. A friend of my family said that she didn't really like the movie, but described a certain sound in it.Well, now that I've seen the movie, there are a few things that I can say about it. First, Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing the completely maniacal, amoral, self-aggrandizing oil magnate Daniel Plainview. Second, Plainview's speech about how he'll bring all the modern amenities to the small town; that brings to mind the fact that the whole American west now does have all those things...they put all these things in the middle of the desert, prompting everyone to use a lot of water, resulting in water shortages. Third, the subject of petroleum calls to mind present-day international politics. Finally, I would say that Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano each individually are better than the movie as a whole (not to diminish the film).Probably the most intense scene is the final segment: there's what Plainview does to his son and then to Paul Sunday (or is it Eli?). All in all, it not only adds up to a very good movie, but Paul Thomas Anderson (""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"") is showing himself to be a very good director.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Revitalizing, masterful, and utterly terrifying.","What is evil? What is hate? How low can an individual go with one's actions and still be considered human....? These, quite possibly, are the biggest questions raised in There Will Be Blood.Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis, the tycoons at the helm of this dig for moral oil, tell a story that takes the archetypal anti-heroes of 'Citizen Kane' and Travis Bickle of 'Taxi Driver' to a whole new, 21st-century level. The film, using Lewis's character Daniel Plainview, walks through incredibly dangerous cinematic territory that questions religion, plays with the nature of greed and hate and evil, and with it all, draws terrifying parallels to the world we live in today. The film and its main character claw so deep through the limits of humanity and the landscape of hell, that you'll be thanking the Good Lord for the silver screen that divides you from this horrible world Paul Thomas Anderson has portrayed. But despite how safe you may seem in your cushy seat, you will undoubtedly walk out of the theater with all kinds of new demons and ghosts buzzing in your head and ripping away at your subconscious. In this way, Anderson has abandoned his primary previous influence of Robert Altman to take more of a Stanley Kubrick direction, creating moral allegories that creep into your psyche and don't ever leave. You should be scared. Very Scared.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Wow,"If Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, there is something horribly wrong. His performance and this film were amazing. I don't give this kind of accolade out generously. I was at the screening at the Chelsea West. We waited outside in the cold and rain for a good two hours to get in there and get some good seats and I can honestly say, I would have waited double that amount of time. Enough of my rambling though. In regards to the film itself; it was very well done. The cinematography was amazing as well as the set design. As usual, PTA gives us a flawless script with terrifying, humorous, and compelling dialogue. All of the acting was spot on. Paul Dano played the role of a two-faced, maniacal, and power hungry preacher. The young man who plays H.W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A last night, he seemed to know everything about the story and his character and seemed to be a natural. Daniel Day-Lewis. Need I say more? He was breathtaking in TWBB. Amazing is all i can say. You will need to see the film to see for yourself. Some may become bored with the film at times, which is what i gathered from the people sitting around me. I had no problem with the ""slow"" scenes, but the general public may have a problem grasping this film. If anything, this will be the reason if it gets snubbed at the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Boredom,"This movie had fantastic acting, beautiful visuals, and a tremendous authentic feel to it. On the other hand, the story was slow in parts, the soundtrack was ghastly, and the movie was a tad pretentious. Let's face it, Daniel Day Lewis is one of this generation's finest actors and deserves any accolades for his performance. What I don't get is why this movie is being touted as the one of the 200 best movies of all-time. It was OK. Some great things, some not so great things. Could it have been shorter? Probably. But there are plenty of fantastic, epic 3 hour movies for all kinds of taste (Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Gone With The Wind, etc). I just don't think this was one of them.If you are a fan of DDL, then you will likely enjoy this movie. It had some funny moments and several great scenes. But it is boring. Heck, there isn't a single word spoken for the first 30 minutes. OK perhaps I am exaggerating, but it seemed like 30 minutes. In fact, during the first scene, I thought, ""That has to be the most boring job in the world."" 60 minutes later I realized I was mistaken - a film critic having to sit through this movie would be the most boring job in the world. However, it did improve, if only slightly.In the end, this was really nothing more than a turn of the century period piece about the oil rush. There was a lot of ""I'm going to buy that land!"" and ""I like to quail hunt"" and ""we believe in God, you heathen!"" I think I expected too much and was let down. I wanted Gangs of New York and The Last of the Mohicans and instead I got The Aviator....a fine movie, about a crazy rich guy.

"A blood-soaked, oil-sopping epic that'll delight many, dissatisfy others","""I'm an oil man!"" Asserts Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) to a colony of naïve citizens of which he is astutely slipping into his trouser pocket one by one. However (in this case) the man speaks no lie for his veins do indeed run rich with plutonium oil. A crude, black substance embedded deep in the merciless heart of director Paul Thomas Anderson's gargantuan North American epic- There Will Be Blood. A perpetually steady, emotionally-draining and dark character study of an oil guzzling tycoon that vigorously chews on the themes of gluttony and deception, faith and ambition, death and revulsion. Do not be mislead by its title, though. This is not some balls-to-the-wall slasher-flick (as the ""chavs"" sat behind me seemed to think at the outset). It is a gruelling, drawn-out dissection of a loathsome yet sinisterly-comical individual consumed and maddened by his own persona. And it's absolutely formidable- visual and melodramatic arrestment at its bona fide best that exudes cinematic precision and awe with satire to spare. But it's also a long-winded affair. So thrill seeking, gore-craving moviegoers walk away, now. I'm afraid there will be no blood for you. Sorry. Add to that list- chic-flick, rom-com and sci-fi enthusiasts. You guys may be better off buying another ticket. Taking another ride. Those left, steady yourself for, perhaps, this year's most thought-provoking feature driven by a leading character performance fit to rival the very best.Ushering in a near dialogue-free opening 15 minutes with a distinct fade-in, Anderson wastes no time in introducing us to the protagonist. Daniel Day-Lewis playsno scratch thatDaniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview. An ambitious, moustached miner who, while thrashing away at the crust of his motherland- at the turn of the twentieth century- strikes oil. A profitable discovery that fortuitously leads him to H.W (Dillon Freasier), a new-born infant of whom he slots forcefully under his oil sodden wing only to drag about the entire continent in search of large segments of land in which crude oil is stirring directly beneath. Soon enough, Plainview forges a blossoming ""family"" oil drilling corporation that soon establishes itself as a force in the industry and prospects appear even brighter when, in 1911, Plainview receives a generously eerie, yet pricey tip-off as to where there may be a sturdy supply of his beloved oil. A tip-off in which he pursues like a unwavering moth to an oil fuelled flame as he meanders ominously into Little Boston, California where the true colours of the indomitable oil baron edge disturbingly into light.Daniel Plainview is an angry, vengeful man whose promises and loyalties to those around him are as false and as futile as his love and respect for God. He ""guarantees"" the people of the Little Boston ranch; food, water, schools and, to the town's radically odd preacher Eli Sunday (an inspired Paul Dano), a newly renovated church of the Third Revelation. But he cares little for the reserving of his pledges and spends little time guilt-tripping over his numerous acts of iniquity. ""I look at people,"" he says ""and I see nothing worth liking."" ""I have a competition in me,"" he continues ""and I want no one else to succeed"". Self-centred sociopath?Yep, for Plainview is as putrid and as predatory as any character to ever grace the big screen. He putrefies slowly, though. The end product appearing more entity than man. Better yet: an egocentric emblem of evil that governs the screen in an implausible manner in which only an actor of Day-Lewis' calibre can. The sheer potency of his flawless portrayal actually carries the relatively toothless narrative in areas which could be further criticised for chugging along at a near crawling pace at times.Visually and acoustically, though, TWBB is outstanding- every nuance of every aural and cinematic component work so well with one another to help give the film such power and impact. It's just a shame that no real direction or purpose bled into the screenplay for which Anderson adapted from Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel- Oil. As far as storytelling goes, Anderson has underperformed here. His narrative lacks any legitimate path or hooks and, to be honest, the lack of defining moments- bar the infamous confession and milkshake scenes- within 158 minute running length is a little disappointing. But the manner in which Day-Lewis dictates the audiences' attention more or less vanquishes any negative thoughts regarding the muscle of the plot. Which is why it comes as no surprise that everybody and their brother have duly commended the London-born method actor's impeccable, Oscar winning performance: the epitome of everything grand about Anderson's fifth but not quite finest feature yet; profound, provoking, intense, immense.In spite of its flaws, TWBB is still an exceptionally powerful piece of cinema that'll remain etched in the minds of those who take to it for quite some time. Even if it's quality is not there for all to see, in plain view.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"oh yes, there will be.","just got back from an early screening here in san francisco and thought i'd just lay down a few lines. Mr. Anderson was in attendance but did'nt really comment on the film, I would have liked to hear what he had to say, as I have not been so knocked over the head by an American film in so many years. He was humble in his introduction and let the movie speak for itself. It is a near perfect stew of direction, cinematography, score and last but not least, acting. Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely mesmerizing, Paul Dano made me squirm as the wretched young priest. oh my god, i have chills just thinking about both of these performances. they stay with you. a lot of the film reminded me of Terrence malick, though it did'nt emulate him. just a nice reminder. i think i'll watch days of heaven now. i wish there were more films like this coming out of the states, let's keep our fingers crossed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A compelling but flawed story,"'There Will Be Blood' is a well made and superbly acted film that kept me watching right the way through. However once the story concluded I wondered why I had been so interested, and that is the problem with this film; it is a long winded telling of a rather simple story.At it's core this is a rags to riches story, but of an unsympathetic character. The films portrayal of that character as an enigmatic personality is a rouse to disguise the central characters lack of depth until the films unsatisfying end. What the film builds towards is an admission rather than a revelation, and the delay in reaching this point is what makes this film an hour too long. It would and could have been better told as a short story.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brilliant and chilling, ""Blood"" will leave you speechless","Words don't describe Paul Thomas Anderson's latest epic film project, and he doesn't let them dominate the story either. A significant chunk of ""There Will Be Blood"" has no dialogue and the ability for it to stay so captivating is only a testament to Anderson's incredible ability to tell stories about people through images that says more than about what's happening.Anderson's weapon in this film is no secret. It isn't often Daniel Day-Lewis's name shows up on a marquee these days, especially when it's not tied to something that is sure to be good. This latest choice of his, however, is better than good and so is he. His character, Daniel Plainview, a self-proclaimed ""oilman,"" is deeply complex and troubled. The way that Day- Lewis plays the lighter parts and seamlessly transitions to the darker parts is chillingly believable. Plainview is not only interesting, but he's embraceable, despicable, amusing and frightening all throughout the film.The only truly supporting cast is his son and a self-proclaimed prophet that he comes into complications with played by Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Dano's performance is unfortunately shadowed by Day-Lewis and it does feel like he was too young to be cast, but the 23-year-old is highly impressive and will perhaps be a marquee name in the near future.""Blood"" is otherwise the strength of Anderson and his crew. The original score by Jonny Greenwood, who is mostly known for his guitar skills in Hollywood, brings something abstract that simultaneously fits the film's generally quiet demeanor using a variety of percussion sounds and few musical notes. While some films prefer soaring John Williams themes, Greenwood's theme for ""Blood"" is one dissonant chord and a sound effect that can be best described as a more painful version of the THX sound system effect. It's harsh, but so is the film. Anderson makes every moment count whether it's when there's music or where he puts the camera.To best describe the film in terms of people familiar with Anderson's work, it's his first film that truly translates to the interests of all dramatic film-lovers. It is distinctly his film, yet viewers will be able to grasp it much more easily than the abstract and obscure multiple storyline nature of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" For people new to his work, be prepared to feel some discomfort, but if you pay attention to the way the story is told, then you'll find the mastery of ""Blood.""",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not as legendary as people claim,"This film is about a oil businessman who stops at nothing to gain power and wealth. His morals deteriorate with his increasing wealth.At the moment ""There Will Be Blood"" is the top 23th film on IMDb. People hail Daniel Day Lewis as the best living actor, and this is his best performance. According to the posters in the local cinema, Daniel Day Lewis has got over 50 best actor nominations for this role alone. As a result, I have very high expectations on this film.Daniel Day Lewis is definitely great as Daniel, but I find it rather unfair that Paul Dano does not get any attention. Paul Dano is excellent as a religious leader, and he constantly impressed me with his passionate speeches. The other characters, I am afraid, are not as memorable.As for the plot, it is good in outlining how Daniel's morals decline deeper and deeper. However, I think it does not portray the consequences of his declining morals enough. It would be great to see the moral repercussions of his dirty deeds, and the emotional impact of such acts on others. The current plot only displays how he becomes increasingly corrupted, and I find this less than satisfying.The beginning speechless introduction is far too long, and the ending is far too abrupt and fast. It is disappointing that it does not portray more of Daniel and his son's relationship between his son coming back and his marriage. I would also liked to see more of his son's reaction and emotions after being told the truth. The initial 30 minutes can easily be shortened to make way for interaction between Daniel and his son. Actually the whole film can be shortened, and the pace quickened, without affecting the story.I think ""There Will Be Blood"" is not as legendary as people claim.",,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Blood - Amateur Review,"*NOTE: first time doing a movie review.*Greed can lead to many things. Some good, some bad. It can often lead to a man's downfall. Set in the late 19th-century / early 20th- century, ""There Will Be Blood"" follows the story of Daniel Plainview. The story starts with the camera focused on a single man in a mine who is none other than Daniel. The movie opens up in silence. There is no dialogue, no speech. For 20 minutes I sat and observed a man in a hole mining for who knows what. In these first 20 minutes we are exposed to a number of things that set the tone for movie. We see a dry barren land, age old technology. You see a sweaty man working at a wall with his pickaxe in some dark and dusty hole. It's intense and dark. During these 20 minutes, Daniel strikes oil changing his life. Lives will be changed, decisions will be made, and there will be blood.This movie appears to be filmed on location in Texas and in California, which is a great way to convey Paul Thomas Anderson's message. Half the things in the movie couldn't be done on set. Unless it was done by some type of magic, then kudos to the team. I personally think that filming on location adds another dimension of realism to the movie, especially since it is a western type movie. Back to what the message is. Well, if I were to take a swing at what the message is, I'm going to say it's about the struggle for power and control. You can take this away from Daniel and his enemy, Eli Sunday (who starts a church in Little Boston called ""The Third Revelation""). Both of them want it all, to be on top in their respective careers. However, the struggle and desire for power pits both Daniel and Eli together for control of Little Boston. It also provides a historical example for that time period. The message is conveyed fairly well in this movie. But that's not the only thing this movie has going on. I personally think the biggest aspect of this movie has to be the music. It's random, and gets you thinking. Mind you, there isn't any run in the park Benny Hill music. The music is dark, ominous and overall creepy. It sets up the scene and makes it interesting. A good example of this can be located within the first 20 minutes of the film. Creepy music starts to play when Daniel begins his descent back into the mine where the dynamite blew up. According to the creepy music, something bad was bound to happen and it did. The ladder Dan was using to climb down on broke, tossing him like a rag doll. Surprisingly enough, this is where he discovers oil. This makes me think that the music starts only when a significant moment is about to happen, which is it's own type of foreshadowing, for better for for worse.As we progress through the story, you start to see the central theme of greed bloom at a rather rapid rate. Greed takes a grip on our main character Daniel and starts to drive the story in a different direction. He begins get a crazy but in a subtle way. Then, he just becomes a different man. It was amazing to the see the actor, Daniel Day-Lewis, take on this role and own it. He put so much energy and power into this roll and really convinced me that he was going crazy. I fully support Paul Thomas Anderson's cast choice. Each person totally owned his / her role, and made the movie as un-cheesy as possible. The shots were clear, and it wasn't gimmicky. We knew where all the important people were at all times during each scene.I would totally watch this movie again if I had the chance. It was plot driven, it never sidetracked, and each scene was significant to the development of the main character. Out of 10 i would give it a 9 simply because there is no such thing as perfect, only what we perceive to be perfect. It was intense, unpredictable, and overall enjoyable. I don't usually watch these kinds of movies, but this one just might get me hooked to the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Milkshake?,"You can criticize this film at points, but the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing. He certainly has made a career of being menacing. His very presence commands the screen. The sociopath that he plays here is one of those, taking everything he can, having no regrets for his cruelty at any point. He does betray his son and still blames anyone who mentions him, assuming they are judging him. They have every right to. It's interesting that it isn't just the righteous who land on their feet. Daniel is willing to do anything to get what he wants. His passions and obsessions are right there. Anyone who hooks up with him has to know that they are simply pawns in the game. This film is filled with memorable scenes and subtle threat. Levi, the minister, is certainly quite complex and as ambitious as Daniel. His pliable face works for me, though some say he is too whiny and obvious. To me, this is what would work in this setting. For most of the movie he is Daniel's equal in the role of charlatan. The bowling alley scene at the end is worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Blood,"There Will Be Blood – 9.8/10Director: Paul Thomas AndersonWriter: Paul Thomas AndersonGround-breaking, disturbing, distraught,frightening, unnerving, intimidating, and in every sense of the word –'a masterpiece'. There Will Be Blood is a character sketch so strong,so complex, that it might take an individual a lifetime of trials and tribulations to comprehend the forces of human nature at work.The film is dark and desolate, like much of Upton Sinclair's works, on whose book 'Oil' the film is loosely based on. Paul Thomas Anderson's (Magnolia) vision to convert this nature study of capitalism into a stunning film, revolving around an oil baron and a pastor has yielded starkly contrasting reactions. While audiences at large have not taken to the film particularly well, most critics unanimously agreed it was Anderson's best. Daniel Day-Lewis (Daniel Plainview), who plays the role of the oil prospector, has etched a new character in the history of world cinema and Paul Dano (Paul Sunday/Eli Sunday) who became a part of the film after the shooting started has played Day-Lewis' antagonist with perfection.Anderson researched this film with all sincerity and it shows. Day-Lewis spend days understanding the character he was playing, to an extent that the actor who Paul Dano replaced alleged he was intimidated by Daniel's character, off-screen as well! The cinematography of the film is simple brilliance, and rightly earned Robert Elswit, Anderson's companion from Magnolia, an Oscar for best cinematography. While the music of the film did not earn much appreciation, I thought it perfectly complemented the film. In several instances, the music lays bare Day-Lewis' emotions, especially in the instance post the accident, when he has a conversation with his son HW, played by Dillion Freasier.The film had a very strong script. This is almost true of all films made from successful and well written novels. But Day-Lewis has gone a step forward and owned the character. He commands every iota of attention in the film and for the first twenty minutes, where there is no dialogue, Lewis proceeds to build and delineate a character which will ultimately define what the film will be. I am not sure if I have seen a better character sketch in a film, a character so powerful, that it leaves one disturbed when the credits role in. What has amazed me is the magnitude with which the audience and critics alike have misunderstood the character narrative of the film.Lewis' character has largely been interpreted as a heartless, cruel, capitalist for who even his adopted son is just a tool to achieve power and success. I believe this widespread misinterpretation is due to a shallow approach that capitalists are greedy and will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. The character of the film is so complex, that I am not sure if there is enough space and time, and ability to explain the nuances and explore the depths. But I will make a brief attempt to do so.Lewis' character is shown to be highly competitive. A man who trusts no one and loves nothing; he is lonely and believes there is no need to understand people as it would be a futile pursuit beyond that what is obvious. But he is not a man driven by pure greed, nor is he blinded by wealth and affluence as many viewers have believed. His relation with his son, and his inability to chart the course of his son's life, reveal his softer side while throwing light on his own superiority, godlessness and a form of megalomania. His character is extremely rational, but his hatred for everything that competes with him ultimately leads to his destruction. Not only is he aware of this (the last dialogue of the film tells us this), we see several moments where his loneliness breaks him; but the fundamental purpose of a human being shedding tears is undermined if there is no one to wipe them. He rises spiteful, harsher and harder after each trial, like a rock hardened by the incessant heat of a volcano. He seeks some solace, something to hold on to. Any trace of familial blood (There WILL Be BLOOD) which he can create by the virtue of his will or by the hand of destiny, he shall accept. The complexities of his character are so profound, that they only reveal themselves in small and quick passing dialogues and one has to live the character to truly see through him.I dread to say there are common traits Daniel Plainview shares with all and everybody. We have either failed to realize it, even though our actions would speak, or we have managed to subvert, repress and bury them deep enough for acceptance in an unforgiving, conditional society. The film is like a streak of artistic lightening in a bleak sky. Whether this film speaks of perfection or not, we will never know, but one thing is certain, we will debate its mastery for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Cinematic Mastery,"I could go on for pages and pages about this movie but I'm going to keep this short and sweet.'There Will Be Blood' is a masterpiece due to two factors, Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis.First of all, Paul Thomas Anderson is a proved visionary of cinema and he's quite obviously mastered the art of storytelling through character development on screen and most importantly, he knows how to get the absolute best out of his actors. Although 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' showcased a magnitude of talent in its ensemble performances, this film is all about Daniel Day Lewis.In my opinion, Daniel Day Lewis is the greatest actor on the planet, his range is unequalled and I have never come away from one of his performances not in complete awe. This is his greatest work, both subtle and grandiose, genuine and brutal, it is something to be marvelled at and a best actor Oscar has never been so deserved as the one that he picked up for this.Just like Joaquin Pheonix in his latest 'The Master' you come away from this viewing almost exhausted at the raw emotion that spills out on the screen throughout the movie.Perfect filmmaking, this is why I watch movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Daniel Day-Lewis is magnificent as Daniel Plainview. No one could've done a better job. His accent, his voice, his presence and everything else made us ""live"" with the character.

Oh yes . . . There Will Be Boredom.,"If you find a single cliché-ridden scene in this entire movie even mildly unpredictable, it must surprise you every single time the crap in your toilet magically disappears when you flush it. People like to ironically throw around the mindless phrase that whatever movie was ""and insult to"" their ""intelligence"". I have never once stooped so low in a review to say that, but I'm going to go even further here. There Will Be Blood is a downright insult to the intelligence of anyone who has so much as graduated kindergarten. And here is why:First and foremost, every single scene in There Will Be Blood is an unabashed cliché, copy/pasted from other ""epic"" (major emphasis on the quotes) movies just like it. From opening to close, there isn't a single thing you wouldn't expect. Calling There Will Be Blood unoriginal is an understatement. Calling it so unoriginal it's a blatant waste of time is a better way to put it. While people say something doesn't have to be original to be goodand there may be some truth thereit's almost impossible to be fully engaged with something you've seen before. It's like repeating a joke a second time: sure, you may laugh, but it's not nearly as funny as it was the first time. Taking the metaphor further, with There Will Be Blood, the joke is ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" It's been said so many times people don't even know why it's funny. The only people who could even remotely find any entertainment value, or, much less, intellectual value, in There Will Be Blood are the fine-wine-sipping, fine-cinema-whores. The kind of people who are so brainwashed into believing every word the critics say is correct, they'd believe the critics no matter how bad a film is. And There Will Be Blood is pretty bad. I mean, seriously, folks, when a movie has to even copy its title (from Saw II's tagline), you really think the directors have enough imagination to even think of a single creative, much less original, idea? Excuse me as I laugh.The second condemning flaw is that the film has no story. It's just the everyday life of an oilman. While I can sometimes appreciate movies about everyday life, the problem here is there is nothing whatsoever remarkable about it. The man's life portrayed is just as dull as my own. It's as dull as your own. It's completely, utterly unremarkable. I'm pretty sure the movie was trying to ""haunt"" the viewer with its negativity, as the back cover says. However, as I pointed out above, every problem that goes wrong and is intended to ""disturb"" the viewer is 100% cliché and predictable, as well as downplayed without any overt emotion until the very ending. Someone can say it is character driven, but the main character and his son are both, again, cardboard clichés who add nothing to the movie whatsoever. Because of this, the movie just goes on and on without any focus or anything at all worth watching. It takes 1 hour and 3 minutesyes, I timed itbefore anything even remotely, mildly interesting happens, and after that, the movie remains deadpan until the end. This review is actually very hard to write because of the simple fact that the movie is like that old politician phrase: it runs on and on for hours, but never really says anything or does anything. It's a lot like trying to review a 2hr, 30min session of staring at the wall.Other complaints:The cinematography is stunning at the opening. It has an old-fashion look. After the first 20 minutes, however, it completely becomes average. Almost as if it was just a way to hook the viewer, then died off.Giving this film an R-rating is completely ludicrous. Despite the title that it directly stole from Saw II, it literally could have been G-ratedthere was no blood, language, or nudity whatsoeverand certainly no worse than PG.The acting was nothing special. It's solid, sure. It's average. It's run-of-the-mill. Oscar-worthy? Again, that's a joke. I saw nothing special about any of the performances, and some of them (such as Ailman) were downright cheesy.It's always easier for movies like this to portray cliché Christian extremists instead of accurately portraying what 95% of real Christians actually act like. I actually find it rather humorous. I've seen hundreds of films portray Christian extremists, but I can literally count the realistic portrayals of a Christian in a movie on one hand. It's a paradox that There Will Be Blood tries so hard to be realistic, while it uses every over-the-top Hollywood cliché ever used.The ending is an absolute safe, self-parody. It's where the entire bland joke-of-a-movie finally gets a punch line. The ending, without spoiling anything, has to be one of the absolute cheesiest endings of all time, not to mention the way it's played out is, who would have guessed, another cliché. I've seen the exact same ending in countless other movies (for example: Hannibal Rising, Hostel: Part 2, etc.).Overall: There is no point of viewing this movie. It's just a rehash of everything you've seen before, with no redeeming value whatsoever. It's bitingly predictable and unoriginal, and you'll see every turn in the first fifteen minutes, like I did. The story is simply nonexistent, and the characters all have about as much personality as a tree stump. This movie is a whitewashed grave: nice cinematography, but once you look past the pretty movie pictures, you see it's dead inside.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perhaps Too Art House For Its Own Good,"I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released in the cinemas , a story of single minded obsession with some great reviews from Daniel Day Lewis performance . Only problem was when I checked the local listings of the local Odeon cinemas it wasn't being screened . Nor was it being screened at the Edinburgh film house which left me puzzled . I did find out that it screened at the Edinburgh Cameo but had finished its run before I got a chance to see it . I was puzzled that film that received much critical acclaim didn't get a wider release but after seeing it on Sky movies I'm somewhat surprised it got so much acclaim in the first placeThere's a term invented by the American film critic David Bordwell called "" intensified continuity "" which in its simplest term is "" MTV style directing "" . Scorsese did this with GOODFELLAS and CASINO , Oliver Stone with all of his 90s work and Francis Ford Coppolla with Dracula . Bordwell does make a point that shot length seems to be increasing in the late noughties compared to the 1990s . Interestingly NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN which came out the same year as this had a similar , long , rather slow , old fashioned feel to it . But at least NO COUNTRY was a plot driven thriller where as THERE WILL BE BLOOD is character driven which means it can be painfully tedious at some pointsThe cinematography is good and Lewis certainly isn't bad as Plainview , but the problem is in the cinematic storytelling . The film starts with long sequences with no dialogue and these scenes drags on . There's also a problem with trying to figure out what the message is . You could understand if there's a sympathetic Marxist slant on the fundamental flaws of capitalism but then Plainview's nemesis is shown to be a preacher who isn't exactly portrayed in a good light . Moral ambiguity or moral equivalence ? A thinly disguised attack on George W Bush ? I doubt it , more likely it's just an art-house hit that received more praise than it possibly deserved .There's not much wrong with it per se . As I said it's a film that is shot and framed well with good cinematography and good performances . However for audience members like myself whose main interest in watching cinema is narrative it's a film that I'm in no hurry to rewatch",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

Superbly-acted American epic,"There aren't many films I consider as American epics. There are several Westerns and a few others that are uniquely American but they are rare. This is one such rare film.There Will be Blood is an epic that spans the life of an oil driller from the early 1900's. The plot is a bit predictable and there is very little dialogue so this film appears to move slowly, yet keeps the viewer interested.Superbly-acted, the characters are very realistic and recount the struggles faced by pioneers of that era. I can't recall too many other films where I felt empathy for a one with questionable ethics.As some have suggested, the film is depiction of ""true"" capitalism, that built America over the last few centuries, with its inherent requirement of hard work ethic, ruthless pursuit of profit, and, at times, setting aside family values.If you like art films and are interested in Americana, this is a film worth checking out.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Who has the milkshake?,"Curious that both of the two best films of the year (the other No Country for Old Men)- likely two of the most daring and great of American films I've ever encountered- both are measured, classically told stories of the pit of greed that encapsulates in the soulless. In the case of Paul Thomas Anderson's film, he uses a source which, as one might expect if one's read Upton Sinclair, there are as many metaphors to be had as blood.But not poorly laid metaphors at all, or ones that hit you on the head without reason or proper impact. These are the kinds that enrich a work of art, where they can be thought of later as with the themes, while in the midst of things you're just wrapped up in the solar-plexus of the story, and more crucially the storytelling. Daniel Plainview is a prospector at the start of the picture who has an image of himself, one that must never be broken. He digs for silver, then digs for oil, and strikes it rich. But he wants more. He buys up land from an Able Holiday, who's closest related Eli is welcoming, but at a price that the Lord has set (assumingly). Soon there is much oil, lots of it, and a pipeline as well. Eventually, like CF Kane, he's by himself in his big, dark mansion, without a Rosebud to boot.Daniel Plainview is such a great character because he is, as played to complete astonishment and embodiment by Daniel Day Lewis (reincarnating, ever so slightly, his volcanic performance in Gangs of New York), a servant to a God that leaves nothing in its wake. He and Eli, in a more-than-subtle sense, are kindred spirits: they worship their idols, one being money and one being God, but they also have a commonality, which is that what they want is never really enough, and what they want relies on those around them at their blind will. When the two, after years of ""ups and downs"" as Plainview says, have their final meeting in the bowling alley, it becomes less a revelation than a staggering scene of hell. It's one of the most absurdly dramatic endings in all movies.But there's also a greater metaphor, which is the oil itself (by the way, Sinclair's novel is titled ""Oil!"" with exclamation point). Anderson's picture is carefully constructed around a man who for capitalism is his lifeblood, for lack of a better term. The oil keeps flowing, and flowing, as does the money. But it's never really enough. There's an inherent fascination with watching a man, like Kane for example, who can never have enough because of a crucial defect in his humanity. No real friends, no real family (a re-emerging ""brother"" is a big sub-plot), and a son who, when a tragedy befalls him, can never be apart of his own self-created image. Rarely has a character been portrayed, by the actor as well as the director, in such a way that makes him so hateful, so unsympathetic, but never one we can look away from. It's capitalism unforgiven, if that makes sense.And meanwhile, with his characters of Daniel and Eli locked in to the web of money and religion in the center, Anderson crafts a film loaded with visual beauty. He's a director known for elaborate long-takes and tracking shots, but here it's even more measured, more in tune with a classic epic, as though the Grapes of Wrath were turned on its head. The dialog cuts like a knife, the cinematography has a visionary quality that brings out the spectacle and the personal feeling (less mood, though there's that there too) of the compositions. And the music by Greenwood is unlike any ever produced, with strings and wailing chords that pierce right along with the narrative.Altogether, it creates in There Will Be Blood a truly horrific and yet ever so recognizable truth in the American dream. And like No Country for Old Men, none of the characters have a ""happy"" ending. Not that a bleak ending a great films makes. But if it fits, it should be rode out till its logical conclusion. There Will Be Blood can be called all the big words- masterpiece, classic, essential, must-see, and that it's maker is worthy of comparison now (more than ever) to the great filmmakers of old. But it's above anything else a precise drama of conscience, or lack thereof. It's a fine, fine milkshake indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

What can you say? For a man still relatively early in his career, 'There Will Be Blood' is only Anderson's fifth feature film, and his third that tops a whopping 150 minutes. Responsible for the script as well as providing stunning direction, there are few in Hollywood today who can make such heavy, pondering films and somehow hold the attention of so many. Yet despite quite an impressive running time, there's a rich and textured story to be told here that demands every minute of its time. No filler. It's a methodical and deliberate picture, but one that pulls us in from start to finish. The script (adapted from Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"") is beautifully constructed, deep and startlingly realistic. Johnny Greenwood's barebones score is chilling and effective (sadly not eligible for an Oscar), and its cinematography is sweeping and wondrous.A soul-dead oilman, hellbent on succeeding and leaving everyone else in the dust. Whatever the cost. The hype is worthy and very much deserved. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers the performance of a lifetime, one that will surely go down in history as one of cinema's greatest. He is absolutely sensational, every line of dialogue delivered with such a ferocious undertone that will slice through even the toughest of audiences. A brilliantly layered and rich character, Day-Lewis brings Plainview to life with such jaw-dropping vitality. And while it's easy to focus purely on this masterful performance, it's important to keep young Paul Dano in mind as well. A blossoming actor, he shines in this fantastic role as a supposed prophet and healer. These are two actors, both on opposite sides of the spectrum, who understand the art of the craft and pull no punches. They drive 'There Will Be Blood' home.In the end, I find it difficult to call 'There Will Be Blood' a perfect film. A flawed masterpiece, perhaps. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what happens, but a slight road bump seems to halter the film's final act. But any film that can lure Daniel Day-Lewis out of the shadows and back on the big screen is a notable achievement, and it's worth talking about. 'There Will Be Blood' is a deeply challenging film whose ability to rattle an audience is like few others.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
21st century masterpiece!,"The first time I saw ""there will be blood"" I was younger and I didn't pay attention to it. Over time I started to see Paul Thomas Anderson movies and I really liked them, he has a unique and very marked style. but I needed to see this movie carefully and it was just excellent. Daniel day Lewis's great performance is everything like an oil magnate from the early 20th century who as he gets more powerful morally weakens a great character x-ray.
I like to analyze the movies for their emotionality and this one succeeds in spades! Paul Thomas's direction is sober, presenting the story, its context and its characters, the music, the remarkable photography. I am not going to say more it is a very complex but essential film of forced vision.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
To forget you are watching a film,"Daniel day Lewis gives possibly the best acting I have seen, ever. When I'd read my own words without having seen there will be blood, I wouldn't believe it too. For the record, I've seen quite a few good movies in my life, just as most people here probably will have.Whether Deniro plays a disturbed cabbie in taxidriver or a boxer falling from his throne in Raging bull, or even when Brando plays parts like the famous Don Corleone, they are only acting their parts.Daniel Day Lewis IS the part. And that is the biggest reason why this movie is already destined to be remembered by coming generations.One could argue that this movie stands out so much because of the overall lack of quality coming from Hollywood for the last 10 years or so. I beg to differ. Were this movie made in the good 70s, it would still be one of the high and mighty.So why is this film so astounding to me? It's certainly not perfect! It has a few scenes of which (I think at least) are either too long or just obligatory. The Preacher role by Paul Dano isn't hardly fitting or acted too well for the claims I just made!Well, first of all; if you get this film, you can proudly say you are a lot smarter then all the self-proclaimed film-critics who saw this movie and immediately drew lines to citizen Kaine and socialist themes. That's just incredibly silly. Whereas Citizen Kaine is indeed a movie with a clear objective against materialism (as well as a personal vendetta with Welles and the man he portrayed behind the screen), this movie is much more alive and breathing. The main character can't be summarized in 1 sentence, only the full 2,5 hours will do. This is where all similarities end, besides the fact that both characters are becoming wealthier, and the perfection of both movies.There will be blood isn't about one theme really, the circumstances (the oil, greed, time and other characters) function more like a setting, where the main character is created and evolves. Although the movie does (very) effectively display the use of new technologies, and sketches an especially accurate image of the circumstances of small towns during the oil rush.I am fond of history and I really like it when movies accurately portray such things whilst not bragging about it, or making it hinder the plot or feel forced in any way. Because it oftentimes goes so horribly wrong I'm under the conviction that this is also a showing of true artistry, combining this element of film, without the viewer noticing it.I think the greatness of this movie can be summarized in 2 things. The perfect acting that daniel day lewis is doing here. I can't even remember the last time I saw a flick in which I was terrified and melancholic at the same time about a character. Mister Plainview (d.d.l.) isn't good, bad white or even gray, he's very complex, and it will be quite rewarding to study this film more than once to just see more of this conflicting behaviour. Just like the real world (something movies always have difficulty portraying for obvious reasons), this character is not just hard to read, but wholly multi-interpretable. This makes watching his actions and reactions to his surroundings very rewarding and looking closely is not, as in 99% of any stories in any form, something you shouldn't do, in order to find the boundaries of the creator's mind. In fact, it only gets you deeper into it. I can't even remember the last time I had that notion on film or book.The story is also superb, and while complex and long, it's also great writing that revels here. Why is the story so great? Same reason like the acting: It takes a hold of you and you'll forget that you are looking at a movie or a story. You are experiencing it.Personally I think method acting is just a Hollywood fad, I'm partially referencing to this inferior actor who was in the machinist and lost some weight with a lot of huzzah. The Stallone's Or even Deniro who started boxing.. for one of his parts. For Daniel day Lewis however, it seems to work perfectly. I've yet to meet the Hollywood actor who refuses medicine against pneumonia on ground that those things weren't there in that period of time, because he's playing bill the butcher and want's to ''stay in character''. I think that's just nuts, but I can't praise his stellar acting enough, so I won't.I doubt this movie will ever get as much credit as it deserves. I think it's a little too dark and difficult for that. But in my opinion it's the nihilist and very human (although many won't see it) touch this story has, which makes it one of the best movies created so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Wait, what?","Well. This officially becomes the most idiotically boring piece of crap I've ever seen. Ever.All the artsy-fartsy reviewers need to clue in to facts. Movies are ENTERTAINMENT. They can be art, and Im the first person to admit that. But you know what you call art for arts sake? BORING CRAP.I understand nowdays its trendy to go against the basic layout of a story, initiating event, conflict, climax, and all that. But this bucks the trend so much all you end up with is ""Nothing happens, and then nothing happens, and then more nothing happens"".You people can spout off about cinematography and shot framing and all that stuff, but you know what those terms really mean? Technical means that support a storyline, and make a film greater than the sum of its parts. Praising a pointless art movie like this one for these things is like praising a computer game with photorealistic graphics that lacks gameplay. All fluff, no meaning.God I hope one day the artsy-fartsy crowd gets kicked out of movie making. I hope one day the academy awards mean more than pointless art crap. I hope one day a movie that succeeds on all fronts will win awards. But I don't hold out hope when someone can get millions of dollars to put together a pointless piece of crap like this movie.I can only assume that the director intentionally named this movie ""There Will Be Blood"" as a satirical joke. Because the only other possibility is that Anderson has completely gone off the rails.But please. Keep it up. Watching you film school nerds praise a 3 hour long snooze-fest is hilarious.

Original but Flawed Work,"There Will Be Blood (2007)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Ambitious film about an oil man (Daniel Day-Lewis) who will stop at nothing to find the black gold. I must be honest and say I don't know what the whole point of this film was or if it was just trying to show evilness in the world but this 158-minute film kept my interest throughout. I think the film drags somewhat right before the final act but outside of that this is a very good epic that certainly has the look and feel of epics from decades ago. The visual style of the film is the most impressive thing as Anderson's camera takes us on quite a journey and also shows off some amazing locations. Another great thing is how we see how oil was produced back in the day and all the small details on the screen make for a very impressive history lesson. I also loved the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, which are done without dialogue. We see Day-Lewis' rise and how he got started within these opening scenes and even though there isn't a line of dialogue spoken we still learn everything we need to know about him. A lot has been said about the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and while it is a great one I wouldn't call it the best of his career. I think he played this same type of character in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York and I think he was a lot better there but that's certainly not a slam against his performance here because he's great here as well. That snake quality the actor brings to this role is quite memorable and even when he's doing something good or worthwhile, you can still see that evilness in his eyes. The supporting cast were mostly good but they are miles behind Day-Lewis and I think this hurt in several scenes including the ones with the preacher (Paul Dano). Dano is pretty good in the role but the part needed someone a lot stronger who could match wits with Day-Lewis.",,Anonymous,Drama
The Masterpiece Of Our Time,"There Will Be Blood is one of few films that has the singular ability to enthrall both the film snob and casual viewer with a mesmerizing train wreck that demands the viewer's full attention from the first frame and never lets go of the reins. You might not like it, but you cannot look away. Daniel Day Lewis is, of course, fantastic. He embodies the character of Daniel Plainview in a way that is both frightening and fascinating- you will leave this film wondering how Daniel Plainview continues to cosplay as Daniel Day Lewis in media interviews. The story is gripping, unapologetic, and allows us a window into the intersection of unabated greed and the American dream without ever approaching the tone of preaching to the audience. The film takes no stance on the morality of its contents, it simply showcases its story and allows the viewer to formulate their own opinions. It is truly a masterpiece of the modern era and will stand the test of time as such.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Positive to watch,"There Will Be Blood, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and released in 2007, is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as one of the most compelling explorations of greed, ambition, and moral corruption in the history of modern filmmaking. Adapted loosely from Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil!, the film is a stunning visual and emotional experience, offering a haunting look at the lengths to which individuals will go to accumulate power and wealth. Anchored by an exceptional performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and a direction that blends sharp storytelling with a deep understanding of human psychology, There Will Be Blood is a triumph that has rightfully earned its place in the pantheon of American cinema.From the very first frame, the film immerses the viewer in the world of early 20th-century oil exploration. The opening scene, devoid of dialogue, is a masterclass in visual storytelling. We see Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), the ambitious and calculating prospector, as he digs his way out of a mineshaft and begins his journey toward success. The isolation and determination conveyed in these early moments set the tone for the rest of the film-There Will Be Blood is a story about individuals forging their own destinies, no matter the cost. This opening sequence, scored with haunting minimalism by Jonny Greenwood, is an effective setup for a film that will unfold slowly but deliberately, revealing the darkness that lies beneath the surface.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Near Perfect,"In terms of acting and production of a film it doesn't get much better than this. Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano are absolutely incredible in their roles, along with a great score, and amazing imagery throughout the film. PT Anderson builds tension throughout the film making many scenes uncomfortable to watch. However after saying all of that, the only problem I had was that I found it hard to get into the film emotionally. I never really got attached to any of the characters, so I didn't really care when something particularly bad or good happened. There Will Be Blood is a film that will keep you gripped for the whole duration, but I wouldn't say it has really had an impact on me.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterclass in dialogue,"This modern classic depicts a dark tale about power and greed. It's chilling, extremely upsetting, but still satisfying to watch because of Daniel Day-Lewis' complex and phenomenal performance. He displays a character that is equally interesting as he is emotionally crippled. It's a perfectly written character study that doesn't fail to dig deep, even if we find no humanity in its depth. The dialogue is overpowering and poetic, the cinematography and the score are sensational and the philosophical relevance of the movie is still noteworthy to this day. The only complaints I have is that it drags out in the middle and that some sequences should've been cut shorter.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Unbearable Film Scoring/Music,"This is my second attempt to watch this film after 13 years and I failed again to complete watching it. At the first time, I thought maybe I wasn't in the right mood and I couldn't get into it enough. But this time I realized that the director's choice for using a sinister, disturbing film scoring (music) going on ALL THE TIME no matter what is happening on the screen kills it for me. This is something that happens with cheap TV films or amateur student shorts, a veeery wrong use of scoring. Of course, since this is a big movie with enough budget, the scoring and the recording and mixing is brilliant. So, it's not about the music or the composer but the director's choice.I get that most people don't even notice this kind of thing and enjoy the film but I couldn't help it. Maybe it's because I'm a musician.Undoubtedly Daniel Day-Lewis is an incredible actor and he acts brilliantly in this film too.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Great acting, but not moving","I will be very quick and only confirm that: 1) Daniel Day Lewis gives an extraordinary performance, he fully deserves an Oscar. 2) the music score is brilliant in the sense that it perfectly highlights and accompany the movie in its development, helping to create a continuous tension throughout. (although by itself it would be quite a weird listening experience). 3) the main weakness of this movie is (and possibly that was a precise strategy) that it it is not involving the audience feelings. Even in the most desperate moments (= the abandoning of his son / the abandoning of his father), the main character's solitude and desperation are portrayed in a very dry and cold way, the audience (at least me) is not moved. 4) The plot has major holes which remain unexplained. 5) the character of the young priest does not show signs of becoming old later in the movie, when everyone else does. 6) This movie has been compared to Kubrick's 2001 Space Odissey, or to Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West for its epic, but such comparisons are nonsense. Those two movies rank among the masterpieces. This is a good movie, time will tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Every time I closed my eyes I thought ""this film is boring. When is it going to end."" The soundtrack would wake me up. Not that it was bad it just overpowered the film.

Oily,"I'm going to argue against celebrating this movie.It isn't because it is not effective. It is. It is extremely honed so that every horse is hitched to the same plow, so that power is achieved.It isn't because we don't marvel at the actorly gymnastics of Day Lewis. Its because it doesn't matter. I will truly forget this film in the sense that none of it will change me, indirectly lead me somewhere or trick me into some discovery. In preparation for this, I saw ""Siberiade,"" another oildrilling epic where kinship is central and the drive to the earth is a retreat.(The ""blood"" in the title is associated with family, not weeping veins.)Elements of that Soviet film will stick with me forever, though the film has less explosive emotion. (It does have a far more dramatic oilrig fire  real instead of from ILM. And it has teasingly seductive songs, not the edgy, spineraising tension of here.)The one element that should have grabbed me was undeveloped. Here is a man who we see is broken. There are no events to follow. He becomes a success and remains broken. The only story for us to seek is why. We know he had peculiar feelings for his sister and left home traumatically. That he prefers isolation of the most remote kind. That given any opening for bond, for blood: HW, the discovered brother, the child Mary, he will grab it with both hands and look for disappointment.We know going in that the business of twins appeared only late, but it could have been central to this mystery of sucking and discarding both blood and oil. I really thought Anderson would exploit this ambiguity of identity. After all, he's made one and a half of the very best films which explores this. Films that are multilayered and reach out and penetrate instead of a barrelling locomotive.So.I would ask you to differentiate. First differentiate rubbernecking over a disaster from exploring and knowing a dangerous situation. Second, differentiate masterful storytelling from stories that have their own lives and catch fire in your heart.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Drama

The Misanthrope's Magnum Opus,"Even though adapted from 'Oil' by Upton Sinclair, 'There Will Be Blood' seems to have taken a deliberate step away from the class-conscious literary style of Sinclair and decided to focus more on the misanthropic inner life of the protagonist, Daniel Plainview.There's no dialogue for the first 13 minutes of this film and this will be your first indicator that you're supposed to pay more attention to what people do and not what they say. Indeed, most of the dialogue in this film involves people lying for the benefit of their own personal gain and the moments of honest dialogue typically result in hostility and violence. Plainview's entire goal is to make enough money to be able to live in comfortable solitude for the rest of his days and to accomplish this goal he engages in the very behavior that he finds so repulsive in other people.This film was both beautifully filmed and scored. The hyper-minimal orchestral arrangements were a superb choice to accompany the minimalist scenery and the minimal amount of dialogue and it's a true surprise that this original score didn't receive more critical acclaim.Sure, this film is an historical drama but what P. T. Anderson seems to be more interested in is displaying the industrialist archetype as a microcosm of what motivates human aggression and greed. Many of the reviewers here would have you think this film intends on criticizing capitalism and greed but that likely has more to do with their feelings about the source material. What P. T. Anderson presents is an amoralistic epic that has no true ""ending"" with some sort of moral or social message attached to it. He neither criticizes or praises the character of Daniel Plainview; he simply shows his true nature to us and allows us to make up our own mind.

Well-deserved oscar by the way, one of the greatest performances of all time hands-down, Daniel Day-Lewis brings a truly transformative, intense performance as Daniel Plainview, a ruthless, driven, passionate about-to-become oil tycoon. Paul Dano is amazing in this film too. Cinematography is beautiful and visually stunning, views of barren landscapes coupled with haunting and intense sound design and score.

The two leads are astonishing, and Day Lewis is exceptional, as his descent into paranoia is a performance of an archetypical character, much attempted by lesser actors, but only equaled by few (Al Pacino in Scarface is a prime example). The climax is nothing less but excellent.But on the other hand, the film could have had a better pace, as it can't be described exactly as ""gripping"".

OK but doesn't live up to the hype.,"Firstly let me say that this is a good film but despite that I was disappointed because it didn't feel like a Paul Thomas Anderson film. The only trace of the visionary director of such films as 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' comes right at the end of this movie, otherwise it plays quite straight. Don't get me wrong it has the stunning Oscar worthy performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview, I haven't seen an actor perform with such intensity for a long time and you do get the sense he lived the part. It also has the unusual but brilliant soundtrack from Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood, the story based on the Upton Sinclair novel 'Oil' is strong and the cinematography is both breathtaking and stylised. But somehow something just doesn't seem right, told over the course of twenty five or so years the only thing that seems to differentiate the decades is Daniels facial hair which starts as a Grizzly Adams and ends up Magnum P.I. and because his acting is so good the supporting cast don't really get a look in. There are shots that would make excellent stills, faces covered in oil lit only by a burning tower or Plainview sat in his chair smoking a pipe as the sun sets behind him but at over two and a half hours it dragged in places and yet it felt like, especially with the time jumps, that there was a lot more we weren't seeing. I wouldn't say I disliked this film some of it is brilliant like a drunken Plainview dribbling and bursting into a semi-controlled rage but I wouldn't go over the top like most critics have and I'm surprised it has won so many awards, thirty three and counting, because its good but its not the best film this year or the best Anderson has done. I feel strange going against the grain but I have to be objective and unfortunately this film just didn't live up to the hype.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

He is utterly magnificent. He manages to be so despicable, so horrifying, yet we still see small flickers of love coming from his character.The story follows Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis) on his journey as a young worker to the successfully terrifying wealthy oil businessman.The movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is beautifully shot, scripted, acted, edited, the soundtrack by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is utterly mesmerizing and hypnotic at times.The movie starts off relatively slow and tense but have patience with it and you will be rewarded with one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.10/10 Must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
There is a classic,"I heard a lot of praise and superlatives for There Will Be Blood with critics calling it a 'masterpiece' a 'classic' and Daniel Day Lewis' performance being hailed as one of the best performances in cinematic history. Thus my expectations were high and surprisingly they were met. There Will Be Blood astonished me right from its sublime opening. We're introduced to a fabulous shot of somewhat threatening desert mountains with The Shining-esque dissident music playing over it, immediately giving the film a sinister quality. Then we're showed the corruption of Daniel Plainview as he discovers oil by accident and elaborately draws it out, presented entirely with no dialogue, just striking direction and visuals. It's a gripping sequence and the film doesn't let up from there.Let's start with the visuals. There Will Be Blood features some of the most stunning cinematography I've ever witnessed. Sometimes it looked as though it was a stunning oil painting (pun kind of intended) with awe-inspiring shots of landscape, almost eating up our anti-hero. Daniel is often presented in raw close-ups like the characters in Les Miserables, giving him a domineering look throughout the film. Daniel is so powerful that he even controls when the film is going to end with a haunting, ""I'm finished."" Paul Thomas Anderson (who's works I've never seen before) directs with amazement. There are often very few camera shots, focusing on the intensity of our protagonist.And let's face it, There Will Be Blood succeeds so spectacularly because of it's terrifically memorable main character. At it's heart, There Will Be Blood is a character study and an intense one at that. Daniel is basically in every scene and he's a compelling character to watch. At first I felt admiration for his ambition, but then we see him turn into someone totally ruthless, filled with greed and anger. I also loved how the two contrasting characters of Daniel and the preacher interacted. The preacher thinks he's some sort of God, whereas Daniel could be alluded to Satan, however in the end the preacher and Daniel are nigh on opposite sides of the same coin.Of course, the character of Daniel Plainview is made all that more compelling thanks to the other Daniel that's playing him. Daniel Day Lewis is truly electrifying and is up there with Heath Ledger's stonking performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight. He has a wonderful charisma about him, he's a great public speaker and has great ambition. However, he turns into someone almost psychotic. I found the final moments to be the most memorable and haunting as we see Daniel in the future, clearly succeeded, but has he? It's here that Daniel Day Lewis is at his most intense and jaw-dropping, helped by the wonderful writing.The screenplay is a tour-de-force of writing. It sometimes reminded me of Quentin Tarantino as it often featured long scenes of dialogue, but written with such suspense it made it all the more gripping. All the characters are developed wonderfully, but of course it's Daniel that we're focused on most. The directing also reminded me of Stanley Kubrick at times, filled with atmosphere and dread just like the extraordinary, The Shining. One of the most intense sequences features Daniel getting baptised in Church in order to secure an oil deal. It's jaw-dropping to watch as one of my favourite critics Chris Tookey pointed out that Daniel is full of rage, yet also genuinely calling out to God. It's quite heart-breaking.After seeing There Will Be Blood I thought that it deserved a definite 9/10. However, it's been almost 48 hours after watching it and it's still swimming around in my head. I also felt utterly compelled to buy it on blu-ray (as I catched the film on the telly) which is certainly telling. Thus, I have to give it the perfect 10/10 as it just resonates in your mind. Plus it just feels right to do so at the moment. There Will Be Blood is an unforgettable film which you'll either get or you won't. I loved the atmospheric music and atmosphere which prevailed throughout the film. Daniel Day Lewis gives an astonishing performance, playing one of the best characters in the film world. It's final moments completely amazed me and immediately made me want to see it again as it's heft two and a half hour running time flew by. There Will Be Blood is a true masterpiece and an utter modern classic not to be missed!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Filmmaking at its best.,"The opening 15 minutes of this film are a thing to behold; while we have no dialogue or exposition, it is the score by Jonny Greenwood which is most striking, with a dissonant, strained note that sets the tone for the remainder of the film (it is easily one of the best film scores of recent times). Along with Robert Elswit's sumptuous cinematography it conveys a mood of impending doom, as we witness Daniel Day-Lewis, entirely alone, at work in a barren landscape. The sound design as he breaks his leg or the sharp 'chink' of the axe is a perfect example of truly cinematic sound design. And that is precisely what this film is - truly cinematic; it is a film in the purest sense: on a visual level, a aural level and a visceral level. And for that it's mesmerizing.Yet upon my initial viewing the most impactful aspect was, of course, Day-Lewis' tour-de-force performance as Daniel Plainview; channelling Orson Welles and John Huston, he is just a revelation to watch, giving a towering and unrivalled piece of acting, that is just flat-out astonishing, grasping you by the scruff of the neck, to the point where you just cannot turn away from this flawless portrayal of a hideous monster, who is one of the most horrible, rapacious and power-obsessed characters to hit cinema screens this past decade. His genius just drips off the screen, as it conveys the proper skill of an unequalled actor, of someone who firmly took this role with a fierce determination, illustrated by the fact that even before he utters a word, we have grasped the depth of this character. His detractors will say his acting here is too histrionic or even ostentatious, but Day-Lewis is aware that Plainview is supposed to be showy, being a larger-than-life businessman with a ruthless drive for power, and because of that we are given a wonderfully bravura performance.The only other considerable role in the film is that of Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. While receiving much criticism for being nowhere near Day-Lewis' level of acting, this is undeserved as he is excellent in the supporting role he's given. And while he doesn't deliver the performance of his career, his turn as Sunday is very watchable and proves to be great foil to Day-Lewis with their brilliant scenes together. The remainder of the cast work as best they can with secondary roles, in what is essentially Day-Lewis' show, when it comes to the acting.Ever since he made considerable waves with 1997's Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson was always a name to watch, with many regarding him as one of the most interesting and best filmmakers of his generation, yet when this was released, he became lauded as ""THE filmmaker of his generation"", and after my second viewing of There Will Be Blood, I came to agree with the statement wholeheartedly. Anderson is a auteur with encyclopedic knowledge of film and the technique. He gets it, basically, unlike say, Tommy Wiseau. He is a real master director, and this film exemplifies that, whether it's the breathtaking set-piece involving a derrick going up in flames, the opening or the THAT end sequence (which contains what is quite possibly the greatest piece of acting I've ever witnessed). Here we have a cinematic poet, defiantly refusing to work as part of a digitalised film business, by shooting on 35mm; which only strengthens the film's relationship with it's closest cousins: the old-school Hollywood epics.This is a stunning and sprawling work of intelligence, originality, ambition and blistering intensity; one of the few films I would call, without any hesitation, ""a masterpiece"". Easily the best film of the past decade, it's a mesmerizing, epic cinematic feat about greed, lies, religion, capitalism and insanity delivered by a magnificent director and the best actor working today.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Majestic,"An immense steamroller of a film. Much that has been said about this jaw dropping film served to put me off watching it for a long time. However that just made it better when it finally happened! Day Lewis is quite brilliant and dominates every scene he appears in, indeed he even matches the majesty of the wild scenery and industrial landscapes so startlingly depicted.The score is a very important part of this film and drives the narrative to such an extent that I felt very uneasy at times, such was it's power. Indeed unease for me is the central emotion generated by this brooding film, one which asks many uncomfortable questions from the viewer and returns far from pleasant answers about the nature of humanity and our relationship with each other and the landscape we inhabit.Religion and it's place in modern capitalist society is another central theme and again a subject from which uncomfortable conclusions are made. In all an engrossing, affecting film which shall inhabit my imagination for some time!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"One of the best, most important films of recent years","If the early Paul Thomas Anderson seemed to be channeling the young hyper-energetic Martin Scorsese, 'There Will Be Blood' - a more quiet and thoughtful, but no less amazing and cinematic work shows Anderson working in the vein of Stanley Kubrick. In place of a hyperactive camera, there is now a coldly, brilliantly observational one. In place of empathetic if damaged characters there are now people drowning in their own poison and lies.He has created a film both boldly theatrical and subtly real, both broadly political and intensely personal. Complicated and confusing emotionally and full of ideas and themes, this feels more mature and focused than Anderson's earlier work, brilliant as that all was. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing, the film looks incredible (if simply shot for an Anderson film), and I'm sure I'll only see more and more layers and meanings on repeated viewings.One of the more important films of recent years, this critique of the American dream of success, of conquest and of control is mesmerizing, and ultimately devastating.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"great acting all around, but the script sends it up in smoke","DDL is beyond excellent, no question, & all the other actors are superb, as is the cinematography, the sets, costumes, the music, everything but the plot. Lots of psychological holes, little depth, all is superficial greed & muscular domination without showing us motivation. We are ""told"" the whys, but we can't see under skins of the characters.& that's why it's such an unsatisfying film - by the time get to see the final scene & appreciate the acting (again) we feel cheated. Because we are left with a desolate, bitter drunk who's hurt himself more than anyone else. & we've heard that one before, & with more punch, panache, brevity & passion. I didn't need to sit through this long film to get that pay off - it's not enough, cuz I coulda been watching Escape from New York & drinking a beer!And what bugged me most, & leads me to believe the director had no idea how to use his considerable resources, is that Ciaran Hinds is utterly wasted - he could have added some dark depth & a show of dedication in his relationship to the man we see baldly as a liar & a scoundrel. Hinds is shot so he almost slinks off the screen; perhaps his small on-screen time is due to editing down a cumbersome film & keeping the action moving. Pity.

"It may have no point, but that doesn't make it pointless!","There Will Be Blood is a difficult movie and one that managed to do something that only few movies are able to: it crawled into my head and made me think about it. At first I was trying to understand it before I realized that there was nothing to be understood, only observed. And that is exactly why people complain about it: they say this movie is pointless because it has no deeper meaning, no message and no unexpected twist. If you judge it from that point of view, you are right. However, There Will Be Blood should not be assessed that way. Paul Thomas Anderson is not trying to shove us down some kind of message that we ought to try to understand. He's just giving us the story of a man, who finds oil and consequently becomes wealthy. We, the audience, are supposed to observe and to make up our minds about this on our own. There is nothing subjective to the movie, it simply and merely documents a part of a man's life. By not being subjective or judge-mental, it makes people feel stupid because they think that they didn't get what it was all about even though there is nothing to be understood. And in that way, people are stupid as they believe that everything has to have some kind of message or moral subtext. It forces the audience to dwell on this movie and use their brains but apparently not many people are fond of thinking. There Will Be Blood is avoiding all of that which makes it a great piece of art since it accomplishes to remain compelling through the entire run-time even though there is not much happening and therefore I think people are right if they believe that this movie will be looked upon as a classic in a couple of decades.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"DDL, DDL, DDL!","Phew!! I just finished this and I can honestly say, I have not had such chills, actual all-over goosebumps from watching any sort of film in maybe the past what, 5 years? Like the way I did here. The last 10-20 mins blows everything away- so far and so wide with its utter brilliance that it almost makes you forget everything that happened prior to it. It was.. epic. All consuming. Absolutely delicious!Being an avid watcher of films I of course knew that Daniel Day Lewis was amazing, but here, especially in the last scenes, I felt scared of the sheer genius that was unravelling before me. This man is planets apart from being just an ""actor""- for him, I don't even think that term is correct! He doesn't act, he ""is""! And I hope to God he will re-think his retirement and grace the screens again, at LEAST one more time.Also major praise to the excellent Paul Dano on holding his own in the many scenes with DDL. Had the movie hired a lesser talent for the role, the chemistry would have been completely off and the fire in the scenes wouldn't have balanced out. Here, they were great. And now I think I need to go find more PD films. He has me intrigued!!! (and trust me that doesn't happen very often!)If you are unsure about whether you want to watch this, I say DO IT.

Theatrical but nonetheless impressive,"Paul Thomas Anderson is a masterful film-maker, and 'There Will be Blood' is a gripping movie, with a superb, always surprising score. The tale of a Californian oilman (apparently with groundings in a real life story), it makes history compelling; and compelling is certainly a good word to describe Daniel Day Lewis's performance as a charismatic, charming but fundamentally ruthless figure, whose need to win ultimately drives away all those close to him (and that's the best fate that any of them get). The film isn't perfect: the dialogue never feels natural, and Lewis's acting is stage-y, though in a mostly good way: powerful and intimate, but not completely emotionally engaging; and the story of his final descent seems a little decoupled from the bulk of the movie. This doesn't mean that two hours don't pass very quickly when watching this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mesmerizing.,Brilliant story of how greed can control an individual and drive him to madness. Not only a brilliant and complete storyline but this performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is timeless and shows why they call him one of the greatest to ever do it.10/10.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Don't believe the hype. Everything you've heard is as exaggerated as the title is misleading.,"After watching this movie, I thought Mr. Lewis did a pretty good job, and the story was fairly interesting if nothing new. That's why I am once again flabbergasted at the reaction of the critics, press, and now the awards. This is as classic and timeless as was the Western, 3:10 to Yuma. Please don't miss the sarcasm. 3:10 to Yuma was a second rate western and an insult to the original. Both the story and the performances were rote and unconvincing. There Will Be Blood was a better effort. But my God people, Rendition, Atonement, The Quiet American ... THESE are movies !!!I'm afraid it's yet another Oscar year based on some criteria I haven't been let in on. No doubt Daniel Day Lewis did a good job, but great? There was hardly enough to his character to base that opinion on. The film depicted how the oil industry began and told us that yes, the same type of mentality which drew people to the'oil-rush', are basically the same as they are now. Manipulative, controlling, and capitalistic to the point at which it's their God given duty to give little or nothing while taking all if you can, cause goshdarnit, that's the daggum American way. If that sounds harsh, do a count of the Native Americans and Mexicans in this movie. They'd been 'dealt with' thoroughly enough at this point to find it best to lurk in the background of this movie. Kind of ironic, isn't it, what with the 'immigrant problem' now. You know, when a lot of the people wanting in are those the land was stolen from in the first place.Lewis played a cold, emotionless bastard, he portrayed that without equal. But that's all he did. His character was so one dimensional that it's over two and a half hours of playing the same note perfectly, while ignoring the exploration of all those other keys. There's nothing historical to be proud of here, no nugget of information previously unknown. It was simply a character study of a controlling man who's psychosis eventually pushes him past the point of no return. With a conscience as baron as the landscape, and the sole driving force to gain more, there was no opportunity provided for an actor no matter how talented to exhibit the range of emotions a supposedly Oscar worthy performance provides the evidence for.Mr Lewis is an amazing actor who's done work of that caliber before and no doubt will do so again. There Will Be Blood, a title which still has me puzzled, just wasn't it. All of this enthusiastic praise for this project does little other than further remove the public's credibility as far as the awards are concerned, or leaves them feeling stupid for being too thick to see something that was never there in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Unrelenting Tedium,"An arid, featureless, drawn-out affair - not unlike the vast expanses of the western landscape in which it is set. And that creaking sound one can hear is not just coming from the ancient oil-extracting contraptions; it emanates from the acting, the soundtrack - but especially the direction.Everything takes an inordinate amount of time. Fifteen minutes is spent on an opening which tells us little - and could perhaps have taken fifteen seconds in the hands of a more capable director.But Paul Thomas Anderson seems to be in thrall to the long, lingering shots favoured by the likes of Orson Welles and Sergio Leone. Unfortunately he appears to have little idea how to use them while maintaining dramatic tension, plot drive or the interest of the viewer. The problem is compounded by the way the choice of shot and technical execution of each scene conspire to distract, rather than illuminate.Neither a highly-mannered performance by Daniel Day Lewis nor Johnny Greenwood's portentous, and possibly misused, score aid matters. But the blame for this interminable fiasco surely lies with a visually-incontinent director in desperate need of an editor.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
There should be refunds,"This movie sucked! The acting was OK, but the plot holes and interminable length made it excruciating to sit through for more than two and a half hours.

Talented people like Anderson and Day-Lewis can do much better work. After reading multiple reviews, I went into the theater expecting an epic. What a letdown! These vanity projects almost never live up to expectations. The studio owes me a refund for that turkey. ""Blood"" goes on my list of worst movies of the year, along with ""Sweeney Todd.""

"Incredible movie, but not for all viewers","You may hear that Daniel Day Lewis is responsible for making this movie a masterpiece. For the most part, that is true. His acting is some of the most phenomenal work I have seen. Considering his regular accent, mannerisms, and appearance, he really transformed himself into the character of Plainview.That is not to say Paul Dano wasn't wonderful. His quirky character sometimes explodes with shocking malevolence just as Plainview does and works fantastically as an antagonist.The scores are astonishingly eerie. From the moment the film begins, you see a lot of build- up that is supported by eccentric music.The only problem this movie faces is that it does not appeal to all audiences. Some may see the movie as slow and boring because the length of some scenes matches the pace of life back in the early 1900s: much slower than today. Long silences and quiet dialogue don't usually go well with some viewers. If you are not the type to watch a long movie that takes a while to get into, I don't recommend There Will Be Blood for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"One of the few films that truly transports you back in time, spearheaded by a tidal force DDL performance.","The opening scene sets the stall for this epic movie. Steady unease, immaculate score, a sense of dangerous potential and admiration for the sheer determination (and dormant insanity) of our lead, Daniel Plainview. This film is a time capsule, it's as if the director and production design opened a portal back to late 19th to early 20th Century America and placed you at the front row. You can almost reach out and touch the world you are watching, and this movie can very easily pull you into its depths. I first saw this film a good few years about it and forgot a lot of its elements, not to say that they were forgettable, but there are so many moments, characters and interactions that it was a joy reliving them. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is legendary, he embodies so many different traits that his character feels so real. His development is astounding and this towering performance is made more impressive by the strong performances of his co-stars. This is one of those must see films. Not everyone will love it, it's dark and unhinged at times, and it could be argued that the actual story doesn't really live up to much. But I see this as a characters story, rather than a story that the characters live through.

Nearly a Perfect Movie,"There Will Be Blood is, as the headline suggests, just about a perfect movie. The Coen Brothers magnum opus of No Country for Old Men came out the same year, and they didn't yet have any Oscar's after several superb films. If it were not for that, TWBB would've easily just swept through the Oscar's. It still snagged some. But there is no weak spot of any kind in this masterpiece. The cinematography alone could drop your jaw. In a nutshell, it's the story of a diabolically evil oil man at the turn of the twentieth century, his assent to wealth and power, and how those things led to nothing more than moral decay and isolation and an unshakable bitterness and resentment at ANY successes of others.. Built a bit from the bones of Charles Foster Kane(William Randolph Hearst) in Citizen Kane. An absolute masterpiece of a film that I cannot possibly recommend any higher.

Might be the best movie I have ever seen !,Daniel Plainview (Daniel-day Lewis) is a shrewd business man who's searching for Oil! So he can become rich . He works very hard and finally gets a tip to get what he wants. But he is singly focused on the pursuit of the riches that he forgets everything else in the process. Finally he does achieve what he sets out to do but at what cost? And does this really fulfill him ?There are so many sequences in this film that are moving and unexpected and impactful . I have rarely seen so many moving sequences in one film. It becomes almost too much to bear at one point.The performances by supporting characters is also exceptional. Specially Paul Dano (who plays a church father) and H. W(child of Daniel Plainview). Paul Dano gives strong performances and there are certain similarities in the self-interest between his character and protagonists. But somehow he appears to come out a hypocrite.Technically there is no issue in the film.

But they did everything they could to avoid even that nuance.After an hour I was checking my watch and asking when something was going to happen.

Blood is thicker than water but oil's thicker than both!,"Many words can describe Paul Thomas Anderson's new American epic, Hollywood's new master has raised the bar from his early days of Boogie Nights and Magnolia considerably. Powerful is one word. Brutal is another. But one word that is never far from my mind is Magnificent. 'There will be blood' is a tale of greed and tragedy as Daniel Day Lewis delivers alter ego Daniel Plainview, a sneering up and coming oil baron in ruthless pursuit of valuable land to increase his wealth and dominance in early 1900's America. Little is known of Plainview's past, and domination not only of the oil world, but of his own realm is the only certantity as we see a man burning with hatred and equally desire manoeuvre his way to oil immortality. Utterly convincing acting, screenplay and cinematography, Anderson has hit the film making jackpot with this one, a movie so captivating and enthralling I consider it almost perfect. I would have to say its PTA'S most complete, mature and acclaimed film, one he would find almost impossible to top with future works.

Fabulous Odyssey of Human Civilisation,"There will be blood is a Path breaking Artistic Cinema of an Ambiguous & Epic Tale, so uniquely different that it will influence filmmakers for generations. Seemed to have written with a definitive pattern, Paul Thomas Anderson successfully exemplifies the most top-notch character study ever written in the history of cinema.The Post TWBB viewing experience has lead to Innumerable conceptions & misconceptions amongst different viewers. This is because, this movie neither allow us to get linked with the plot which lays underneath nor letting us into the character's shoes. So the after effect is nothing but confusion about various events of the plot lying on its surface and struggle to understand the meaning of those events.But once you are in it, the blood will flow through your veins with a force so stout, that the Movie will haunt you. The more you watch again, the more you shall extract and gradually break through its enigma.The significance of this Movie's greatness is that it's been gifted with a screenplay deliberately planted with loose ends and missing links, but filled with allusions.At first place, TWBB is a homage paid to Stanley Kubrick Movies and many other classics. In other way, the entire movie can be said as an elaborated portray of the first section of 2001: A Space Odyssey's ""The Dawn of Man"" Again here, ""The Dawn of Man"" depicts the invention of 'Tool' (which lead to a perpetual progress of mankind) and domination of the Inventor in the fight of conflicts for drinking water of the land. TWBB too, illustrates the discovery of 'Oil' by the protagonist and his conquest over the conflicts with various other opportunists.The plot of the movie remains less significant to what is shown in the Movie. The crux lies in what is not shown in the Movie.Set at the Turn of the 20th Century, The Lead Character of the Movie is Daniel Plainview, a ruthless & highly ambitious opportunists who struggles his way up to become an Oil Tycoon; a person for whom the only route for salvation is accumulation of unlimited wealth. On surface, we only see him as a greedy businessman, but as soon as we try to think what makes him that, we are on a journey of understanding this vibrant personality - The terrible past or childhood days of Daniel Plainview, not shown or narrated in the Movie, which molded the mind of this man. And then you have all answers, for why Plainview never hits his son, why he hates common people, why he never worship god.The Movie depicts the Two Primary Driving Forces of Human Civilization which is Capitalism & Religion, in its early stage. The Petroleum Boom & Religious Propaganda intensifies as all human sentiments of greed, social recognition, religious fanaticism, love, family, ambition & survival unravel amongst the various characters setting up an odyssey of conflicts of opportunists for who shall defy or abide whom.Leaving the Plot aside, There will be blood has one of the greatest one man towering performance in the history of cinema. Daniel Day Lewis accurately depicts the central character of Daniel Plainview immortalizing that character.""I can't keep doing this on my own with these  People"" - The dialog will remain immortal.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film reminding of Citizen Kane,"""There will be blood"" is about the rise of the oil industrie in America (like ""Giant"" (1956, George Stevens)) and about the rise and fall of a tycoon (like ""Citizen Kane"" (1941, Orosen Welles)). So the film can be compared with not the least of films in film history. Nevertheless it withstands this comparison rather well.Central to the film is the conflict between the tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) and the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). This is however not a conflict of principles. Eli Sunday is also interested in money and for Daniel Plainview oil is a holy substance. This is illustrated by the way he baptizes his stepson H.W. with oil. The conflict is rather a powerstruggle in the course of which the two combatants mutually humiliate each other.H.W. is the stepson of Daniel Plainview. They have a rather curious relationship. For Daniel his stepson is a way te present himself as a family man (a necessary condition to do business in this very religious part of America), something he definitely is not. H.W. made me think of Oskar Matzerath from ""Die blechtrommel"" (1979, Volker Schlöndorf), although he does grow up. As a grown up he disappears however from the scene.Both Daniel and Eli have ""the gift of speech"", and they use it to cheat on the farmers of the neigborhood. The voice of Daniel is so confidence inspiring that it can only belong to a crook. The film starts with a long silent opening, after which there is a speech of Daniel trying to buy the land of farmers in order to drill for oil.The cinematography is very beautiful, in particular in the scenes of wide landscapes. Landscapes who will be damaged forever by the activities of Daniel Plainview. Coincidentally the Coen brothers filmed in the same part of Texas as Paul Thomas Anderson for ""No country for old men"", a film from the same year (2007).The score sounds very much like a Philip Glass score, but is actually by Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead. There are dissonants in the music by uncomfortable scenes in which the hard selfishness of Daniel Plainview is revealed.In ""Citizen Kane"" there is some sort of redemption at the end. In ""There will be blood"" there is only madness.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The cinematography is lush, the acting deep and the overall feel of the film majestic. But it is ultimately unsatisfying. The movie traces the life of a misanthropic loner who turns the American dream into a nightmare. Day-Lewis refers to himself as an oil man, and that's what he is. He lets nothing get in the way of getting what he wants, though we're never really sure what that is. Money isn't really the goal, as he turned down a deal offered by Standard Oil that would have made him a multi-millionaire. ""What would I do?"" he asks as he turns down the deal. No doubt, Day-Lewis is a masterful actor, adept at turning in performances of larger-than-life characters. I was disappointed, however, in the Eli Sunday character, as played by Paul Dano, who was so good in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It's unfortunate that a movie often praised as being iconoclastic reverts to the tired stereotype of the hypocritical, self-aggrandizing preacher. And, frankly, Dano's performance is somewhat lacking in nuance. The movie meanders over 2 1/2 hours before crashing to a jarring end. ""I am finished,"" Day-Lewis's character pronounces. He should have said that about an hour earlier.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
If your conscience has been seared into a fried clove of crispy black garlic... Have we got a film for you!,"So you want to go see a movie. You check the IMDb and see this film is getting an 8.9 rating (#16 on the top 250). It stars Daniel Day Lewis, he's a great actor. The TV ads look smart, and what's that ""milkshake"" line about anyway? Off you go. Three and a half hours later you return home and go on the IMDb and vote it a 10 out of 10. Why? Because you are a secret mind-controlled drone of the company that made this film and you always do what you are told. That is the only plausible explanation I can come up with for the extraordinarily high ratings There Will Be Blood is receiving. That or your moral compass only points south.This film is nothing more than a magnificently crafted pile of poop and frankly, I find its undeserving numbers highly suspect. There are plenty of examples where most every critic gets it ""wrong"" on a popular film, so no need to re-trod that ground (watch The Aristocrats if you don't believe me, I dare you). But a quick perusal of the IMDb comments index for this film seems to tell a different story than a movie voted higher than #18 Raiders of the Lost Ark or #36 Apocalypse Now. Searching in chronological order, about half the comments say they hate this film. Another quarter didn't think it was as good as everyone said, and only about a quarter praise the film. With that track record, this film should score somewhere in the 5 to 7 range. We should all hope that the studios have figured out a way to pump up IMDb scores. Otherwise, we live in a world where pointless violence and hypocrisy are celebrated as the ideal.No doubt, this film has its merits. Daniel Day Lewis gives an award winning performance. I love it when an actor takes chances and I think it works here, many disagree. The film making is top notch, all the acting too. Most everything from cinematography to wardrobe is as good as it gets. Were this film to have a point, it all would have worked together for a powerful addition to the American film atheneum. As it is, it does nothing more than underscore tired stereotypes and leave its audience wondering why so much effort would be put into such depraved proclamations. Perhaps worse, it glorifies the most evil of human intentions.Can we agree that more is required for a great film then just good film-making? Otherwise, Gigli deserved better treatment. Here, Daniel Day Lewis plays an oil man in the morally corrupt laissez-faire American big business culture (seen it) fighting with a morally corrupt Christian minister (seen it) in a society full of have-nots (seen it) controlled by gilded evil white men (that's new) and everything, eventually, adds up to nothing but gruesome, vivid murders and pointless hatred. Roll credits.I found the portrayal of the young minister to be particularly vapid. Pastor of ""The Church of the Third Revelation""  please. Even the church name is painfully hack. Look, I can handle stock stereotypes, but can anyone in the film industry portray a Christian leader as anything more than a sad, money grubbing miscreant? And how many times are we going to need to see this before it gets tired? Not that any other religion or group could have taken its place. I wonder what the reaction to this film would have been had the Snidely Whiplash minister been portrayed as a Rabbi, and all the Jews in his congregation nothing more than gullible or emotionally weak? Never mind the cartoonish unfairness of it all, don't you think it makes for uninteresting character development? Whatever.All the ""smart"" people will go away from this film figuring out that the world is a hopeless dog eat dog jungle. The rest of us will go home and do all the work that holds society together and hope for some other film to take our minds off things like this. 1 out of 10 for a pointless and grotesque story.",,Anonymous,Drama
10/10,My favourite Western.I rewatch this film often for the Daniel Plainview baptism scene alone.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the greatest performances of all time,"Daniel Day Lewis cannot be denied. He goes beyond what most actors are even capable of doing. This truly is his masterstroke, and to give the academy award to another actor would be an insult to the institution of acting. What Day Lewis achieves with this performance embodies the very definition of acting, and it will be remembered as one of the most powerful and most influential performances in history.The film itself is terrifying, and intensified only by Johnny Greenwood’s amazing musical score. It is a history piece, and in a very sadistic way it is a comedy. But above all it is a horror film about the atrocities of a quintessential anti-hero, and one that the audience is forced to reconcile with. But there is a much deeper message, and at its core is the confrontation between Plainview and Eli Sunday. Sunday, pious and very naive, is the exact opposite of Plainview, and by pitting these characters together we see manifested before our eyes one of the most fundamental dilemmas of human nature. The great mistake would be to assume this film is anti-religion, or anti-capitalist for that matter. Anderson simply picked the worst parts from either side and set them loose on each other. The result is a brutal and universal battle that you cannot turn away from.Perhaps the only element of the film which is less than perfect is the span of time that it attempts to cover. There is a scene that requires a massive leap in time in which Plainview's son, now grown up and married, confronts his father. Up until that point, the film has risen to a climax so expertly only to be suddenly jarred by a very large leap ahead (10 years or so) in order to fit in this subplot. The scene has no cathartic element for Plainview, who remains as unwavering as ever, and seems superfluous in the grand scheme of things, which is unfortunate because it is a powerful scene and very well acted. It is clear from start to finish that the plot of the film is not about Plainview verses himself as much as it is Plainview verses Sunday, and this scene only serves to draw attention away from the major conflict, hardly worth interrupting the atmosphere that the film has already built up.But then again, there would have been no bowling for priests...",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Masterpiece,One of the most beautiful movie that i've seen in my life. A masterpiece,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Daniel Day-Lewis shines in Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece 'There Will Be Blood',"""There Will Be Blood (2007)"" is a cinematic masterpiece that tells a powerful story of greed and ambition. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and starring Daniel Day-Lewis, the film is a tour de force of acting, cinematography, and storytelling. The film is set in the early 20th century and follows the rise of a ruthless oil baron named Daniel Plainview, who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.One of the film's greatest strengths is the incredible performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, who fully immerses himself in the character of Daniel Plainview. Day-Lewis's portrayal of the character is both terrifying and captivating, as he brings a raw intensity to every scene he is in. The film is also visually stunning, with stunning cinematography and a haunting score that perfectly captures the mood of the story.In addition to its technical achievements, ""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterclass in storytelling. The film's plot is complex and multi-layered, with themes of power, greed, and family dynamics woven throughout. The script is brilliantly written, with every line of dialogue adding to the tension and drama of the story.Overall, ""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterpiece of modern cinema that is not to be missed. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, and is a testament to the power of great storytelling and masterful filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Vengeance,"""There Will Be Blood"" is an instant classic, very much in the mold in of ""Citizen Kane,"" but much more effective. This is one of, writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson' finest achievements and is certainly in the discussion for his best work along with ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" P.T. Anderson is quickly rising as this generation's best director and maybe the greatest visionary film has ever seen. On a technical level, ""There Will Be Blood,"" is near perfection and may end up near the top of AFI' 100 greatest films list in another 20 years or so. The Cinematography is gorgeous. The score is incredible- sometimes a little overused. The acting is great, lead by one of the best of year- see Viggo Mortensen of ""Eastern Promises"" if you want to see a performance that rivals one of this magnitude. Paul Dano was, however, over the top and just couldn't match up with Lewis as he was outclassed and out performed, but some of the smaller roles were played with incredible realism and felt completely genuine. The direction is flawless. The art direction will put you back in the late 1800s on through the late 1920s. The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis will the thing that's remembered for years to come as he now owns title to two of the greatest acting performances of the 21st century (""Gangs of New York""). Like, ""Gangs,"" ""There Will Be Blood"" is powered by Lewis as it's lead by Daniel Plainview, played magnificently by one of the best actors cinema has ever seen as he carries this ambitious film. Without this incredible performance to lean on ""There Will Be Blood"" just can't hold up to what it sets out to do. As we watch the development of Daniel Plainview and his hatred culminate we quickly realize just how deadly Plainview becomes. Where there's oil there's greed, and where there's greed there's disputes, and where there's disputes there's blood, and there will be blood. The greed in this film is saturated through the characters with one after another looking for money. Oil is the source of money and no one can get at it except for Daniel, so his greed is going to come into conflict with the spectators greed, who all wants a piece of the proverbial pie.The best scene in the film is the big gusher scene and it's also the turning point in the film. The cinematography in this five minute scene alone is worth a nomination and the score will sing your ears as the fire will sing your eyes. After years of drilling for oil, Plainview becomes powerful, but not as powerful as he will or dreams of becoming. The big gusher represents Plainview's boiling greed and once the ocean of boiling oil erupts, Plainview, is overcome with the prospect of making so much money that he could move away from everyone and live in a mansion, away from ""these people."" He hates most people and he doesn't see anything worth liking when he looks at people. Everyone that crosses his path is just another spectator getting in the way and taking the money that he has rights to. He does all the work- the drilling, he does all the finding, and he leases all the land so he should get all the money. This is how this works, you see. When his adopted son H.W. goes deaf from the blast of the big gusher, Daniel, no longer knows of any way to talk to him. When his partner asks him, ""How's H.W."" as Daniel is mesmerized by the fire and the ocean of oil under his feet and the kind of money he can make- the real money- he uncaringly says he's ""not good."" Then, just like that, H.W. becomes a burden instead of cute face to help him buy land. H.W. is a tool in Daniel's eyes. Everyone is a tool. Just like a pickaxe or a drill, people are tools, and Daniel uses those tools to get what he wants, but when they start acting like people instead of tools is when we have big problems. H.W. just gets in the way like everyone else and the love and bond of a father and son seem to take a back seat to greed and competition.Daniel sends H.W. off to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. While he's away his brother Henry is the next in line of spectators getting in the way. And Eli Sunday as well, the evangelical preacher for the Church of The Third Revelation. Paul Dano plays Eli, and his twin brother Paul Sunday, and get's into dirty business to provide for his church so he can preach to a bigger congregation. Sunday becomes immersed in his own greed and eventually finds himself corrupt and looking for help from his ""brother Daniel"" who doesn't exactly see himself as his brother. Greed and power sit atop the focal points of the film in regards to self examination. Sometimes you have to take a look at the ugly side of yourself. Some may question their actions as they try to change and some continue those actions without remorse. Daniel's plunge into madness is dark and prolonged and gradually alcohol and hate become the driving force in his life. As Daniel plunges into the never ending abyss we see that his hate knows no boundaries and he will hate anyone and turn on everyone. You'll come away questioning if he loved or cared for anyone. As Daniel comes to a point in his life where he wants to be: Alone and on top with his rivals drowning in a pool of their own blood. Whether he eats someone or isolates himself from people, he succeeds in whatever he does.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Left feeling confused,"I felt stupid after watching the movie, as if I missed what everyone else saw in this film.
Daniel Day-Lewis was phenomenal-in fact all of the cast was superb.
I just didn't understand the motivation for Plainview to be so horrid. I guess I was let down because it's hard for us as humans to admit that the bad guy does often win.
Then, again, Eli wasn't such a good guy.
I just was confused by what I was supposed to feel at the end. When the movie ended after the bowling alley scene, I literally said ""wtf?"" 2 1/2 hours and that's how it ends?
I love period pieces though, and I adored the grit and grime, but I always need the question ""why"" answered for me.
The music score was incredible. It had me in the edge, and maybe if I had paid attention to it more I would've understood what I was supposed to take away from the whole project.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Shot at Greatness!,"This movie is absolute masterpiece in terms of story, direction, screenplay, cinematography, background music and acting. Daniel Day Lewis has yet again delivered a packed powerhouse performance. Firstly, Anderson has made a gem of a movie. Anderson's story telling style is quite unique; he doesn't rely completely on dialogs but rather on camera movements capturing the characters emotions and expressions. This style of story telling might make one bore with the movie but believe me not his movie. He knows his trade very well. I have only seen his other movie 'Magnolia' which I liked too but in this movie he excels not just himself but many other filmmakers of this generation too. He definitely seems a director to rely on delivering master pieces. Now, coming to the main man movie belongs too, i.e., Daniel Day Lewis, is undoubtedly the most talented actors of our generations and this movie only strengthen his place further among one of the greatest actors of all time. He portrayed ""Plainview"" so perfectly that I cannot even begin to imagine some other actor playing this role the way he did. Watch the intensity with which he delivers his dialogs, intensity when he is digging for oil, when he is protecting his kid and almost every frame he is in is a shot of greatness, how competitive he is, how chilling he is. Other actors too are good, especially Lewis Kid (as a child), Elli the preacher. I don't want to reveal anything here why Lewis is superb here; why direction is superb here, as to mention those I need to describe some specific scenes and moments in the movie that with the help of the director, and Lewis who takes them to the extreme height of perfection and superiority and which might not give you a full satisfaction of seeing those for the first time in the movie and I don't want to take any such moments away from you. So it would be in your best interest that you watch the movie and decide yourself why these gentlemen's were so amazing in TWBB and why the movie is a masterpiece. Just Watch it.!!!!!

Powerful anti-success story,"Adding my praise to director Anderson and especially thespians Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano, I have a couple of reactions to There Will Be Blood that hopefully are not repetitive or redundant.First of all, growing up and addicted to the TV movie packages, my favorite film genre was a subset of the popular Warner Bros. 1930s movies. Edward G. Robinson starred in many vehicles which had an almost rubber-stamped, surefire format: he was a self-made man who rose to the top in the first few reels, only to reveal numerous tragic flaws that brought him down down down to oblivion by the fadeout. Never a happy ending, but always extremely satisfying to watch his familiar arc -enjoy his heady success, and learn (esp. for a youngster like me) from his tremendous errors. Everybody knows Little Caesar, but more typical for E.G. Robinson were the films Silver Dollar (he gets ruined by the Gold Standard); I Loved a Woman (E.G. as unscrupulous Meat Packing magnate); Dark Hazard (about dog racing); and others.There Will Be Blood is the first film I've seen in a long time that brings back this format, though of course much harder edged than in the 1930s. Daniel Day Lewis is quite a different actor than Robinson, but both faultlessly engender sympathy for their characters, even when the fictional guys are doing reprehensible things.The other issue came up this weekend when I mentioned There Will Be Blood to a friend who said she hadn't seen it because she heard it contained ""gratuitous violence"". I immediately looked it up and the dictionary defines gratuitous as ""unwarranted"". The debate over gratuitous violence is certain to continue for a long time, but I don't believe the violence is unwarranted in There Will Be Blood. And recall the previous epicenter of this debate, Sam Peckinpah, who in his ongoing opposition to the Vietnam war was outspoken in his wish to ""rub our noses in it"" when he staged the memorably violent scenes in his films of that period, notably Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch. The central theme of Straw Dogs was the Territorial Imperative, a theme very well handled by Anderson in There Will Be Blood.",,Anonymous,Drama
"So, ladies and gentlemen... if I say I'm an oil man you will agree.","""There Will Be Blood"" is nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and let me tell you, it's deserving of every one of them. The composition of directing, cinematography, musical score, and the acting of Daniel Day-Lewis make this an experience; one of the most riveting in cinematic history. You will likely be shocked, or befuddled, when it's all said and done.Daniel Plainview is a character of complexity. His true nature is a mystery, especially early in the film, and you never quite know what goes through his mind. Daniel Day-Lewis gets this part, and his portrayal of Plainview is masterfully dark and engrossing. He becomes a figure of cruelty, and coldly dispenses of people when they no longer suit him. Yet ironically, his sanity seems to be held intact solely by the singular relationships he does have. Plainview maintains a ""business partner"" because he claims it helps legitimize him to the community. In reality, his motives are selfish. He needs an ear to bend with the hatreds that swell in him, someone to shoulder the weight of his personal demons. He is a classic people user, and when there are no more left to suck from, he devolves into a loathsome recluse. There is no need to hold an award ceremony this year, at least, not for Best Actor. Daniel Day-Lewis will win the Oscar without so much as a contest.There is an unnerving atmosphere that pervades this film, and to credit the vision of Paul Thomas Anderson, it leaves you with a constant feeling that something bad is going to happen. So much of this feeling is stirred by the incredibly alarming music. It is chaotic, and at times even feels out of sync or inappropriate for the moment. This serves a purpose, however. Every musical sequence was unique, and many were employed to clue the viewer into something beneath the surface. I can't say enough how integral the score was in maintaining the unsettling mood of this picture.The cinematography was beautiful. I remember one part specifically when Daniel and H.W. were driving through town in their Model T. I love this scene, and it was so well executed I almost could believe it was actually shot in 1908. Another striking sequence that really stands out was when Daniel carried H.W. from the burning oil well. The way the camera follows him in one uninterrupted shot, the music plucking away violently. There is a sense of something amiss, and the suspense of the moment is fully realized through its impeccable design.Day-Lewis gives a mastered performance (the character Daniel Plainview rivals even Amon Goeth of ""Schindler's List"" in the breadth of his villainy), and Thomas Anderson delivers what will stand as one of the great films of the 2000's.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
There will be Yawns,"Hello Moviegoers, Thankfully in There Will Be Blood, there is not that much blood, I'm not sure how much movie there is though either.Okay the acting was incredible. Daniel Day Lewis, as always, is pitch perfect and IN-TENSE. Paul Dano was impressive and Ciaran Hinds was underemployed considering what a fine actor he is.But the movie was, well ponderous and obvious. The music was portentious and overwrought and at times downright weirdly inappropriate.Ya' know they set this up as some kind of epic story of greed in the robber baron era, but mostly the characters are just pathetic. And where were the women, no where in this movie.Well like I said the acting was outstanding, Daniel Day Lewis tears up the screen, but there wasn't enough story to keep my interest and the only character you can care about, the boy, gets short shrift.

DDL's performance is so good that it commands your attention and conceals the movie's great weakness. You're so mesmerised by him that it's easy to overlook the fact that the storyline is uninteresting. In fact, there isn't a storyline as such. It's just a chronological sequence of events showing how this ""oil man"" makes his fortune and uses people along the way.

Overrated but very interesting nonetheless,"I had so been looking forward to this movie, for so long, and had to bide my time to see it.However, on a wet Monday afternoon in Glasgow my chance finally arrived.PT Anderson is right up there among my favourite directors of all time with Magnolia in my top 5 films, ever! News of Daniel Day Lewis' performance and his (as it turns out justified) favouritism for the Best Actor Oscar only added to my anticipation.The film's position as No. 23 EVER on IMDb's review list (my filmic bible) meant it had to be a total classic.So I'm afraid I have to beg to differ.Whilst much of it amazes there is just too much indulgence in this movie. The first 20 minutes when, famously, not a word is uttered feels to me like film w***. It is overlong as well and I felt the cinematography failed to reach the top drawer; it's simply too dark in places.The theme of greed is interesting but it feels a bit derivative of Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand - the famous book of the 50's - although I gather the inspiration was drawn from a little known novel called 'Oil'. And there are rather too many moments where Daniel Plainview played, mostly magnificently, by Daniel Day Lewis, is symbolised as the Devil incarnate sheathed in shards of flame and plumes of smoke. OK PT, we get it The context in which this greed is acted out is Oil Boom America (the first third of the last century). It centres around an oil prospector's run ins with an unnamed fundamentalist Christian outback church.The parallels between Bush and Iraq are not difficult to see.Whilst the congregation may be innocent worshippers, the relationship between the young pastor (Dano) and Plainview, is the real axis of the movie and it meets with mixed results. Partly because Dano's performance is not 100% convincing. Close, but no cigar.Indeed the denouement was, I thought, verging on the absurd.Daniel Day Lewis' descent into madness is well observed and he manages to avoid the excesses of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. However, having seen most of the big movies of the year his was probably the best male lead performance - although I felt Ellen Page in Juno and Javier Bardem in A Country For Old Men were better, purer, more believable constructs.Which brings me to my final point. The Coen's movie beats it hand down on every level except for the score, which is stunning.Jonny Greenwood was responsible.Verdict? 7/10.

A Rather Excruciating Two And A Half Hours,"I think the last significant movie I saw that featured Daniel Day-Lewis in a significant role was ""Gangs of New York."" I was reminded of that movie somewhat. My reaction to ""Gangs"" was that it was dreadfully dull, although it did have a smattering of action here and there and at least I could see by the end that there was a point to the whole thing. Its high rating notwithstanding, I have to pin ""There Will Be Blood"" with the same dreadfully dull tag. The difference between this and ""Gangs"" is that there was precious little action to be found here, long stretches of nothingness (about ten minutes passes by at the start of the movie with no dialogue at all) and in the end I really couldn't see what the point of this was. Some parts of this movie are well done. The portrayal of the Old West was totally believable, the look at early oil drilling was interesting, the performances from Day-Lewis as silver miner turned oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday were good and the final confrontation between Plainview and his ""son"" (Russell Harvard) was very emotional. Overall, though, to me the story didn't seem to flow all that well. It just completely failed to capture my attention, and trying to keep focused on a movie that is just plain uninteresting for two and a half hours is excruciating. For whatever reason I also found the musical score by Jonny Greenwood to be at times inappropriate in that it often just didn't seem to fit the mood of what I was seeing on the screen. Clearly I'm in the minority on this, but I just didn't find this to be a good movie at all, and I frankly can't go any higher than a 2/10 for it.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
PTA homages Malick and redefines the epic genre (again),"Unlike many people are saying, ""There Will Be Blood"" is not Paul Thomas Anderson's first epic. If ""Sydney/Hard Eight"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" were minimalist pearls, ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" were superb mosaics of epic proportions - PTA himself defined ""Magnolia"" (by the way, my favourite film ever) 'an epic about common dramas'. ""There Will Be Blood"", on the other hand, is an epic at the core of the term, but with PTA's unique style in lieu of old-fashioned clichés, powered with a tour-de-force performance by Daniel Day-Lewis (the best of his career and, since we're speaking of DDL, that's quite a feat). His extraordinary story of greed, family bonds, and vengeance (based upon Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"") could be defined as a bravura meeting between Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" and Malick's ""Days of Heaven"", mixed with the grandeur of John Huston (""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"") and George Stevens (""Giant""). Alongside the Coens' ""No Country for Old Men"", this is the best film of 2007 (it's one of the few times, perhaps the only, when my two favourite films of a certain year are actually the favourites to win the Best Picture Oscar, so I will be glad if either of them gets the top prize next Sunday), a treasure that'll amaze audiences for years to come. Jonny Greenwood's musical score and Lewis' ""I'm finished"" won't leave your mind so soon. 10/10.",,Anonymous,Drama
Complex Character Creation Raises Bar For Others,"Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal in his portrayal as an early oil baron or should I say the earliest oil baron. In fact the synopsis of the movie is really that simple: the early life of an oil baron. Just when I have used the word simple I have to back up. The movie and certainly Daniel Day Lewis' performance is anything but simple. Lewis creates a complex and difficult character in the title role. Just when you think you have a handle on both the story or this character another twist appears that makes this movie juicier and more interesting.The movie was two Oscars in 2008 for cinematography and for Daniel Day Lewis for Best Actor. Lewis does his best to not only act, but to physically channel his character. He does a masterful job that continues to set the bar ever higher for actors of his generation. It was nominated for a total of 8 making it one of the top films of 2007.Overall it is difficult to classify this film as it has so many wonderful qualities. It is a terrifying biographical tragedy. The timing of the movie's release hits hard with today's newspaper headlines. The audience is simply slapped in the face with our country's dependency on oil and how oil barons in this era set a tone for the next 100 years. At times I found this movie chilling, masterful and compelling. Surprisingly however, I was never sympathetic to Lewis' character which I'm sure was very challenging for him to create. This is a must see film from 2007 and one is hard pressed to find many flaws, a credit to talented director Paul Thomas Anderson. ****/*****, a standard held for the higher films of the day.The posters for this movie are endless.

Excellent Cinematography Work,"Although I found ""There will be Blood"" to be excellent in all aspects. What intrigued me the most was the cinematography of the movie. There were some scenes of which I was completely blown away. In particular the scene when the oil well catches fire against the backdrop of a dark blue sky. The mixture of the smoke, fire, and the oil painted sky in the backdrop was truly remarkable. In addition, the scene when Daniel is on the train with his son had a very old fashioned feel to it, reminiscent of the black and white picture days.One piece of the movie that will no doubt go over looked pertains to Daniels relationship with his son once he had become deaf. Clearly a difficult situation to deal with for anyone, especially at this juncture in time when not much had been known about this sort of problem. I felt that enough had been done to show Daniels sympathy for his child without making him seem colder then he was. Anymore of this would have been simply harping on something very few of us can relate to.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Horrifying, hilarious, brutal and beautiful- a masterpiece.","There Will Be Blood is an absurdist black comedy from Hell. It's a deranged, unhinged masterpiece the likes of which we've never, ever witnessed before. Forget all the Kubrick comparisons- the only thing Kubrickian is the score, and even that is only because of the obvious Penderecki comparisons. Kubrick never got this close, this dirty. Paul Thomas Anderson does not separate himself from these characters; he became these characters in writing it, namely Daniel Plainview, portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis in what has very quickly become my favorite screen performance of all time. This is Robert De Niro in Raging Bull quality we're talking about, and personally, I think he one ups De Niro with this film. I know, I know, heresy...but that's how much I responded to his performance. It seems that Anderson somehow found a ""brother...from another mother.."" in DDL, judging by recent appearances where they all but cuddle in front of the interviewer, and together they have crafted one of the most indelible screen characters of recent years. Daniel Plainview is a monster, no buts about it, but he's a recognizable monster. He's not some abstraction. In Plainview, we can see ourselves, and it frightens us, and that's part of this films brilliance. Plainview acts out upon feelings that we don't even like to admit that we are capable of. He's malicious and deviant, and yet charming and likable. It's scary stuff, and DDL's performance will be studied for years to come for the sheer dedication he gives to the characterization. Forgive me if my thoughts seem rambling, I've seen the film three times now and I'm still trying to process it. It's such an experience. I can't even begin to go on about Paul Dano as the equally despicable Eli Sunday. I'd love to talk about the scenes that play out like high comedy ran through oil and grit. There's a baptism scene that could have come out of a brilliant comedy, and many scenes go into bizarre, unexpected territory that you wouldn't see coming in a million years (an uncomfortably funny encounter in a restaurant comes to mind) The film is at moments heart-wrenching, horrifying, hilarious, brutal, poetic, over the top and brilliantly mad. PTA isn't afraid to let the audience decide how to feel; he's not going to hold your hand, and I think that's the problem a lot of people have with the ending. It's definitely the litmus test for the film- if you dislike the ending, then you obviously haven't been paying attention to the character of Daniel Plainview. If you enjoy the ending, then clearly you've followed the entire ride. My advice to people that hate the ending is the same thing I'd say to the people who hate No Country for Old Men's ending- watch it again, think about the ending throughout the entire film. It's the ONLY way the film can end. I think Roger Ebert put it best in his review ""Only madness can supply a termination for this story."" So, with that, I end my random, barely coherent thoughts on the one true masterpiece of 2007, and really of the last decade. It's already in my top 5 EVER, and you should take my word seriously...because I'm a genius. This is most DEFINITELY not a film for everyone- most I've talked to have either loved it or despised it with a fiery passion equally, and it's most certainly a one of a kind experience, but if you are willing, then you most certainly won't be disappointed. I'm finished.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Daniel Day-Lewis - A Masterclass Actor!,"Daniel Day-Lewis is a Masterclass Actor. In my opinion, He's The Greatest Actor Since Marlon Brando. Brando defined ""ACTING"", while Day-lewis, changed the way to look at ""ACTING"".In 'There Will be Blood', A Performance that Won Him An Oscar, Day-Lewis delivers an astoundingly heartbreaking performance, that gives a new way to look at ""ACTING"" altogether. As Daniel Plainview, a mineral prospector, Day-Lewis does a Tour-De-Force, that left me mesmerized. He not only becomes Daniel Painview, he gives him a life to live. He is, without a doubt, the Face of Cinema. A special mention for Paul Dano. He's incredible and shares the best scenes with the thespian.'There Will Be Blood' Synopsis: A story about family, greed, religion, and oil, centered around a turn-of-the-century prospector in the early days of the business.'There Will Be Blood' is a Magnificent Motion-Picture on its own merit. Paul Thomas Anderson's Direction & Screenplay, both, are Unmatchable & Beyond Words. He tells this ruthless & violent human-story, with flawless understanding & tremendous confidence.Its a film that talks about Gods and Monsters. It talks about the Rich & the Poor. It talks about Greed. It talks about Agony. Its a Magnificent Film, that explores each & every human emotion, bombastically.Very Strongly Recommended! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is one of the greatest performances I've seen in a long time; it is so great that it is absolutely terrifying at times.,"Daniel Day-Lewis has got to be one of the most dedicated actors of our time, giving us one great performance after another particularly in these four; ""My Left Foot"", ""In the Name of the Father"", ""Gangs of New York"" and now ""There Will be Blood"" in his darkest role ever. One a whole his performance in this film reminded me of Orson Wells from the great ""Citizen Kane"".This is one of the greatest performances I've seen in a long time; it is so great that it is absolutely terrifying at times. For insistence there is a scene where his competition is trying to buy him out and tells Plainview that he can spend more time with his son but Plainview feels that he's trying to tell him how to raise his family and he says the following: ""One night, I'm gonna come inside your house, wherever you're sleeping, and I'm gonna cut your throat."" Now that just put chills down my spine and the way he says it with that 'John Huston' kind-of accent is just brilliant. There is also a great scene where he is burying someone in the middle of nowhere in order since he felt that this person was after his money. It just simply reminded me of Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" when trying to kill Curtin, looking out for his share of the gold along with some other scenes since the director (Paul Thomas Anderson) went to sleep every night watching ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" while filming ""There Will Be Blood"", and you can tell.The film basically is about a man who is looking for silver but instead finds oil and is now determined to be the best in the business and make sure that he ranks on top and above the others along with his partner H.W. Plainview, his young son. In the process he finds difficulties in gaining all the land he desires and in building his pipeline. Every single scene is extremely well made and shows us Plainview's ruthlessness slowly turning into madness.One of the film's finest scenes is the opening scene when Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is on his own in the middle of nowhere and is trying to wrest silver from the earth with a pick and shovel and a stick of dynamite. There is no music in that scene, you just here the sound of the pick hitting the rock and Plainview moving around in the hole and it works perfectly. Not to mention the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous in almost every scene.This film is defiantly film making at its best but it could have been a lot better since it had quite a few flaws in it and the major flaw is the annoying Eli Sunday (played by Paul Dano from ""Little Miss Sunshine""). I didn't care one bit for his performance and in fact it even got on my nerves at times, especially his 'church scene' where he 'casts the devil out of people' in his little chapel.This is Paul Thomas Anderson in his finest hour as a director, his best film since ""Boogie Nights"" one of the best films of 1997 since I wasn't a fan of his last 2 films: ""Punch Drunk Love"" & ""Magnolia"".",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

There Will Be Awards,"I am going with Paul Thomas Anderson's latest, more mature work as the best American film showing this year, certainly guided and downright anchored by Mr. Daniel Day-Lewis in another legendary performance of screen-shattering proportions. I will hear of many accusing this master character actor of overdoing it at times, serenading the camera with eyes viewers needn't peer too closely into lest our own humanity become compromised. The truth is, for every over-the-top scene which almost always remains justifiable in Day-Lewis's astonishing hands, observant viewers will be equally if not largely rewarded by the boiling subtleties which ripple throughout, just beneath this menacing surface of a man.As engaging a character study the movie feels (and this it firmly remains right up until an overworked finale), There Will Be Blood shines equally as bright as a brave new step for period westerns. Not in some time has fictionalized American history been so bold with creative and thematic assertion, yet accessible enough to render this harrowing study into greed without generation, and one for the books.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The epic American Masterpiece of the decade!,"After a third viewing of There Will Be Blood, I have to say that this film continues to amaze and fascinate me even more! Paul Thomas Anderson created a work of art here. There Will Be Blood reaches amazing heights, and has amazing achievements. First off, this film is not for the faint-hearted. Those looking for an entertaining watch, it will completely blow you away. It is a tale of an oil-man, one who has a lot of ambitions and characteristics. He is very much greedy, he wants more and more, and he is also very complicated. He is a family man, one who manages to change his life in weird aspects.This film starts, and has you on watch. There are a lot of important aspects of the story, of every scene that viewers should keep in mind. This is very much a character-story. Daniel Day Lewis plays his character, Daniel Plainview, and completely transforms himself into character. His acting, every single scene, it's as if Lewis had to completely get into this mind and soul. It is seriously a performance of the decade. Daniel day Lewis proves he is the actor to beat. Paul Dano, who plays Eli Sunday(and Paul) also gives a very different performance. Some say he overreacted, but his character is that way too. His performance totally captivates the character, and the way his character lives. The script is seriously amazing!!! This film is a lot about religion, faith, greed, family, etc. It has almost everything that a film should have. It has moral lessons and themes, and very haunting scenes.From the technical part, this film succeeds. The set designs and the cinematography are simply first-rate. The musical score is simply WOW! It really defines a genre of music scores of the last decade, and it is so haunting! The direction that Anderson took is amazing. He had to really create passion and force to every single scene. Every single scene is driven powerfully, and you are never left wondering why it was done that way, but to just capture more to the audience.This film is perfect! There is no other word. It is in many ways a horror film, it is in many ways a life-lesson, and also a tragedy. It has one of the most intense and powerful endings in cinema history(if not the best!) It truly is the best film of the decade, and one of the best films ever made! A force to be reckoned with!",,Anonymous,Drama
"A real thinking persons movie, very profound!!!","There are not many movies being made these days that can do what this one does. It not only entertains, but has you thinking about it for days to come. There are so many nuances and eddies of plot in this movie. The characters are believable, multi-layered and absolutely mesmerizing. Daniel Day Lewis won a deserved Oscar for his performance, they should have given him two as his performance was that good. Once again black gold(this movie) is overlooked at the Oscars and fools gold wins the best picture award(No Country). Who ever is doing the choosing these days for the academy is either blind, deaf or both, or maybe just stupid. The departed last year and now No Country, both of which are good at best but not great! The Academy of Movie Picture's best picture award should go to a movie that is great! There will be Blood is a great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A distinctly American masterpiece,"Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" or Modest Mouse's ""The Lonesome Crowded West"", ""There Will Be Blood"" is a distinctly American masterpiece. Its overriding themes of religion, greed, family and loneliness converge to evoke a desperation that could only have come from the oil rush gripping our country in the early 1900's. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a sprawling epic nourished through the umbilical of oil barons, railroads and the vast, desolate West.Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"", ""Punch-Drunk Love""), the film is a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"" However, only the film's atmosphere and landscape are informed by Sinclair's portrayal of the oil business. The actual plot of ""Blood"" is wholly different, an intricate story of fictional oil entrepreneur Daniel Plainview and his battle with the disordered world that surrounds him.Plainview is a misanthropist who paradoxically seeks companionship even as he loathes mankind in general. His investment in oil is motivated entirely by his desire to earn enough money to escape civilization altogether. He loathes religion, dismissing it as a superstition, and entertains human interaction only when he calculates that it is crucial to his oil mining. Daniel Day-Lewis' (""Gangs of New York"", ""My Left Foot"") gripping portrayal of Plainview cannot be over-estimated. His willful stage presence lends the film a searing intensity that both counteracts and complements the film's measured pacing.Yet while the story is certainly rich with detail and subtlety, There Will Be Blood is hardly a film of words. At times fifteen full minutes will pass without any dialogue at all. The space that fills these stretches of silence greatly enhances the film's sense of space and desolation. Even when characters do speak, nobody says more than necessary. Words are carefully chosen and tersely delivered, and there is much to be read between the lines.Instead of leaning on dialogue, much of the film's force comes from its gorgeous cinematography. Meticulously detailed and breathtakingly beautiful, There Will Be Blood is visually arresting from the film's beginning to its conclusion. Similarly, the score (composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood) greatly accentuates the film's most dramatic moments. Yet while the music itself is impeccable, the way that Anderson employs it is even more impressive. Violins and sparse percussion rise and fall at unexpected moments, carefully cultivating a sense of unease while still managing to feel natural and well considered.Perhaps the most incredible thing about ""There Will Be Blood"" is its minimalism. In spite of its long runtime (which approaches three hours), the film never feels indulgent or overly complex. Anderson slows down the pacing of the film to a deliberate lurch. This might frustrate impatient viewers, but the approach is ultimately makes the film's several climaxes more rewarding and its emotional peaks more stunning.""There Will Be Blood"" is both visceral and cerebral, the rare film that combines the raw emotion of our most human instincts with smart, well-conceived film-making techniques. Well worth the hype and capable of meeting even your wildest expectations, Anderson's latest is truly a masterpiece of American cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Masterful.,"I don't know whether this is quite as good as No Country for Old Men or not - only time will tell that - but this is a very, very good film in its own right, anyway. This is most comparable to Citizen Kane, boasting a similar structure and main character, although this is every bit as compelling and interesting, with twists and turns around every corner, always something to keep you on the edge of your seat. There Will Be Blood is a riveting drama, and it weaves a tale that you will not forget.Daniel Day Lewis's acting is fantastic, and he is surrounded by a supporting cast that do not lack for acting prowess themselves.

Arguably The Greatest Film Ever Made,"Paul Thomas Anderson's film ""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterpiece. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is truly incredible. The opening scene is truly astounding. The music, which was composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, is absolutely breathtaking. Daniel Plainview is one of the great characters in cinema history. The performance of Paul Dano is understated and wonderfully nuanced. The screenplay, adapted from the Upton Sinclair novel ""Oil!"", is absolutely brilliant. Paul Thomas Anderson is undoubtedly the single greatest filmmaker of his generation. The story make take place in the early 1900s, but the themes of religion, business, and capitalism have a remarkable relevance in present-day society. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The gusher scene is especially striking. It will be remembered as one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is the strongest that I have seen since Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". The ending is brilliant and satisfying, despite receiving much criticism. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a true masterpiece of American cinema and arguably the greatest film in the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Slow, lingering but brilliant dramatization of how money corrupts","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the 1890s, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) sees the profit to come from oil and becomes set on his journey to becoming a ruthless tycoon who will step over anything and anyone to get the bottom dollar. He manipulates a deeply religious family into selling him their land, most significantly the son Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) whose religious convictions are deeply held and without question. Over the years, Daniel continues to deny him and his family the money he owes them and drifts apart from his adopted son, whose deafness resulted from his greed and who he only uses to project a caring family man image, until he turns on him and Plainview descends into madness.The trick to succeeding in business, it's safe to say, is to market essentials, things people can't live without. Phillip Green has made millions from his Marks & Spencer clothes empire (aside from living on the continent for large parts of the week to avoid tax) and John Leslie picked himself back up from falling out the limelight by becoming a property developer. But nothing seems to bring in the bucks like oil, the substance needed to fuel the machines that get us around. After the war, Iraq stands to get itself right back up on it's feet due to the large oil reserves buried beneath it and think of all the Texan oil tycoons who've done well for themselves off the back of it. TWBB delves into the psyche of a trailblazing entrepreneur who first saw the potential to exploit this service for all it's worth and how determination and ruthless desire drive him to go right over the edge, even to murder.It's guided along, of course, by an amazing performance from Lewis, who captures the accent and spirit of Plainview perfectly. He has good support, too, from Dano as the young son of the preacher, driven by his beliefs and values who ends up selling out like everyone else. The film isn't driven by talky moments so much as long periods of silence and moodiness (including a dialogue free first thirty minutes) in which Paul Thomas Anderson, who writes and directs, creates an eerie and enthralling atmosphere of impending doom and madness. Every shot and every scene has it's own unique touch that creates just the right impression very subtly.It requires persistence and it might not strike you the first time, but there is no doubt this is a modern classic we have on our hands here, an enthralling and chilling tale of how money corrupts. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Realism with major flaws,"I'd read other stories about the hard lives and deceptions common to the early oilmen seeking their fortunes. It was thus with trepidation that I went to see this film. One definitely gets a flavour of the hard stoicism of the participants as the script and acting are superb. Nevertheless, I'd liked to have seen more of the slimy/silver tongued ruthlessness in the later dialogue with the corporate oilmen that is reputed to have persisted at the time. The film as a whole is a great testament to the many tales that no doubt can be told about this period in the US's history. However, I found great fault with the musical choices throughout - all overly intrusive, clanging and orchestral when something more basic and wild would have coloured the scenes much more effectively. Daniel Day Lewis was fabulous as usual but the Director should have insisted that he maintain the 'limp' more consistently - a major scene early on after his injury sees him running without impediment...such a shame as otherwise Daniel's performance was spot on. A hard film to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
beautiful ugly,"Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a driven hard-scrabbled miner and prospector. In 1902, he discovers oil in California. A worker dies in an accident and he adopts the man's baby. He promotes himself as a family man with his son H.W. and a sincere oilman. Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) sells him information about oil on his family's farm. Paul's twin Eli doesn't trust him and is driven for his church. Daniel acquires the rights from everybody except hold-out William Bandy. As the oil flows, Daniel and Eli become bitter rivals and blood starts to run.This is a slow-moving epic driven by a relentlessly intense performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. This movie is infused with his sense of menace and a self-assured intensity. Paul Dano has his weird creepiness. Paul Thomas Anderson creates a completely immersive world filled with hard characters. It is absolutely beautiful and stark with its offkey scores. There are scenes of perfect beautiful ugliness. The movie explodes in intensity from time to time but mostly it has a tone of menace and stress. I like it but I would like it more if it moves faster. This has the look of greatness, and the sense of greatness. It is close to greatness but I wish I like more.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Floored. Period.,"Just got done seeing this film for the first time, and it punched me dead in the face. Daniel Day-Lewis' interpretation of the main character Mr. Plainview is an absolute tour de force. His crystallized greed and over-the-top bitterness jabbed a nerve ending in me. I can understand how some viewers might call his approach too much, but considering the source material (a moralizing novel written to generate an inflammatory response), it felt right. the atonal musical score has been a bone to pick for many viewers as well. for me, although it did not seem to fit with the time period of the movie, it felt right to me as well. It reminded me of some of the music that filmmaker Stanley Kubrick put in his movies, and since Kubrick is my all time favorite director, i'm probably a little biased. but i think this movie is meant to be a work of art that tries hard to provoke an emotional response. the film could be seen as a moralizing tale, a cynical comment about the potential depths of mankind's greed, a stern warning, or a dozen other things. i got a great deal out of the film, and i think it will age pretty well as the years go by. it may feel admittedly boring and too drawn out at times, but it came across to me as a richly textured piece, showcasing Lewis' performance. BRAVO!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Masterful Performance that answers a Question that is never asked,"I think that Daniel Day-Lewis is the best actor right now. Period. Every time I see him on screen, he captures misanthropy in a way that no other Hollywood pretty boy or girl can even approach. He is a throwback to a time when even famous actors actually struggled on the way up and had some personal understanding of hate, malice, struggle, failure and redemption. Not the ""I didn't get paid enough for my last film"" kind of hatred, or ""I didn't get in the tabloids enough last week,"" or ""My girlfriend left me and now I have to find another one."" No, the ""I have to literally kick my competitor in the head in order to feed my family"" kind.A performance can make a movie. It sure does make this one. But what is the film about? An oilman at the turn of the century? Yes. Greed and betrayal and murder and hatred? Yes. A parable on what it took for hard men to succeed in hard times? Most definitely yes.But the question that is answered has nothing to do with any of the above. Those are incidentals to the real answer that the film provides. The question to be answered only comes in the last five minutes of the film. Everything before that is an explanation of why the film ended as it did.Now, you may not think that the question posed at the end of the film - why did the aging oilman do what he did? - is worth making a film about. I think it is worth answering, because of the insight it gives into a time and place and human nature. But the film definitely answers that question. Brilliantly. So, if you want the answer to that question, this film gives it to you. But telling you what the question is would spoil the film for you, because of the sheer randomness with which the film seems to end.As for the journey the film takes, well, it is a look at a total misanthrope who explains quite succinctly his philosophy of life to his ""brother"" - namely, ""I hate everybody and want to make enough money to not have to deal with anybody. It is not enough that I succeed - everyone else must fail."" Now if you think that is an uncommon feeling, well, maybe you're right, but I sure think I've met people like that along the way. And this film portrays pure misanthropy in what I think is a brilliant way. A long, roundabout, circuitous, mysterious way, but still brilliant.I recommend this film if you are in the mood for a very dark but profound experience into the human psyche. Or if you just agree with me that Daniel Day-Lewis is awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Greed Comes at the Price of One's Soul,"Daniel Day-Lewis has always been fascinating to me. He's an extraordinary actor who I believe I saw for the first time when I saw Gangs of New York, in which he was one of the most lovable villains I'd seen up till that time. But with each role I've seen him play, he has an entirely different presence. For instance, he seems like a totally different person in every way when he's shaven as opposed to mustachioed. Despite Day-Lewis's intriguing stiffness and Minotaur-like density, he is capable of inordinate transformation to the point of complete contradiction. In There Will Be Blood, his physical inhabitance of Daniel Plainview, accompanied by a brilliantly realized sandpaper voice, is a lurching cartoon villain of opaqueness, impossible to probe. Day-Lewis's portrayal is so deeply subjective that the innate content of Plainview asserts itself thoroughly over form.A rivalry is sparked between secularist rags-to-riches oil magnate Plainview and ambitious young priest Eli Sunday, played powerfully by Paul Dano, as Plainview, feeling secure in his dissociative feelings, sees himself reflected in Eli's anti-social greed. Plainview's son is the only person he trusts amidst all of his shrewd manipulations and pragmatism, but when his son goes deaf after an oil rig incident, they estrange and his trust becomes totally displaced and his soul is eclipsed, and the world dances around these inert, degenerate people until, well, they are ""finished.""Paul Thomas Anderson, all of whose films so far have become favorites of mine, has succeeded in setting a new bar in cinema, having bewilderingly gotten away clean with an incredible amount of risks with this shifty, cynical, mystifying masterpiece. Like Day-Lewis playing Daniel Plainview, he has plunged into a solitary subjectivity that has removed him from the influences of mainstream convention. It's an unremitting film, relentless to be completely itself. One of the less subtle examples would be Jonny Greenwood's atonal and dissonant music score.A key scene in this movie is the first sermon given by Eli Sunday. It is a perfectly directed and acted scene. Eli proceeds to make an extreme fool out of himself, with total confidence. What he says and does are all completely ridiculous, often contradicting himself or failing to make any sense, and no matter how far Dano goes, Anderson's tone remains undisturbedly cynical. Just as he did with the documentary interviews in Boogie Nights, we aren't put off by the self-indulgent idiocy of his characters; in fact we laugh a bit without losing touch with the film's current.There Will Be Blood is the fascinating sort of film out of which you stumble, distraughtly rummaging for an adjective or neighborhood of feeling that are both vivid and explanatory enough to cover all corners of your experience and individually characteristic enough to identify your mind, which is routinely on a different wavelength that this movie. It's an indictment of the sociopathic institutions of industry and organized religion. It's a character study. It's a clash of egos. It's an impression of a time. It's a detailed account of a time.This is a film movie buffs will analyze, debate, and rewatch endlessly. Now of course the snobs will retort with claims that each other does not understand the context and meaning and this and that, but the important thing to do with this film is wash away all that you hear from pretentious pseudointellectuals and let the film effect you on your own terms.It can hardly be argued that there was most certainly kismet involved in the overlapping productions of There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men, two films released recently very close together, having been shot in the same West Texas locations and at times getting in each other's way.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A very powerful film and different on the subject,"There will be Blood is an example of quintessential cinema, also it is an entertainment as an adventure film and this is Daniel Day Lewis's second greatest performance after My Left Foot. Even if it is not superhuman like My Left Foot, it was amazing. As for direction, as said, this is a masterful work with a powerful story telling. Honestly, I had not supposed that Anderson was such a master director, despite I have seen Magnolia which is a masterpiece for me. At this point, it is frustrating that some people find the movie very boring, slow paced and even some say that nothing happens in this movie! This is funny, because There will be Blood is not an art house film-I don't mean that art house films are boring, but this is an adventure film like Gone with the Wind or something. This is an adventure with a rare and important plot which had not been handled before: oil! As known, Anderson inspired from the another masterpiece The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The story is very adventurous here and Daniel Day Lewis is Bogart? Anyway, the moments take place in the train station affected me a lot, for me it is may be the zenith of the movie. It was touching but in a silent and deep way. However, I had a problem with this movie which is the final act. This is the only disappointment for me. The final act clashes with the atmosphere, the tone, the spirit of the movie that is built throughout. it is like the movie steps into a new age and the movie turns into something postmodern and this post-modernism doesn't fit the movie. Then, Daniel Plainview starts to talk about milkshake, milkshake??? Also, the twin stuff was far fetched and not convincing.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

It seems to be the trend, and, why do we as consumers keep 'gobbling' this crap up? Because we get duped into thinking that there is something of value by the amount of 'hype' that goes into the promotion of these movies.

The Review: There Will Be Blood,"There Will Be Blood is a very unusual film, be it the first thirty minutes with not a word spoken, or the twisted corruption of an oil man. This movie is less a popcorn movie and more an artistic piece of work that seems to express much more than you had first braced yourself for. My friends and fellow critics, this is a work of art.The beautiful cinematography is just one of the many feats this film has. Others include the amazing acting from Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano (Paul is absolutely frightening) to the intensity and language the script brings to the characters.This isn't going to be an easy film to sit through. This film is a journey into one man's soul, and watch it decay from the inside. Greed is the main subject for this film, and it expresses it with perfection.The name is a bit of a misnomer. There isn't much blood in this film. As a matter of fact, the film is a PG rating in Canada, so don't expect to see a graphically violent film.As I said before, the cinematography is beautiful. You'll hold your breath at the sight of 50 men running toward inflamed oil spurting out of the pump and into the air, making mid-day look like deep, moon-less night. This scene is just one of many.This was a very good contender for Best Pic. Only the masterpiece that is No Country for Old Men could have beaten this brutal, and yet poetic film about Greed, Hate, and self-destruction.Rating: **** (of 4)Entertainment: ***** (of 5)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

He strikes again, and it is there a lifetime desire is born: a desire to acquire more.With a deep and resounding voice, we hear that man speak for the first time as he attempts to lure the residents of a town into a business deal. His name is Daniel Plainview, and he is an oil man. Beside him always is his adopted son, H.W. He brings the boy along just so an illusion of a family is established, and the oil man is one step closer to the owners of potential prospects.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/there-will-be-blood-movie- review/",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Modern Masterpiece,"There is a way to turn storytelling into true art through the use of a camera. Paul Thomas Anderson understands exactly how and he has proved again and again that he is a master of powerful, moving, aesthetically brilliant storytelling. His most recent film was the 2007 period piece There Will Be Blood. The film is about business man Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in one of the greatest performances of the 21st century. Plainview starts out as a dirt poor oil field worker who grows into a deranged and greedy oil man who plays a vicious game of deceit and treachery with a poor town whose devout faith is the only thing that keeps them all going. It is the complex tale of one man's rise to power and descent into greedy insanity. It boasts a kind of intelligence that modern American cinema rarely achieves. This is a film that feels like it should have been made decades ago during the fruition of the American movie industry, yet instead it was made in 2007 and has successfully revitalized the potential of American filmmaking.There Will Be Blood succeeds so extravagantly as a careful blend between artistic imagery and cinematography and sincere storytelling. This films story is strictly for intellectuals. It doesn't spell out anything for the viewer and it doesn't hold your hand as you watch it. You have to absorb the film rather than just watch it. It is subtle and quiet and yet so enthralling and so moving. The film's incredible focus drives home all of its meaning and messages. It isn't just the story of one man's trial and tribulations in the oil industry. It is a story of greed, obsession, cruelty, and faith. The film cleverly blends two different lifestyles, one of the stalwart business man and one of devout religious passion into an ingenious story of ambition versus faith. Few films are able to so intelligently tell a story of such calibre against such an unlikely backdrop.It is one thing to be able to piece such a sophisticated story together, it is another to tell that story in such an artistic and captivating way as Paul Thomas Anderson's direction of There Will Be Blood. The cinematography of this film is incredible and Anderson's camera work is astounding to a cinematically intellectual eye. His camera movement is so subtle yet so brilliant in its quiet complexities that you are driven to feel so much more emotion and captivation while watching this movie than you would expect. The sweeping pans, the immaculate wide shots, the enthralling close-ups, are all what make There Will Be Blood such a subtly excellent work of art. This film demands a higher level of appreciation and I can easily say that it isn't for everybody. It works on such low key levels that it unexpectedly grabs hold of you carries you along for almost three hours of pure captivation.There Will Be Blood is a prime example of modern aesthetic storytelling. The film is practically flawless in its execution and it achieves all of what it set out to do. It makes you think and it also mystifies your eyes as you gaze into its immaculate lens. And with the addition of Anderson's fancy script and Daniel Day-Lewis' magnificent performance you've got yourself a modern American masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's hard to rate this film.,"What can I say, it's very well made, really good sets, great performances all round, soundtrack sets the tone well creating a feeling of impending disaster or doom.But I watched 1 hr 15 minutes of the 2 hr 38 min film and gave up, on a night off with no other engagements I sat there and thought ""nothing has happened in over an hour"", now please don't mistake me for one of those ""I need some action"" types, I can appreciate a well made movie as written above, but this film, is literally like going to visit a solicitor's office or doing jury service.Daniel Day Lewis is probably the finest actor on screen, only having done 22 features since he started acting, he picked his roles well and went years without work so he could get a great script, but the 1 hr 15 minutes I watched of There Will Be Blood bored me senseless leaving me unfulfilled with a feeling of ""nothings actually happened"".",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Stunning Character-based movie !,"Based on a novel ""Oil!""..A very strong & theatrical performance by Daniel. Music was loud and brought about a stillness and grandeur to the desert, oil and sweat. Daniel's swagger as a businessman (OILMAN) carried the movie till the end. Eli, the self-proclaimed priest character, was suppose to be the anti-thesis to Daniel's character, but the portrayal wasn't done as strongly as Daniel Plainview's character. Many viewers, after watching this movie, could be confused and left with bitterness. I was simply stunned.For me, the highlight of this movie was the screenplay and the depth of Plainview's character. 2 scenes bring out this aspect - one where he was drinking with his newfound brother, Henry, and claims that he does not like anyone else to succeed around him. You could feel the hatred, the jealousy and the scorn inside the man. Second, when he kills henry, buries him and sleeps on that very ground. Cold!Not a happy movie, but a good work of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
I just don't get it,"It was pretty good for the most part. Then it fell apart in the last half hour or so. The ending had me scratching my head, wondering what the point was. I felt that it was operating on a metaphorical and thematic level that eluded me.It also would have helped if Daniel Plainview had any redeeming qualities. Think of a lot of other anti-heroes or antogonists in movie history: Jake LaMotta, Darth Vader, Travis Bickle, Gollum, Tony Montana, or even Bill the Butcher. Each of these characters had some sort of positive quality that you can relate too. Daniel Plainview's character arc is just a slow steady descent into a black hole. I understand that not every movie can be sunshine and roses, but I just can't revel in this kind of nihilism. There has to at least a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"He drinks it up, as we the viewers also digest this picture.","There Will Be Blood is adapted by Paul Thomas Anderson from the novel ""Oil"", written by Upton Sinclair. It charts the rise to power of Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector without one seemingly redemptive characteristic, this is a man who takes and uses an adoptive son purely as a front for luring sympathy from prospective sellers, the facade of a caring family man never more so ruthlessly exploited as it is by Plainview. Upon learning {at a price} that there is oil abundant land in California going cheap, Plainview and H.W. {his ahem, son}, set off there and begin manipulating the land owners to meet Plainview's means. But although the operation there is thriving, Plainview meets resistance per se, in the form of local preacher Eli Sunday, greed and religion appearing to define both mens destinies.So many writings and analytical dissections have been formed about this mighty epic from 2007, and really it's not my want to even begin agreeing or disagreeing about the various translations of the piece. For what it's worth, I don't see anything more than a fable about isolation thru greed, and the blending of capitalism with religious fervour. What I do know is that watching There Will Be Blood feels like a reason to love cinema, regardless of Paul Thomas Anderson's motives that bubble beneath the surface, it's a film of extraordinary greatness. It's leading man, Daniel Day Lewis, turns in one of his customary brilliant performances, enticing audience confusion as to if Plainview is a genius or a sociopath bastard? Either way you call it, Day Lewis has given us one of the modern cinema's truest scary monsters. Paul Dano as Eli gives the film its other central performance, and in view of D D Lewis's barn storming performance, it's with much credit that Dano leaves an indelible mark come the final credits.Tho nominated for eight academy awards, the only other win outside of Day Lewis's for best actor {really it was a given that he would win}, went to Robert Elswit for his stunning cinematography, sparse dusty lands are perfectly framed with truncation excellently arriving in the form of oil drills and fire laden towers. There Will Be Blood is a film that demands you return to it for further viewings, each subsequent visit bringing about a little more than a fabulous leading man performance. It's just like many prescription pain killers, if you give it time then it most definitely works, and to me as a lover of cinema, this picture is part of being the best medicine of recent times. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Oh Yes, There Will Be Blood","Winner of two Academy Awards for Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Best Cinematography, ""There Will Be Blood"" is based upon the 1927 novel ""Oil!"" by Upton Sinclair and takes place in California during the early 20th century with an oil prospector making his fortune. Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), the aforementioned oilman, is a shrewd businessman and sees death early on as a part of life in the industry but it is only after he is challenged by a deceptive evangelist does death go from inadvertent to unmistakably discriminate.In a cacophonous mix of cutthroat business and zealous religion, a war is instigated when a young man named Paul Sunday (Dano) comes to Daniel and offers to point him in the direction of a surefire fortune in exchange for a handsome sum. Paul's hometown village of ""Little Boston"" is a figurative gold mine, the family farm and the hundreds of miles surrounding it an untapped wealth of crude oil. Under the guise of pheasant hunting enthusiasts, Daniel and his son H.W. (Freasier) start investigating the property and their suspicions are quickly confirmed. Within no time, a deal is on the table but Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), a local preacher, impedes the contract by not only demanding a generous portion of the proceeds but also the chance to expand his modest congregation. Hiding behind the façade of Christianity, he is motivated by greed, only to be unexpectedly matched by the cruelty and cunning of Daniel.The film is more than deserved of both of its Oscars, namely Day-Lewis's riveting performance as Daniel Plainview, a man who is torn between the love for his son and his love for self-affluence (or so one thinks). The 52-year old Oscar winner's performance is matched by that of his 24-year old co-star Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. Though he was cast as both of the Sunday brothers, it is as the sanctimonious Eli that Dano makes a pointed connection with the audience. He is the character whom viewers love to hate, using religion to veil his egoism and his struggle for power, so much so that he aids in lending sympathy to Daniel, a man whose motivations are equally insatiate to his own.Stunning cinematography comes courtesy of Robert Elswit, a man who served as director of photography for P.T. Anderson's much-discussed '99 film ""Magnolia"". Filmed in greater part in Marfa, Texas (neighboring with the cast and crew of ""No Country For Old Men""), Elswit recreates and highlights the best of old California's sweeping vistas, its rustic mountain ranges, rolling hills and dry desert-like tundra the picture-perfect backdrop.Paul Thomas Anderson has a short but unique body of work and this film has created the official apex of his career. It is also a sign that there will be many more interesting projects to come from this 38-year old writer/director/producer. Dusting off the ashes ten years after the outrageous cult favorite ""Boogie Nights"", ""There Will Be Blood"" is a definitive sign that this director has matured.Out of a total of 10 stars, I give it a 9. I can only hope it will parallel to Joel and Ethan Cohen's magnum opus ""No Country For Old Men"".",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A modern classic,"*There are a few plot points that are discussed in this review*I don't write a lot of reviews on here, but for a movie like this, I think I will. Of all of the best movies I saw from 2007, the quirky and original Juno, the suspenseful No Country for Old Men, and the hilarious Hot Fuzz, There Will Be Blood remains the best. Very rarely does a movie appear where EVERYTHING comes together perfectly. The acting, directing, writing, music, and cinematography are all top notch here.The film involves Daniel Plainview, a prospector who agrees with the Sunday family in the town of Little Boston, California to drill on their land for oil. When Daniel does discovers oil, tensions between himself and Paul Sunday, a priest in the town, rise as they both become more and more greedy as the oil keeps coming in.Daniel Day Lewis gives the performance of the decade as Daniel Plainview. Paul Dano, who was in Little Miss Sunshine, really surprised me here. There is a scene late in the movie where Daniel is baptized, where Dano and Lewis both really shine. It's a chilling scene that is still just as effective no matter how many times I see it.Now that I think about it, the entire movie is filmed with images that stick with you long after you've seen the movie. Daniel falling down the mineshaft early in the film, an oil derrick catching fire and the many workers who rush to snap the cables and wait until the time comes to dynamite it. The aforementioned baptism scene. And of course the ending, undeniably one of the most surreal and jaw-dropping moments in recent movie history. Watching this movie for the first time (on blu-ray, which I highly recommend), I had to rewind it and watch the scene again 2 or 3 times, just to be sure that what I was seeing was actually happening. I know it sounds strange, but it's true.This is the best film of 2007 and probably of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Violence begets violence,"In watching There Will Be Blood, I was a little worried to consider the old saying, like begets like, because it makes me realize that violence has always been too much of a prevalent part of American history. I am sad to realize that we might be one of the most violent countries in the world, in a way, at least because American history is peppered with intensely violent episodes, starting with the very first settlers who arrived here in the 18th century.There Will Be Blood takes place in turn of the 20th century America in the classic American frontier. Expansion is taking place everywhere, and we meet an ambitious prospector curiously named Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis is clearly one of the most talented actors working today, and is a giant among even the greats of film history. There is a lot of talk about how he created the unique voice for his character, and it has an introduction that Orson Welles would have appreciated, in that there is not a word spoken in the movie until 15 minutes into it.It is curious the way music is used in the movie, as we get some suspense music at many points of the movie, perfectly relating the sense of unease and uncertainty that must have permeated through those times.We never learn anything much about Plainview. We don't know where he comes from, only that he has no friends and no family except a man who shows up midway through the movie claiming to be his long lost brother and an adopted son, who Plainview seems to take under his wing out of an inability to leave him for dead after his father was killed in a mining accident, but later it becomes clear that the boy can be put to good use for business purposes. When he grows up and wants to go into business for himself, Plainview's view of their relationship becomes clear. This is the ruthless business that was taking place in the early American oil industry.Plainview, a wily businessman if ever there was one, soon becomes immensely wealthy through his drilling ventures, so much so that he is able to effectively compete with the oil giant Standard Oil, throwing million dollar offers back in their face at a time when a million dollars was a truly astronomical amount of money.Standard Oil has been casing an area around the Sunday family ranch, until one of the Sunday sons, Paul (Paul Dano) introduces himself to Plainview and offers to tell him of a place where there is surely a huge oil deposit for payment of a few hundred dollars. Plainview is suspicious but pays him with a vicious threat if the tip turns out to be false. Upon arriving, he basically cons the Sunday father into giving him drilling rights for next to nothing, making a permanent enemy out of the other Sunday son, Paul's twin brother Eli, an evangelical nutcase.Paul Dano has made a jump that I didn't predict in his acting career. He was so good in Little Miss Sunshine that I didn't see him making such a big jump into such a completely different role, and even though his character was a little too over-the-top for me once or twice, it's clear that his acting career is progressing much faster than I would have anticipated.There is also, by the way, an interesting dichotomy in Eli's character. His only motivation throughout the movie is the propagation of his church and religion, which drives him to constantly try to wrest money from Plainview from his drilling profits, which reminds me of the constant relationship between organized religions and the never ending requests for donations from church members. According to the movie, religion is as much a business as oil drilling. We even see a variety of early ""photo-ops,"" one of which Plainview publicly throws back in Eli's face. He has nothing but contempt for religion, as he does for most people.The movie is loosely based on Upton Sinlair's novel Oil!, which I understand tells a remarkably different story, but nonetheless this is a fascinating story about the formation of the American oil industry. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is alone worth watching the movie for, and while the film is not without it's imperfections, the effectiveness with which it recreates the American past is nothing less than stunning. I can't wait for a film adaptation of Sinclair's The Jungle!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterful exploration of the dark sides of human nature.,"There will be blood is one of my favorite films. It conveys grandeur and imagery spectacularly in it's cinematography and direction, it's acting is spectacular and larger than life, the soundtrack is haunting and shocking and the story is universal and surprisingly relatable.Daniel-Day Lewis portrays Daniel Plainview, a great actor portraying a great character. Daniel succumbs to greed and human indulgence. He addmitedly ""hates most people"", and wants to be alone. He uses his son for a sales tactic. He's a drunk. So why do we like him so much? Because he is us. He is what we are if we truly succumb to human nature. He descends lower and lower into this personal hell until the name of the movie comes into play.His adversary is Eli, a evangelical preacher. The characters contrast well and gives Daniel chances to show his personality. Eli is played by Paul Dano. I honestly don't understand the criticism of his acting in this movie. I thought he was a fantastic actor worthy of standing next to Day-Lewis.I really can't describe this movie. It is so deep, so profound that I can't see how any intelligent adult would not be able to acknowledge it's greatness.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
What is this mishmash of self-indulgent scenes all about?,"There are 2 things that disquieted me after watching this movie:1) Despite the absolute dryness of the plot, it is rated so highly by critics.2) Everyone who watched it admitted its boring, but they still said its a good. Talk about influences...This is by no means a poor film, but its definitely one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.There are many scenes that can simply be removed without having any impact to the film. In fact, after the atrocious 2 hour and 40 minutes, I still could not feel anything or tell you what the movie is about. I have absolutely no connection or understanding of the contradicted character Daniel. For a film that revolves entirely around an individual, thats quite an underachievement.This film has no soul. While it is a character study, but many of its scenes are so drawn out that the impact of the acting is sometimes drowned out by the seemingly senseless wandering of the camera. You see many scenes of characters walking in vast barren lands, standing around, waiting and doing nothing in a variety of scenes. Yes, the scenes are very believable, because they are so mundane. If you put all those scenes together, you will have a decent documentary about oil drilling in 1900s.Yet, the film happens to be a mish mash of scenes that lead to nowhere. I waited till the end, expecting a scene of absolute emotional explosion, but non ever come.Music at times was good, but at times was simply incongruous to the atmosphere of the scene. A good musical score is supposed to bring us closer to the atmosphere of the scene, but the scores in this movie often achieve the exact opposite. You got shaken out of the scene and can't help but wonder ""why did they put this weird tune in there?"" The indulgent cinematographic attempt to earn an award nomination is all too obvious... so much so that it came across as pretentious, excessive and sometimes painfully out of place.That being said, the movie is not without its merits. Daniel has delivered a consistent performance throughout the movie. Excellenet acting, but certainly not to the level of ""perfection"" that many people claim. Its hard to act a character that is so unreal. Yet, when you only have meaningless drawn out scenes in a barren land, audience can't help but pay attention to the actors. In this case, its all good. Because thats the film's only saving grace.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
big movie with great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis,"""There Will Be Blood"" is a 2007 film directed by P.T. Anderson and starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano.It's the story of an oil tycoon, starting out in the early days of the century and going through to about 1929.Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, and in the beginning, we see him searching for oil with a team of men. I have to inject something here: what I loved about the beginning was the lack of dialogue. Whenever we see westerns or pioneer films or whatever, characters speak as we do today. However, I believe that miners, trappers, traders, gunslingers et al. didn't do much talking, in fact, they were probably just one or two steps up from neanderthals, without much education, and living somewhat isolated lives. The beginning of this film captured this beautifully as the men worked side by side, saying very little.Plainview becomes wealthy - he seems charming as he travels around with his son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) but he's out to get land as cheaply as he can, and he makes promises he doesn't keep. He ultimately comes up against the Sunday family, whose land he buys, but one of the sons is a preacher, Eli (Dano), and the two come into conflict immediately.There's not much plot here; it's the story of a morally bankrupt man who becomes more and more morally bankrupt and richer as time goes on, more of a drunk, and more isolated. He abandons H.W. after he goes deaf as the result of an accident, but he's shamed into retrieving him by Eli making him confess his sins in church before he's baptized - the price Plainview has to pay in order to get the Bandy land, the last holdout.The film is propelled by the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, the young gay lad of My Beautiful Laundrette, the star of My Left Foot, Lincoln, the hunk in Last of the Mohicans - the man's range is unbelievable. He gives a terrifying performance. Like his performance did in Gangs of New York, Day-Lewis scared the hell out of me as this volatile man who would just as soon kill you as talk to you. It's searing, it's gut-wrenching and ultimately devastating.Without an actor of his caliber, I can't see this film being successful - it's too long, for one thing, and there's just not that much story. Paul Dano is very good. I've read that some felt he wasn't dynamic or charismatic enough as the preacher, but I think the point was to be very different from Plainview in personality.All in all, worth it for Daniel Day-Lewis, as are most films in which he appears.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Overrated Praise From Critics,"Lewis hams it up in his Oscar winning role as Daniel Plainview. His performance is truly phenomenal. But unfortunately, this is all TWBB has going for it. There is simply not a rich enough storyline to justify the film's close to 3 hour running time. Plainview comes across as a boorish, manipulative hustler in the first 2/3rds of the film. Not until the film's final act does Lewis get to go full throttle and act like an unpredictable sadistic madman. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's ""Oil"", the title of the film is misleading to say the least. I've seen more blood in the average Nip/Tuck episode. To the film's credit, the cinematography and set design are superb.Paul Dano plays twin brothers in the movie who befriend and cross Plainview. I did not know these were supposed to be two separate characters until I read an article about the film after I saw it. Paul Thomas Anderson is hardly the cinematic auteur critics would have you believe. On the plus side, this is clearly PTA's most accomplished work thus far. At least he didn't try ripping off Scorsese's GoodFellas (Boogie Nights) and Altman's Short Cuts (Magnolia) this time around.Long story short, There Will Be Blood shows PTA has grown slightly as a moviemaker and story teller. DDL confirms the notion he is one of the greatest actors of his generation. But that is where the praise begins and ends. TWBB is not the work of a gifted filmmaker, and is surely not one of the best movies of the year.As a side note, I fail to understand why the MPAA gave this an R classification. This film could very reasonably have been rated PG-13.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

There was blood. So what?,"Good production value: nice sets, costumes, atmosphere and acting. The story starts promising (if choppy) then suddenly unexplained violence begins and it all goes nowhere from there.
Since this is supposed to be a character-driven drama, the lack of complexity (or even credibility) of the main characters completely undermined this movie for me.
After seeing it and even sleeping on it, I can't figure out was this was about (and not in a good senses that it keeps me guessing). The film obviously wanted to make a strong statement, but it is really unclear what it was about: demonizing atheism (and while at it, evangelism as well) or was it supposed to be a verdict on alcoholism or sociopathy? Nothing fits and nothing inspires me to think deeper than guessing what target they missed.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

I'm excited to see what he does next. Paul Thomas Anderson never disappoints as well. I love every piece of film he's done. He's a very humble man and always makes the right decisions.

A Cinematic Masterpiece,"A film unlike any other in 2007.... Paul Thomas Anderson delivers a knockout punch with There Will Be Blood! The cinematography, writing, scripting, directing, scoring and acting blend the story of a lust for power into a cinematic masterpiece. Daniel Day Lewis has no rivals. He is the ultimate actor. The supporting cast proves they can hold the screen with DDL, even if he does steal every scene in which he appears. The beginning of the film offers such a different feel than most films shot today. It's quite refreshing. A film everyone should see, just to say they've seen it. Even if you end up hating it. (Seems the reviews are split on this one.)

"Avarice, ho","This film supersedes categorization. It overrides the fact that epics have been dead for the past 30 years or so (a fact which I continually lamented). Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of a lifetime as Daniel Plainview in this, Paul Thomas Anderson's claustrophobic masterpiece. Paul Dano capitalizes on the opportunity to show his raw talent as Eli Sunday. Daniel Plainview is a vicious oil magnate who won't hesitate to slit your throat if you bat an eyelash in a way he feels is offensive. Eli Sunday is an eager, deluded evangelical minister. These two titans will clash repeatedly on the screen until the bloody end, in which it feels as though they are playing a drawn out game of Russian roulette in which each is attempting to go in opposite directions yet they are on a furious collision course.Enough with the metaphors and analogies. When and if you go see this don't expect gallons of blood to flood the theater, as PTA uses what blood there is scrupulously, and to great effect. It is a great indictment of capitalism and evangelism and doesn't strain to show what they are as most films do. I won't vindicate you by going as far to rant about this being the best film ever as it is not a time-tested wonder like Lawrence of Arabia or Citizen Kane (not to say those are my favorite films, these just have appealed to the conventional sense of epics and are therefore comparable). I'm just saying this is an overall worthwhile and satisfying film, which can be very hard to find these days among the mindless soulless morass that is Hollywood film which never fails to produce a plethora of slashers, bad parody films and video game reminiscent action and almost always fails to deliver films like this, that may feel like a kick in the teeth (which can be a very good thing).The cinematography is damn near intoxicating, just a wondrously shot film, which might very well have brought a tear to my eyes if they hadn't been wide open for the duration of the film. The spectacle is as aesthetically pleasing as it is terrifying for the psyche.The soundtrack (kudos to Johnny Greenwood) is as close as it gets to overpowering without annoying me. Also I'd like to thank PTA for using Brahms' Violin Concerto (last movement I believe) at the end, wonderful selection.If there was one thing I pondered it was how PTA adapted this from Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"" as the two stories are so divergent that if I hadn't heard so previous to seeing the film I would have wondered if I had walked into the right theater. But thank you PTA, however much I loved the book, for changing so much about it as there was plenty making a straight book- to-film production of ""Oil!"" couldn't convey.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best films of the century,"There Will Be Blood is a challenging film. It's not hard to comprehend (meaning no much time jumps or stuff like that) but there's something about it that just keeps baffling. That ""something"" is probably the difficulty to realize how audacious this movie is. It's an uncompromising and ruthless image of an abominable man that doesn't embellish its subjects: capitalism, rapacity, greed, madness and revenge.In 1898, miner-businessman Daniel Plainview labors alone in his silver mine. While climbing out of the pit, the ladder breaks down, Plainview falls, breaks his leg and goes unconscious. When he wakes up, he shouts ""No!"". But not for pain, but because it slows him down, and doesn't let even a broken leg to stop him from delivering the silver nuggets to be evaluated. Silver is followed by oil, but it could be anything else as well, because Plainview only cares about money and beating others in the competition. He later travels to the town of Little Boston to look for oil with his adoptee H.W. Plainview. They are, however, challenged by preacher Eli Sunday, who sees Plainview's true intentions but whose objectives are similar to his.There Will Be Blood is unlike anything writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has done before. He became famous with his two films in the end of the 90's: Boogie Nights, a depiction of blue movie business in the 70's, and Magnolia, a drama about a quantity of people intersecting during two days. Where those films had large ensemble casts and enormous amount of characters, There Will Be Blood is a true one man's show. The movie is completely built upon the character of Daniel. He is the movie's absolute point of reference, first seen as a greedy, misanthropic bastard, a character impossible to sympathize with. But as the movie proceeds, new aspects of him are revealed. But that doesn't mean they'd be positive aspects. He is a discordant, colorful character.But the movie isn't just a story about him. There Will Be Blood is a very powerful and profound thesis about American greed and capitalism that still ravage the country and the other world today. Anderson contrasts two hunters of power: Daniel tries to justify his actions through common wealth, Eli through religion. Anderson's view of their duel is merciless: either one of them isn't better than the other one, even though Daniel's unscrupulousness is quite hard to transcend. Both men treacherously use other people for their own benefit, lie and make vows of bright future to people, while their only goal is money and power, with only means and requisites being different.Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a towering, ballsy, simply astounding and one of the best performances of the decade as Plainview. He embodies this travesty of a human being, becoming only more insane and crueler as the film proceeds. It's only in the end scene where he hops on the borders of overacting, and might even cross them, but it doesn't bother. Paul Dano is also superior as Eli, putting his babyish face and intensity in good use as this devious preacher. He's not as mind-boggling as Day- Lewis, but it's still a remarkable performance considering that he had only 4 days to prepare for the role. God knows how incredible he might have been if he had had more time. The technical section is also glorious: Robert Elswit's cinematography is flawless and very beautiful, and Jonny Greenwood's strong soundtrack creates a nightmarish and hypnotic atmosphere to the background.There Will Be Blood is a movie that requires multiple viewings to grow to its full measures, and once it does, it reveals to be a masterpiece. Like all of Anderson's previous work, the film requires concentration and patience but rewards the viewer massively. The film might be too heavy for some, since there's actually not a single happy moment, but to me, this is an unforgettable masterpiece that is going to stand the test of time and will be viewed over 50 from now. This Anderson's best film to date and an instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

there will be!,"***This review maybe contains a slight spoiler or two***Many films come, mark a certain era of one's life and become a nice memory. Some films come and enter inside a mind, become a milestones of life, you think about them, they provide you with some unknown insights. And then, there are a couple of film's in your life that come, blow you apart and change your life from it's root in a way that great art and everyday experiences can only provide. This is one such film. One such experience.On the most basic level, you will contemplate this movie on its artistic merit; its direction, its music (aaaaarghhhh, its gorgeous music!), its acting. Daniel Day Lewis, my god, what have you managed to achieve?! Although I hate to think in such terms, but his rendition of Daniel Plainview is the best acting ever captured on celluloid. Period.Many people will start there and remain on that point in their love or hate for this film. Although it is hard even to imagine, but many a viewer have found this film to fail even in those parameters.But, that is only a gateway into THIS. I don't know how else to call it. I have later described the impact film had on me as ""a religious experience"". What did I mean by that? Well, it's hard to describe, but it can be somewhat explained by this question; did you find the character of Daniel Plainview as ""good"" or ""bad""? When you reach the answer and it is negative, I can just say: WTF?! You're entitled to the opinion but we wan't be going for an afternoon coffee any time soon.But if you find him to be ""good"", if you realize his consuming love for his son, his pain after the ""incident"", his rock-hard morals, his uncompromising mind and his burning intellect, I can just say: welcome! It is now time for one more viewing, and now prepare for the hand of god (whatever it may be) to blow your mind away.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"it's good, but oddly unsatisfying","I have to say right away that the first half to two-thirds of this movie are totally, completely, and unquestionably mind blowing. The film combines eye scorching cinematography, fierce acting, dynamic, unpredictable characters, bold imagery, revolutionary music, and an overall style and pacing that grant the movie a sort of tension and realism that are absolutely palpable.What I really liked is that for most of the film the story if of such epic proportions that it seems as if no actors could contain it. However, Daniel Day-Lewis internalizes his role to such an extent that the huge scope of the story is almost a reflection of his character's (and humanity's) dark complexities. He and Paul Dano give electrifying performances, and Day- Lewis's Oscar will be well deserved indeed. The film pulsates with its own evil, manic energy and boldness, thanks in large part to Johnny Greenwood's revolutionary score. Calling it music wouldn't be very accurate. Instead, I think of it as primal noises and tones, signifying Daniel Plainview's primal urges of greed and power. For the most part, this is a stunning work of cinema.During the majority of the film all the good elements of the film I listed above are firing on all cylinders. In one of my bigger film disappointments of the year, in the latter 40 minutes to an hour of the film, these components fall puzzlingly out of place. The story all of a sudden contracts into a psychodrama, standing in stark contrast the the two hours of allegorical oil drilling and evangelizing that preceded it. After this point most of the film takes place inside, depriving viewers of the beautiful cinematography they had been treated to. Paul Dano, the yin to Day-Lewis's yang, leaves the picture for a while, depriving the viewer of their delicious (and frightening) rivalry. The music gets less edgy and more conventional, eventually sounding like something you've heard before. And, most puzzlingly, while all these things are being scaled down, Daniel Day-Lewis's performance gets more and more over the top, eventually bordering on dark comedy. This is fine, I suppose, but I feel that in the context of the rest of the movie it just doesn't work at all.In a way, There Will Be Blood is a lot like oil itself. It starts off with the joy and energy of discovery, and makes the viewers very happy, just as it makes Plainview and others like him very rich. However, just like oil, ever so slowly it dries up.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Without doubt the greatest film of the mid-2000's,"After amazing films such as ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""The Master"", PT Anderson is probably the greatest living director today, this masterpiece of a movie justifies that title.The story revolves around a prospector, named Daniel Plainview (Day- Lewis) which is looking to make a fortune out of oil in the early twentieth century. No spoilers, he finds an oil-ore and becomes a very wealthy man. The only obstacle to ensure an even bigger paycheck is a small Californian town which welcomes him with open arms when he promises daily bread on their tables, new roads and a school. In order for Daniel to fulfill their needs, he wants unlimited access to their undiscovered petroleum-resources. Very early on we get to see Daniel's greed, deceit and lies slowly distorting the man's moral compass, which also affects his adopted son H.W during the story.This is undoubtedly the greatest acting ever on screen, it's surreal to see Day-Lewis being Plainview. The last 45 minutes is pure acting-gold. I was shocked and scared during the ""I drink your milkshake""-scene at the end, such a sinister performance. Paul Dano does also a remarkable and underrated performance as the overly religious twins Paul, and Daniel's nemesis Eli Sunday. The church-scenes are mesmerizing and full of energy, great actor! Honorable mention is Dylan Frasier as H.W, a talented young actor I'm certain we'll see more of in the future.Robert Elswit won a very well-deserved Oscar for his cinematography. It's stunningly beautiful, which is quite ironic for a movie which is so evil and sinister. This combined with Anderson's amazing direction and subliminal messages just hits home-run.""There Will Be Blood"" is an unique film. It shows how greed can affect a person and the people closest to them. Anderson knows his craft, and clearly shows it. Day-Lewis is a monster of an actor and offers his best role to date, no, I'll go as far as saying this is the best acting displayed in any movie to date next to Heath Ledger's Joker. See this film, it's a must-see for people who loves the art of cinema. Hurry up with ""Inherent Vice"", Anderson..-MB",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perhaps the best American film of the 21st century,"If I could resume this flick in one phrase it would be: ""This film is a flawless masterpiece about a ruthless entrepreneur who suffers from severe mental problems of an unspecified nature (he is, basically, a sociopath).""The main character, Daniel Plainview, is the most powerful film character of the 21st century, given all the 21st century films that I have ever seem as of October 2012. He is aggressive, terrifying but at the same time, psychologically very weak: he has a very delicate mental balance as little things can really put him off balance and make him announce death threats to anyone in the room.The film is not only about sociopathy, however, it is also about entrepreneurship, in both the oil and church sectors of ""the economy"". Daniel's archenemy in the film, Eli Sunday, is also another entrepreneur who is nearly as aggressive as our protagonist and he would be the most powerful character of any lesser film, but here, Eli is almost an ant next to Daniel Plainview.Overall, a film to those that like powerful dramas, but those weak of heart should stay away from this monstrous film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film that will endure the test of time?,"I think so - he said, answering his own question.This seems to be one of the most polemic review sections I've encountered. I just had to drop in...Apparently that's because we expect different things from a film, like:How should the characters be constructed? What propels them and to what end?When do we pick up the main characters and where should we leave them?How is time suggested in each scene, each shot. Why does this even matter to the ""filmic experience""?What is the function of the soundtrack and the relevance of the ""extra diegetic"" sound?Etc,etc...I don't expect us to agree on ""what is cinema"" and ""what cinema is"" (and it's purpouse) nor would I like to go the academic road here, but some of these reviews seem to be frivolously addressed to the shallowest of depths... and it saddens me to read how easily people praise or dismiss films, purely on actor performance, character motivation, good/bad-world... above all, it seems to not make justice to the wholeness I believe was achieved with this particular work.In my opinion this is a solid unity of cinematic form and content, strongly binded by some ""creative choices"" that, being far from industry standard (hence most of the visceral reactions, from both sides), are used here for more than just wow or wtf factors.These choices, when successfully combined, are the magical glue that converts mere entertainment items (technically ""perfect"" by all dogmas)... into something else, that goes both deeper and beyond.Bottom line? I truly believe this to be a very bold film (a rare Hollywood bastard) that will surely continue to be a powerful transforming experience for cinephiles of decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The first 10/10 I gave out in almost 4 years,"This isn't exactly cover story news, but that is FOUR years, mind you. And I've seen over 1,000 movies for the first time since then. There just never had been a film since then that fully captivated me and which at the same time I deemed competently made and complex enough.Now this glorious movie was a rewatch and I had it rated 9/10 after I saw it the first time at the theater early in 2008. It's a film that can't complain about a lack of praise, neither from film critics, nor from IMDbers. The film in question is, of course, There Will Be Blood.It gripped me from the first minute and didn't loosen its grip until the end. Much of it can be contributed to the score, that gives the scenes an odour of urgency. The pacing, the tone, the composition of the film is just so right, it never hits a wrong note. There's not a scene that makes you think: ""What was that good for?"" or ""That seemed kinda off.""It is the source of one of cinemas great characters and much of D.P.'s lines are so memorable that I could quote them after my first viewing. Unlike most films it never seemed to be in a hurry. You won't find something like a hasty camera sway to capture something unexpected or to catch up with an actor. There isn't a moment that feels like some random idea that the director came up with an hour before and that he thought would sort of fit at that place in the movie.Now the visuals... What else could be said about the images other than that they are beautiful to look at? Well, just take this shot, for example. - http://i593.photobucket.com/albums/tt13/PedeAmb/ThereWillBeBlood.jpg - The sequence starts with the camera zoomed in on Daniel Plainview's back. The camera slowly pans out to reveal the huge, burning oil fountain. Daniel raises his arms to signal somebody. Now from both sides men pulling carriages filled with dynamite enter the frame. As all necessary components are inside the frame the camera stops panning out (see picture). The men park the carriages in the flame, and the dynamite blows up five seconds later, while the men get away from the fountain and out of the picture as fast as they can. The flame expires right on time. And all of this happens to be set in front of an awe-inspiring bright blue sky filled with majestic clouds. How much planning and testing must have went into that?One reason why it is very relevant for a film to be one piece made out of many different well-conducted pieces (from cinematography to set decoration to acting...) is that it let's you lose yourself in the movie, which enhances the emotional impact. There is another reason why the whole package is important, and why just one individual aspect that holds your interest in a film isn't quite enough. If you feel like everything is done right, you will feel like you are in good hands. It's when you feel that you are in good hands that you have complete confidence in the filmmaker and his vision. You roll with the movie all the way, no matter how outlandish or puzzling the movie might become. You are there, because you have the confidence that the guy who brought it to be knew what he did. As I watched There Will Be Blood I was confident that Paul Thomas Anderson knew what he did.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Can you say AWESOME,"This was a genius film. Much better movie than NO COUNTRY. This should have won best picture. Ironically filmed in same parts of Texas as NO COUNTRY. Daniel Day Lewis gave an awesome performance as Mr. Daniel Plainview.. Early 1900s oilman. His interaction with Paul Dano who played identical twins was spectacular. Basically Mr. Plainview met his match in unassuming but sanctimonious Reverend Eli Sunday. Mr. Plainview did whatever he could , used whomever he could to get ahead. Murder, mayhem, he was a ruthless oilman, a conman to be sure. This movie was a chess match between the 2.Mr. Sunday was not exactly as pure as he portrayed himself to his congregation. One scene in particular that took place in the church is perhaps one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The closest character that came to mind to compare to Mr. Plainview was Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko . Both , ironically , won academy awards , well deserved for their roles. This movie comes to an unexpected last scene that just adds to this fantastic entertainment. Rarely do I see movies that are about 2 and half hrs that you do not want to end. This movie is one of those . You have to be at optimum alertness at all times. This is a pure intellectual film that is well written, well scripted and well acted by all. Do not miss a second of this film that will have one twist after another.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film for anyone who knows a good film when they see one.,"There Will Be Blood is a movie for anyone who enjoys amazing cinematography, and can relate to a man who dislikes everyone's company. I mean this is in the best possible way of course. Paul Thomas Anderson created a masterpiece of a film set in California in the early 1800s. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. The wonderful California background and breathtaking scenes (like an oil rig being in flames right at sunset) make this film project images you will never forget.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays his part perfectly. He is an oil man  who worked hard his whole life trying to become rich. One day he is mining alone in the middle of nowhere and his ladder breaks leaving him crippled and alone. This didn't stop him from grabbing some silver he was lucky enough to find and crawling probably miles for help. He will do whatever it takes to make enough money so he can get away from people. That's his goal in life, to become alone. This dark man isn't the normal hero you find in a movie and it makes it very different and hard to recommend to most people. For those who can appreciate a good film, this is a must see. If you are a practicing Christian and sensitive about anti-religion films, then you might be better off passing this one by.  As for me, I am an atheist who loves different and wonderfully made films and this is the best one I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"The most awe inspiring, thought provoking film I've ever seen","What is the defining aspect of P.W. Anderson's There Will Be Blood that kept me so captivated throughout its running time that fell just under three hours? I think it's probably a good many things. There's the beautiful, Oscar winning cinematography, there's the driving message of greed and corruption in society, there's the Kubrickian styled direction, and of course there's some of the best acting performances of the year, but only one stands out to draw me into this film. The character of Daniel Plainview (Oscar winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis) is perhaps the most complex character ever captured on film and is one with whom I found myself strangely attracted to, for I saw something about his character worth pitying.Daniel Plainview is a cut throat business man during the industrial revolution (an ""Oil man,"" he calls himself) who uses a persuasive speaking voice and enticing promises, but at the end of the day he only is wishing to fulfill his everlasting greed. Eventually he is lead by the tip of one Paul Sunday who tells him of oil in a far off location known as Little Boston. Plainview takes the bait and moves in and realizes that this could be his big haul that makes his fortune, but in the process he meets his greatest adversary. Eli Sunday (a very underrated performance by Paul Dano) owns and operates his own church (The Church of the Third Revelation) where he claims to act as a prophet and the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. Naturally the two of them clash as the audience realizes they are both driven by mostly selfish desires.As Daniel's fortune increases his hatred towards himself and mankind expands, and he realizes that all he wishes is to be far from it, but it is apparent he has become incapable of being happy. His son, H.W. Plainview seemed to be his only way to happiness, but Daniel in his denial just push H.W. and everyone around him far to the side, preferring to suffer miserably by himself until he completes his long drawn out self-destruction.This is why I pity Daniel Plainview when others say he is a character that deserves our loathing. What they are failing to grasp is the inner struggle taking place in this man and how very confused he must be, because they only seem to note the negative things he does in the film. Daniel Plainview is a man who has let the natural desire to compete absorbs him and he has given up the fight to suppress it.Is Daniel Plainview a man, or is he the representation of a spirit that is found throughout mankind? Each time I see this movie the impact increases. Every single time I watch this two-hour forty-minute film I find more reasons to be in love with it. Each time I find more ways that Daniel Plainview can be related to the human race as a whole.""I don't want to talk about those things. I see the worst in people, Henry. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little. Having you here gives me a second breath I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people. {Daniel laughs as if his final comment were a joke}"" ""I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."" I think everyone occasionally has thoughts such as those stated in the above quotes. We just don't act on them in the manner in which Plainview does. The problem with Daniel is that he never lets go of the feelings and lets them push him forward rather than think to the back of his mind.This movie deserved Best Picture and Director for 2007 because of the fact that I have never seen a more stunning, magnificent illustration of human greed and corruption. There Will Be Blood is a movie that will be seen twenty-years from now and like Apocalypse Now people will believe that the Academy made the wrong choice in regards to choosing their Best Picture winner (like anyone REALLY cares what the Academy has to say now of days). I think everyone will need to see this film at some point or another or they will have missed one of the most important films of the 21st century, and that is just a fact, plain and simple.Just you watch. Ten years from now this film will be taught in film classes and Daniel Day-Lewis' performance shall undoubtedly be used as a subject of study in drama classes for aspiring actors and actresses.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A modern fable of greed that is both gorgeous and terrifying...,"Paul Thomas Anderson had proved himself a masterful filmmaker with titles such as ""Boogie Nights"" and of course ""Magnolia,"" and the wonderful, surreal comedic Adam Sandler outfit ""Punch-Drunk Love."" All of these tales involved broken people who we were able to care for. And then comes ""There Will Be Blood,"" a film about broken people who we do not care for, but learn to hate strongly. Anderson does not go out of his way to make this film intricately plotted, but instead simply focuses on two influential forces in America, forces that have been with us since the countries founding: Ruthless business and greedy religion. The primary focus is on Daniel Plainview, a man whose voice flows like molasses. He is the single most deplorable character in film since Scarface, and he's even less forgiving. He adopts a child in the name of having an heir to his business, only to later abandon him. He is the man who looks at people and sees ""nothing worth liking"" as he himself embodies the very greed that is wrong with mankind. And then there is Eli Sunday, the young preacher played by Paul Dano in a breakout role. He cares less for ministry as he does for himself. Any true man of faith (myself included) should see past the mask that this false prophet puts on and realize that the church he builds is for his greedy goals and monetary gain, putting him pretty much on the same level of Plainview in nastiness. The pressure builds and builds, and at the end the viewer is left breathless. So sit and watch this, set aside an afternoon to turn it over in your mind, and brace yourself, for there will, indeed, be blood.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Film making perfection.,"Having viewed There Will Be Blood for the second time last night I am still reeling in the wake of its perfection. Paul Thomas Anderson takes his direction to a new level, filming on a larger scale than he ever has, and doing so with the creativity and conviction that will ensure his place as one of the finest film makers of this generation. Every shot is stunning in its composition, framing, and lighting, serving the complexity and multi layered nature of the story.Despite Anderson's seminal direction and cinematography the film is owned completely by the performance of Daniel Day Lewis. He provides a towering character study of a man driven only by a sense of greed and competition. Many a story has centered around the destructive nature of greed but no actor has captured it with quite as much passion and intensity.By its conclusion, his Daniel Plainview is a shallow, souless man, destroyed by his own unwavering quest for wealth. Day Lewis is in almost every scene and is utterly commanding whenever on screen. His complete transformation and exploration of the Plainview psyche is on par with that of De Niro in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, Pacino in the Godfather, or any one of Brando's best performances. The performance is easily the best of the decade if not one of the best in film history.Dano is worthy support as Eli Sunday, and the mere fact that his character can share the screen with Day Lewis is a testament both to the writing and to his performance. Johnny Greenwood's score is is the perfect counterpoint to the film, bordering at times on creepy, its edgy, off kilter sound enhances Plainview's descent into madness. This is an emotionally draining, yet completely stunning masterpiece, and an exercise in film making perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""When ambition meets faith""","A story about family, greed, religion, and oil, centered around a turn- of-the-century prospector in the early days of the business.Impressed with PTA's work with the mesmerizing Punch Drunk Love, I checked out his other work. Mongolia, Boogie Nights. They all seemed good, but nothing that suits my interests. But what intrigued me the most was There Will Be Blood. I've increasingly become a fan of modern westerns with the work of the Cohen brothers. They are genius. No Country For Old Men and True Grit were all very great, and they all contained heart + soul. But something about TWBB was different that made me have to go see it...Expectations were moderate, they exceeded like no other has. TWBB can be passed as a western, but contains so much more than you know. First of all, the STORY contains it all. Speaking figuratively, there is no story. It moves along precisely and easily, with giving us story easily but also giving us much more than we asked for. It's easy to follow, needs no complex plot twists, and gives us the perfect ending that makes this film a classic.. The acting was top-notch. Daniel Day Lewis isn't the most known actor today and frankly, he's not the person I hear everyday. But his performance was so disturbing, so perfect, that your going to get chills down your spine. He perfects his character like no actor was portrayed. He was the perfect Daniel Plainview.. The haunting feel of the film was perfectly chilling. While most people complain about the soundtrack (PTA really loves loud soundtracks) I, for one, loved it. It fit the film in a strange way, and it kept me at the edge of my seat. But it also did one other thing: set the mood. The movie isn't like any ""western"" (if you even want to call it that) you've seen before. It was disturbing, haunting, and might I say beautiful. Everything was done so brilliantly, I cannot explain how much I loved it. The characters were portrayed wonderfully, and you can feel their emotions and needs. The acting, which ties in with the characterization, was perfectly done. Everybody gave it their best, and their best was all we need. The soundtrack and the atmosphere gave this film a perfect bleakness that you aren't going to find out what's next. If you love clever, brilliant, and haunting stories; this will suit you. There Will Be Blood was a masterpiece. I could say it was one of my favorite films. It was wondrous, beautiful, haunting. It will stay with you for days, and you won't be able to stop thinking about it until you see it a few more times. I'm finished.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Well worthy of the hype,"I really enjoyed this movie. The three most valuable aspects of the movie are the music, acting, and story. I am a big fan of Jonny Greenwood and I've read a lot of complaints about the soundtrack to this movie. You shouldn't review a film if your idea of a good movie is Wall-E and you shouldn't open your mouth about music if your idea of good music is 50 Cent. I own the soundtrack to the film and I occasionally listen to it while studying or on the train. There are two or three songs that only belong in a movie, but the rest are excellent and all are fitting for a soundtrack to such an eerie and violent film. I honestly put the soundtrack in the ranks of ""Amelie"". As for the acting, Daniel and Henry Plainview were well played. HW Plainview and Eli Sunday weren't truly very convincing, but it wasn't devastating to the film. I truly felt the need to review this movie because I read reviews by so many people who didn't understand the story or thought the movie had no plot. Of course, like any good movie there isn't a linear plot built as predictably as a tunnel with a light at the end. I think many people didn't like the end because it was unsettling to their worldview. I think the director, whoever he is, was trying to give an accurate portrayal. Perhaps it is because I am an environmentalists but the character of Daniel Plainview is still alive and kicking. I liked the theme or religion throughout because it demonstrates how people will allow others to take advantage of them because their focus is on divinity and eternal life. Daniel Plainview is the man on top. He is easy to hate for no reason, but this movie gives plenty of reasons to hate him. The movie is an accurate representation of the aggregation of power and the path to success, especially in the business of oil.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Like watching plate tectonics,"Maybe we have exhausted the possibilities of a particular kind of film-making. Maybe there is only so much you can tell when you forgo explanation, when every motive is ambiguous, when events unfold with the unpredictability and unknowability of life itself. Maybe there is a limit to what you can show without telling. Or maybe, ""There Will Be Blood"" just failed at showing what it needed to tell.The first part of the film shows a tough, bitter oil man seeking his fortune in an isolated backwater town. It is suggested that he exploits his son and the community in his quest for oil, but we also see him care for his son and the community appears to prosper.Prone to drink and a violent temper, he commits a few atrocious acts and then the movie jumps forward a number of years to show that he has become a monster. Then the film ends.In between there is really no tension or dramatic conflict. While the main character is played evocatively, I couldn't tell you what his significance is, either historically, as a moral example, or for the surrounding cast. He is presented as a force of nature, without comment or context.Which makes this film like watching plate tectonics. For a long time nothing happens, then something erupts, then nothing happens. The causes remain hidden deep underground. It might make for oil, but doesn't make good film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance of his career.,"My Rating : 9/10Paul Thomas Anderson took the first few pages from Upton Sinclair's novel Oil! and ran with them taking creative freedom to bring us this modern day classic. Oil! is more focused on the political and socioeconomic side of the oil boom that occurred in California during the early 1900's and the class warfare that was being waged, whereas Anderson's screenplay is focused on a story of a man, his son, and their relationship which makes for better cinema than the original source material. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance of his career (obviously in my humble opinion) as Daniel Plainview: a wealthy independent oil man, who battles with the big oil conglomerates along with a vengeful Evangelical Eli Sunday (played fantastically by Paul Dano) all the while trying to do right for himself and his son. Anderson delivers a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word and it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but it was beat out by No Country for Old Men. Though No Country is a great film it is nowhere near the level of There Will Be Blood.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

He's still got it,"Has Anderson made a single bad film? This is the third picture of his that I watch(the other two being Boogie Nights and Magnolia), and he has yet to let me down. He continues to reject commercialism and the mainstream approach, and now brings us a story set during the oil boom in California, with a clash between greed and religion. The long takes and ambiguity is still present in his work, and he certainly isn't holding back on his vision, either; at no point in this does he shy away from the ills of the period. There is a tremendous level of detail to the depiction of the drilling, the machines, etc. This is immensely realistic, and partially because of that, it can be rather unpleasant at times. The plot is interesting from start to finish, and this has good pacing. Every role is well-cast, and the acting is flawless; they all disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. If I hadn't known it was Daniel Day-Lewis, I would not have been able to tell from my viewing. The editing and cinematography are excellent. This is astonishingly well-shot. The music is mostly classical pieces, and it fits beautifully. There is some brutal violence, a bit of disturbing content, and very brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD holds a well-done fifteen minute featurette of sorts, or, in its own words, ""pics, research, etc."". I recommend this to anyone who is not dissuaded by anything I have written in this review. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Incredible,Daniel Plainview is one of the best characters ever created. DDL took 3 years to create this masterpiece of a character,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An amazing film from Paul Thomas Anderson.,"In the early 20th century, an ambitious man by the name of Daniel Plainview (Oscar-Winner:Daniel Day-Lewis) discovered Oil in the desert of Texas. Soon enough, he find himself to be an modest rich man. After the death of an worker on the job. Daniel decides to raise the man's son to be as his own. Years has passed... Daniel has truly become successful at finding Oil and his adapted son grown up & his name is H.W. Plainview (Dillion Freasier). When an mysterious young man by the name of Paul Sunday (Paul Dano). He goes to Daniel to tell him, there's Oil in his father's farm. He tells him, he could make millions on his father's land. Daniel, H.W. and his assistant Fletcher (Ciaran Hinds) goes to Sunday's farm to find Oil. Which they do sooner enough but Daniel meets his match, when Paul's twin brother named Eli (Also played by Dano). Who's just as ambitious as Daniel but for different reasons. Eli wants to build an Church and he thinks, he's great preacher. But Daniel's life slowly changed... when his adapted son turns deaf, Eli becomes greedy by asking Daniel money and Daniel's mysterious half-brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor) shows up. Daniel's life turns darker and darker and oh yes, there will be blood.Written and Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Hard Eight, Magnolia) made an absorbing drama that manages to have an dark sense of comedy at times. Day-Lewis is excellent as the smart Oil dealer tycoon, who may be way over his head at times but he's an deeply flawed man. Which Day-Lewis own an Oscar for his memorable performance. The supporting cast are first-rate, especially young Freasier and Dano. But some viewers might be turned-off by Dano's tole as a young, slightly crazed preacher. Cinematographer Robert Elswit (Return of the Living Dead Part 2, Tomorrow Never Dies, Punch-Drunk Love) won an Oscar for his beautiful cinematography.The two-disc Collector's Set of ""There Will Be Blood"" is somewhat disappointing. No audio commentary by the writer/director:P.T. Anderson (Although there's rumour, he stopped doing audio commentaries after his enjoyable infamous comments on ""Boogie Nights"" or no behind the scenes footage. But the bonus disc on the special features are decent enough. DVD has an featurette made sometime in the 1920's titled ""The Story of Petroleum"" with music by the film's composer Jonny Greenwood (Member of the band ""Radiohead'). DVD also includes moments that inspires the film by using old photographs of the 1920's with photos of Anderson's movie, deleted scene titled ""Fishing"", dailies outtakes and trailers. Deleted Scene ""Fishing"" is a good scene but it is easy why Director Anderson deleted it, because there's no place in the picture. Disc one has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.""There Will Be Blood"" is certainly one of the best movies of 2007. It may be not for everyone, some viewers might find it too slow. But i think, Anderson's film is fast-paced and fascinating. I wasn't sure what to make out of it at first but i did liked it. But after watching it in the second viewing, i loved it even more. At times, it seems that writer/director Anderson was paying tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick and the late Robert Altman & especially the music that sounds eerily enough to Kubrick's picture ""The Shining"". If you haven't seen this, don't miss it. Panavision. (**** 1/2 out of *****).",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An epic movie by PTA for DDL!,"A stark parable of American Capitalism! Daniel Day-Lewis is perfect in the portrayal of Daniel Plainview, an oilman and a very complex character. The movie shows us how a man that strives on his ruthlessness of greed and corruption can also destroy himself.A masterpiece by P.T.Anderson for Daniel Day-Lewis! This is another example of why Daniel Day-Lewis gets so good characters. And he seems to be refusing roles which do not have at least one freak-out scene. And he's at his best in such scenes (The final 'I Drink Your Milkshake' scene in this movie alongwith a few others like the one with Pastor Eli).The music, cinematography, direction and acting in this film make for an epic experience. A few scenes are so breathtakingly beautiful that they leave an ever-lasting impression! Must Watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Blood"" nothing short of a masterpiece","There is a certain amount of dread surrounding the release of ""There Will Be Blood,"" Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"" I anticipated disappointment in thinking Anderson's film would be yet another imitator of ""Citizen Kane."" After all, the story of Daniel Plainview plays out in the same epic fashion as that of Charles Foster Kane.Fortunately, Anderson is wise enough to understand that this is not and does not need simply to be a ""Kane"" clone. Instead, ""Blood"" is a deeply devoted and emotionally engaging telling of one man's quest to reach the top of his field.Daniel Day-Lewis gives what can only be described as the best performance of the decade thus far as Plainview. Day-Lewis's Plainview is a master of coercion and social understanding, but these traits go from strong to weak as the film progresses.Equally as interesting is Eli Sunday, brought to life by ""Little Miss Sunshine"" star Paul Dano. The brilliance of Dano's performance comes from the overzealous and almost comedic nature of Eli's ambitions for his faith and church.Eli's larger-than-life personality to the rural people of his small town puzzled Plainview, who wonders how these men and women could be so idiotic in accepting Eli's principles.In this questioning lies the essence of Day-Lewis' character, a hungry oil tycoon in the making who is as much of an enigma as the members of Eli's church. By the film's end, one could view all of Plainview's actions, which include murder, bribery and theft, as being the products not of selfishness, but, as Plainview explains, of a hatred for the simplicity of the people around him.Just as grand as Plainview's desires is the scope of the picture itself. Anderson vividly brings to life early 1900s America in a desolate, distraught matter that is not easily achieved.Robert Elswit's cinematography is breathtaking, perfectly capturing the vastness of the then-undeveloped California land with the grand scope of the open fields that hold the promise of oil.In terms of score, Johnny Greenwood's composition for the film is revolutionary. Not very often do audiences see such a dynamic flow of music combined with notes that set off a sense of urgency even in the weaker moments of ""Blood."" It should be noted that the film's less powerful segments are few and far between and are mostly produced in the first half when viewers see Plainview simply toy with his violent nature.Still, this film has such a grand ambition to it that its ultimate goal almost seems to override every other aspect of the film, except for Day-Lewis' performance. The greatest achievement of ""Blood"" is in shooting for the highest sense of dramatic purpose imaginable, and on many levels, it achieves its hopes.The end result is nothing short of an American masterpiece and a film that I feel safe in saying will only become more respected as time goes on. ""There Will Be Blood"" returns the epic film genre to its most basic, yet effective, roots and succeeds in grabbing our attention time and time again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Drilling in Human Hearts and Oil Fields,"Oil derricks in flames, ruthless and vicious human beings and spilled blood combine in the California oil fields of a hundred years ago. Daniel Plainfield, a self-made and hard-driving oil baron, and Eli Sunday, an unscrupulous and manipulative preacher, confront and antagonize each other over the course of decades. Both are unstable and hollow souls who expect and bring out the worst in others. Greed and avarice causes them to drill into human hearts as much as the vast oil fields in which they toil. Plainfield and Sunday clash in surprising and brutal ways until one of them discovers the limits to how deep a drill can go.Upton Sinclair, the author of the story on which this film is based, is likely turning in his grave in the realization that things have gone downhill since his time. 100 years ago when someone was accidentally clocked by a drill rig, Plainfield could dump the body in a tar pit and be done with them. These days Plainfield could strike again and not even need the cover of night to get rid of the body, just a Twitter account.The film is exquisite, impressive and ornate on many levels, especially the acting and cinematography. It racked up two Oscar wins for Daniel Day-Lewis' acting and for the cinematography, and it was nominated for six more. Daniel Day-Lewis is at his wicked best in portraying Plainfield. The cinematography is amazing for its startling beauty, composition and colors, oil derricks bursting into flames in the night for example, as well as the intriguing way it frames the characters. The photography tells an enthralling story beyond words and sound. The period clothing and elaborate sets are fascinating to behold. Such attention to detail makes even scenes of business negotiations appear alluring. The film is long, but because it is so good you don't notice the passage of time. An eerie yet intriguing soundtrack goes hand in hand with the disturbing characters, heartless actions and frequent severe beatings.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Draaaiiiiiiiinage boy!""","A film that hits you like a fever, ""There Will Be Blood"" is not the kind of movie that someone will have the pleasure of watching or reviewing. It is a portrait of several layers of everything that comes with the desire for power, will leave the audience feeling exhausted and with a bitter taste in the mouth.Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film is submitted safely and confidently. Anderson proves to be one of the best director of all time, a fact that is evident here. Packed with shots and scenes of breathtaking intensity of boiling, the film makes no apologies about his tendency toward grandiosity inherent in telling an epic story that spans decades.Perhaps the first thing that will strike viewers will use the images as dark and gloomy, almost impossible to see. We watched the movie as we were covered in oil. Batway, oil is simply the central theme of the film.The story begins with the oil tycoon Daniel Plainview, he is a very intelligent man and cruel that does whatever it takes to achieve your goals. He works hard, but he also takes advantage of the people around at your expense, if necessary. His business partner is his son H.W, that he actually ""acquired"" when the H.W biological father, who worked on one of the platforms of Daniel, was killed in an accident at work. Daniel is deeply protective of H.W, but only for that H.W brings to the society, a serene and innocent face. When both know Eli Sunday saying the land of his father has oil everywhere, making an offer to Daniel to buy the property from his father. Eli is the local preacher and a healer ""self-proclaimed"" wants the money from the sale of the property to finance his own church.The lives of both characters change completely when Daniel decides to buy all the land outside the property of the father of Eli and tries to acquire all the land around, at bargain basement prices to be able to build an oil industry. And always with H.W at your side to strengthen the business.The setting of the film can be impressive, every minute that passes we see it bigger and bigger. And with it the ominous and annoying soundtrack that fits in every scene, leaving them more disturbing. When music raises the pitch dark, pessimistic and emotionally draining film, without ever taking center stage away from the performances, with characters that prove to be the soul of the story.Daniel Day Lewis proves to be one of the best actors of this generation, this film, in my opinion, gives his best performance to date. Daniel Plainview (Lewis) can be cruel, sinister and pessimistic at every passing second, but at the same time can show a little ray of goodness in his evil look; Paul Dano in a fantastic and disturbing performance, Eli Sunday (Dano) is the Movie's religion, amidst all the disturbance and sinister he is the sort of God to want to expel the devil, the devil being Daniel, out of paradise. But throughout the film it all fits.The film is a character study of a man who usually do not want to know and you will not be able to forget after all is said and done. After watching it you will not want to reveal it soon, but it will be for all the right reasons, Paul Thomas does all this perturbation on purpose. ""There Will be Blood"" is a powerful and emotionally draining experience, the experience of one of the best MASTERPIECES ever made!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Final section of the film damages what is other wise a great film,"Story of Daniel Plainview a silver miner who switches to oil. The film charts the course of Plainview's life over 30 years as his fortunes rise and he descends into madness.Going into the film I was carrying a great deal of baggage. The promise of a truly great film is tough thing to have to live up to. Hailed by many as a classic film on par with many of the cinema's greatest offerings I'm left to wonder if its all hyperbole since the film has barely been on view to the public for roughly a months time and true classics are created in the long term not the short. It will be for time to tell us if the film that has been fashioned here is the masterpiece or an also ran.For me the film is very good, but I found it considerably less than the ""one of the greatest films"" that the film has been handed by some critics. To be certain the film is excellent on almost every level technically. It is sterling achievement of the film maker's art. The problem for me is that the film falls apart in the final stretch and collapses into simplicity in the final scene. Its rather hard to discuss this with out going into detail, something that may or may not ruin things if you haven't seen the film. Since I don't want to spoil anything I'm going to choose not to discuss things other then to say the denouncement did not work for me and in a way renders most of what happens prior less than it seemed.I do think that the film is worth seeing. I just think it's not the be all and end all or recent American cinema.8.5 to 1927, considerably less after that. 6.5 over all",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

So very Plain,"This is possibly the single worst movie I have ever seen. I'm actually surprised that a sign didn't flash up before the credits saying ""HAHA, jokes on you, we just wasted 3 hours of your life, and you paid money to do it! This movie was the result of some over idealistic, closet protester deciding to make a movie about the status quo the world has seen over the past 150 years. Despite the wars, disasters and change, one thing has remained the same: Religion and oil rape the poor, protect the rich, and occasionally cross paths resulting in disastrous consequences (cough, IRAQ WAR!!!, cough). That is pretty much the core message of this movie.My suggestion to the writers of trash like this would be: Balls up, get some gumption about you, and actually write a movie about the message you are trying to get across. Don't pussyfoot around issues by making crap like this.On another note, despite the appalling script and shocking storyline, the acting was superb.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Near Perfect,"As close to perfection as one can possibly imagine. This film is simply stunning — an incredible artistic achievement, which is shocking, thrilling and totally absorbing.Daniel Day Lewis gives a brooding, mesmerizing performance as the deranged prospector who rises from near broke to major oil baron through sheer force of will. He is not alone, however, in making the acting exciting, believable, intelligent and highly watchable — nearly every spoken line, gesture, look or presence in this work is thoughtful and bold — he just happens to give one of the best screen performances ever in cinema.All other aspects of the film are of the very highest quality, from the music to the cinematography — they hardly matched in even the very best pictures made throughout the decades of cinema.The story evolves slowly, but surely and the situation becomes increasingly tense. The characters unravel, not because the plot demands it but because of their central weaknesses, while the central character, played by Daniel Day Lewis, remains steady, largely because he is already calm within his own insanity, until the terrifying finale.In short, one of the best films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Best Movie of the Decade,"I know, I know, many will disagree with me on my title, but I stand by it. In my humble opinion there was not a better made, acted, written, or scored movie from 00' to 09'. I was stunned when No Country for Old Men beat this movie as best picture. The movie is slow, but the story requires a pace of that nature. If Paul Thomas Anderson did not show the viewers the paintstakingly, slow, struggles it took for an independent oil man making his way in the blossoming world of ""big oil"" than this movie would have never worked. That, coupled with quite possibly one of the best acting performances of all-time by Daniel Day Lewis, and you have, again, the best movie of the decade. Lewis scored with this film not only because he nailed the determined, driven, and often-times, nasty character of Daniel Plainview, but in the scenes where there was no dialouge, his expressions, gestures, and physical acting took over. The score, by Jonny Greenwood (who was snubbed an Oscar nomination because of ridiculous Academy rules), works on every level in every scene. Without it, this movie may not have had half the emotion it did. P.T. Anderson is the best American director out there, I have LOVED every film of his, and may be biased as a result of my appreciation of his style. But regardless, if you have not seen this movie, give it a try, and definitely wait through the slow moving first hour or so, as it picks up pace, and eventually ends with knock-out punch that I did not anticipate.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Markets more than what it delivers,"Miramax proves they don't need the Weinsteins to market over-hyped, critic's darlings. We're talking about the studio that stole best picture Oscars in 1996 from Fargo and 1998 from Saving Private Ryan, and got nominations from movies that were okay but not great like Chocolat. I even think there were far better movies in 1999 than the Oscar winner, American Beauty, but you be the judge of that. This movie, if marketed normally, would've tanked in the box office. Here's how they do it: Show it to a handful of critics by year's end, who'll start the buzz and put it in top-ten lists. Premiere it in one or two art houses in New York and L.A., who are obviously going to be sold out because people wanting to see what all the fuzz is about. The thing goes in crecendo, the movie wins some nominations, premiere it in more theaters. Wins some Oscars, do a wide release. By then, the film is bad-word-of-mouth proof. As in ""Gangs of New York"" Daniel Day Lewis' performance overpowers the film and turns it into a one-man show. Only his scenes with Paul Dano have some balance and are in fact the film's most entertaining exchanges. Not a bad film at all, just a bit overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
There will be a Mr. Anderson ...,"When one of the finest filmmakers teams up with one of the most accomplished actors of our times, you know you're in for something unique.P.T. Anderson has made us wait far too long since his last feature, Punch Drunk Love (2002), as has Daniel Day Lewis, (only one indie film since Gangs of New York). Intelligently cautious about selecting their projects, Anderson wooed Lewis to his script based upon Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil! A title the film kept while shooting. The current title is a little deceptive, as the blood refers to the relationship between father and son which makes up the core of this film and not greed versus faith as the marketing would have us believe.Daniel Plainview (Lewis) is an oil man, something he is proud of and yet has isolated himself from the world in order to follow his dreams. When the world catches up, unexpected interactions come into play. Like Faust, Plainview loses more of himself as his wealth increases.This is a fascinating story in the vein of 'Giant', a rare dramatic background of oil drilling, though this is more reminiscent of Citizen Kane than anything else.Anderson, perhaps all too aware of the similarities, steers clear of the journey of a tycoon, whose soul is slowly shedding and strips it back to mere one on one interactions, unlike his previous films such as Magnolia where numerous characters shift across the screen in a lush tapestry. Indeed, much of the action takes place outdoors, in isolated settings and this is no coincidence. Anderson knows what he wants and he expresses it; Plainview with his son, with his brother, with his young mirror image, the evangelist, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). Daniel Day Lewis is the showman and Anderson gives him the stage.Anderson's style is dominant, his trademark long steadicam shots, tracking in and out of poignant character moments and a stunning soundtrack by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood, (sadly overlooked by the Oscars), which brings attention to itself but that's the point. Anderson has always favored a heavy soundtrack, the odd effects of Punch Drunk, the disco tunes in Boogie Nights, and the Aimee Mann laded Magnolia.Blood is a remarkable actor's film, delving deep into theatrical tradition. You can almost hear the 'Rosebudian' whispers of Orson Welles as he spies the black seeping up from the desert with fascination and the subsequent malevolence it inflicts on those that are near it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brings a new meaning to the saying: an instant classic!,"What better two to put together than Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis. PTA is a favorite writer and director of mine from Magnolia, being one of my favorite films ever. As such, going into TWBB, I expected very highly of it.I was rewarded with an absolute shattering of my high expectations. Watching this movie is akin to watching a miracle. The sheer brilliance of it is simply unexplainable. High expectations doesn't even begin to describe the greatness of this movie.Of course, the directing and script are spot on. But, what I would like to expand on is Mr. Lewis' acting. Lewis becomes Daniel Plainview in such a smooth and seemingly effortless manner. He demonstrates to us the terrible consequences of greed, especially in relation to oil, and the way his life and ""family"" fall victim to it.I may get criticized for making the following comment, but I believe Daniel Day Lewis delivered, in TWBB, the most Oscar deserving performance ever in the history of cinema. He completely shines in this movie and is a sheer joy to have watched on the big screen and at home on the smaller TV. His acting is like an explosive masterpiece that reawakens viewers and critics of all kinds what the really talented actors are capable of.Lewis undergoes a complete transformation of character in TWBB, and his transition is flawless. For people who cannot appreciate true acting, you will probably find this movie boring.

The Only American Masterpiece of 2007,"Once in a very rare while (all too rarely, alas) I leave a film instantly convinced that I just experienced an enduring classic in real time, and that's how I felt after watching ""There Will Be Blood."" It is an amazing film with a performance at its center that defies description, and I haven't been as energized or excited over a new release since last year's ""Children of Men."" I've always liked Paul Thomas Anderson, even at his most over indulgent (""Magnolia""), but he's never seemed as mature a filmmaker as he does here. Where other Anderson films have sustained one long fevered pitch and burnt themselves out in exhaustion, this film is restrained and disciplined; it builds slowly and inexorably to a powerhouse conclusion. Like nearly every Anderson film, it's a love it or hate it movie. It's virtually impossible to have an indifferent reaction to it. And I imagine the ending will be one of the most divisive aspects of the film. I, for one, thought it ended perfectly, and suspect it will be a long time before I get the film's final image and line out of my head.No review of this film is complete without mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis, who is nothing less than a force of nature at its center. His performance is so good it's scary; what he does in this film can't even be called acting. I've seen other performances this year that I greatly admired: Tommy Lee Jones in ""In the Valley of Elah,"" Ryan Gosling in ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" Viggo Mortensen in ""Eastern Promises."" But Day-Lewis seems to be working in a completely different stratosphere than these others. In Daniel Plainview, the oilman who's eaten from within by greed and a lust for power, he has created a villain that's one-dimensional yet extremely complex all at the same time. Plainview should be a boring character, because he's so single minded in purpose, yet Day-Lewis makes him endlessly fascinating. And was I the only person who actually liked him a little bit? In a world full of hypocrisy and men telling one another what they want to hear the better to take advantage, Plainview is refreshingly honest and straightforward, no matter how abominable he may be. He's like the American system of free enterprise taken to its monstrous extreme.Though set in the past, the film is one of the most relevant I've seen this year. The battle over economic and religious domination is obviously one that rages today. Religious and corporate institutions differ only in their methods -- both are driven by a lust for power and control.And to top it all off, Johnny Greenwood provides one of the most unique and sensational scores to grace a movie screen in a long time.I can't say enough good things about this movie.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

His raw unsettling role in this movie has such a threat of unresolved anger through it that you can barely tear your eyes from his. Remember Joe Pesci in Good fellas - well Plainview is all that and more yet he communicates it all with a twitch of the face or the raise of an eyebrow. Although the story is compelling it can drag in places but the wonderful Dl carries the entire film on his shoulders and hurls it back at the audience.

I await a satisfying explanation for these overblown reviews,"I haven't seen any convincing explanation for the accolades given this film. That is not to say that Day-Lewis' acting is not deserving of enthusiasm, but acting does not make a film.The film is a character study of paranoid personality disorder and greed. I see little else beyond that. I sense PTA was trying to tell me something about men, their relationships to each other, brothers and sons, but what it is I defy you to tell me, let alone what is so profound about it. A man who is given no love has no love to give? I think Citizen Kane took that one and ran it to it's end. In fact, Plainview is pretty much the same as Kane, if slightly more violent (though, remember, Kane too releases his violence when he feels betrayed). They both pretend to be champions of the people, but are incapable of caring enough to deliver true love or caring, only the material scraps from their barreling capitalist enterprises.The religious charlatanism angle is vapid and translucent from the start, not to mention trite. The lighting is above par and the burning oil derrick scene is visually stunning. It is an entertaining movie until the end, which appears as if it were written by some college student high on pot. There are definitely at least two clear 2001 homages, which is cool. But if a film is not stunning in every other regard than story, which this film is not, than it cannot be great.

Don't listen to the critics! This movie was terrible!! Just watch the clearly disappointed audience running for the exits. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
an unconventionally rewarding film,"""There Will be Blood"" has a minimalist score, long stretches with no dialogue, little in the way of action, and an ending that eschews traditional resolution or dramatic catharsis, yet it remains an intensely gripping film.It a character study of a charismatic yet thoroughly unlikable man. He methodically works towards goal only to have it destroy him when he accomplishes it. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview a 19th century silver miner who becomes an oil tycoon trying to amass enough wealth to separate himself from the world that he dislikes. Over the course of his life he picks up a brother, a son, and a nemesis only to discard or destroy them in terrible and almost off hand ways.If the movie sounds unconventionally rewarding, that is because it is. It is less a conventional narrative than an exploration of the nature of a particular man. It is a film that both requires and rewards patience.",,Anonymous,Drama
Blood is just the easy part !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When you love cinema because of what it is you enjoy movies in aspects not everyone will agree and There Will be Blood is such a fine example of it. A Masterpiece should I say that penetrates in the deep field of human emotion and brings to life characters of such dark feelings and perverse ways that you will feel like evil is getting in you veins and will make you want to take you eyes out of the screen but at the same time will nail you to you seat and never let go. Mr. Lewis is just great his takes this part and makes it his own is like he will have to go to shrink to become him again I have seen a lot of great acting but this is something else. P.T. Anderson on his hand delivers another great film and amazing cinematography along whit a soundtrack makes this one an instant classic a movie that will be talked about over the ages. It is amazing how you can put on a screen a mixture of emotions and feeling this only can be done by all the superb acting, Lewis, Dano etc.. and a Director like Anderson.At the end of the film I was speechless, powerless, devastated, angry, I guess I was reflecting all the emotions i just ingested thru this one now I have to let it out.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Burning Descent Into Madness,"The film is simply perfect in every way, every scene, every note and every facet of all the actors performances are spot on. Day-Lewis presents a character in Daniel Plainview of unrelenting maliciousness, not quite as sadistic as Bardem's Anton Chirurgh but every bit a villain through and through. What makes Daniel Plainview more horrifying than any other villain I've come across is just how much of myself I saw in his character. This film made me want to be a better person not through guilting me into loving my fellow man, but by simply showing the life of a man who never changed and alienated all who loved him. Here is a man that never evolves and experiences no epiphany, he stays the same miserable bastard that he's always been and its just so refreshing to see that in a character. Too much these days we as film goers are forced to sit through contrived character changes or realizations that come out of nowhere and only serve to insult the audience. People don't change and here is a film thats not afraid to express that in the most brutal way possible.Plainview hates people and wants success in business only so he can make enough money to escape them. Making money it turns out, is very easy for him, he has a way of speaking and carrying himself that is hypnotic and convincing even when you know you're being lied too. He's an oil man but he just as easily could've made his fortune in silver or gold or the blood of children, his ruthlessness would not have stopped him. And what is oil if not the blood of the earth.He finds his fortune somewhere in Texas where he runs afoul of a small-town church whose preacher represents all Plainview hates about the humanity he wishes to escape from. The young Paul Dano gives the best supporting performance of the year as Eli Sunday, the preacher and faith healer of the church and the symbol of Plainview hatred for years. Throughout the film the two characters run afoul several times with Plainview only building up his hatred over time, for Eli, and for everyone around him.There has been much uproar over the film's ending, many call it 'over-the-top' or unreal. Yes, the ending is insane, maddening and gruesome, and it is perfect. No other ending could possibly due given this character and his personality and all the decisions he has made in his life up to that crucial point in time (and given the title). The conclusion to the film is unsettling but its exactly what has been building and building the entirety of Daniel's life and its the only ending that could have done this story justice.The film works like a slow burning fire beneath the surface. The tension and the intensity just builds up until the climax where all is settled and there is no turning back. Our hero has become the man he was destined to be and there is no one left to help him. Plainview passes that threshold after which its too late to go back and right the wrongs you have committed to yourself and to those who loved you. His slow descent into madness is hard to watch, but whoever said a great film had to be fun to watch. Great art is not always pretty and great characters are not always likable. Those are not proper critiques of this film. There Will Be Blood creates an image of a man who is not perfect, but the image is perfectly created.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful masterpiece centered on a dark personality,"There Will Be Blood is a riveting drama film centering on Daniel Plainview: an ambitious and egocentric oil prospector who develops a wealthy business by manipulating his competitors, employees, friends, and family. Three phases of his life are chronicled: his first oil deposit discovery, his consolidation of power by transforming a ranching community to a drilling field, and his personal struggles later in his life.Daniel Plainview is one of the most profoundly complex characters in film. There is ample truth in his character: selfishness, greediness, and ambition are traits that we are all familiar with. His character might be expected to be one dimensional from these traits, but this is not the case. Occasionally, we might sense remorse or sympathy from him (for example, when he holds the son from a killed worker), but it always turns out to be based on a selfish goal. The essence of his beliefs is summarized in an enticing dialog midway through the film, where he states that ""I see the worst in people"". Despite his unrelenting flaws, it is impossible not to pity him. Daniel Day-Lewis does a phenomenal performance as Plainview, which will certainly be remembered as one of his career highlights.The supporting characters are also well acted (although they don't stand out as much as Day-Lewis). Paul Dano does an interesting take as the preacher Eli, who serves as one of Plainview's opponents. Plainview and Eli parallel an industry versus religion struggle, which adds an important element to the film's main theme.Another strong point of the film was the music. There is no powerful theme or melody. Instead, it consists of disjointed and convoluted sounds. Occasionally, the tone of a melody may be heard, but its rather unconventional. I liked this type of music and felt that matched perfectly with the film's atmosphere. The music and visuals (primarily of the desert environment) were adhesive complements. An example of this is a scene where the drilling tower catches fire. The contrast of dark and bright colors with the thumping music in the background creates a vibrant sensation.There Will Be Blood is now my favorite movie of the year (with a close, but discernible second of No Country for Old Men). The direction was beautiful, the acting was incredible, and the plot was engrossing. The themes were important and it left a strong aftertaste. If those are the things you look for in a film, then you can't go wrong with There Will Be Blood.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Epic!,"Seeing this movie last night, I realized even from the beginning of the film, from the first scenes that this film was made with a craftsmanship that you see once in a couple of years or even decades.The first thing that hits you is the haunting score brilliantly composed by Johnny Greenwood.The next thing you notice is the cinematography: the film is beautifully shot, as you can see it in every scene.It really manages to capture the essence of the story making great use of the shadows for the more dark scenes but also of the beautiful landscapes.The art decoration is also amazing as you can see the attention given to details in recreating that period.The screenplay is just perfect as it doesn't pop out, it isn't the central piece of the film(like in Juno for example) but more it is like a natural part that just fits perfectly into the whole ""mecanism"".The acting is top notch as the cast mirrors the dark mood of the film.But eventually this film isn't an epic because of its stunning cinematography, perfectly written screenplay, haunting score, or incredible acting.It all comes down to Paul Thomas Anderson's vision of Oil! by Upton Sinclair and to the central piece of his vision: Daniel Day-Lewis's acting.Never have I seen a man, an actor so completely and utterly transformed and so into the story, maybe only a mad man or a possessed person.Even though it may probably sound like a cliché: He is Daniel Plainview.How does he do it?? I keep asking myself, but it in the end lets just leave it as a mystery as he says and just pray to God he's gonna' keep making this kind of roles for as long as he will be able to. Yet, all of this could have not been able without Paul Thomas Anderson's directing who takes each part of the film and puts them together in a perfectly balanced film instead of giving too much attention to only one part.This is way this film is an epic;it's a story about power, greed, anger, hate, maliciousness, and religion.It is beautifully shot, with a powerful screenplay, top notch acting and masterfully directed.And this is way it resembles so much to Citizen Kane and I would go so far as to say that it's the only movie worthy of the comparison and the only one that can match the greatness of Citizen Kane.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Interesting time piece but devoid of a plot that is worthy of the acting,"A new age of discovery movie that takes two apolar individuals , pits them against each other and brings you into their heads in a way previously done by the likes of Kubrick and Copolla. The false hope that is being pedaled is a bit offensive as is the desperation in that it is sold. Oil for one, and God by the other. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are excellent in how they dupe themselves along with others in their endeavors. But the sadness of such existences is only shown, not felt. The story line is predictable that not even the blaring musical tension can elevate. DDL had depth as Bill The Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"", but despite a sincere commitment, he is still a one dimensional character, albeit a charming one. Some movies are discussed in reference or even comparison to others by the same director, actor or genre. Others stand out as unique. ""There Will Be Blood"" has some of both, which is to say there is much to discuss in those regards. The bottom line is what needs to be considered, and this movie takes a long time to evidence a lack of character development and to show to unsurprising results of such an existence.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Compelling - Poor people skills but not as dark hearted.,"Wow fantastic movie and an amazing acting job by Daniel Day Lewis. I read many reviews about this movie after watching it that describes Daniel Plainsview as uncaring, or dark hearted. I would say more that he has poor people skills. that he doesn't feel comfortable around people, the lack of understanding he gets from his attempts at communication makes him say he dislikes people. But really he loves his son, and is proud of him. He gets along fine with his business partner, but when things don't go his way he strikes back viciously, as we see numerous times. always too far and too extreme for the circumstances but a result of the poor people skills not hatred.Interesting soundtrack... according to one interview with the director he compared the movie to a horror movie... and if I'm not mistaken this seems to be the soundtrack or a very close approximation from the Shining.Amazing movie one that will stick with me for a long time. Not just the interesting accent, but the strange and amazing feel of the whole film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Daniel day isn't human,"he single handedly made this a great film. i thought that for such a long movie, it really didn't seem like it. that had everything to do with Luis. what he brought to this film was almost unreal. he played this character so well that you almost forget that he is acting. if you don't constantly remind yourself through out the movie what a fantastic job he is doing, you will eventually forget that he is an actor. he makes everything in that movie seem real.i also liked all of the other performances. i thought that in gangs of new york everyone else in that movie was shadowed by Luis. he seemed almost out of place because he did such a better job than everyone else. though the focus was all Daniel day on this one, you have to give credit to the other actors. to be looked at as doing a good job when you have to share the Daniel day Luis (who was probably on camera for 2 hours of this movie) is truly an accomplishment. i especially liked the actor who played Eli. watching him give sermons was awesome.i think that the story was alright, but it almost didn't matter because of how well the actors were. it seems really good when you are watching it, but looking back it was just good not great. besides the acting, the music and cinematography was outstanding. i only give this a 9/10 because i only like to give out one perfect ten a year and im gonna have to go with no country. if i could give it a 9.99/10 i would. you MUST see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Nutshell Review: There Will Be Blood,"Money is the root of all evil. It's needed to fuel the economy, and it's needed to further various gains, be it personal, political, and even religious to a certain extent. Too much money and people will see green, wanting to know the secret formula to creating and hoarding wealth, because of the various forms of satisfying utility that comes with the spending of money. And precious commodity like oil which is in high demand, automatically equates to wads of cold hard cash.Written and directed by Paul Thomas Andersen, There Will Be Blood brings us to the early 20th century, where it chronicles the exploits of a certain Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day- Lewis), who discovers oil deposits during silver mining, and hedges a bet on the right horse. Calling himself an oil man, he designs his persona as being a humble family man, with his adopted child H.W., so as to lower his level of threat as he goes around acquiring land which has the prospect on sitting upon oceans of oil buried deep down. It's a very shrewd move, and a card that he plays to perfection, hiding a cruel mean streak that he possesses deep within.A teenager approaches him one day with leads that his family and the entire neighbourhood of simple rural folk, are sitting atop a potential gold mine. Without further ado, Daniel and son qualifies this lead, and hurriedly entice the folks to sell their estate to him. And here's where the compelling argument for the proposal take place, where even you'll be hard pressed not to agree with, of the boost in the local economy that the oil money will bring - better infrastructure, better crops for food, educational opportunities, jobs all round, and the likes. But Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) plays the hard game with Daniel, and requests for a church to be built for him, to further his ambition of being the defacto faith healer in the community.And of course, such deal breakers are never in the good books of shrewd businessmen like Daniel, and the two of them set down the path of adversity, with the playing of games with each other, obvious snubbing, and total disgust. We see how the upper hand swings and shifts from one character to the other in their struggle for power over the community - one through the economy, the other through religion. And it is this battle which made me get interested and sit up.There are some very acute observations about the abuse of religion in this movie, and the exploitation of it for ulterior motives, gains, and self-preservation, cannot be highlighted in terms more stark than those here. For money, one can sell the soul to the devil, or turn religious should support be able to be garnered from the support group. For money or power over the masses, false prophets inch their way to top positions so as to have absolute command and control over their followers. To save one's skin, one can deny their Lord whom they exalt in the loudest voice day in day out, although this is no big deal for false prophets since their faith is placed on the moolah instead.I will count my chicken before it hatches, and say Daniel Day-Lewis will win that Best Actor Oscar this year, without a doubt. He will be robbed of that accolade should he not win it, as it was a really fascinating transformation to his character, and I still admire how Day-Lewis the person fades away into the character he portrays. His oil man is nothing but a ruthless businessman who will stop at nothing, not even murder, to fulfill his goals. His deep resonating voice is strangely hypnotic, and he presents a character that you will so love to hate, and probably be fearful of, along the way. Relative newcomer Paul Dano holds his own against the acclaimed veteran, and his Eli character exudes a sense of seediness that you can't help but cheer when he gets his just desserts. With the both of them having a chance to have a go at each other, I thought Dano really took up the opportunity to let it rip.It's a pretty long movie, sad to say you can feel its length. It unveils itself very slowly, and the first 20 minutes are pretty much devoid of any speaking parts, as you follow the designing and building of land based oil rigs, as well as the process to bring out the black gold. But there are some brilliant scenes in the movie which are worth their weight in gold, coupled with the beautiful cinematography and art direction, transporting you back to the turn of the century. The last third of the movie seemed to pick up the pace but felt somewhat rushed, but the superb acting and ending more than make up for the shortcomings along the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Turn of the Century,"""Turn-of-the-century"" is not a phrase you hear any more; that's because, 10 or 15 or 20 years ago, people were still using it to refer to the period of the late 1800s and early 1900s, a quaint period where things like long-distance radio, women competing in the Olympics and the internal combustion engine (the main component of new novelties like the automobile and the airplane) were just dipping a toe in the ocean of their impact on human society.But now in 2008, nobody's using that phrase anymore  because of course, the century has turned once again, and the bemused wisdom of hindsight that ""turn-of-the-century"" once implied has become uncomfortable  because we are now in a future we are too busy and stressed out to appreciate or absorb. What new inventions, just being introduced, might radically change our lives and world in the years to come? Please  we're still trying to deal with 5 minutes ago.There Will Be Blood is set in this period of yestercentury, opening in 1898. The film tracks for almost the next 30 years, a visionary oilman who lives the before, during and after of the tipping point when petroleum took over coal's mantle as the primary source of energy the world depended upon. This is a bracing film, buoyed by a mad, intense star performance by the great Irish actor Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview, the oilman.There Will Be Blood experiments with picture and sound in exhilarating ways. The first 16 minutes of the film contain not one word of dialogue, a rare way to start an American movie. The compositions and edits don't telegraph what we're supposed to be absorbing  the details exist quietly, in the larger mis-en-scene, and the pictures magnetize our concentration. Here's a film that asks us to pursue it, rather than vice-versa. For a film that largely takes place in 1911, it feels very much like film-making more sophisticated than what we are used to in 2008. Lighting is frequently dark. Characters sit at opposite ends of the frame, with vast, empty (yet pungent) expanses between them in the center of the shot. The art direction, costumes and cinematography capture the grime and quiet we are used to seeing in photos of the period, so effectively it's spooky.The narrative pounds forward. Plainview experiments with early drilling techniques and uses trial, error and his own unstoppable gumption to get petroleum out from below the ground and into the hands of the big refining companies, racing against seemingly only himself in the insistence upon increasing the profit margin. A pivotal moment comes when Plainview is propositioned by a strange boy, Paul Sunday, who sells out the simple California family he abandoned for only $500. Sick over the freight costs he must pay the railways to ship his oil to the California refineries, Plainview heads west to exploit those whom the young Sunday has promised do not know. A musical score such as we've never heard before in the movies, written by a composer who has never before scored a fiction feature (Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood), keeps us on edge  fast-moving dissonant trills punctuated by foreboding, low-lying percussion.Unexpectedly, while expenses go down (the rural Californians of the fictional Little Boston ignorantly sell their land to Plainview on the cheap) the overhead only increases. Plainview has no family, but by his side is a 10-year-old boy he tells everyone (including the boy) is his son  but more importantly, his ""business partner"". (The boy, whom he calls H.W., actually belonged to a fellow miner who died in a tragic accident in one of Plainview's earlier mining experiments, whose wife had died in childbirth, and Plainview grabbed the opportunity to effectively impersonate the child's father.) H.W. becomes a victim in another mining accident, suffering a major handicap  and Plainview loses his ""business partner"". (The boy's sweet, serious face was a major bonus in sucking signatures out of goat farmers and their wives.) Paul Sunday's younger brother Eli surfaces  and is the first individual that can rival Plainview in his drive and fever to conquer his fellow man (although Eli's vehicle of choice is radical evangelism, not capitalism)  and Plainview must invest in destroying him. The bloodthirsty immortality mounts  and the pendulum inevitability swings back, as impersonation (in a different form) and humiliation come home to roost.What's happening to our world? There Will Be Blood is one the year's most brilliant films; it is completely about right now, and the teeming world on the brink of technological changes that will change our lives as we hurl forward into the future. Will we learn compassion and grace, check our growing greed and egos against a moral compass? There Will Be Blood has the audacity to flat out state that we won't. It's chilling  and claustrophobic. It invokes a fight-or-flight instinct  but the end of the film, where we are confined with our hero in a small room that mirrors the small dark mine in which we started this journey 29 years and 155 minutes earlier, we realize that there's no where to run to in this society  and that we will need nothing less than a superwoman to save us.

Fantastically ambitious and ultimately successful depiction of greed in America,"Having read a lot of reviews of this movie from other users, it seems to me they are missing the whole point of the film. Many decry the movie as not grabbing their attention via the characters, they find the music distracting, they find that nothing happens. I really don't know what movie these people are watching. This is certainly an ambitious movie and sometimes people react against films which they perceive are overly pretentious or ambitious and that is fine if the film does not make a strong case for the truth of its arguments. However I do not understand the questions of many of the critics of the film here-well, anymore than I understand why so many people like so many terrible movies.I found the film excellent. Paul Thomas Anderson (of the fantastic Boogie Nights, the very underrated Punch Drunk Love, and the excellent Magnolia) has adapted the novel ""Oil"" by Upton Sinclair to compose a film about the effect of corrosive greed and religious hucksterism on the development of the West and how, while they may prove temporarily beneficial to their promoters, the ultimate effect of such self-interest may take its greatest toll on the very people who are the prime movers of such self-interested schemes.The story turns on the egotism of two key characters-Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis, quite possibly the best actor working regularly in the movies these days) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano perhaps not coincidentally mnemonically-related to one of the most influential evangelists of the 20th century and in a performance which offers a significant counterpoint to Day-Lewis' large shadow, not an easy accomplishment). These two men in the developing West see the interrelated utility of each other's interest, and also, I believe, recognize intuitively, the pre-eminent motivator of their rival/ally as self-interest, setting the stage for the ""blood"" of the title. They recognize that the other man's interest can be employed in their interests, but that at some point, a clash between the two interests is almost inevitable, so strong is each man's greed.The film ranges across the dry, open west and some foreshadowing for the eventual confrontation is delineated by the filmmaker. A plot of land heavy in oil is identified for Plainview's purposes by Eli Sunday's brother Paul who extracts a fee for the right to look for oil on the Sundays' property. Plainview duplicitously investigates the land and confirms Paul's tip. In confirming the correctness of Eli Sunday's brother's geological information, foreshadowing of Paul Sunday's wisdom is made. Along the way, Plainview has acquired a child. His parenting methods are unchallenged by associates or the authorities, owing to the wide-openness of the West, and hints about the unethicality of his child-rearing methods are suggested, via the choices Plainview uses to feed his son HW (who is cynically employed by Daniel to convey his trustworthiness to towns whose oil he wishes to get) However, in this unregulated environment, Henry's treatment of his son, which might be considered simply ill-informed given the free-wheeling, unregulated environment of the wild West, veers unquestionably into the unethical. Numerous ethical questions go by the wayside by both Plainview and Sunday. However, the manner in which such issues are overlooked by both men are not done in such a callous manner as to raise the alarms of the community in which they live. Additionally, they are considered leaders and so their behavior might be ignored simply on those grounds. But perhaps more ominously, it is obvious that both men are willfully attempting to obscure such unethical behavior and that these actions will catch up to them at some point in the future.Anderson deserves his Oscar nomination for direction because the tone of the film is such that it could quite easily veer into sneering self-righteousness or unintentional comedy. More impressively, Anderson, from Sinclair's book, has created two strong and very bad characters whose influence and sway during a period of great change in the American west will have ripple effects down through the years and he allows these characters to shape the direction which the film will go. When a director has such bracing characters, one need simply allow these characters to develop along their natural arcs.The use of music in the film is unnerving and compelling. Anderson has gotten a fantastic soundtrack from Johnny Greenwood of the band Radiohead. The dissonant, relentless tone foreshadows some of the horrors which one might vaguely expect but whose exact nature is unknown.As stated, Anderson resists the temptation of becoming overly preachy or allowing his film to become an unintentional parody of the greed and divisive religious beliefs which the key characters of the film promote. The acting, most specifically from Dano and Day-Lewis is electrifying and it is their work, along with a visionary screenplay and capable direction, which makes this a valid nominee for a best picture Oscar in 2008.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Paul Newman of Facial Hair,"Daniel Day Lewis' mustache steals the show with its unrelenting greed and by-any-means-necessary business methods. This fantastic piece of facial hair one-ups its performance in Gangs of New York, where it butchered through Leo DiCaprio's stubble, shaving the Hollywood Heartthrob bare. Many shots in the movie emphasize the mustache's loneliness, placing the handlebar masterpiece amidst vast desert landscapes, making it clear that in Capitalism, every little hair is on its own. Based on Upton Sinclair's classic early 1900s mustache, There Will Be Blood's bushy protagonist puts forth a most definitely Oscar-worthy performance (though I don't know if there's a category for it).",,Anonymous,Drama

"very long, story could have been tightened up","Sure Daniel Day Lewis was good in this, but his role in Gangs of New York was a lot better and he didn't win the Oscar for that. His character, Daniel Plainview, doesn't really do anything to stand out to me. And I thought his character was going to be a lot meaner than what he was.Daniel Plainview is an oilman. He buys up land in Texas to drill and teaches his young son how to run the family business. He becomes successful but often cheats families when buying land. He doesn't give them the real value of the land. His son is injured in an accident and loses his hearing. Before too long, Daniel ships him off to school in California. He also must deal with a preacher, Sunday, that he considers a fake. He has to say he is a sinner in church in order to buy this one man's land. You could tell he really resented the preacher for this humiliation. He gets him back in the very end.While his son is away, a man turns up claiming to be his brother. With his son gone, Daniel starts to let this guy get involved with the business. But the guy slips up and Daniel knows he's an impostor and shows him what happens when you cross Daniel Plainview.Toward the end of the movie, it skips forward in time by many years. Daniel is now an old, lonely drunk. He lives in a huge mansion and his son comes by. The son says he wants to move to Mexico to get a drilling business going there. Daniel calls him a competitor and disowns him. He is very mean to his son and reveals a shocking secret about his childhood.Overall, this is a dark film about a man making a living drilling for oil in the early 1900s.FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching.

Fascinating- Best of '07,"There will be blood is rated R for some violence. The rating does not say anything about the truly terrifying human portrait of greed evil and hate. There will be blood is in all ways amazing. Acting. Writing. Story. It is about (No Spoilers) a turn of the century ""oil man"" in his search for fortune and what he will sacrifice. Although it is over two and a half hours long, it is worth it. Unlike the disappointing No Country for old men, Blood is not extremely and excessively violent although there is one particularly graphic scene. Daniel Day-Lewis is enticing in his role as Daniel Plainview. In possibly the best performance of the 21st century, he makes you feel for, or hate passionately, Plainview. After watching Blood, It will make you think for a very long time, about the themes and choices. There will be Blood is such a powerful film, this does not give it justice.

2 1/2 hours that will leave you spell bound,"I got this movie for my birthday and finally got around to watching it (as it was 2 1/2 hours long), and I must say, Daniel Day Lewis gets my vote for damn fine actor. It was a little slow, and if you were expecting a big showdown or something you'll be disappointed. It really was well written, and I have to say all of the acting was spot-on. The actor who played Eli did a great job of portraying a very eccentric preacher. And the entire movie had me spell bound as I knew next to nothing about oil drilling except what I've seen in movies like Hellfighters. I had no idea what kind of dangers lie in such a business, and not to mention the madness that ensues from being an ""oil man."" Since I heard it was based on Oil! by Upton Sinclair I knew it was going to be a bit crazy- and after seeing this movie I immediately thought I should read that book. This film is not for the young or those who don't understand strange twisty plots, as at times it gets hard to follow, and although few and far between the violent scenes can get somewhat gruesome.

A dark and marvelous cinematic tale of greed,"I don't think I've ever seen a movie like ""There Will Be Blood"". It takes time for the greatness of this film to sink in and happens upon reflection, but it truly is a great film.Directly after viewing the film, I felt it was overrated. But not anymore.""There Will Be Blood"" is pretty much a movie about a determined oil man who sets up a well in Little Boston, but others want him to share the wealth, and he gets greedy. And yes, there is blood.Daniel Day Lewis gives the performance of a lifetime here, playing a generally nice man who is being driven insane by the greedy people around him, and his own greed and lust for success begins to overtake him. Paul Dano plays opposite him, an equally greedy religious boy who feels that he is a chosen vessel of the Lord, and feels that he deserves what he desires. And of course, he wants money for Daniel Plainview's success, and uses his religion as a vehicle for money and revenge. There aren't too many other important characters aside from H.W. Plainview, the son of Daniel, and Henry Plainview, the man who appears to Daniel eighty minutes into the movie and reveals to him that they are brothers (or are they?).Every performance hits you like a bombshell. None of the characters, with the exception of H.W., are even remotely likable, and they don't have redeeming qualities. It's a bitter movie to take in because of all the selfish people involved, but its a classic one. Each actor does a very good job with the exception of Daniel Day Lewis, who does a great job.The first half of the movie establishes Daniel Plainview's time in Little Boston, drilling oil, and focuses mainly on oil, until a terrible oil accident. The second half focuses on his transformation from a business-driven man to a man gone mad by greed, resulting in a climatic conclusion. The final scene, in my opinion, is one of the greatest put to screen. The actors, characters, and script all work together beautifully, like an elegant but gloomy dance.The only thing that doesn't fit into the rest, is the music. It only goes with some of the parts, but the music is really wacky in some parts and sticks out like a sore thumb, degrading some of the scenes a little.This might be a hard film to take in because of its somewhat slow-moving, oil-based first half, then dark and disturbing, quicker-paced second half. With the exception of the music, the movie is flawless. Every line is delivered with significance and conviction, and all in all, this film should leave you breathless. I really hope its remembered with the old classics, because it boasts of their impact. Don't miss this. It's a film that sometime in a life, everyone should see, and it should be remembered forever. 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"haunting images, haunting score","There Will Be Blood is a strong movie in virtually every area, but what impressed me most of all was Jonny Greenwood's score. As in Jaws, and perhaps even more so in this case, the music creates an atmosphere of suspense that no combination of writing, acting, scenery, costume, makeup, etc. could come close to achieving in its absence. Greenwood's (usually) minimalist post-modern orchestral score sets such a tone from the opening seconds of the film, as we see the early struggles of our antihero, Daniel Day-Lewis's Daniel Plainview. We watch a man driven by an unquenchable greed and hear a swell of strings foreshadowing the decades of suffering that his greed will impose (on himself and on anyone in whom he sees an opportunity for advantage).The character of Plainview is not a depiction of a pure psychopath, in the way that Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh was in No Country for Old Men. He is a bit more nuanced, but the glimpses we are given into the fact that Plainview does in fact possess a capability for regret, sadness, and empathy make him that much less likable for his repeatedly ignoring such feelings in the quest to fill his pockets. Here is a man not to be crossed, and one whose protean unpredictability leaves all but his essential business associates ever at risk of crossing him should they happen to encounter him on the wrong day.The use of religion by the oil man and of the oil man by religion makes for one of the most interesting elements in the story line. Apparently the two were even stranger bedfellows in the days before Newt Gingrich's neocon revolution. One wonders what Upton Sinclair (socialist author of the source work) would have made of the current U.S. administration, or rather, one hardly needs to wonder. Naturally, at the time of its writing the source work (Oil) was a criticism of the big business syndicates of Sinclair's day, but you know, the less things change the more they stay the same; and if I were to attempt an exegesis on There Will Be Blood it would be to make a case that Paul Thomas Anderson intended explicitly (though not exclusively) for the film to remind us of some of the less honorable practices of the current administration. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but this is certainly the impression that I got.Anyway, back to the manifest content of the film -- I awoke the day after having watched There Will Be Blood with a handful of very vivid images left over in my mind, scenes of destruction and ruin, not bothered by them so much as impressed with the movie's ability to occupy my thoughts in so vivid a manner. Anderson, Day-Lewis, and Greenwood each deserve a round of applause for what they've done here. By their efforts, they have given us a movie that will be well-remembered decades hence.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Overall worth watching, but not exceptional","Overall a movie worth watching, nothing close to the masterpiece the reviews suggest it is though.I found that Day-Lewis exaggerated in his acting. Like struggling to prove he did a great performance.Real rage is one thing, and pretending rage is another one.I perceived his acting as being kind of fake.Other than that the film addresses some classic issues of human species. Poverty, ambition, solitude, hatred and grief.And of course what a deceptive fraud religion is.That's all.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"a journey, a learning curve","It was the last hour,the last minute, in fact the last breath in which the miracle was performed and the humanity was redeemed,by the holy grace of the lord. Similarly in an year filled by spectacular masterpieces in terms of excellence and creativity from the American cinema, comes a story just before the year's end, a journey of human life - one that has all the points straight to remain human, told through such mesmerizing performances that an epic,not for an year, but for a decade is made.Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (of Mangolia fame), and nominated for eight Oscars (including the best movie, best male actor and best director) the movie 'There will be blood' is set in the early the early years of 20th century, when north America was just developing, portraying the life story of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) who starts off as a silver miner, but switches over to oil mining business.He comes across a vast untouched and unheard oil source, after being given a tip-off about the place, and then the entire movie seems to chronicle how he gets the land from the people settled there, how he strikes deal with big players in the oil market and how he strikes a fortune and becomes a millionaire. But then, there is Eli Sunday(Paul Dano), a priest who goes about calling himself a prophet, stumbling into every single move the oil businessman tries to make,trying to throw his life out of balance every time it somewhat intends to come on track.Apart from the protagonist and the antagonist the movie has many a elements that separate it from the rest of the promising crowd of winner.The 12 year old son, that Daniel Plainview always moves around with, his step brother who seems to appear out of nowhere during the second half of the movie, the constant twists and turns that keep the story's protagonist to remain a normal human even in spite of his success, all promise to keep the viewers engrossed for the two and a half hour length of this movie.The second aspect that needs to be mentioned apart from the storyline is the engaging and soulful background score that has been used throughout the movie, such a score that it never lets the excitement of anticipation die out from the audience.Almost all of the background score consists of symphonies and music from highly reputed 18th and 19th century composers from across the Europe.All these endeavors in this movie would have been in vain if the atmosphere that is created in this movie would have failed, but the producers have seemed to take care of this aspect the most. The scenes that are put up, drive hard the point that the movie tries to develop, the struggle that goes into oil mining during that period is certainly visually developed through the arid uncultivated terrains, dry lands and vintage machineries that the movie shows. The movie seems to develop slowly, delivering less and arousing the desire to know more about the characters. The excellence of the director is clearly achieved as he delivers more than his previously directed works. But the depiction is Daniel Plainview, a character that grows from a small time miner into a confident man and to a ambitious person later, who puts his only relation i.e.with his son at stake for his desires, is very judiciously done by Daniel Day-Lewis. Having won an Oscar previously and having an experience of old time-western movies (Gangs of New York) he seems to breath life into the character of Daniel Plainview perfectly. His counterpart, the priest who proclaims himself to be the third revelation, a messiah figure, and a constant hinder to his aims adds the needed flavors of hate, passion and struggle to the movie.Paul Dano,who previously impressed audiences with his side role as 'silent'brother in 'Little Miss Sunshine' carries out the role to the maximum possible shades it can portray.The movie is more a journey, a learning curve that seasoned movie lovers would surely appreciate. But if you are someone who catches American movies occasionally, leave this movie for future times as this movie requires deep appreciation and understanding of the various complexities that this movie seems to develop upon. Following the likes of legendary classics like 'Scarface' and 'Godfather' this movie, ranked #20 at IMDb among top 250 all-time movies, this movie is sure to be a milestone in American cinema, and would be viewed with same awe even after decades.It has all the emotions that a human life can offer - excitement, ambition, passion, fear, hate, jealously, treachery, morality and realization.And as the movie ends - Oh,yes there will be blood.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disappointed,"This was a movie I had high hopes for. Unfortunately, it disappointed. Much because I didn't connect to it, and felt a bit bored. The score and music in this film didn't hit me at all, and sometimes it was awful. But, acting, direction and cinematography was great. I see why so many praise Daniel Day-Lewis in this.

There will be no point.,"Daniel-Day Lewis and others do not deserve a 1 out of 10 stars here as he could not have played his part much better, but my wife and I saw this movie because so many people reviewed it so well, and we're not sure why. We kept waiting for something to happen and knew it may not have a satisfying ending (hence the title name- There Will Be Blood- but didn't even see much of that), we kinda felt like we're watching a car wreck and expecting it to make sense; we were left not even sure what the point was. We also felt like the movie's been done before (although I could look at it this way; without giving anything away- but maybe watching a man destroy himself, and the lives around him make me feel better about my life). Still, could have done without it.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
And so there was,"I really enjoyed this movie. It has a classical feel to it. If you need not stop action to keep your interest, I would not recommend it, but I would say the action level is comparable to an old western. Daniel Day Lewis is an amazing actor. He is a throughly convincing actor in every role I've seen in him. I think the movie leaves some room for the viewer to decide how evil Daniel really is. He does seem to be mostly working towards his own benefit, but he does help out the local community. It can be said though, that he is not a religious man and has one heck of temper.The black gold mentality makes for an interesting movie. Everyone seems wise of the fortune to be had for those who can put in the work. It causes greed and anger in some of the least likely characters. The movie allows people to get a deep understanding of many of the characters, to the point where at the end, characters actions, are no longer surprising. This isn't to say that the plot is predictable, but that the characters are so well developed, that reactions to circumstances seem genuine.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing storytelling through outstanding acting,"The performance by Daniel Day Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" is one of the most memorable of all time. It is the story of powers' corruption on the soul of a man. It centers on an oil baron and bigoted man whose life was marred by his terrible emotional decisions which clashed against his business life. Special note that Paul F Tompkins had a scene in this. Every actor in this movie really gave it their all, and that's something that brought life to an otherwise merely slightly-compelling story of wealth and its downfall for the average man. From the beginning, when he first strikes rich, to the end, when it drags him down, you're rooting for him.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

It is a film that is not only visually stunning, but also intellectually stimulating.The film's central character, Daniel Plainview, is a complex and multi-dimensional figure, who embodies the Faustian bargain of the American capitalist. Through his character, the film explores the corrosive effects of power and wealth on the human soul. The film also touches on the themes of family, religion, and morality, as Plainview's actions have devastating consequences on both himself and those around him.The film's cinematography, score, and performances are all top-notch, adding to the already rich tapestry of the film. Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Plainview is nothing short of mesmerizing, and his performance is a masterclass in acting.

It is a film that challenges the viewer to consider the darker aspects of the human experience, and it is a film that will stay with the viewer long after it has ended.

"Strangely gripping if bladder-fillingly long, it has some of the best characters in recent memory.","There's not so much a story in 'There Will Be Blood (2007)' as a series of events that shape a character and his descent into soulless pseudo-insanity, with a strong undertone that seems to comment on the tyrannical nature of typically larger-than-life tycoons and the destruction of their selves in the search for that intangible metric of so-called success. This strangely gripping if bladder-fillingly long saga has a beautiful flair for visual storytelling compounded by a fantastic though heavy-lifting score, that's as ominous as the piece's prophetic title, and a one-of-a-kind powerhouse performance that sneaks up on you to end with one of the scariest character-driven scenes of recent years. There are stretches which stretch the pace, of course, and its apparent lack of narrative may be frustrating if you're not willing to reflect retroactively on its themes, ideas and, most importantly, character arcs. While the journey each individual takes may seem subtle on the surface, it is really within the expertly-written characters that the picture finds its purpose, an exploration of the people who don't always say what they are thinking but are thankfully clearly thinking something, and its a real treat to dissect every single moment that a simple side-ways glance or overt outburst of furious anger gives us a glimpse behind the eyes of some of the best characters in recent memory. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Blood,"I remember reading about just how much money Rockefeller was making at the height of his prowess and the sums were eye watering. His Standard Oil company is referenced in this powerful drama with Daniel Day Lewis as ""Plainview"". He's a prospector looking for silver but who has a bit of a fall and discovers that there is something much more valuable and plentiful - if you know how to find it, He gradually buys up leases and together with his stalwart ""Fletcher"" (Ciarán Hinds) and young son ""H. W."" (Dillon Freasier) starts to develop his business with a view to building a pipeline of over one hundred miles to reach the sea. Along the way, their lives are fraught with dangers and tough choices have to be made - especially when an accident at one of the wells renders the young boy deaf. It's at this remote site that ""Plainview""meets his nemesis. Not in a competitive, business, fashion - but in a puritanical Christian one. The son of a local homesteader is aspiring preacher ""Eli"" (Paul Dano) and the remainder of the film sees the one trying to humiliate and outmanoeuvre the other and disclaim each's strongly held values. It's a slow burn, this film, but DDL is on super form as a man striving for success but for it's own purpose. His wealth does not bring him contentedness nor, for that matter, does it bring joy to anyone else. This also demonstrates just how poor rural parts of the USA were at the turn of the 20th century, and at how vulnerable the population were to exploitation and the venality of the oilmen. The photography is immersive and the pace works well in drawing us into the perfectly constructed characterisations that were the natural successors to the earlier pioneers. I didn't love the conclusion. It seemed a little unnecessary, underwhelming - rushed even. The last ten minutes have an intensity of their own that though they well illustrate the skill of Dano and DDL, they just didn't quite wrap things up as I might have liked. Still, it's a great piece of cinema with some strong writing underpinning a series of lusts....",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
There Will Be Blood,"The word, 'masterpiece', is thrown around needlessly often, I'm guilty of it myself. However, if anyone was to call There Will Be Blood a masterpiece, I couldn't fault them for it. Despite its simple premise, it manages to reach such a deep and layered story, that for the most part, I was at a loss for words.At its core, There Will Be Blood in nothing more than a story about a man. A man who has insatiable greed and an endless and unsatisfiable need for more. However, not once did the movie feel simple or easy. There are so many threads that run throughout it that the final result becomes a harrowingly deep exploration of human nature. Indeed, it's thanks to its simplicity story-wise, that it can explore parts of humanity, such as ego, pride, greed and hatred, with such painstaking detail. What I found to be perhaps the most impressive part about There Will Be Blood was the level of intimacy it reached. Since the film focuses almost entirely on one man, he becomes such a close part of the experience that I often felt like I personally knew him. What makes that relationship so difficult, in the case of this movie, is the fact that Daniel, the character of focus, isn't a particularly nice person. While there are moments of joy and triumph that lead you to root for him, those moments are almost always turned into ones where you can't help but despise him. While I can't speak for everyone, for me, it was clear that what made There Will Be Blood so brilliant was the not only relationships that Daniel had with the other characters, but also the relationship he had with me, as a viewer.Although there is a lot to unpack narrative-wise, there are just as many things filmmaking-wise. One of my favourite parts about this film was the intensity and uncertainty of every scene. I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started watching. Although I had heard plenty of things about this film, as well as seen the rating it has on Letterboxd, I had no idea what it was going to be about. The poster, with its oil drill, certainly gave something away, but that was about it. While knowing a little more about it might've convinced me to see it earlier, I'm very glad that I went in completely blind. A lot of the film, I feel, relies on not knowing what's coming next. There are plenty of moments that would've potentially fallen flat had I known what was going to happen. Tension was built masterfully with an unnerving soundtrack, slow panning shots, and a constant sense of uncertainty. The characters do, of course, add their own flavour to the tension, which is especially apparent with the most significant side characters, whose motives are often left blurry.But the thing that was, without a doubt the highlight, was Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Daniel Plainview. The character he had to portray was one of conflict and hate, ego and pride, and above all else, greed and an endless hunger for more. However, what made Plainview so different from most similar characters, was his motives. Throughout the film, there are hints that he isn't simply after money, or power, or even influence. And although he often says that those pursuits are the reason for his competitive nature, it ultimately becomes clear that he isn't a man fuelled by a desire for material wealth. In the end, what gives him the greatest satisfaction is getting to say the last word. Daniel is a man who will never forget and will hold a grudge until the day he dies. And because his desires transcend those of wealth and power, he will never be satisfied no matter how successful he is. He doesn't see competition as a threat, rather he sees it as a chance for someone else than him to be successful. And it's that ego and pride that fuels him, the desire to be better than everyone else.It took me longer than it should've to see this masterpiece of a movie. There Will Be Blood more than deserves the praise it has received, and will, undoubtedly, continue to receive. On the surface, it's a surprisingly simple film, but as you dig in deeper, the layers start to appear. Indeed, I could've written a thousand words about the character of Daniel Plainview alone, but alas, I don't have the time for that. What I can say, though, is that there is no question about the brilliance of this film. It blew me away at almost every turn, and while I might not be eager to revisit it any time soon due to how heavy and tough it can be at times, it's a film that will stay with me for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A tale of madness and greed.,"There Will Be Blood may be one of the best movies made in the 2000's. Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is a masterpiece, and Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview should be considered the 8th Wonder of the World. If you ask me, this movie should have taken the award of Best Picture at the 80th Anniversary of the Oscars. This movie is just unbelievably breathtaking from beginning to end. I myself just finished watching it for the 5th time a few days ago, and to me that movie will never ever get old. For someone who has not seen this movie, I highly recommend it as long as you are not bored easily and care more about the characters and dialog rather than a magnificent storyline and persisting action.Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the great directors of our time. He has to be mentioned in the line up with Tarantino, the Coens, Darren Arronofsky, and in my opinion, even Scorcese. With P.T.A holding 3 of the 5 spots in my ""Top Five Favorite Movies"" list with: Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, and The Master, it's easy to tell that he is my favorite director and that is why i am praising this movie so highly. Just the way that he uses his camera angles and ability to direct his actors are both astounding. Paul Dano should have at least been nominated as Best Supporting Actor, with his role as Eli Sunday, if not have won it.

Pitch black soul of capitalism,"This film starts with a dark, almost demonic foreboding of doom and evil, accompanied by the harsh landscape and harsher score. The title also warns us of almost Biblical level horrors to come. An oil prospector works with grim determination, falls and presumably breaks his leg, finds oil and broken leg or no, somehow crawls to the claims office to stake his claim. This accident is the first of several. We see the human animal at it's lowest and meanest throughout the 150 minutes of this bitter film. The bottomless pit of capitalistic greed is pitted against religion, and if the first here defeats the latter - which is shown to be far from truly pious anyway - it does so by simultaneously destroying itself. The oil man's last line is 'I am finished' - and he truly is. He never really stopped falling ever since that first drop in the shaft. This is a riveting, nasty film, though there is some light in the almost fairy tale love that develops in the background between the oil man's adopted son and the preacher's younger sister, both of whom offer a ray of innocence in the general nastiness. The tale of the oil man's long lost brother adds one more nail in this coffin of human misery and despair. Performances by all are very fine with Paul Dano walking a fine line between innocence and cunning, while Daniel Day Lewis shows the human animal trapped by its own pride, greed and ambition into an almost frenzied desire to step all over its fellows, till there's no one left to threaten it's isolation.",,Anonymous,Drama

Simply unforgettable.,"The closing sequence delivers on the promise of the movie's title in a manner that keeps viewers discussing it long after the picture ends. ""There Will Be Blood"" is not a movie that disappears quietly. Paul Thomas Anderson's epic masterpiece ""There will be Blood"" is a steadfast reflection of the very essence of capitalism in America, where domination, not gain, is the ultimate objective, and by any means necessary.When we first meet Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1898, he's mining for gold in a shaft he has dug into the ground of his Texas property. He finds what he's looking for, and perhaps more. Several years later, he has shifted his focus from gold to oil and he has been able to hire some hands. When an accident results in a death, Daniel finds himself with an infant orphan to care for. He raises the child, known as H.W., to be his own. By 1912, Daniel has become a well-known oilman, and he his looking to expand his empire. Accompanied by his partner, Fletcher (Ciarán Hinds), and his son (Dillon Freasier), he travels to California to follow a promising lead. What he finds there astonishes him. He seeks to buy large parcels of property, but he is impeded in his goal by the evangelist preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who wants Daniel to donate $10,000 to the local church before he sells. After the contract is signed, however, Daniel reneges on the deal. Shortly thereafter, once the first drill has become operational, there is an accident that results in an explosion that fuels a major oil fire and costs H.W. his hearing.For most of the film, Daniel is a fascinating character. He's a mass of contradictions: charismatic, ugly, easygoing, ruthless, silver-tongued, plain-spoken, gentle, violent. He's smart and understands how to manipulate every situation to his advantage. He understands the business of oil and transforms himself from a poor miner into a wealthy businessman. Unfortunately, the more power Daniel amasses, the more corrupt and dissolute he becomes. Anderson chronicles Daniel's personality decay intelligently. He establishes the character as an admirable individual, but eventually his morality slowly erodes. The lives of these two, Daniel and Eli, are self-centered, cunning, and ruthless men who collide and lead us into the dark, unpaved path of madness of self-destruction driven by their unrelenting greed.""There Will Be Blood"" is a rich character study of a fascinating individual who is by turns likable, loathsome, admirable, monstrous, and driven. What Day-Lewis brings to the characterization is more exquisite and complex than anything even Anderson might have imagined at the outset. His Plainview is the most gripping film performance of the year, and as his religious foil, Dano also reveals unsuspected depths. Long, but so well crafted with terrific cinematography, and beautifully written/directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Daniel Day-Lewis and Robert Elswit both earned Academy Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Character-driven rather than plot-driven,"It keeps you engaged because of the great acting from DDL. The scenes between him and Paul Dano were always quite powerful and were the best parts of the movie. I wish there were even more scenes between them, because the tension between both characters was great to watch.However, it did lack something for me, especially given how it was highly rated. Movie lacked pace and story progression. It failed to connect with me on an emotional level, which I usually look for in a top-tier movie.A+ for the acting, but while the initial premise is great, the story is not amazing.

$19 and 2 1/2 hours you'll never get back.,"If I wanted to watch John Huston, I'd have rented Chinatown. Daniel Day-Lewis does a great impression of Huston in this film. The unrelenting sociopathic nature of Plainview wears over time. A long time. There doesn't seem to be any point except oilmen are ruthless and evil, and religion is a scam. There is a trend of excessive violence and brutality in many films these days, instead of a good story and great characterizations. Ciaran Hinds is underutilized Much is promised- nothing much delivered but an ""ambitious man"" story. Taken from ""Citizen Kane"", and a cheap supernatural thriller hinted at when it seems God will take a hand. He never does. There is also a frisson of ""Moby Dick"", man pursuing the leviathan.

Excellent All Around!,"Dark, Depressing and Thought-Provoking, This Masterpiece is based on an extremely Shrewd, Powerful, Terrifying performance of a complicated character perfected by an extraordinary Daniel Day-Lewis who has given one of the best performance of the decade, along with excellent direction by an extremely talented Paul Thomas Anderson,who has also done a great job in the screenplay of the story, There Will Be Blood is a real Dark Masterpiece on an extremely complicated character perfected by Day-Lewis and through sheer hard and excellent work by Director Paul Thomas Anderson.The Story of the movie is quite Unique, about an Oil Prospector named Daniel Plainview, and how he gets obsessed with Money,Power and Greed after getting to know he can get hold of all the important oil mines in the country,while alienating friends and making his relationship with all the ''friends or family' he has in his way to being rich and in his continued obsession of money and power. Quite An Unique and terrifying character showing us about how the oil dealers really were and what greed of money and power can do to a Human Being.Well I Really Don't Know what I have to say of Day-Lewis's performance here. He is just quite extraordinary in his role of Daniel Plainview, which is an extremely complicated and difficult character to portray, but he has done an excellent job in perfecting the role of this character, and his acting is just top class throughout the movie, at times it really overshadows the other things in the movie, and this really has to be one of the best performances of the decade and one of the most powerful I Have Seen In My Life. Paul Dano is also extremely good in his character of Paul Sunday who is a priest, and his character is just the opposite of Plainview's character, and their chemistry is just sparkling. Dano has done his character justice by giving a really great performance. The Other actors in the movie(specially the child of Plainview) have also done a really good job in making this movie an extremely well acted and portrayed film.Absolutely Sublime Work from Paul Thomas Anderson in this movie, and this was also his debut work, and he has done an amazing job in showing the life and rise of Daniel Plainview perfectly, so well that at times I was thinking i was in the characters time and not in the 21st century! He really has done the movie justice by perfecting the direction, helping the inexperienced actors specially Dano give excellent performances, helping the staff in their work, and he really is a excellent director and needs to be appreciated. Top Marks to him for making such an excellent film.The Story Written by Upton Sinclair is quite excellent and unique,and he has done a great job in describing how Greed,Money and Power can do things to a Human Being(here being Daniel Plainview) and how he can do such terrible and dirty things to achieve what he really wants. Paul Thomas Anderson has done an extremely good job in the screen writing of the movie, and he really is multi-talented! The Cinematography in the movie is just sublime! The Cinematographer has done an amazing job in showing the times of Plainview and I was practically blown away by some of the breathtaking scenes in the movie! Top Marks to him! The Music throughout the movie is excellent and keeps the atmosphere in the movie in check, and top marks to John Greenwood in giving an excellent background score to the movie,specially the music in the ending credits.Well I Really cant understand why This was only appreciated for its acting and cinematography, this is really a near perfect film and Paul Thomas Anderson needed to get more accolades for this, but anyways in my books this will remain an extremely powerful film and superb bio-pic based on a extremely complicated and shrewd character, and I recommend it to every good movie lover.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Acting 101,This is a must watch for any up and coming actor. Daniel Day Lewis is one of those actors that COMPLETELY inhabits his character. This is just my opinion but I don't know that this film would even be watchable without Lewis in it. The long shot scenes stay captivating simply because of the emotion that Lewis shows throughout. Much like James Gandolfini in The Sopranos you can always tell what the character is feeling by their face and body language. The story itself is intriguing but it's much more so because of the way Lewis portrays Daniel.This is definitely a must watch for film buffs. For the Marvel and super hero people this is probably a skip a there is not a ton of action. There certainly is magic but it's the magic of one human being completely becoming another.

This Film Will Make You Hug Your TV (If you can fit your arms around it),"This film was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who has been one of my favourite directors for quite some time now.

"great performance, where's the story","Daniel Day Lewis puts in a great performance as Proudview, an oil man. This is the story of a man consumed by greed, the need to dominate others and without any redeeming qualities. He is a fascinating character. The problem with the movie is that he is slowly unveiled to us in the first hour, but then there is another 90 minutes to the movie where additional details are revealed, but nothing more is revealed about his character. There is no plot, just the arc of his life. Unlike some other unlikable characters, e.g. Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, there is no compelling reason to keep watching.I have not read Oil, the Upton Sinclair novel, but I have to believe that something is amiss when the men from Standard Oil are treated as normal but greedy men rather than the same harsh treatment of Proudview.The soundtrack has got to be the worst I have ever heard. OK, I get it. Proudview is a man whose entire life is composed of sour notes, but 2.5 hours of sour notes is just unrelenting. I nominate the score as the Plan 9 from Outer Space of soundtracks.Again I haven't read the novel and Hollywood has never needed to adhere to the source material anyway, but a battle a wills between the greedy oil man and the hypocritical young preacher (Sunday) would have made a more interesting story and still be true to Sinclair's darkly negative view of powerful men.Finally I think there is something wrong with critical review when a great performance is sufficient to earn a movie a great review. Yes this movie takes lots of risks and fails in many of them, but just give an honest review of the movie as a nice try but a miss.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

There's more than just blood..,"Daniel Day-Lewis delivers an emotionally-draining performance as Daniel Plainview, a California oil tycoon whose greed and visceral need for vengeance allow us to view what is arguably one of the most bone-chilling and emotionally corrupt characters in movie history.This movie was revolutionary in my eyes because of the introduction of a new style of character, and a deviation from the standard movie plot. The film revolves around the life of this character Daniel Plainview and it is an exploration of character above all. It is not the type of movie that will please the majority of movie-goers, and this movie was released around the time of a similarly deviant movie in No Country For Old Men, and most of the plaudits go to the latter.This movie is profound and compelling, it explores a number of themes and it is definitely a movie with a mature aspect to it. I highly recommend seeing a film like this, because although its relative calmness, it is a unique plot, and coming across such a powerful acting performance such as Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal in this movie will be difficult.

"Pretentious, rambling, overbearing","I went to this movie with high expectations, hoping for a powerful and moving viewing experience. But it didn't happen for me. The persona of the movie is the same as the persona of Daniel Plainview: didactic, driven, harsh, bullying; demanding and then not delivering. Don't take me as a philistine-- I can appreciate Citizen Cane, Greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, etc., etc. I just don't see that this movie rises to that level. Give me Chinatown or The Godfather or Scarface, but don't try to tell me that Daniel Day-Lewis with a Sean Connery affect is anywhere near as good an embodiment of evil as Orson Wells as a drunken corrupt cop in a broiling border town. I would have rather spent my time re-watching Once Upon a Time in the West to get my strange music and wide open silent spaces punctuated by violent outbursts. Give me Gregory Peck as Ahab--at least I can appreciate what drove him to his madness. I wish I could put my finger on what really bothers me so much here. I haven't seen No Country for Old Men yet but I recently read the novel (before I knew it was being produced) and found it fascinatingly brilliant. I understand Upton Sinclair's viewpoint on the American Dream (I teach American literature) and can appreciate a good anti-hero when I see one.

Loved this Film mainly due to Daniel Day Lewis!,"Just watched this on Channel 4 and was immediately drawn into the movie from the outset. It is not often that a film is so well produced and lit, that leaves such a memorable leading character and cast that it warrants comment and commendation. Not a great fan of Daniel Day Lewis but then again he has only ever been witnessed in my left foot that did not leave an impression. It can now be seen why he has won Oscars for performances. A seamless flow of talent from an actor that does not for one second appear to be acting!It is a relief to come across films like this that separate them from the masses of other also ran movies produced to remind us of how difficult it is to get the mood, lighting, direction and the right actors casted to produce something special.

Danial Day Lewis,"There will be blood is a tycoon epic about a character. It is the Citizen Kane of the 21st century and will remain a masterpiece in everybody's head. There will be blood brilliantly shows the darker side of capitalist, where the most despicable people thrive and will do anything to make their money. The movie also expertly tackles religion and it what seems like a battle of capitalism and religion, the lines between the two get blurred.This movie has explosive set pieces and great production. What really blasts this movie into masterpiece territory is the performances of Paul Dano and Danial Day-Lewis. With the ladder being the standout. The performances allow us to bite deeply into these characters, this movie has a ton of substance.Overall, I can recommend this to everyone, specifically older folks who enjoyed historical epics.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Masterful,"Paul Thomas Anderson is, my honest opinion, the Stanley Kubrick of my generation. Kubrick had a way of making films that weren't just entertaining but also intelligent. There is also the fact of the incredibly haunting scores that accompanied his films. There Will Be Blood is the film that I believe will be what proves his genius. The film delivers an interesting commentary on religion and on capitalism.In his previous works such as Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love, he worked on a more small scale. There Will Be Blood is nothing short of an epic film. It has a grand scale much in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia does. The grand scope of the film displays how large the landscapes are and just how much he has to conquer. The score of the film is just as compelling as a Bernard Herrmann score. Jonny Greenwood is on his way to becoming one hell of a film composer.Finally it to be mentioned that the main reason to watch this film is because of the once in a lifetime performance done by Daniel-Day Lewis. He is a ruthless, but not heartless oil man. At times he shows the love he has for his adopted son but I always get the feeling that he might just be doing it for a purpose to show off a fatherly like perception that he wants his clients to think he has. The end is an amazing cinematic finish that can't be overlooked.If you think that this film is too long then you are probably not paying attention to what a good film is. This film is one for the ages and I think that everyone should owe it to themselves to watch it and feel something from it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The issue I have is that it is a difficult film to connect with emotionally and it's pacing is off, often meandering and losing it's punch. I consider myself a bit of a film snob, but at the end of the day, a ""best picture"" should not only have artistic merit, it should be consistently entertaining.

The Promise of Early California: Unimaginable Riches For Those WIthout Constraints,"It seems to me that many critics of this film want it to be High Noon or My Darling Clementine, a traditional western with a linear plot where the good guy wins, want it to be something other than what it is. The title signals a good deal: There Will Be Blood: a certain tip-off to the tone and direction of the plot, a cruel and brutal study of the acquisitive personality.In the stark, rock-strewn hills of Central California at the turn of the last century, a man, not unlike his financial business counterparts in the early 21st, tries to find meaning in ownership, in denuding the earth of it's riches and turning them into individual wealth--it's an age-old story of the choice between love of family and human consideration and the amassing of great wealth. In the pursuit of power, in this in-depth study of human greed, discriminating viewers will experience a scathing indictment of an individual's detachment from all we like to think of as humane.The Daniel Day Lewis character, not unlike the more recent financial barons thieves on 21st Century Wall Street, aims to amass millions and keep them. His story, filmed brilliantly against the stark simplicity of once unspoiled land, and underscored by a sensitive, though unconventional musical score, is laid out persuasively: it's likely that another will have a difficult time laying siege to this human engine of destruction.Performances are unilaterally brilliant in this dark, somber meditation on American history, and while not particularly cheery, such information has no need to be--it is enough that the film can be a motivating and powerful experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Most Overrated Film of 2007!,"Paul Thomas Anderson once again fashions an original and ambitious film of layers filled with challenging themes that, despite producing an occasional scene of brutal realism, fails to be that good. This two-hour and forty-minute story of one man's greedy ambition and his unwavering quest for wealth at whatever cost, reminded me of a Charles Dickens story where all the characters are caricaturesand that is not a good thing.Daniel Plainview is an oilman who is seeking to make a fortune by finding a piece of real estate with a profitable oil well. He has no family except for a baby boy he adopts and quickly turns into his young prodigy. He is approached by a boy, Paul (played by Paul Dano), who tells him of a ranch where there is such an abundance of oil it is seeping out of the ground. This is all Daniel needs to hear before setting off to find it. When he arrives he quickly goes about buying up the ranch as well as all the surrounding land and then with a crew starts drilling. He does run into some confrontation with Eli (also played by Paul Dano) the brother of Paul. Eli realizes the oil is worth something and wants a share of the profit for his church which he is minister of. Daniel agrees to this, but once he strikes oil and starts raking in money, he completely ignores his deal with Eli as his true colors are shown and he slowly turns completely bitter to everyone around him.This is one of those films that seems to easily garner many award nominations and termed ""masterpiece!"", but when you go see it you are left wondering if you saw the same film. There were simply too many flaws in this film to be even close to a masterpiece.To start, as I said before there are moments of true brilliance and some scenes were so engrossing that you would hang on every motion and line of the characters only to be shut back out the moment the scene was over or the acting would become so ferocious that serious parts were almost humorous. PTA, the director, seems to have this style of pushing his actors almost into the territory of over-acting (as was the case of Tome Cruise and Julian Moore in Magnolia).The production was nothing new or magnificent. The cinematography was mediocre almost annoying at parts as it showed close-ups for extended periods of time. The score was a ""nail-on-chalkboard"" type with every note out of tune and absolutely no melody just repetitive clicking, banging, or stringing contrasted against the silence of the plains.For the story to be almost three hours long it was too focused on the main character, so that the supporting characters (none of who are women) appear more like those extras who just have a few lines before they head to the next studio. Because of this fact I felt the reality was taken out of it as Daniel Plainview seemed to exist in his own world were there was no society and the people surrounding him were so vacant of any character that everyone did as he said. Also the lack of a female character (supporting or main) was a big mistake.I give this film points for trying to bring a message, but there were too many messages and themes that got mixed together so at the end I was wondering if it was trying to show the affects of greed, money cannot buy happiness, capitalism vs. religion, etc. All of these themes are good but when they are not made clear enough.Lastly I feel that since it is not an entertaining film, it is more a character study filled with different themes to critically analyze (which I LOVE) that the director should have chosen a different actor and story to illustrate those themes instead of oil drilling, Daniel-Day Lewis and nearly three hours of screen time (half of which has Daniel covered in oil beyond the point of recognition).",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

A towering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as corrupt oil man...,"Blood, oil and religion seem to be the heated topics for this version of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil"", and the presentation is starkly realistic from beginning to end, with DANIEL DAY-LEWIS giving another one of his towering performances in the central role of a corrupt, guilt-ridden man who can't talk about his evil deeds.His antagonist is a preacher (PAUL DANO) of hellfire and damnation, played with an oily mixture of naiveté and money madness, who wants his fair share of the wealth on his doorstep. It's really the battle between these two men that grips most of the story and leads to a startling climax.While all the performances are valid enough, it's a shame to see CIARIN HINDS so wasted in a role that barely gives him a chance to utter more than a few lines as a steadfast friend. More prominent in the supporting cast are DILLON FREASIER as the boy adopted by Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) when his real father is killed in a mining accident toward the beginning of the story. The boy is led to believe that he is the real son, only because Day-Lewis wants to use him and his innocent face as a way to secure deals. When the boy is a grown man and wants to move away with his new bride, Day-Lewis ruthlessly exposes the truth about him being an orphan and banishes him from his life with hateful curses.All of this is never fully explained, but we do know that he has a hatred for most people which he openly admits to a man who poses as his long lost brother Henry (KEVIN J. O'CONNOR). Here too, we can sense a dangerous relationship built on lies and moving toward a violent climax.DANIEL DAY-LEWIS inhabits his role with great intensity and although he is said to base his speech pattern on John Huston, he looks and sounds like he's chanelling Walter Huston as he appeared in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" as the old prospector. There are moments when his facial expression reflects the sort of penetrating gaze and wicked gleam in his eyes that Walter Huston had. It's almost uncanny. At any rate, Day-Lewis certainly deserved his Best Actor Oscar for this gripping film, stark but relentlessly moving and sometimes emotionally draining to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Apart from Daniel Day Lewis's acting brilliance, the movie on it's own was really good and most important...very original and unique.The directing and cinematography was beautiful and the story good.Having said all that...I came to the conclusion after buying this film and watching it, that if you take a director such as Paul Thomas Anderson and an actor like Daniel Day Lewis and make them do a story about oil-business, greed and selfishness...you get a masterpiece such as There Will Be Blood!I haven't given any movie a perfect 10 because in my opinion, no movie is perfect, but this one definitely snatches the 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black and cold at heart,"There are so many reviews here, it's unlikely this will get read. So I'll just talk about a few things about this film that I find interesting.Great as Daniel Day Lewis' performance in this dark, soulless film certainly is, the criticisms come thick and fast now I've finally seen it, long after all the hype has died down.I can't help but wonder whether, in casting Day Lewis, the director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't, just slightly, come to regret his casting choice. He created, in every sense, a bit of a monster. There's just no room for any competition at all in a film with a character  and played by an actor  of this magnitude. He fills the screen, he is its black heart, his voice drowns out others, his desires, his wiles, his greed, his determination  so much so that any other actor appears literally lacking (which is very unfair to some of them). Paul Dano's character seems ineffective, insufficiently greedy and grasping. Ciaran Hinds is wastefully thrown away in a small part for which he appears to have been cast solely for his interesting face. His face is very interesting, but his voice is still more so. If it wasn't to be used, why cast him? Why didn't we get the chance to see more of what HW becomes, and (** spoiler alert **) how he defies his father? I now feel, having thought about it for a while, as though I was having another, tedious chapter in The Formation of Great America  ironically dark in tone of course, to suit our modern tastes  shoved down my throat. This chapter is noble enough to show the bad with the good. At its worst it's a dull historical lecture about greed and development cleverly disguised as art; beautiful to watch, masterfully constructed, but black and empty and as full of rhetoric as a failing politician's speeches.I can't make it out: fashion will eventually pass and this film will surely be abandoned to time, and will no longer be acclaimed as the single best thing to come out of Hollywood sincePaul Thomas Anderson. I reserve my enthusiasms for more heartfelt, lowbrow stuff: the quality may be lower but the heart is at least still there, beating and feeling.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
What was that insufferable buzzing in my ears?,"This movie had the most annoying score of any I have ever seen.

I had to leave after an hour and twenty minutes because I just couldn't stand it anymore. If the movie were otherwise compelling, I might have suffered through the headache-inducing noise, but the scenes were so slow and long, for no ostensible purpose. If each scene had been cut by one-third to one-half, there would have been no loss of content or dramatic narrative and the movie might have been improved considerably. But it still would have been a movie focused on two foul, shallow, uninteresting people.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant. where to start?,"I bet that there will be thousands of extremely long media student theses about this movie in the future. There is so much depth and so much description in every scene, every set, every line and every expression that I don't know if I could ever get tired of watching this movie. I have watched this movie four times, and if it was rereleased in theaters I would spend 15 bucks to go see it again on the big screen.First, Daniel Day-Lewis was extraordinary in this film. While many people could agree that DDL's performance here may be one of the greatest ever in cinema, it doesn't dominate the picture. The strength of the characters, the other acting, the sets, the direction and story are equally amazing. One of the most extraordinary things about TWBB is that you don't focus on the film making; there are very few period pieces that don't make you think about the sets, cinematography, props, accents, wardrobe and historical authenticity of what is showcased. In terms of the strength of the ""forth wall"", the only other movie I think compares to this one is the Outlaw Josey Wales.While simple, the story is incredible deep. People who call this movie slow should probably watch it again more carefully. If anything this film moves too fast to really appreciate all of the methods and themes used to progress the story. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and every frame of this movie fulfills that promise. I imagine that a full examination of this film could fill up a thousand page hard back book fairly easily.After appreciating this film, I have trouble considering other movies masterpieces. I think that is reviewers had watched this film multiple times that it would have sweep all of the awards. I also think that there Will Be Blood will be rated as one of the greatest films ever made.The fact that in 2008 this film didn't use any digital intermediate, it was shoot on petrochemical film, cut using scissors and taped together in an almost century old way, is just another aspect that makes this film so mind bogglingly great. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Hollywood's last hurray, and we never see a movie of this quality again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good solid acting along with an incredible story. A Masterpiece.,"Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson have created one of the greatest movies of this time and perhaps of all time. There is so much ambition, brilliance, detail, and probably everything that you would put in a great movie. I don't think that anything, and anything could top this level of amazement for me. The film has put me through a cathartic and dogmatic experience by just watching. Truly outstanding on every level. A masterpiece One of the great things about this film is that it cannot be put in a specific genre, or cannot even be pinned down to what 3-4-5 different genres got mixed into the end result, because this film simply defies that question. It's too universal, complex, and humane to be categorized easily. It's not even an art film or a western exactly. It echoes classic Hollywood, but it's way more ambivalent and ambigous than that. It's definitely a highly artistic piece of periodic cinema from an American auteur in the age of postmodernism. I cannot define it much further.. I love the music throughout the film. It defines the energy. Just a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. DDL morphs the character so well I can almost feel the aches and pains from years of hard work and injury.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not a spiritually uplifting film,"There have been a lot of extremely negative opinions posted on IMDb about this film, so, if like me, you've watched the film, or intend to watch it for the very first time and are still a little bemused by the amount of poor reviews on the first 1-10 pages on IMDb, perhaps a little explanation is required.The critics loved this film, followed by heaps of praise and over-exaggerated hype on its initial release. By delving deeper, I discovered that most of the negative opinions were posted during the immediate aftermath of the film's release, mostly by very bored and disappointed movie goers who expected a lot more entertainment; a faster moving movie with an obvious plot and lots of action and BLOOD. This film doesn't quite adhere to these conditions. It's slow-paced, cinematic, sinister and brooding. After adjusting my IMDb search parameters and looking at the most recent reviews, five or more years after its initial release, I noticed a much more balanced critical opinion. People seem less disappointed and more appreciative of the film from a neutral perspective, perhaps like me.Yes, the movie is rather long at two-and-a-half hours in total, but after it was over I felt a little disgruntled at it ending so abruptly. OK, that might just be me, but I wanted more. It's not an epic tale along the lines of The Godfather, how could it be? The plot is far less complex, the depth of acting isn't on the same level and the deeply planned long-term maliciousness of Michael Corleone is absent, but that doesn't stop the film from being a dark, sinister, negative story about a man hell-bent on getting exactly what he wants at the expense of love, family, friends and peer companionship. He's probably the most unbearable man who's ever lived, so it might be difficult for many people to relate to or sympathise with a man like that, a person so forcefully driven to do whatever he wants at the expense of everything else. How can a man achieve so much success and wield so much power and yet be so contemptuous of life? He believes in nothing except his own will.I found the film invigorating throughout, never once getting bored or questioning any particular aspects, but neither did it make me feel good about myself, others or mankind. It did a fantastic job of reminding me that there are a lot of people out there who don't care about me or my concerns. I'm certainly not going to let this jolt of realisation provoke me into giving this film a knee-jerk 1 or 2 star review.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Without a Doubt One of Daniel Day-Lewis's Greatest Performances,","There Will Be Blood is a fantastic movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The character development is also top notch,especially for the main character,Daniel Plainview,you go on a long journey with this character for two and a half hours and the characters whole story is very well written.It is without a doubt one of Daniel Day-Lewis's greatest characters,he puts all his heart and soul in to this role and well deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role,you wouldn't even believe it is actually him.The only think that really bothered me is that the title is very off putting,it makes it sound like it will be a very violent intense movie,which it really isn't,I got why it was called There Will be Blood toward the end,but as you're watching it you expecting a lot of violence and war to eventually break out in some way,which dosen't happen.There Will be Blood is a great drama that I would recommend to all moviegoers.Set in early 20th century Texas,Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis),a self made tycoon,will stop at nothing to expand his empire.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Epic Mediocrity,"This leisurely-paced drama recounts the life and times of a ruthless oil tycoon. There are fine performances from Day-Lewis (seemingly doing a John Huston impression) and Dano, but there is little to the plot to hold one's interest for nearly three hours. Anderson is the emperor with no clothes. As with ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia,"" he makes an overlong film out of mediocre material, believing that audiences will equate great length with great film (and apparently the masses have done just that).

The film itself is 'grimy', sparse, and feels real, the era portrayed with precision and attention to detail. The movie is well written and dialog is delivered with plausibility. Screenplay is workable and character interplay quite believable. I can't rate it higher, because overall it just left me feeling hollow, as though I had witnessed an exercise in futility, kind of a bummer.I think you may enjoy it as a rental if you enjoy a well made period piece, with top notch acting.................",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"intriguing dialogue, a carefully-selected cast, a brilliant score, and a dark plot that makes the viewer think.","There Will Be Blood Film ReviewIn There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson showcases his skills as a director and screenplay writer in this twisted tale of a man's ultimate downfall. The film is critically acclaimed and finished second for Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 2008, only behind No Country for Old Men, respectively. Anderson is able to display his talent through intriguing dialogue, a carefully-selected cast, a brilliant score, and a dark plot that makes the viewer think.The film takes place mostly in Southern California beginning in the late 1800's but eventually goes well into the early 20th century. A young silver miner named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day- Lewis) strikes oil while hunting for silver in New Mexico. While raising his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Plainview becomes rich and is considered ""the oil man"" throughout California. One night, a young man finds Daniel and informs him of land bountiful with oil near the town of Little Boston. Daniel hurries to the small town with his son in search of the sought-after land. When he strikes oil there, Daniel becomes even wealthier and his ""family business"" thrives. However, as Daniel's wealth soars, his life begins to change for the worst and he spirals down until he becomes the corrupted, hateful man he is by the end of the film.While making the film, Anderson had to be careful when it came to choosing who would play Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the two main characters, but he makes a seemingly flawless decision by selecting Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. Day-Lewis returns the favor by giving one of the best performances of the 2000's and creating a character that is not only believable, but also relatable to the audience. He brings intensity and passion to an opening twenty minutes of no dialogue that otherwise, would not be nearly as interesting. Audiences see the evolution of Plainview from beginning to end due to Day- Lewis simply owning his role throughout the film's entirety. Anderson is considered as above most screenplay writers and directors when it comes to delivering a solid script and it is easy to see why in the film. By avoiding dialogue in the first twenty minutes, the viewer is able to immediately connect with Plainview's physically grueling lifestyle. This is a bold move by Anderson but it ends up paying off in a big way. Throughout the rest of There Will Be Blood, the characters' dialogue is provoking and helps drive the plot by creating conflict between Plainview and the people involved in his life. To make the film more intense, a score, by Jonny Greenwood, and several cues are used to create a sense of heavy tension between Daniel and life itself while also providing foreshadowing. Some critics consider music to be a tool that can be used correctly or incorrectly in film. It can make a movie boom or bust. Greenwood's score is key to the success of the film and its strong influence on viewers. Anderson also touches on several key themes in the movie that almost everyone can identify with in one way or another. Audiences are able to see the struggle for power and wealth and what its consequences can be. Religion and its positive or negative influence on a man's life is also prevalent in both Daniel and Eli. Both men fight one another to become ""God"" in their own sense. Anderson's dark tale of a man's downfall reigns in critical acclaim and for good reason. The film is strong in many categories. However, one issue that was made apparent was the pacing. At times, certain scenes felt drawn out and overdone. One scene, in particular, where Daniel and his ""brother"" are in a bar late at night, offers little to drive the plot and could arguably be removed from the film. This and other small instances could lead to some audience members becoming bored or disinterested especially considering the fairly long length of the film itself. Nonetheless, this small issue certainly does not outweigh the many positives the movie offers from a filmmaking standpoint. Paul Thomas Anderson's film is certainly not for everyone. The film has limited action sequences while also containing dialogue that actually makes viewers think. Many will certainly not like the cold, abrupt ending. However, by looking at the movie critically, one can see the many strengths the movie contains from both a filmmaking standpoint and as a lesson on life. People that can catch on to key themes and also enjoy tragedies or quests will love this movie. There Will Be Blood is a hit and is worthy of a 9 out of 10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A time capsule to when life and business was hard,"Having never gotten around to watching There Will be Blood until some 16 years after it's release I found myself with an afternoon spare so I decided to see what this film was about considering it's mostly positive reviews and to see if there is more to the film than the Meme happy ""I Drink Your Milkshake"" line
Well quite simply this is an absolute stone cold classic , mostly to the enigma that is Daniel Day Lewis but it's has the most wonderful cast to help him along.In the years since it's release the cinematic world has had a dramatic shift firstly with the MCU taking over then with Covid decimating film making such as that this classic style of story driven movies simply don't get the oxygen they need .I fully understand the kind of writing and film making aren't a straight forward thing or every man and his dog would be producing epics
But the big movie companies should be striving to create this kind of masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A Very Well-Made Film, but No Best Picture","I don't quite understand why There Will be Blood is being given praise such as 'the greatest film ever' and 'best picture of the year'. This is certainly not the film I saw.Paul Thomas Anderson's epic tale of greed, pride, and selfishness is indeed a masterpiece in terms of technical achievement. While giving respect to classic film-making, Anderson's film feels very new. Large credit for this has to go to the groundbreaking original score by Johnny Greenwood of Radiohead. His score is unlike any orchestral composition you've ever heard, very eerie and almost tense. I know that one of the people I saw it with said they hated the score. I thought it served its purpose quite well. Besides that, the directing really is very well-done with eye-catching cinematography, great costumes, and good writing.But let's get down to the real thing: Daniel Day-Lewis. There is no denying that his performance as oilman Daniel Plainview in this film is truly the best of the year, really of many years. He creates a character that is truly heartbreaking and disgusting in his utter disregard for anything but his own success. Even when he can feel the disappointment in himself, he can't bring himself to change his ways. He still serves only himself and can't stand to see anyone else succeed. Paul Dano also serves up a brave and somewhat disturbing performance of his own as the hellfire preacher who opposes Daniel.The film however is far from perfect. Several subplots are hard to follow and one in particular is very confusing. I still can't quite make sense of it. Obviously some kind of symbolism was meant, but it didn't come through. And the film is very long, too long in fact. The first fifteen minutes are pure silence, a unique beginning that got old fast. While the story of Daniel is truly heartbreaking and intriguing to watch, many of the story lines are drawn out far too long. Some have called this ""character development""- I call it slow moving. It's high-time for the end when it gets there.At heart, There Will be Blood is a character sketch of a really despicable man. The story is certainly worth watching, however unfortunately drawn out. Don't go in expecting a light and stimulating time at the movies- you won't get it. This film's a real downer, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But perhaps with this film you're just down too long. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

The real deal,"I saw this movie for the first time last night and was so surprised by its quality. For some reason, in my mind, I had always associated this film with No Country For Old Men, probably because they were released around the same time. Based on previews and some reviews I had read, I thought this was going to be the same hyper-violent artsy shock film. (I'm not trying to insult No Country, it was a great movie, but I stand by that evaluation.) I was so pleasantly surprised to see the unexpected- a completely beautiful, fascinating and honest movie. In fact, the lack of artsy pretension was what struck me most. The superb acting made it raw and believable. The characters avoid becoming caricatures, in spite of the intensity and extremes of their personas. So many aspects of the film were so obviously Kubrick-inspired that it did teeter on the verge of plagiarism at times, but the movie has enough of its own original merits that I wasn't overly put off by that. I'm not sure this movie got its fair shake. We heard so much hyperbole about films like American Beauty, Slumdog Millionaire, even Titanic (wow), and yet this one, in spite of winning some Academy Awards, seems at risk of slipping through the cracks in terms of its enduring legacy.

There Will Be Salad Tossing,"About 7 StarsDaniel Day-Lewis DOES deserve a nomination. Though the flaws of the movie can't be dismissed. Dano's acting is utterly eclipsed by Day-Lewis,which works against the telling of the story. Also, over the 40 year course of the story there's zero age progression on DD-L or Dano, who always looks 14. Did Anderson think that was cute?Little House On The Prairie meets A Clockwork Orange (but neutered to a virtual PG-13), with some vibes from the original Planet Of The Apes.Cinematography, Tempo and Acting are fantastic. Ambition is the most critical element in this movie; and I give it to Anderson... that he makes the point that The Meek Are Blessed, even if terrorized by the ruthless.This movie though is a major criticism against Americans; you can't construct a universe where the greatest businessman and religious person are reckless without saying ""Hey, This is how the world is.""It blurs the line between between ambition and corruption; like cheering for ignorance. I am not drawn into movies about nihilists. If you think christians and capitalists suck then this may be your movie. To be fair to Anderson, there are businessmen and christians in this flick that aren't nasty; they just have no ambition... so where's the socialist white knight, Anderson? Or should Americans just take a f-ing leap? This story works better as a story than it does as a movie: Movies are a visual medium; symmetry can't just break for the ending, then call it clever. For the better part of 2 and a half hours Anderson immerses us in sweeping vistas of the California wilderness... which leads to us spending the last 15 minutes in the main character's basement.(?) I don't understand how this made sense to Anderson while story-boarding.When I think of PT I think of Magnolia, Boogie Nights and Hard Eight. When I think of Quenton Tarantino I think of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. For me this flick might be for PT what Kill Bill is for Tarantino.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A shallow film with some great performances,"The real reason to see this movie is for Daniel Day-Lewis's incredible performance which reminded me of his performance in GANGS OF NEW YORK crossed with Jack Nicholson's in THE SHINING.My biggest criticism of the movie is that it didn't follow through on the whole theme of the price of modernity. The price of modernity is even more of an issue today than it was in 1911, and on both an international and local scale. An outsider comes to town and suggests you compromise your way of life, and in return, society in general will prosper, but nowhere near as much as the stranger will prosper. And who's to say whether or not society really prospers?All of this is fascinating, philosophically dense stuff, so it was a let down for me that the movie abandoned this theme and went for the mad psychopath plot crossed with the sad billionaire plot that we've seen before in countless other movies. I definitely recommend the movie, Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is certainly worth the price of admission, but from a thematic point of view, the movie is much more thin than it ought to have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

I actually think DD-L was not right for this part,"Though I'll probably get flamed for saying this, I don't think Daniel Day-Lewis was right for this part. I should preface my remarks by saying that I see around 30 independent films a year, consider myself a film buff, have studied American Naturalism (of which Sinclair's book Oil! is a part), and unlike many here, actually liked Magnolia. I also have nothing against Daniel Day-Lewis. But I think he was too florid in this role, operatic almost to the point of silliness. Watching the great Ciarin Hinds playing Daniel Plainview's right hand man, you could almost see Hinds saying to himself, ""For God's sake tone it down there, Dan."" I realize PTA was trying to say something about how Daniel Plainview is larger than life, etc., and I also realize that many of the main characters in naturalistic novels come off this way on the page (i.e, McTeague), and that playing naturalistic characters in this over-the-top way has a Hollywood history (Burt Lancaster in Elmer Gantry), but in this movie I think it was very important for Daniel Plainview to be a bit more subtle. We have to see him not as some obsessed monster who eventually loses all his humanity, but as a human being we can all identify with who goes off the rails. I don't think Day-Lewis accomplishes this. Though we do believe he actually loves HW and Mary Sunday, Day-Lewis plays Plainview as damaged goods from the beginning. He is creepy, and I think it's a little unbelievable that he would be able to snow people so easily with his spiel about leasing or acquiring their land. Though I agree with most here that this movie has many excellent qualities, upon reflection I think I would rather have seen a more subtle actor like Russell Crowe or Christian Bale play this part--I think either one would have made the character more human.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

There was..... only Daniel Day Lewis's charisma,"Maybe I have gotten so used to Hollywood action blockbusters that I have just lost any sense to appreciate a very fine, sophisticated movie. Or, maybe There Will Be Blood simply failed to deliver the message it sought. I don't know.Or, maybe I am just annoyed that after spending more than two hours of my time, I didn't get a good, satisfying, and titillating climax. To make a bad analogy, after watching the movie I felt like last summer when I invested a whole month's time and a good deal of money on some lady I was attracted to at first sight, only to find out in the end that there can be less than meets the eye.I concede that the two hours went by without bore or snore. That is because I was thinking I was gonna get something if I persevered. But in the end, all I got was the only thing they couldn't fail to deliver, Daniel Day Lewis's mesmerizing acting and charismatic voice, although, I admit I would gladly trade two hours of mine for any kind of role DDL plays.I now think my biggest disappointment is that I wished dearly to like Daniel Plainview. I wanted him to be a hero, doing something extraordinary or maybe become betrayed and get a deeply satisfying revenge. Or at least be a decent love story. But no no, there are no heroes in this movie. Its all about reality and how sick it can be, especially when the main character in the movie doesn't have convincing depth of character. To me, the movie failed to either make me like or hate the characters. It was all too remote, too detached, and too fragmented. Good acting can go a long ways, especially in the Academy Awards, but it alone does not win the heart of the viewers; it needs a good plot to begin with.Will someone do Daniel Day Lewis justice and give him the role of his career, which I wish is yet to come, given his skill and talent?",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
The New  Paul Muni,"Daniel Day Lewis escapes into a character more deeply than any actor I can recall except for the great Paul Muni, the sadly mostly forgotten and at a time the biggest star at Warner Bros during the 30's.Brilliant camera work and set decoration are apparent in this fine film but it is a Day Lewis Field Day as he mesmerizes the scenes.I wonder if the last scene is a drunken rage and that it is not real. Does he really kill the Preacher? Why did he kill the impostor who said he was his Brother? Why Murder the man? Did he murder the Man or was this all in a an alcoholic blackout?A visionary who was tough minded he lost his beloved Son at the end who also was tired of his Father's imperious moods.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Beautifully captured, but plagued by length and tone issues","Going in, I was not exactly sure what to expect of There Will Be Blood. I was never too interested in the film leading up to awards season, but slowly warmed up to the idea of seeing it (if only because of the buzz around Daniel Day-Lewis and the film's eventual Oscar nominations). Yet even a day after seeing it, I am still a bit perplexed about it.There Will Be Blood is a little hard to describe. At once, it is a frenzy of good and evil themes, centred on a gold miner turned oil prospector Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis). He travels through the southern United States with his son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), buying up properties and making money off the oil on the land. On a chance tip, he ends up in California on the Sunday ranch, a rich potential source of oil. And here he meets up with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a preacher and prophet in a local church, whose religion is not Plainview's forte.The film follows from here, as people know, with Plainview's gradual change of heart from a good natured oil man, to a greedy and self-absorbed money maker. It follows a few subplots here and there, but the main focus is on Plainview.And I think that is where some of the film's problems lie. At 158 minutes, the film has that grand epic aura about it, but the story stalls far too often for it to truly be legendary. I found it only worked in small strands, frequently jumping from time flying right by, to it dragging its heels through the oil. I got bored a few times watching, and for a movie that has more than its share of exciting moments, it truly says a lot. It is bogged down with too much filler for its own good. I realize it had to stay with the whole epic tone, but it just does not stay consistent at all. The subplots, as few as they are, never seem to truly feel resolved or even worthwhile. I really liked the material between Plainview and his son, but the relationship between him and Eli Sunday is never truly explored as well as it should be. For such a strong force in the film, Dano is not given nearly enough to do (even with two roles). When they clash on screen, it is pure magic. But there is not nearly enough of it. And all of the useless moments with Plainview's brother are just that. And for such a coldly serious film (with a rather oddly bizarre score), there were way too many ""funny"" scenes. If the only way to silence the audience is for a character to be brutally murdered, I think there is a problem.What I did find most interesting about the film was its unique use of action. It takes almost twenty minutes for any cast member to speak (other than a few grunts from Day-Lewis), and all the entirety of the introduction to both Plainview and H.W. is done through movement and sound. It was not something I was used to, especially with a modern American film in 2008, but it brought a certain sense of beauty and majesty to the film. It allows for a lot less to be said about some of these characters, but it also makes for a greater amount of depth to be absorbed. Paul Thomas Anderson could have easily used an immense amount of dialogue (or voice-over like in No Country for Old Men), but the uncommon method works brilliantly for this film. As it goes on, it uses more dialogue, but it still has many focal points built upon speak-free scenes, and almost all of them work more than the last.The film's art and set direction and cinematography are simply breathtaking. There is a massive amount of detail in every scene, and the massive amount of work bringing to life is awe-inspiring. The one long take involved a flaming oil well is frightening and beautifully captured at the same time. The bright visuals, contrasting with the ever darkening material are just one of the film's strong suits. Anderson has always been a very visual storyteller, and he does not change his ways here. In fact, he matures even further, and gives a great idea of what we should continue to expect from him (and obviously his amazingly talented crew).Day-Lewis, for all of his acclaim, is really good. Not Gangs of New York good, but good nonetheless. His work here is still miles ahead of the competition, but I think I was just expecting too much. He commands every scene he is in, and he's ridiculously over the top as he seems to pride himself on being (especially in the popular ""milkshake"" scene), but his effortless look throughout the movie looked to me like he just was not enjoying himself at all. His richly layered character is brought to the screen magnificently, but what is the point if you do not get any fun doing it? I was consistently thinking of Bill 'The Butcher' throughout the entirety of the film, and only a handful of times did he ever come close to matching the sharpness and complexity of that character.I was actually much more impressed by Dano. After Little Miss Sunshine last year, and There Will Be Blood this year, he is truly beginning to make a name for himself. His powerful performance holds its own against Day-Lewis, and he shines exquisitely when it is just him on-screen, or just having Plainview sitting and viewing in the background. I only wish he got more recognition.There Will Be Blood is a brilliantly captured film that has more than a few problems with its story and tone. It packs some great performances, but just do not go in thinking it will be the best of the year.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
There will be something better than this,"Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor so I gave it a 1 otherwise it would be a negative 1. This movie made ""The Unforgiven"" look like a high voltage action movie with this being so - Slow is not the right word - more like agonizingly painful. No real story line - terrible subject as as storyline (oil in the early 1900's)- no reason for any of the characters being the way they are - no reason to watch the characters as they are - no redeeming qualities to walk away with - no inspiration to gain from it - no ending worth discussing - no dialog worth remembering - no reason to see it and definitely no reason for me to have sat there for 2 1/2 hours watching it. I guess I just couldn't believe it could be that bad and that some how - some way it was going to build to something even if it was in the last 5 minutes but it was not to be. Don't waste your time now or when it comes out on DVD.

"A Fiery, Bloody Mess of Brilliance","Daniel Day-Lewis is epic in Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood, earning himself his second Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.Daniel Plainview is the leader of one of America's largest oil tycoon's and strives to expand his wealth by tackling a major project in a small town that is mainly Catholic, whose spokesperson is sceptical over Plainview's intentions. Alongside his adopted son, Day-Lewis' character must face the difficulties of the hard-hit industry and deal with the consequences.Speaking on cinematography, the on-screen image is exhilarating, with scenes of mass eruption proving critical to the film's success - the scene I'm speaking about was so large that at the time fumes flew over the ranch in Texas and wormed their way into Ethan and Joel Corn's No Country For Old Men, causing shooting to temporarily stop. Despite its Texas filming site, Anderson's film is set in Southern California and strives to emphasise the heat that in-turn provides tough working conditions.Daniel Day-Lewis proved that he was the perfect man for the job with his articulation of the role, offering a finely-toned, unique accent, the ruthless and brutal nature of his character and the slow deterioration of his mental state in the presence of his son, who plays a vital part in the film.Anderson's camerawork is genius, particularly in two gritty church scenes, he captures just how important God is in determining a town's beliefs and feelings with a slow-moving picture on Dano's character, who is allowed the freedom of the screen, to convey his thoughts to the local civilians. Despite the film being predominantly set on a desert, Anderson purposely adds in scenes in Plainview's home, a stranded pub, and as mentioned before, a chapel, to showcase new scenery throughout the 2 hours and 38 minutes and make the audience remember that yes this is a film about the purpose of oil, but ultimately, it is a film about people.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Anderson manages to humanize a Sinclair novel.,"I don't have much to add to the general consensus of this film. It is a wonderful Western that tells a gripping empire story of a misanthropic and myopic capitalist-a man who trades his soul for all material gain and ends up with nothing. All aspects of the film are some of the best work from the aughts. Day-Lewis gives a utterly convincing performance in the lead role. The film's cinematography has a haunting beauty to it that sells the atmosphere. And Anderson's direction and writing are some of his best work. The final sequence-I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE!-is such a bizarre yet fitting sequence to this tale. But I have read Sinclair's book before I first saw the film-unlike I am guessing the majority of the audience.The book is typical Sinclair. It is incredibly vivid in industrial detail and it utter invokes the times and setting of the story. The primary emotion the novel invokes is rage. For like The Jungle (a better book) Oil! Is an angry didactic anti-capitalist polemic; the book is a thinly veiled satire on Teapot Dome scandal which limits its applicability . It is rather vicious towards *all* of its characters-I am straining to think of even an empathetic character. The book is largely centered on the conflict between James Arnold Ross (the Plainview character) and his worker sympathizing son, ""Bunny"". Eli-and his brother Paul-are in the novel with Eli largely tracking with the movie character-through the novel Paul, a literal communist, absolutely does not track with his film counterpart. There is a hint of the conflict between Eli and Ross in the novel but is resolved in a very different way and it is much more a subplot within a subplot. Anderson's script is exceptionally loose in relation to the novel.I think this is for the best-the novel is too blunt to work in film form. The film manages to maintain much of the novel's vividness around the oil industry c. 1910 and it maintains the anti-capitalist edge to the material-abet less forcefully. But it ends up being a lot more emotionally engaging by centering the preacher-oilman conflict. The film captures Marx's notion of ideology vis-a-vis religion in italics compared to the novels' bullhorn. Eli is much more a living person here-and for that matter so is Ross (Plainview). I love the script does not feel bound to stick to the novel. It lifts ideas and scenes here and there while making the story more human, less strident and more psychologically plausible. This is a go example to demonstrate that a film's infidelity to its source material can be a positive good.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

There we go once more,"This movie already has a grand reputation for being epic, including a slight capitalism critic. But the plot is rather average and the epic thing about it is maybe the main character, although he doesn't develop much from the different confrontations he gets into.That's not Daniel Day-Lewis' fault. He can surely make the ""Gangs of New York""-trip once more and comes out of it with honor. Day-Lewis finds the depths when they're there and doesn't pretend to make anything more out of the character than there is in the script. Or in life.The great performance however comes from Kevin O'Connor in a rather small but important part. Anyway this movie wouldn't get the seven points it gets from me, without the last scene, which is quite nerve-breaking, but also a great struggle between bad and bad, there you can't foresee the outcome. If the rest of the movie was like that, it might have been a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Search for Transcendence,"Why do we do what we do? What is the ulterior meaning of our acts? These kinds of questions constantly haunt my head, and it was in one of those thoughts that I found what underlies Daniel Plainview's character: life is only worth it when you have a reason.It is no wonder that the American ethos has been built on an ambivalence: religion, the worship of the god of Christianity; and capitalism, the cult of ""self-made"" man. Max Weber (in 1905, the year that surrounds the setting of the film) originally established the relationship between the evangelical creed and its influence on the prevailing economic system today through the religious value of work and discipline. One of the interesting places of Weber's analysis is his prophetic spirit with respect to the capitalist essence: in modernity, human beings would be engaged in their work, in technique, but devoid of any sense of transcendence (that Protestantism allowed with life after death). Modern man would be thrown into consumption for the simple fact of consuming, work and survival as ends in themselves, without any further meaning. Modern man would be Daniel Plainview.We are, mainly, before the man in search of meaning; a radical modern Charles Foster Kane. The film is a faithful reflection of the human condition; that, we could say, that underlies every human being: wandering aimlessly through life, without a sense of transcendence, subject only to our instincts (the desire for distinction and protection, mainly).Faced with this apocalyptic scenario, it is essential to direct efforts in the search for a meaning that consoles existence. Our protagonist finds that consolation in the family, and that is the only possibility of escaping from the existential abyss in which he finds himself.Returning to Max Weber, the figure of Eli Sunday would represent precisely American society. Protestantism has become a simple servant of the capitalist spirit, the sense of transcendence with which it once ingratiated its faithful has been replaced by mere instrumentality. Eli Sunday is one more representation of the disease that afflicts modern society: his efforts are exclusively focused on the search for power and distinction. And it is from the inherent competitiveness of the society in which this dispute between Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano is forged. Plainview sees in Eli Sunday a representation of himself ... and Daniel Plainview detests himself.Needless to say, in terms of execution the film has no errors. I mention some of its virtues:The maturation of the well-known sequence shots of Paul Thomas Anderson towards multiple frames (where the most characteristic is the Paul Sunday scene); and the masterful elaboration of the scene with which the film opens.The photograph of Robert Elswit who conceived one of my favorite scenes: the fire of the drilling rig.The best soundtrack that Jonny Greenwood has composed to date, where I highlight ""Open Spaces"", ""Oil"" and ""Proven Lands""; obviously impressive is the extract from Brahms that appears when they open the oil derrick and with which the film closes.The inclusion of amateur actors gives the film an enviable naturalness, the church congregation and the oil workers are more than correct. It is enough to appreciate a simple detail: the position that HW (Dillon Freasier) takes when firing the shotgun.And Daniel Day-Lewis, who is simply spectacular. You can blame him for whatever you want but there is a detail in his performance that forces me to classify it as my favorite male performance: his eyes; how is such a level of independence of the eyes possible!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Absolute best movie of 2007,"My opinion from technical aspect is the amazing score composed by Johnny Greenwood. Music was used in this film to heighten the emotion. Example, in the burning oil derrick, the score consist of string instrumental that evokes anxiety. Another brilliant way for Anderson to use music, he uses it to foreshadow for future consequence. Like when Daniel Plainview and his imposter step-brother en route to Bandy's ranch, the scene has neutral atmosphere yet the background music is anxiety-inducing, panic sort of. Then, the lighting setup in this looks very naturalistic despite in behind the scene, they are using tons of spotlight during production. The amount of efforts they put to make the shot worked should be appreciated. Personally, I was surprised to know this film's budget is the same amount from his older work, Punch-Drunk Love because of how ambitious and precise it look in this film more than Punch-Drunk Love. Great performance from Daniel Day Lewis too, who's giving this sort of over-the-top acting.
On surface level, this film is great for character study and the plot. Its interesting event what makes mainstream audience who's unfamiliar with cinema, could enjoy. Also for people who are into films they could observe on deeper level like Plainview's psychology, subtleties performance and still enjoy it. This is another amazing movie by Paul Thomas Anderson, which he wrote his character as a normal human being with complexity instead of objectifying it into a caricature. We as the viewer might dislike Plainview, but we still could empathize with his tragedy from his childhood, things he went through building his own oil empire. Personally, in first act I was impressed by its subtlety with less dialogue, second act by the production design and characters development while on third act by its high emotional impact. I also think this is that intelligent type of film, with repeated watching you could pick up new detail everytime.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A glorification of being mean?,"It appears that many people like this movie. The only explanation I can give of this is that people have watched so many movies that they have become completely numb, and the only thing that tickles their brain is shock value.

That is judging a movie as good just because it is ""different"".Well, I'll tell you what makes this movie different. It is so painful to watch that movie makers in the past wouldn't even consider making it. This main character has no redeeming values and is so completely vile that he's not even believable. The preacher is so annoying and pious that he is also very hard to watch.If this movie was based on a true story it might have some value because it would be a study of reality. Its not though. Its complete fiction.

This movie was disgusting. Feelings such as these do not need to be shared.

Incredible craft but overly cynical,"There Will Be Blood is a 2007 film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. This is the first film I've seen from him, and it stars famous method actor Daniel Day Lewis as the lead. It takes place in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and focuses on a prospector during these times. I'll start off with the negatives so I don't forget. There were a couple fade transitions that kind of bothered me and felt out of place, but that's really nitpicking. A big issue I had here was the score. Usually I'm never bothered much by scores, either they're very good mediocre for me, but the score for this film was just very distracting. It wasn't very good in my opinion, and honestly I would've preferred if the score was just took out of some scenes. I guess another problem I have is that, as I'll get into this is an incredibly well-told story, but I think outside of the story itself it doesn't hold much weight. There's some surface level themes about capitalism and greed, but nothing that's super impactful, but honestly I think that's ok (I should mention that this is subjective, of course different themes impact us in different ways, this is just how it impacted me personally). It doesn't make the movie pointless, it's certainly a story worth telling, but just throwing that out there.Getting into the positives, this film has an excellent screenplay. All of the characters are very well written and the dialogue is superb. The acting by everyone is great, but of course Daniel Day Lewis steals the show. He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. There's a moment, about 35 minutes into the film, where he gives a single look that terrified me more than most horror movies could. You could really consider this film to be a character study on Daniel Day Lewis's character, and it absolutely works due to his performance. The film is slow, it's 2 hours and 38 minutes long or something along those lines, but I was never bored. It's entertaining from beginning to end. The cinematography and direction is very good, the sets are good, and everything about the production really feels like it hit the mark in terms of portraying this time period. The film is on Netflix, and I strongly suggest you give it a watch if you're up for a dark and sometimes very violent film. 8.3/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Greed and fundamentalism,"A story which shows us a couple of the pillars America was founded on, unabashed greed and religious fundamentalism. Paul Thomas Anderson really transports us to the oil fields of the late 19th century, and the performance from Daniel Day Lewis is stellar, leading a very strong cast. The film reminded me of 'Citizen Kane' in its scope of an ambitious man's life, from the early days of finding his fortune to fighting and clawing his way to riches, and 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' in how greed perverts his soul. Its epic feel and high production quality certainly make it worthy of being discussed among such great old films.I found the relationship between the misanthropic oilman (Lewis) and a faith healer (Paul Dano) fascinating; both seem like flim flam men who manipulate the crowds around them, and their gamesmanship shows itself in a need to dominate and humiliate the other. The oilman is the apex predator in his world, but looming are the bigger fish of Standard Oil and the robber barons who threaten to snap him up. I'm not sure the story is quite as good or as well told as the beautiful cinematography and excellent acting, but the film was interesting for all of its 158 minutes. In the end, where does all of the battling and wealth accumulation lead in a man's life? And can one be successful in the capitalist world and remain a humanist?

Daniel day at his finest,"This movie is the absolute epitome of cinema. Incredible acting, story, writing, cinematography. This movie has it all. It's definitely a slow burn, but it has enough intensity to keep you absolutely glued. Daniel day Lewis's character is so well thought out. He is reserved, quiet, manipulative yet ready to explode at any second. Watching him is like watching a lit fuse slowly burning down. He is unpredictable. His arch nemesis makes for an incredible pair. The rivalry between them is one of the best in recent memory. This is a must watch for anyone who loves artsy, intelligent and slow burn films. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Impressed,"What can i say about the fine acting in this movie that it hasn'd been said yet? Some say that when you forget your watching actors portray is when the acting really is good, this is the way i felt during the 2 and a half hours of D. Lewys and Paul Dano. One thing i noticed, mainly in the beginning is how Paul Thomas Anderson chose to tell the storie only by images and the beautiful shots that the film presents us, not with loads of text overwhelming the viewer, allowing a smooth way to enter the universe.Wish i had seen this in a movie theater, cause the fotography is magnificent and when put together with the soundtrack: OH MY GOD how that hits.Really liked the time jumps, didn't feel like i missed part of the story or so, and the characters aged and developed well with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

I love it!,"Paul Thomas Anderson's early 20th-century epic deals with greed, capitalism, and the ruthlessness of oilman Daniel Plainview. The film follows Daniel's conflict with a young preacher over religion and faith. Right off the bat, this is a fantastic film that illustrates how the lust for success and power can make a man hollow from the inside. We see Daniel abandon his child when he needs him the most, and his hunger for success is only surpassed by his general hatred towards all human beings, making him want to get away from all of them.The film has deep themes of religion and faith as Daniel conflicts with preacher Eli Sunday, who claims to be the prophet of God. Their conflict delivers the best scene of the film. Daniel Day-Lewis is great in the film and delivers what is his best performance as he completely immerses himself in Daniel Plainview, portraying a despicable yet ambitious man who is passionate about what he is doing. He is a man who is volatile but loves his child. He is well-supported by Paul Dano, who is also great in the movie, especially in both the church scenes where he tries to show that he has the power of the Lord. He has a hidden side that lends a mysterious quality to his character.Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is fantastic. This is his most ambitious film because he tackles so much yet gives you a personal story about a man who will do anything to succeed. It's a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Legendary Day-Lewis Performance,"There are few actors who can repeatedly make a repellent character still engaging and do it effortlessly. I would say only DiCaprio and De Niro can do it as good as Daniel Day-Lewis. The man is a legend in film history, and his portrayal as Daniel Plainview will easily go down as one of the greatest performances of all time. While I believe his 'Butcher' character in Gangs of New York is more entertaining and re-watchable, it's this haunting performance that may outlive any of his other characters, including his recent portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.Right from the opening sequence the music engages you into this tale of a man full of hatred and greed. Even in the first 15 minutes which feature very little dialogue, you get a sense of the tone and the overwhelming theme of madness that goes along with Daniel. The movie is most definitely filled with memorable performances, and it is a memorable film. I wouldn't even say the movie is too long, which is what most people complain about. Day-Lewis captures you with every scene, and makes you feel as though these actors were actually living in this era. I was also shocked at it's few moments of violence, especially towards the end. Because the movie is just detailed as a Drama, the violence comes as a complete surprise. Paul Dano shows us his young talent and his ability to perform with the greats, and not even be overshadowed by the great Daniel Day-Lewis. I also found his son to be quite thrilling in his tragic role.Minor complaints include the sometimes bombastic score. There were times it overshadowed the dialogue, which for this type of movie is bothersome. When you have a character piece, I want the music to compliment and not overpower the actors.I cant say I will ever remove the final scene from my head, and I can't say I will ever want to watch this movie again because of how disturbing it can be. There Will Be Blood is truly one of the most memorable movies of the past decade and a true work of art. It deserves a place as a great cinematic achievement.9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""There will be blood"" is no masterpiece, and certainly not the best film of the decade","It seems that, even though it (fairly) lost the best picture prize to NCFOM, TWWB is regarded as the best film of the decade. That if features a good performance by veteran actor Daniel Day-Lewis is an undeniable fact. But even there I'm afraid I have to disagree with most of this film supporters, because IMHO showing unparalleled fury or rage and overpowering every word with the weirdest of voices does not equal the best performance of all time, because that would mean being able to show some depth an nuance, which starring at the horizon and saying ""I hate most people"" certainly does not. I do believe he's a great actor, one of the greatest of all time, but this is certainly not his best performance. Apart from that point, which still remains as the best part of the movie, we're presented with a story about his character's greed for oil, and a character study of how his greed and contempt for the world gradually isolates him from even his son. That would actually be a great premise for a movie, if it was actually treated as in-depth study of real human feelings and emotions and for the better an entertaining one. What we get instead is a totally boring movie made by the most overrated filmmaker of all time who, aside from the amazing technique displayed in some breathtaking shots, can do nothing but throw at us how in love he is with his own material. Don't get me wrong, because I'm no transformers fan, and I love drawn-out movies, such as The Godfather, The Deer Hunter, Bergman movies, just to name a few, if they actually have something new or interesting to show or to say, which rarely happens through this wandering mess. How some people say it has a deep meaning that touched theirs souls like nothing else is beyond me. If you want real feeling that is gut-wrenching and tears your soul apart then watch a Bergman movie or read some Dostoevsky, because this pretentious mess ain't nothing of that kind. I know there are movies that grow on you after some watches, but after the third one I gave up and so consider myself in position to criticize it. ""Boogie Nights"" is so superior to this in even aspect, and I would go so far as to call that movie a flawed masterpiece, but certainly not this. After two and half hours of boringhood, there comes a finale that's both surprising and rather kubrickian, and although by then we all know it's a trick the director is pulling on us to make us think he has achieved something deep and true, we can still enjoy the fabulous Day-Lewis get lost in a sea of despair.

There will be blood is about the fictional Oil prospector Daniel Plainview played to absolute perfection by Daniel Day-Lewis in my personal favorite performance by him. He is truly incredible in this film. There Will Be Blood delves deep into Daniel's psyche as greed and power overcome him throughout the course of the film as he try's to take control of his surroundings as well as those around him as he battles the preacher Eli who is also played to perfection by Paul Dano. Paul Thomas Anderson is a master of his craft creating an intense, gripping and brutal story out of something so mundane as Oil. His direction is magnificent, with a particular moment when things at the oil well go wrong, truly showing the audience his skill as a film maker. There Will Be Blood is not easy viewing at times but if in the mood to watch an intense character study of a man corrupted by greed then you should definitely consider giving this film a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
There will be milkshakes.,"I can't lie. There Will Be Blood isn't anywhere close to being my favourite Paul Thomas Anderson film, but I liked it quite a bit more than before on this latest viewing. I think seeing it on the big screen helped. It wasn't as dramatic an improvement as watching 2001: A Space Odyssey on a tv, and not being truly impressed until seeing it in a cinema, but it also wasn't far off. The slow pacing in both films is easier to not notice when you're overwhelmed by what you're seeing and hearing, and when you can't see the time or any other distractions.Obviously, Daniel Day-Lewis is at his best here, and There Will Be Blood would probably still be good if everything but Day-Lewis underwhelmed. But this is also impressively directed, has a decent number of iconic scenes, and looks grand. I still can't work myself up into a frenzy over Jonny Greenwood's music like so many people do (both for this score and his other ones... I don't believe he would get nearly as much attention as a composer if he wasn't a member of Radiohead), but at least that score sounded more overwhelming - and therefore interesting - with a proper sound system.It's still a bit too slow a film, I feel, and the point of it all, as far as I can tell, is a bit simple for something so long. I still love the Anderson films with big casts and/or lots of energy over his more psychological character dramas, but still, a lot of this is impressive on a technical front. And those qualities really did shine on the big screen, so I'm happy I got to see it that way (and the screening sold out, which was crazy but also cool to see).",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A movie that will feel artistic to those who don't usually watch ""slow"" movies","Let me begin with a summary of my thoughts, so that the majority of the people that read this review will be able to skip the main part... The movie was mediocre at best. Daniel Day Lewis was exceptional as usual. Simple as that.Why you will probably ask... Well, there are many reasons. First of all a slow-paced movie isn't by default artistic which seems to be what many people think nowadays due to the lack of slow-paced movies. There Will Be Blood has an interesting beginning and well... you will stay with that interest until the end. Not one thing of importance happens in the whole movie, just a repetitive explanation of the characters involved and a slow , really slow development of the script.When the movie ended I couldn't help but ask my self ""What will I keep in my memories after watching this movie?"". The answer was nothing. I couldn't (and still can't) find anything of importance in the whole script, in the whole plot that made me stay focused.In the whole it's like watching a landscape portrait.

"While I admire P.T. Anderson's attempt at an epic story in this vast canvas of early oil drilling and one man's greed, the film fails to entirely convince","Released in 2007, THERE WILL BE BLOOD is Paul Thomas Anderson's vision of an oilman driven by greed. The film opens with a long introduction without spoken dialog: in 1898 prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is digging somewhere in the California desert. An accident kills one of Daniel's fellows, and he adopts the dead man's orphaned son. Ten years later, Plainview has a number of successful oil wells going, bringing in thousands of dollars a week, and he generally wins new rights to drill by presenting himself as a decent, family man. ""I work with my son here,"" he says, gesturing at the now older boy (played by Dillon Freasier) who has been named H.W.As the film settles into its plot, Daniel and H.W. get the rights to drill one huge new oil field by flattering and tricking the people who own the land over it. Daniel is opposed, however, by the young charismatic preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who insists that the oil drilling is unwelcome unless it brings donations and new members to his church. Gradually we see Daniel's greed, attempting to satisfy this rural congregation but really just obsessed with extending his rights over the land.So greedy is Daniel that family life really means nothing to him: after H.W. is caught near an oil well explosion and becomes deaf, Daniel essentially abandons him, sending him off to a school in San Francisco. Eventually this greed both exalts Daniel to massive wealth and ruins him. Though loosely adapted from Upton Sinclar's novel OIL!, it is hard to see this film as a general critique of capitalist excess when Plainview is the only clearly warped person here. The viewer meets several other people involved in the oil industry in the film, and they seem to be ordinary, decent people. Instead of vaster social themes, P.T. Anderson is content to explore one man's psyche.THERE WILL BE BLOOD drew critical acclaim, but I was left with mixed feelings. Definitely, English actor Daniel Day-Lewis presents one of the great method-acting performances of all time, utterly convincing as an obsessed California prospector of over a century ago. The production values are excellent and really recreate the world of early oil drilling with its primitive technology (and proneness to accidents). I also admire Anderson's attempt to tell an epic story, and I appreciate that this director doesn't mind letting the running time extend as far as he needs to tell the story.However, the film is easier to admire than to love. Its feels to me flawed in many ways. The last scene, one of great theatricality and violence, doesn't seem adequately set up by the preceding moments. Secondly, Jonny Greenwood's soundtrack, which draws on avant-garde classical music, is too showy. I'm not bothered by modernism, and indeed I regularly listen to composers to whom Greenwood is often compared and called more audience-friendly. But I found that the soundtrack draws excessive attention to itself instead of smoothly matching the action.Thus, I would still recommend THERE WOULD BE BLOOD, but I don't think it is an undeniable classic, and its featuring on multiple ""Best of the 2000s"" lists just baffles me.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A MASTERPEICE,"There Will Be Blood is an absolute amazing and intense film with a great performance from Daniel Day-Lewis as anti-hero Daniel Plainview. This is a gripping story with family, religion, greed, and milkshakes.Many people say that Daniel Day-Lewis gives the only good performance in the film, but Paul Dani also gives a great performance as Eli Sunday.The movie is about an oil prospector named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis). He dosen't care about ANYONE except himself. When one of his workers die he adopts his son H.W, and uses him as a prop to make him feel like he's a nice family man, when he's actually a ruthless monster. And that's all I'll say about it, because I don't want to spoil it, because if you haven't seen this movie, see it.Daniel Day-Lewis won an Oscar for best actor, and he deserved it because his performance is so convincing and amazing, that it's scary. He's the only actor ever to win 3 oscars.This film seems heavily influenced by Stanley Kubrick, due to the music at the end, the atmosphere, the hidden and mysterious messages that go over your head, and Plainview beats Eli Sunday the exact same way the apes beat up the skeleton with the bone in 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think the reason why is because the director Paul Thomas Anderson actually met Stanley Kubrick. And he was nice Paul Thomas Anderson when he found out he directed Boogie Nights, but he was much nicer to him when he learned he wrote it.This is a masterpiece and really wonder what Paul Thomas Anderson does next.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Not only did Daniel Day Lewis do a magnificent job, but so did Paul Dano and the rest of the cast. The story that evolved around America's 1884-1927, which is very rarely explored, was great. I liked the whole message about greed and wealth etc. And what it can lead to in the end.Now I have to be honest though. This movie would not have survived without Daniel Day Lewis.

I wish I could grow a mustache like Daniel Day-Lewis in this movie,"There is a fine line between what makes a good movie and what makes a great movie. Was it the vocally mute 20-minute intro sequence (a la 2001: A Space Odyssey) which ended up being just as enthralling and encapsulating as the last climatic 20 minutes? Was it the stunning performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano? Was it the perfectionist-level detail that put the plaque on their teeth and the grime underneath their fingernails? Was it the soul-crushing script on the corruption of wealth, the fool's errand which is salvation, and the abuse of the poor? Who can tell but God (if he's not a superstition), but somewhere amidst the 2.5 hour runtime, There Will Be Blood succeeds at becoming a sure contender at several best-of lists. I suppose a good way to find a more definitive answer would be to imagine if this script were handed to any lesser director and cast and see how their product would compare to P.T. Anderson's masterpiece here. Oh, the religious symbolism is too strong, that child performance wasn't quite convincing enough, this is just old-time Breaking Bad. But in the correct hands, the oil wells stand tall, domineering, and admonishing like crosses, Dillon Freasier's performance was on par with the adults, and having seen this movie now, I think Breaking Bad is just a modern There Will Be Blood. All the gears were well oiled and cranking together and it just so happened to come together so perfectly. The cinematography lent itself to some beautiful shots, symbolic framing, and a personification of the environment almost as if it were a character too. The powerfully and torquey filmmaking kept this film chugging on tracks faster and faster and it stayed interesting over the ballsy length. It found refreshing ways for people to be despicable to one another, which is always nice, and the take on the classic King Midas touch folktale was interesting as well. And it seems to be as relevant today too more than a decade after its release with conglomerate corporations and megachurches running amok. I don't know how to leave it; I can't find any critiques, no matter how minor. This is certainly a film to go down in history and I think its flawless character certainly justifies that.

A near unblemished semi-classic tour de force driven by a leading character performance to rival the very best.,"""I'm an oil man!"" Proclaims Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) to a township brimful of naïve citizens of which he is astutely wrapping around his finger one by one. However (in this case) the man speaks no lie for his veins do indeed run rich with plutonium oil. A crude, black substance embedded deep in the heart of director Paul Thomas Anderson's gargantuan North American epic- There Will Be Blood. A perpetually steady, emotionally-draining tale about the evil deeds of an oil guzzling tycoon that vigorously chews on the themes of gluttony and narcissism, faith and ambition, death and abomination. Do not be mislead by its title, though. For this is not some hysterical slasher-flick (as the juveniles sat behind me seemed to think at the outset). It is a gruelling, drawn-out dissection of a loathsome yet sinisterly-comical individual consumed and maddened by his own persona. And it's absolutely formidable. But it's also a marathon, meaning that it's not for everyone. So if movies of the elongated breed just aren't your thing, then I'm afraid there will be no blood for you. Sorry. However, if you sincerely believe that you've got what it takes to go the 158 minute distance, then brace yourself for a near unblemished semi-classic tour de force driven by a leading character performance to rival the very best.There Will Be Blood begins, then, with a poignant fade-in of a series of desolate mounds scattered across a dauntingly atmospheric New Mexican landscape. This is the first of many deeply satisfying fades employed that are aided quite brilliantly by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood's unsettling score which helps underline the overall mood of the tale. Add to that, every nuance of every cinematic and visual component which all work so well with one another to help give this: Paul Thomas Anderson's fifth feature film, such power and impact.More importantly, though, than any of the cinematic aspects citied above, is the protagonist. Well, antagonist to be precise. Daniel Day-Lewis playsno scratch thatDaniel Day Lewis is Daniel Plainview. A late 19th century Sean Connery sounding miner who while thrashing away at the crust of his motherland strikes silver and several years later, oil. But Plainview's profitable discovery comes at a price as one of his fellow miners pays for the unearthing with his life, leaving Plainview with the moral duty of raising the desist's new-born son, H.W (Dillon Freasier). And so, with the youthful, innocent H.W poised firmly under the oil sodden wing of Plainview, the two travel the continent, Dad: buying up large segments of land in which crude oil is stirring directly beneath, and son: smiling chastely for the native punters to help sweeten the deals. Thus, Plainview's success, reputation and wallet all begin to swell at a rather substantial rate and in 1911 he receives a generously eerie, yet pricey tip-off from Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) as to where there may be a sturdy supply of his beloved oil. And, like a moth to an oil fuelled flame, Plainview meanders ominously into Little Boston, California where the true colours and characteristics of the indomitable oil baron edge disturbingly into light.Daniel Plainview is an angry, vengeful man whose promises and loyalties to those around him are as false and as futile as his love and respect for the lord. He promises the locals of the Little Boston ranch; food, water, schools and, to the town's irregular preacher Eli Sunday (also Dano), a newly renovated church of the Third Revelation. But he cares little for the reserving of his pledges and spends little time guilt-tripping over his numerous acts of fraudulence and immorality. ""I look at people,"" he says ""and I see nothing worth liking."" ""I have a competition in me,"" he adds ""and I want no one else to succeed"". Harshly honest words, from a partially harshly honest man for Plainview is as putrid and as predatory as any character to ever grace the big screen. He putrefies slowly, though. And to be honest, the end product is more entity than it is man. Plainview is a symbol of sin. An emblem of pure self-serving evil, and from the first frame to the last, the sheer presence boasted by the oil sucking chief governs the screen in an implausible manner in which only an actor of Day-Lewis' calibre can. The critically marvelled, multi-award winning performance of the unfaltering London-born method actor is the epitome of everything grand about Paul Thomas Anderson's finest feature yet: intense, immense and utterly, utterly chilling.Nevertheless, for all its blood soaked and oil sopping glory, There Will Be Blood requires a patient, focused audience who are not fazed by its unhurried temperament. Admittedly, the film does have a tendency to slowdown to a near crawling pace at times, and I can't help but feel that the colossal performance of Day-Lewis carries the narrative in certain areas. But to begrudge There Will Be Blood for those slender drawbacks would make youwella sinner!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Daniel Day Lewis made my year,"I recently saw a ""pay-per-view"" of ""There Will Be Blood"" and I was stunned. Not blown away, not taken aback, not shocked, not horrified, but stunned. Going into the film I knew that Daniel Day Lewis' character Daniel Plainview would be (or end up being for that matter) a man with no empathy, but only his lust for wealth. I saw Lewis in Gangs of New York, but failed to recognize his supremacy as an actor, for I was young. In this film he may have given the best performance I have ever seen. Throughout the film Plainview is, in one aspect, simple (or ""plain""). Never does he give the appearance of deception, which is I'm sure is his goal as an entrepreneur. He knows what he wants and he knows what he doesn't want (an example would be when he walks away from a prospective oil project in the early moments of the film due to the chaos among the townspeople). Plainview works patiently and smoothly until he gets what he wants. This is obvious in his actions of building the oil rigs and even in the way that he speaks. But when needed to achieve his ultimate goal, he takes violent and even deadly measures. Daniel Day Lewis acts the Plainview character to perfection, even down to his display of impatience for people when he bites his cheeks and moves his mouth about in frustration when in a conversation. I can not even really begin to describe why Daniel Day Lewis was the most believable as I have seen an actor unless you have seen the film, which I suggest any readers who haven't already do right away. As a film, there was no cohesive plot, there was no ongoing score (a trend, along with ""No Country For Old Men,"" that I am thrilled to see, as it accentuates the performances), there was no twist or surprise ending. There was only the deterioration of the humanity of a man and its effects on his family and others. That is why I was stunned as the credits rolled; I knew what was going to happen, but was still captivated nonetheless. In the last scene, all of Plainviews choices made throughout the film are shown to truly make him the man he becomes- evil and unremorseful.",,Anonymous,Drama
An icy cold movie that suffers from too many problems,"There Will Be Blood is widely considered to be from many critics as one of the best films from 2007, as well as the first decade in the 21st century. And in sometime in the future, it will be hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, if it hasn't already.Most of the praise and hype seems to be focused around Daniel Day Lewis' performance, which, as although I find the movie to be overrated, he does deserve all the praise that he has been given for it. This film features great performances from all of its cast members.But a good cast never means a good movie, and frankly, There will be blood is too long, and too boring. There Will Be Blood tries too hard to create tension, and often fails. This film features huge gaps of time where it seems nothing is happening, and I think its safe to assume that Paul Thomas Anderson wanted us to guess if something is going on- creating tension. But as the score screeches into our ears it is pesky and annoying. It's boring and emotionally detached in a sense. There will Be Blood may be, from a technical standpoint, a great film, but it's a draining movie that sinks in its flaws. A big disappointment. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Worst movie,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen.... I do not understand why ""There will be blood"" has such good reviews... Maybe is like the saying:""the beauty is in the eye of the beholder..."",in this case I can not see the beauty-I am blind:) I have to say that lately all the movies that I've seen are average quality as far as plot,acting,effects...quite everything...I don't remember seeing a movie from which I could say""OK,this is a good movie I want to add it to my collection and see it another time"" and I don't know if this is because I see to many movies or their quality has decrease so much?!?I hope that year 2008 will be the a better year for us,normal viewers",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
