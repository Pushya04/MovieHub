Funny touching love story (not just the fairy tale),"A boy (Fred Savage) is home sick, and to his dismay, his grandfather (Peter Falk) has come to read him a fairy tale. It's the story of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls for farmboy ""As you wish"" Westley (Cary Elwes). He goes off to make his fortune, but after news of his death, Buttercup is being married off to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by three rogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk's feign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and Fred Savage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put together all the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. The characters are memorable. And who could forget the fun that Wallace Shawn has choosing the poison drink. Mandy Patinkin is absolutely amazing as the swordsman seeking revenge from the six finger man. And there will never be another André the Giant.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding!,"Princess Bride is something that is really special. It is well designed, well directed and well acted. Rob Reiner is a very good director indeed, directing films like Stand By Me and all that. The film itself is beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, matched with a funny and touching script, not to mention quotable. The story was simple, but very well-developed, with a few surprises here and there. As for the acting, it is superb. Cary Elwes is a very charismatic lead as Westley, and Robin Wright gives a very spirited performance as Princess Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is a little annoying, but he has some delicious throw-away lines, so you warm to him, especially when Westley insults him at the end. Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant and Christopher Guest(who bares a mere resemblance to Tim Curry's Cardinal Richelieu) were very good too, as is an unrecognisable Billy Crystal. And Mandy Patinkin is deliciously hammy as the man who wishes to avenge his father's death by killing his six-fingered murderer. But what impressed me most were the funny interruptions with the grandfather(played wonderfully by Colombo's Peter Falk)and his sick grandson(Fred Savage). All in all, an original and funny movie that is a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
so much fun,"Not much to add to other reviews - a delightful, warm story with some hilarious sections. Rob Reiner had to leave the set while Billy Crystal did his scenes because he became nauseated from laughing so hard. Mandy Patinkin bruised a rib trying to keep from laughing during his scene with Crystal.Robin Wright was a perfect, sweet ingenue just as now she's an amazing President on ""House of Cards"" and was everyone's image of the ideal First Lady.The entire cast was great. I loved Peter Falk reading the story to Fred Savage.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Perfect Movie,"This is one of those rare films that gets better each time you watch it. With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.The plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases-  many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie.   If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.I have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my 'sick day' movie because it is such a joy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I love it.,"There's enough reviews here to show how enjoyable and entertaining this movie is, but I had to put my own word in...I simply love this movie. I watched it with my parents when I was very young, and have been watching it constantly ever since. It's a movie that I just can't seem to grow tired of. For one, I absolutely love the medieval fantasy genre, both in books and movies. From a small child I've loved knights, castles, dragons. the whole sort. This movie, quite simply, puts the viewer into an imaginative world where everything seems real. Second, the characters are so enjoyable to watch, you really begin to feel for them - all of them. Even humperdink, whose name does him justice, gets pity at the end. Lastly, the grandfather's list of the qualities of the book at the very beginning are all true... this story has everything. That is why it is such a classic, when everything comes down to it. From the moving love story between Wesly and Buttercup, to the dynamic and brilliantly scripted duel between the Man in Black and Indigo, to even the hilarious bickering from Vezinni to his lovable giant, Fezzik... This movie finds a place to include EVERYTHING one can imagine.  The story moves along at a great pace, and you feel as though the whole land has been covered when the book is closed. Furthermore, the whole conception of using the ""telling a story"" approach doesn't taken away from the realism of the story, but raises it even more by showing how mesmerized the boy is, listening to the tale - just as we are, in front of the screen.Maybe it was how I was captivated to the screen, watching it as a child... Maybe it was how I'd pop the movie in and turn a boring Sunday afternoon an exciting adventure as I grew up... Or maybe it's how I can sit down with friends and all enjoy the movie together, laughing at its funny parts, and cheering at it's exciting moments. The movie has a place in my heart, and that will never go away. A ""10"" on the scale, and even these words, can't begin to tell how much I love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A great adventure film in somewhat the same style as other great fantasy adventures like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride takes us on a wonderful trip along with fascinating and enormously amusing c","I'm not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or, at the very least, I just can't pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed, it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan (okay, MALE action adventure fan), but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously (at the risk of sounding shallow) girly name, because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel, but the film is truly great from start to finish. And, indeed, the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves, and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage's initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on, we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can't get enough.Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley, the love-struck servant to Buttercup, a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly, Elwes' later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well, especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup, but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief (it was nearly nonstop from start to finish) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini, the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out, Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini's enormous, idiot sidekick, and by far my favorite of all, Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s (`My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!').This is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book, just like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages. The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inigo Montoya saves the day!,"""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.""I know, I picked the most quotable line of this epic fairy tale (sorry for being such a cliché), but it was honestly the scene I enjoyed the most in this movie. Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of his most revered films and it has become a cult favorite over time. I didn't fall in love with it however, but I can understand the appeal this romantic fantasy has on so many people considering it has it all: a tale of true love, adventures involving pirates, sword-fights, fantasy creatures, and a princess who is forced to marry against her will. The premise is no different from that of your typical damsel in distress fairy tale, but the way the film seems to be mocking and honoring those familiar elements at the same time are what makes it stand out. It has a unique innocent quality to it while remaining funny, charming, and sweet. Perhaps I would've benefited from watching this at a younger age, but having waited so long to experience it for the first time was a bit of an underwhelming experience. I wasn't swept away by its magical and fantastic elements and the love story didn't stand out from other romantic tales. There are several fun scenes and unexpected character interactions, but during most of the film I felt a bit bored. The satire works in parts and so does the fantasy, but it just felt too familiar to win me over entirely.The screenplay was adapted by William Goldman from his own novel of the same name. Although for this film he uses a grandfather (Peter Falk) to narrate the story as he is telling it to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). At first the grandson isn't too keen about having his grandpa read him a story, especially because it starts off with kissing, but once the adventure begins he's hooked. There are occasional interruptions that bring us back to the kid's room, but most of the film takes place in this fantasy land where we are introduced to a very beautiful woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls in love with her farm boy, Westley (Cary Elwes). The two have found true love, but having no money to marry he embarks on a trip and promises to return to her. Buttercup is shattered when she hears that Westley was killed by a fearful pirate named Roberts. With nothing more to look forward to, eventually she gets engaged with Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) of Florin who promises to turn her into a princess. On the eve of her wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two hired henchmen, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) a skilled swordsman who has promised to avenge his father's death, and the strong but gentle giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant) who really doesn't know no better. While holding Buttercup ransom and fleeing from the site, they discover that they are being followed by a mysterious man in a black mask. He catches up with them soon and the adventure begins as these men face off with one another and new revelations are made.Allowing for the story to take place through this narrative style was one of the better decisions because it gave the film its unique dreamy style and it wasn't necessary to deliver realistic visuals. It was all part of the fantasy, although I would've preferred less interruptions, but I guess they had to give Fred Savage and Peter Falk some more lines. The relationship between Elwes and Wright was believable, but it didn't stand out because it was too familiar. However, they were both the perfect casting choice for these roles. It was Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya who stole the movie for me. I absolutely loved his character and the sword fighting scene was the highlight of the movie for me. It included a brilliant homage to Douglas Fairbanks (which I'm sure gave someone the idea that Elwes would be the perfect choice to spoof his Robin Hood character in a later movie). Montoya was probably the inspiration for Antonio Banderas as well when he was cast to play the Zorro. This character has become an icon and he was the saving grace of the film for me. The rest of the characters were OK, but he stood out. The exception and I think I'm in the minority here was Vizzini. I found Wallace Shawn's portrayal of him rather irritating and I couldn't stand him. There is also a hilarious scene with Billy Crystal playing a miracle doctor, who you'd only recognize due to his voice because he is heavily covered in make up to look like an old man. The Princess Bride had its strong moments, but somehow I never managed to fall in love with the fantasy and wouldn't consider it one of Reiner's best films. It does prove however what a versatile director he is because the film is very different from his other works. I'm still a bit shocked that the film is so widely loved, but I can't argue it isn't a good movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"You can't remake this movie, I mean it. Would anybody like a peanut?","To call The Princess Bride a classic is to understate it's significance. The Princess Bride is not only a great movie, it is above all else, a GOOD movie. It unites us as a culture and reveals within our collective nature a longing for the simple times when heroes were righteous and pure, villains were dastardly and vile, redemption was always possible for the wayward soul, and true love could overcome any obstacle. I pray we can find those days again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A personal favorite, but mediocre. The whole greater than the sum of its parts.","Despite the glaring flaws you will find in this movie. It remains one of my favorite ones to watch for a number of reasons.1) It has EVERYTHING! Action, comedy, drama, suspense, revenge, fairy- tales, heroes, villains, pirates, giants, miracle men, even rodents of unusual size. There is a reason it is always among the list of Best Movies, Funniest Movies, and Best Love Stories of All Time.2) The CAST. Hard to name a more fitting princess than the beautiful Robin Wright, Cary Elwes can sweep you off your feet as a farmboy or a masked man, Mandy Patinkin delivers the most memorable quote of his career, and the rest of the ensemble transport you into their magical world.3) It has ROBIN WRIGHT in it! Did I say that already?4) It brings out the KID in me and the nostalgia of those days. If only for two hours you can go to a distant land and be on an adventure and feel positive and young again.5) It has plenty of MEMORABLE LINES and scenes.SOME MISSES: - SPECIAL EFFECTS are pretty lame, even by 80's standards (the rodents could not have been more fake and some of the props are sub-standard) - STORY: Predictable and full of clichés - SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: While there are numerous memorable lines, they are repeated too frequently throughout the course of the movie. The script was simplistic. And to be objective, not too funny for most adults. - ACTING: There isn't much depth to any of the characters but the script didn't give the actors much to work with, for starters. Younger audiences may not notice it, but older ones may cringe in some scenes - CHEESE FACTOR: oh boy, it has plenty. It openly deals with ""True Love"" in a fantasy environment so it's pretty much set-up for sappy-ness.FOR: - People who still have their inner child intact somewhere - Family movie night - Slumber Party with the girls - Reminiscing with others who have seen this movie as a kidNOT FOR: - Kids who are too young (who might get scared by giant rats, some fighting, torture, talk of killing, and kissing scenes) - People who take themselves too seriously or are jaded cynics - Grown-ups who will be seeing this for the first time and have been misled by the high ratingsBOTTOM LINE: Cheesy Mac & Cheese with bacon bits. My favorite food ever since I was a kid. It was yummy then and still yummy now and I don't have to explain why I love it, I just do. If only for the fact that I've carried my love for this movie since childhood, my sentimental attachment to it would give it a 10/10.But then my Mac & Cheese, no matter how yummy, is never gonna get 3 Michelin stars next to a dish with fancy truffles. As a MOVIE, stripped of my nostalgia, this one is mediocre at best. There are more imaginative fantasy movies, funnier comedies, more romantic love stories, and more exciting adventures.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Possibly one of the most enjoyable films ever made...,"""As you wish..."" ""Inconceivable!"" ""My name is Inigo Montoya...""I love this film so much.From its opening scenes of the young boy being read a story by his kindly Grandfather to the romance, action, adventure and fun of the fairy tale. The Princess bride tells the tale of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love Westley (Elwes)who become separated through the course of an unfortunate event involving some pirates. Westley's destiny is to rescue Buttercup from the clutches of an evil Prince so that they might be together again. Yet he's not bargained on some of the wonderful characters that he will meet (and befriend) along the way...This film is so deliciously acted, made and written that it is a treat to watch.I've lost count of how many times I've seen it now. But every time I still gain the same enormous amount of pleasure from watching it. A movie that is a delight for the young and just as much fun for everyone else.The actors are all superb in their roles ('perfect casting' does not come close to describing it!) A young Cary Elwes is suitably dashing as our cocky hero (check out the sword fighting!)and Robin Wright is good as the beautiful Buttercup. Mandy Patinkin is great as the vengeful Inigo Montoya who utters that famous ""you killed my father. prepare to die"" line. Everyone else gives there all, including Christoper Guest, Chris Sarandon (as the main villian), Wallace Shawn, the late Andre The Giant,Mel Smith, and Billy Crystal.Even though it is about 18 years old, the humour and sly jokes are still as sharp today as they were back in 1987.You know you are watching a great movie when you here Elwes' ""To the pain..."" speech near the end. You've probably seen The Princess Bride. If so...go and watch it again. Right now, and remind yourself how good it is! And if you haven't- what are you waiting for? Go and check it out now! It's worth it! Hands up who can quote this entire film off by heart! ;)Watch out for:The R.O.U.S's Elwes' and Patinkin's Sword/word fight The Miracle Max scene When our heroes storm the castle (Go Inigo! Go Inigo!)

What am I missing here?,"I saw this movie when I was very young (like 10) and did not remember much from it. I know it is a popular movie and see memes of it all over the place.

"A satiric comedy with humor and sadness, dark with the light.","This film is an intelligent, sardonic send up of several genres that pokes fun (affectionately) at fairy tales, swashbucklers, love stories and basic conventions of film.  One of my favorite scenes is where Inigo Montoya first confronts his quarry after years of searching.  His adversary does the unexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the same circumstances, with hilarious results in the scene.  Basil Rathbone probably whirled in his grave!Not by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but a champ in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and good performances.  Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales that it spoofs than even the best of Disney's takes.  I loved it the first time I saw it and love it more now.  Well worth watching.

While this is a movie review, I cannot recommend the book on which it is based more highly.  It is quite simply the most humorous, enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that were impossible to include on the screen.

True Love Conquers All,"Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and Robin Wright Penn star in this classic fairy tale entitled The Princess Bride. It is based on a novel by William Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay. Director Rob Reiner brings life to this story and effectively evokes the enchanting spirit of the witty 1973 novel.The movie opens with a sick boy (Fred Savage) who receives a visit from his grandfather (Peter Falk) who intends to read to him from his favorite book. The boy is not exactly pleased to be distracted from his world of video games. However, his mood quickly changes as he and the viewer are transported to a place out of time. We are taken to Florin, a kingdom in an imaginary land, complete with dashing heroes, cowardly princes, rhyming giants, rodents of unusual size, fancy swordfights, and yes . . . even some kissing.This fairy tale begins on a farm in the countryside. There lives a beautiful, young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) who learns that ""as you wish"" really means ""I love you"" when she falls for her farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes). While trying to seek his fortune, Westley disappears at sea and becomes an apparent victim of the Dread Pirate Roberts. A few years later, Buttercup, who is now engaged to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), is kidnapped by a trio of misfits, which includes brains--Vizzini (Wallace Shawn); brawn--Fezzik (André the Giant); and sword--Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). As they sail away toward the Cliffs of Insanity, they notice the pursuit of a man in black. Now begins the adventure . . . .The central idea of The Princess Bride is that true love can conquer all. Throughout the movie, there are many hardships and trials that true love must endure. The movie keeps the viewer guessing until the very end whether or not there will be the classic fairy tale ending.This movie is appealing to me because of the classic fairy tale style combined with the witty humor, well choreographed action sequences, and intense instances of suspense. The characters are well developed and all the actors give an amazing performance which adds to the overall appeal of the movie. The Princess Bride is easily one of my all time favorite movies.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

A classic fantasy for all to enjoy.,"The Princess Bride is a wonderful family film about a maiden named Buttercup and her ""farmboy"" Wesley. When Wesley goes away to seek his fortune, he is reported to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Hearing this really gets Buttercup down, and it only gets worse when Prince Humperdink chooses her to be his bride.( Hence the title) To make a long story short and not give away the ending, Buttercup's kidnapped for suspicious reasons and rescued by someone familiar. She's in love and nothing can stop true love! A couple of deaths, a would be wedding, revenge fulfilled, and a couple reunited end this gala of a film. But this doesn't even sum it up, I promise! I love this film because it does not take itself too seriously and flows well across the screen. The main characters and their supporting cast are quirky and memorable. You will be repeating classic lines like, ""My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!"" over and over again. Through the adventures of Wesley and Buttercup you feel drawn to the characters and fall in love with their ability to amuse you. Do you want to be entertained with a light hearted fantasy/comedy?

What's all the fuss about?,"This movie is on the higher end of 'meh'. It's seen as something of a comedy classic today, and I can see how in 1987, it probably felt very fresh and as such received a very positive response. I'd have probably enjoyed it more if I'd seen it then. But I just don't think it holds up - it's not terrible by any means, but I don't think it's quite as good as people seem to remember it as being.So it's a fantasy-comedy-adventure that (obviously) doesn't take itself too seriously. As such the plot is fairly predictable and the characters largely played for laughs - which is fine - but I don't think it's actually done consistently well. There are definitely some funny moments, but I think I only laughed properly three times in this film. Partially I think it's because that, by now, we've seen this kind of comedy a lot (again, at the time, I'm sure it was a lot newer and fresher), and moved on from comedy based around the fact that apparently Spanish accents are funny (here's looking at you Fawlty Towers).It looks really cheap, and yes, I appreciate it's nearly 30 years old, but a lot of films made in the 80s (even in the 70s) had better effects and sets than this. There isn't really any ambition with the world it's set in - it's very dull and stereotypical and it doesn't really fit with the fact that this is supposed to be a kooky, original world.The guy who played the Spaniard aside, I just don't think it was acted very well either. The female lead especially is wooden, and there was absolutely nothing (even comedic) to her character or given in her performance.I couldn't really get into the 'story within a story' element either - the granddad telling the story to his grandchild is shown for about 10 minutes and there's nothing to it - I just kept asking myself why? Why did they choose this setup? It doesn't help the overall flow of the film in any way and just seemed like an odd choice.As I said, there were a few good laughs, but not enough for me to want to see this again any time soon. It has its fans but I think a lot of them need to remove the nostalgic veneer of their memory of this film and come back now and watch it. A warning: you may be disappointed. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic and funny fairy tale,"I love this movie!  It's sweet, but with satirical humor. The dialogue is great and the adventure scenes are fun.  Rob Reiner shows an excellent touch once again with comedy and a childlike point of view.  It manages to be whimsical romantic while laughing at the conventions of the fairy tale genre. I would recommend it to just about anyone. I've seen it several times, and I'm always happy to see it again whenever I have a friend who hasn't seen it yet. I haven't watched it with any kids, but I think it has lots for them too. There are wonderful quotes throughout.  I think Mandy Patinkin absolutely steals the scenes he is in as the Spaniard Inigo Montoya, bent on avenging his father's death. I gave it 8 out of 10 mainly because it feels very light, but I may go back and change to 9 thinking of how happy this movie makes me and it's rewatchability.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A Classic Fairy Tale With A Lot of Heart, Warmth & Charm.","A romance, a comedy, an adventure & a fantasy, The Princess Bride is an amalgamation of all of these and is a fairy tale that has been passed from fathers to sons for generations and here is presented in the form of a novel that is being read by a grandfather to his grandson, thus making sure that the book's narrative style & structure is kept entirely preserved.The Princess Bride tells the story of Buttercup who falls in love with a farm guy but loses him and is at last engaged to the Prince of the region. One day, she is kidnapped & held against her will by three hired helpers; a Sicilian boss, a Spanish swordsman & a giant. But they soon find themselves being pursued by a mysterious masked man who's gaining on their trail.Rob Reiner has directed some well-known classics (A Few Good Men, Stand by Me & When Harry Met Sally...) but most people are still not familiar with his name because unlike other filmmakers, he has no unique style of shooting a film or possesses a trademark. And this is another one of his films that's pretty different in style & approach when compared to his other works. And Reiner does a good job at it.The screenplay is adapted from the book of the same name in a manner that preserves its narrative style, camera-work & editing nicely compliment each other, visuals effects never aims for a realistic portrayal of the world depicted in the story plus it benefits very much from its sweet, tender & pleasant performances from its cast, including Andre the Giant.On an overall scale, there isn't much wrong with The Princess Bride & carries out most of its elements the way it's meant to be. More entertaining than what I was expecting from it, definitely showing a lot of heart, warmth & charm and yet it didn't click enough with me for I'm not really a fan of fairy tales.

Not only is it a well-written screenplay and has been rated over 8/10 stars by most movie critiques but it has been nominated for five awards and has won five other awards, some including the ""People's Choice Award"" and the ""Saturn Award."" In addition, this movie also features a dynamic cast. The entire cast did a remarkable job in making this fairytale realistic (to an extent). One example is about how the combat (sword fights, flips, tricks, etc.) scenes were well done and rehearsed. They kept the viewers on the edge of their seats through every ""clink"" of a sword and ""swoosh"" from a flip. Another is how the make-up and costumes in the movie added a great effect to the cast of characters, especially to the older, more mystical characters featured, such as Miracle Max and his wife. The 1987 release of The Princess Bride shows viewers that this movie making process took time and consideration, along with an amazing cast, and a hard working crew, creating a story that's to be a great audience pleaser.Three evil villains, a cruel Prince, a beautiful bride, a hero, Cliffs of Insanity, a Pit of Despair, and so much more chaos and adventure—no one has ever had to fight this hard for true love.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Soooooo Gooood!!!,An hilarious movie that knows exactly what it is. The actors takes their roles seriously and delivers perfectly. It's nice to see young rising stars in an early role which is the case for Robin Wright and most certainly for Cary Elwes.I had a good feeling and a big smile on my lips throughout the movie. Well worth a watch more than 30 years after release.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pleasant enough fantasy adventure aimed at family audiences,"I hadn't even heard of The Princess Bride until very recently. But evidently it has something of a good reputation and I am guessing that it may have been a sleeper hit that gained its reputation over a number of years as opposed to a film that hit the mark on initial release. Having seen it I'm still not entirely sure why this one has gained the reputation it has, as it didn't really seem all that remarkable to be perfectly honest.Its story takes the form of a sweet natured traditional adventure narrative. It's set in a fantasy land but unusually is told from the perspective of the present day with scenes of a grandfather reading the title book to his ill grandson. It has a strong romantic subplot and has very clear morals, with no grey areas. Consequently its simplicity makes it very well suited to children. But it can appeal quite well to adults too because it does have a lot of humour. It's helped in this area quite a bit by having a very good cast. There are too many to mention but my favourite character was the evil hunchback played by Wallace Shawn. The scene where he has a battle of wits with the hero over a poisoned drink is the funniest and best moment in the film for me. So all-in-all, it's certainly a likable enough movie but one probably, in fairness, not aimed at me. However, I cannot avoid not commenting on its weakest aspect because it was so, so terrible I couldn't believe it. The music. Oh, deary me, the music. For a film with some evident production values on screen it was completely bizarre that the soundtrack was so horribly tinny, like it had been composed and performed on a Casio keyboard!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As good as it gets,"Maybe a spoiler at the end....maybe. It is 2018 and this movie is now 31 years old. I am pushing 70 and have watched several thousand movies. For clean family-viewable entertainment, this has to be in almost everyone's all time top ten. Or five. Mandy Patinkin, a very fine actor, was never better than as Inigo Montoya, the Spanish swordsman. Robin Wright, barely 21, was exquisite as Buttercup. Cary Elwes has never, IMO, been quite as good as he was as Westley...but then, he was superlative as Westley, setting the bar very, very high. All of the acting ranges from good to great. The inclusion of Andre as Fezzik was random ""geniusness""....it just worked, and worked oh so incredibly well. I have watched this movie many times and I still love it. The outer wrap of grandfather Peter Falk reading the story to his grandson Fred Savage takes the ""Family Friendliness"" rating to a fifty on a 1-10 scale. There are many, many characters to enjoy in this fanciful tale; my personal favorite has always been Inigo Montoya. The sword fight scene remains, for me, one of the finest pieces of dramatic comedy I've ever seen, no matter who was the victor.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Above average fantasy movie with straight-forward action, sword-fights, and lots of monsters","An outlandish, offbeat satire of the genre, being a modern retelling of the essential fairy tale plenty with attractive scenes, all of them make this one an amusing an entertaining story as children as adults. A contemporary rendition upon the basic fairy tale jammed with all the cliches, outright satirical humor , sense of style, Error Flynn adventure and Pythonesque shafts of humor . It deals with an irreverent love story between a gorgeous maiden, Buttercup: Robin Wright Penn, and her young swan lover , Gary Elwes, this one helped by a duo of brave warriors : the assertive Mandy Patinkin and the huge Andre the Giant, both of whom battle the wicked evils of the mythical kingdom of Florin to be reunited with one another. When Buttercup is destined as consort to the wicked prince, Chris Sarandon, she is kidnapped, then our starring has to save her through a series of life-threatening exploits. Meanwhile, a grandfather , Peter Falk, tells his grandson, Fred Savage, the marvelous tale.This adventurously enjoyable romance movie centers around a wonderful adventure crammed with traditional fantasy, including great dueling scenes, damsel in distress, dashing protagonist and evil villains. It exudes a certain innocence, sense of wonder and upright enthusiasm into the proceedings. The main interest lies in attempting to recognise the well known cast, many of them beneath mounds of makeup. Gary Elwes and Robin Wright give charming interpretations. Mandy Patinkin injects any real enthusiasm to his undaunted revengeful role . Support cast is frankly excellent. As Christopher Guest as a James Mason-like villain, as well as the sympathetic Wallace Shawn . Peter Falk as the old storyteller does a Granpa Columbo. And some miscast comic cameos such as Peter Cook, Mel Smith, Billy Crystal and Carol Kane .It displays a colorful and glimmering cinematography by Adrian Biddle. As well as a sensitive and unforgettable musical score by Mark Knofler from Dire Streets. Based on William Goldman's cult book being well updated and compellingly directed by Rob Reiner(This is a Spinal Tap, Alex and Emma). A better than average fantasy that kids will probably love it.

It's inconceivable that this movie is rated so highly,"This has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time. I don't know what it is, but it may have to do with how old you were when you first saw it. I'm guessing that when the movie was first released, a lot of guys took their dates to see it  women typically love romantic themes, even when done badly  and got laid that night or something, hence they remember it fondly. Or it's possible that even younger audiences were fans of TV's ""The Wonder Years"" and loved Fred Savage or something. But for anyone who wasn't younger than 25 at the time of its release, this movie's popularity is an enigma: As a comedy, it's not very funny. As a fantasy, it's just bad. It has some qualities as an action adventure, though it comes off as a cheap imitation of a cross between the Robin Hood story and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (a silly movie that works, at least for most guys, in a way that the Three Stooges do not); shame on Peter Cook. Overall, the story is childish, the dialog is juvenile (""She is alive, or was an hour ago. If she is otherwise when I find her I shall be very put out"". Come on!) and repetitive, the sets are pathetic, the acting is abysmal (Andre the Giant and that annoying little dweeb, please), and the special effects (rodents of unusual size)  ugh!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfection.,"I very rarely like to put 10/10 for a rating of something as I feel nothing is perfect. However, this movie i feel is so close to that 10/10 it would be wrong not to award it this. Although it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it is brilliant in its own right. The characters are humorous, the dialogue is witty and the cast is brilliant. It contains so many different elements which also make it a really good family film. Action, adventure, sword-fighting, pirates, romance, comedy and fantasy.

"""As you wish"" means ""I love you.""","By virtue of the ""under 29"" female vote, ""Princess Bride"" is somewhat overrated on the IMDB, but still is a good, fun movie.  I rate it ""8"" of 10.The recently-released special edition DVD is the one to view. The colors are nicely saturated in most scenes, it has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, and there are lots of extras, including one of the better ""making of"" specials. One of my favorite actors is Mandy Patinkin, and here he is great as the Spanish swordsman seeking revenge for his father's death at the hand of the six-fingered swordsman played by Christopher Guess. This was Robin Wright's first film, as a 19-year-old, playing Buttercup. Cary Elwes is also perfect as her love interest. Andre the Giant, who died in 1993 at age 45, was so fitting in his role as the giant. Overall a fine cast and a fine, entertaining, funny film.

A Timeless Tale of Love and Adventure,"""The Princess Bride"" is a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time, weaving together elements of romance, comedy, and swashbuckling adventure in a way that continues to captivate audiences of all ages.At its heart, ""The Princess Bride"" is a story about true love transcending all obstacles. The chemistry between Cary Elwes' dashing Westley and Robin Wright's enchanting Buttercup is nothing short of magical. Their on-screen romance is a delightful mix of wit, charm, and genuine emotion that effortlessly draws you into their world.But it's not just the central love story that makes this film so special. ""The Princess Bride"" boasts a cast of supporting characters that are equally lovable and quirky. From Inigo Montoya's quest for revenge, played with heartfelt determination by Mandy Patinkin, to Vizzini's hilariously overconfident intellect, portrayed by the incomparable Wallace Shawn, each character brings something unique and memorable to the table.What truly sets this film apart is its masterful blend of genres. One moment you're chuckling at the witty banter between characters, and the next, you're on the edge of your seat during a thrilling sword fight. The humor is sharp, the action is exhilarating, and the romance is genuinely touching. It's a movie that appeals to the young and the young at heart.The writing, penned by William Goldman, is a testament to his storytelling prowess. His screenplay not only creates a richly detailed world but also subverts classic fairy tale tropes in clever and unexpected ways. The result is a narrative that remains fresh and relevant, even decades after its release.Inconceivably quotable, visually enchanting, and emotionally resonant, ""The Princess Bride"" is a timeless classic that continues to win over new generations of fans. It's a film that proves that true love, humor, and adventure are indeed timeless, and it's deserving of a permanent place in the annals of cinematic history. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the hundredth, ""The Princess Bride"" never fails to deliver a heartwarming and unforgettable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Poor and perfect""","The 1980s were the golden age of the fantasy movie – Excalibur (1981), The Dark Crystal (1982), Legend (1985), Willow (1988) and many others, sword-and-sorcery sagas for the blockbuster generation. But what those aforementioned pictures also had in common were high-production values and emphasis on aesthetics and stylisation. In some cases this was to hide the lack of a decent story. The Princess Bride by comparison is a decidedly minimalist affair, devoid of special effects (bar a bit of puppetry and prosthetics), atmospherics and big fight scenes. This is a fantasy movie which must rely on other things for its appeal to the viewer.The Princess Bride, adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, is really quite a light and simple story, more of a fairy tale than a work of what is normally called fantasy. Its world is too cosy and its baddies are not really evil enough to give it a sense of danger. It also contains a fair few plot holes along the way. It is however saved by two cunning devices. First is the framing narrative whereby Peter Falk is reading the story to his cynical grandson. The grandson's attitude pre-empts criticism, allowing the story to acknowledge the weakness of its own opening and challenge the nay-sayers to keep watching. Secondly there is the constantly humorous angle, a wit in the words that is often self-deprecating, and more irreverent than outright hysterical. The humour is all within character, so not enough to classify The Princess Bride as a spoof or even really a full-blown comedy, but it prevents the viewer from laughing at the corniness of the movie, because it gives the impression that all along the movie is chuckling at itself.Conveniently enough, director Rob Reiner had a background in comedy, and part of his skill in this area was selecting good comedy actors. The Princess Bride provides great opportunities because it has a lot of minor characters that aren't necessarily comical on paper but can be made funny in the way an actor plays them. Because these parts could be interpreted in a number of ways Reiner is more or less free as to who he casts in which role, and he actually seems to have stacked them so they get better and better as the movie progresses. First up is Wallace Shawn, great at doing indignant pomposity. Then there's Mel Smith, rarely seen in films but a fine character player from his days in TV sketch shows. Then we come to Billy Crystal, whose act is a masterwork of timing, working brilliantly in tandem with a lively Carol Kane. And finally there is the brief cameo by Peter Cook, a model of decorum and propriety until he opens his mouth. Wonderful stuff.While we have the cream of the crop in the small parts, it seems this production could not afford big stars for the leads, and we get too relative unknowns as the heroic Westley and his eponymous princess. Someone may have had the idea that Cary Elwes would shape up to be a modern-day Errol Flynn. He certainly has the looks and can pull off a swashbuckling swagger, but he just doesn't have the necessary presence or charisma, and it's no wonder he was picked mostly for supporting roles after this. Robin Wright is similarly bland, although to be fair despite being the movie's namesake her character does not really have a lot to do here. Better things can be said of Mandy Patinkin who brings the right blend of cheekiness and earnestness to his part (Inigo was my favourite character when I saw this as a child). An honourable mention must also go to Andre the Giant who is surprisingly good considering he's a wrestler hired for his bulk. He struggles with the language but it's clear he was an intelligent and sensitive man.It is essentially all the little touches that make The Princess Bride what it is – the wit, the quirkiness, the set-pieces. And yet, it being a fantasy picture I do find myself wishing it had a little more of the glamour and spectacle with which its contemporaries were filled. It may win out in the comedy stakes but it lacks the wonder and enchantment of Labyrinth, Legend or The Dark Crystal, and thus it falls short of brilliance. This is a little picture that works well on its own terms, and belongs solidly in the category of good plain fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A near perfect movie.,"I will say this right now that I love this movie. It's got everything you want. It's got action, adventure, cool sword play, romance and it is endlessly quotable.When I first heard of it, I dismissed it as being kids stuff and some sappy romance. Can you blame me? Just look at the title! But after hearing from friends how good it was I had to take a look and it's become one of my favorites.The story is in itself a play within a play. The main story is actually a story told by a grandfather to his grandson who's home sick. It's a story of the young Buttercup, the eponymous Princess Bride, and her true love Westley. Westley goes off to seek his fortune but is captured and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Or has he? Along the way we meet a Spaniard who's a marvel with the blade, a gentle giant with great strength and a Sicillian with more brains than smarts. They all play a role in leading Westley back to his true love.The story is great. The actors are all top notch including Andre the Giant who plays the giant. He's nigh incomprehensible at times but he plays the role well. Mandy Patinkin as the Spaniard delivers one of cinema's classic lines that just about everybody knows. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright shine as the young lovers. And of course Billy Crystal and Carol Kane steal the show as a pair of humorous healers.Some scenes lag a bit and there are times it's played a little too broadly but all in all it's a wonderful movie that should be seen by everybody. I can't recommend this movie enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An enjoyable (and extremely quotable) fairy tale, but still less than the sum of its parts","THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is revered by Gen-X-ers and 80's babies, along with THE GOONIES and other children's films that have a certain adventurousness and whimsy to them. I, however, was born at the tail end of the decade, and missed out on a lot of these cinematic treasures as a child. Finally, I have rectified that by watching this film, which is firmly ingrained in the pop culture consciousness. Does it live up to the hype? Yes and no. From a filmic perspective, the narrative is a bit formulaic and cliché, like the storybook tales that this movie takes its inspiration from. On the other hand, there are plenty of moments of pure genius that make it stand out from the rest. Fortunately, the latter outweighs the former and overall it was a perfectly enjoyable viewing experience.The story, although about the titular Princess Bride, is actually framed by a grandfather reading a book to his sick grandson. I think that this part is essential to making the film work because it gives the audience a way to understand the story and how it works on more than just a surface level. Fred Savage's character is the audience stand-in and his questions and commentary can represent the questions of all little boys who have been told fantastical stories by their own relatives. The grandfather can represent the director, or any family member who has served a storytelling role, and guides the audience through this familiar, yet not too familiar tale. The story of the Princess Bride itself is reminiscent of many a fairy tale, and like many before it tells how true love overcomes great obstacles. There is a great cast of characters, many serving up some choice and memorable dialogue that has gone down in the pantheon of great quotes. My personal favorites were from Vizzini, Inigo Montoya and the Impressive Clergyman.In terms of quality, Rob Reiner did a great job directing his actors, who all give great performances. Even Robin Wright does an impressive job for her first big-screen role which, aside from Jenny in FORREST GUMP, is the role she is best known for playing. The filming aspect was also quite well done, with most of it being done on well-constructed and detailed studio sets. The cinematography, while not particularly memorable or flashy, was competent in workmanlike kind of way. The real weakness here is the script which, while serving up plenty of individual moments worthy of praise, didn't always flow naturally, and not because of the framing story either. There is also a long stretch of the movie where Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) disappear, which just seemed odd to me. In my opinion, the story could have been fleshed out a little more in some respects. Still, what is there works for the most part, and I can't really fault it for trying to mix things up a bit.Overall, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a perfectly enjoyable movie, even if it doesn't live up to the enormous praise heaped upon it. The movie does have some flaws, but those are mild in comparison to the great storytelling on display and great dialogue, which enhance its replay value. Highly recommended, especially if you haven't seen it yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Andre the Giant was born on May 19th, 1946","The Princess Bride (1987), is a great film. Not because I like romantic love stories. Not because I follow wrestling. Not because I need to know the meaning of true love. The film is just a good film. A veteran in Hollywood, Rob Reiner, does his best work here, as he directs this comedy, in the grand tradition of Mel Brooks and crafts a fairy tale, that the adults can love too. Much like Ron Howard, Reiner grew out of television as an actor and eventually went into directing some really great movies. Both directors, would reach this point after they left the TV shows that made them famous. Reiner had moved his range to encompass many genres in his resume, but it was good, that he returned to comedy at times and that was good for the success of this film.Told in a storybook way, with a grandfather (Peter Falk), reading the story to his grandson (Fred Savage), we are transported back to a land where knights, fire swamps, witch doctors and hungry ROUSes (rodents of unusual size), exist. The beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright), has been kidnapped for ransom and its up to her one true love, Westley (Cary Elwes), to come rescue her. Along the way, they meet all kinds of colorful, creative, humorous characters, that play a part in the success of the two lovers' future endeavors. One of those characters was Fezzik (wrestler Andre the Giant), who's huge stature made for a perfect lovable giant, who eventually befriends Westley and Buttercup. It is nice to see that Andre became tied to such a revered, respected film, because if you read-up on his life or watch a documentary on him, the years of being a wrestler and the state of his gigantism, by this time in his life, had taken its toll. He was in a lot of pain, during the filming of this movie and it is nice to see that his sacrifice paid off.This film is a perfect example of a huge Hollywood, cinematic success. Other great performances in this film, also are some of the best cameos too. Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, Billy Crystal as Miracle Max, Carol Kane as Valerie and Peter Cook as the Impressive Clergyman, are just some I'll mention. However, the most rememberable character, is the one who was quoted the most, in this highly quotable film. That would be Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya. The entire cast in this film is fantastic. The comedy is dead on perfect. The scenarios, situations and tribulations, that the characters get involved in, which are chronicled in the story, carry you to the very end. It's one of those films, no matter who you are, that makes you feel warm inside by the time you reach the end.9.1 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pretty good if you look at it from the witty entertainment angle,"A lot of people and critics believe 'The Princess Bride' is a masterpiece and some even believe it is one of the greatest films ever made. However, objectively speaking the movie is not a masterpiece but primarily a highly entertaining escapism flick which still far outweighs its negative sides.Not entirely sure why the film was told out of a book straight from another modern day story, because the modern scenes really seem to have little significance and it also eventually ends up going nowhere. Fortunately, most scenes take place in the historical fantasy setting, which is obviously far and away the most entertaining one. The cinematography is beautiful, with a lot of stunning shots of the beautiful british landscapes where it was filmed on. Also the area where Inigo and the Man in Black face off is worthy of mention as a beautiful piece of cinematography. While being covered in comic aspects, the said scene with the sword fight between Inigo and Man in Black is actually also a masterpiece of choreography and incredible moves, resulting in possibly the greatest single duel swordfight one can ever see in film.The acting was mostly good, especially by leads Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin & Robin Wright. They manage to make their characters likeable due to their natural charm and witty line delivery. A lot of other characters were ridiculously overacted, such as Wallace Shawn's Vizzini. The screenplay is a bit wobbly as a lot of the dialogue is extremely witty and original yet Patinkin's constant uttering of 'Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.' grows tiresome after a while. Some things are really predictable such as who the Man in Black really is but other things such as Count Rugen's response to the first time Patinkin says the you killed by father line are quite original and somewhat hilarious.It is quite the cliché to say if this movie was serious we might take Elwes & Wright's romance and struggles emotionally serious, but there is still truth to it as it is not the kind of film that leaves you with feelings or thought long after it is finished. It was generally just made as the type of feel good escapism flick and if you limit your expectations of true cinema it can still be considered as a worthy piece of entertaining art. However, anything transcendent or thought provoking it is obviously not therefore it should not be judged like actual masterpieces.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

OVERRATED,"I went into this movie thinking this would be a freakin masterpiece because that's what everyone said it was. I mean, everybody who talks about this movie always says how funny and wonderful the movie is. Alas, I did not find it so. Not even close!Firstly, the humor in the movie, which I understood to be its best part before viewing, is just not that great! It's a shame because Don Rickles is an incredibly funny actor, but he is firstly underused and secondly given horrible jokes! Billy Crystal is another one where a fantastic comedian has a garbage take in the movie. And really nobody else had any good moments.As for the other characters, Indigo Montoya (I honestly have no clue how it's spelt) is fine, but he like everyone else is a one dimensional character. Nobody has any depth to them, anything beyond a basic motivation. Montoya wants to avenge his fathers death, The Princess and Wesley want to be together, the prince wants to marry her to start a war, Andre the Giant, well, is just sort of there.And the plot is nothing special, it's just a damsel in distress story with a couple other storylines to stretch it out. I've never read the book, so maybe it does better, but the movie? Nope.From a cinematography standpoint, it just feels very fake. The music is not good, the camerawork is bland, the sets look like they're fake. I can't tell if it's supposed to be ironic in this sense, but if it is, it's not done well enough to be ironically funny. It just feels cheap.This sort of feels like one of those movies that people saw as a kid and fell in love with and weren't old enough to see its flaws, and now that they're adults they have too much nostalgia surrounding the movie and remember it as they did as a child; perfect. To summarize, the movie is VERY overrated. Not worth the hype or the viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film holds up after 30 years,"The Princess Bride has been a film that I've always wanted to watch but never got the opportunity until now (Thank you Goodwill!). After finishing the film, I can see why it's close to so many people's hearts. Throughout the film, I caught myself smiling at moments and bursting with laughter at others. It is a very easy watch. The story's pace is great, making the viewer captivated and invested in the characters throughout the entire film. This is done with the help of some fantastically choreographed sword fighting, hilarious jokes, and an array of diverse characters.Even though I enjoyed this film, there are some things I can nitpick. I noticed many continuity errors while watching the film; not that it really matters, but it was sometimes distracting me from the story. I also felt as though there were times where the plot was too convenient or over the top. This could have been intentional since most child bedtime stories are outlandish, but there were scenes such as when they break into the castle that had me scratching my head and saying what the??? There were also parts of the film where I felt as though characters knew things or had things that they probably wouldn't, like when Fizzik pulls out a random black robe from his sleeve. That was confusing, but again, I might just be missing the humor behind those parts.Even though I had some tiny issues with the film, I still had fun with this movie. There were many moments that reminded me of when my dad used to read stories of knights and pirates to me as I fell asleep. This childhood sentimentality mixed with the feelings of whimsy and familiarity while watching the film is why I think that this film was such a fun experience. I would definitely recommend this film, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think most will find something fun about this story of silliness, revenge, and true love.The GoodActingHilarious/comedic timingCaptivating storyThe BadContinuity errorsPlot holesThe grandpa/grandson story sometimes getting in the way",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
old flavor,"magic. for the flavor of old fairy tales. for the fascinating manner to use pieces from myths. for the roots in contemporary every day life. and, sure, for the cast. because it is just a simple story. a grandfather, his nephew and a book. a princess and the adventures who defines true love. nothing new. but nothing too old. because the great virtue is the admirable translation of a state. nothing more. and this small detail does The Princess Bride an admirable work. a jewelry. so, a lovely film. like a box of memories. and this does it special. because the irony about classic stories, Peter Falk as the wise teller, Andre the Giant as the fascinating good ally, each, everybody does the adaptation of the novel of William Goldman a beautiful meet with the colors of an unique age.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing - especially for a Top 250 movie,"As I'm writing this, The Princess Bride is ranked 194 in the IMDb Top 250 list with an average rating of 8.1. Considering the rating and the fact that I love fantasy, I had high expectations. Long story short - I was very disappointed.It's not that The Princess Bride is bad. It has its moments and a unique kind of humor. But the overall impression is lackluster at best. The plot is thin, the acting is sub-par, the main characters nothing but clichés and the special effects are barely worth a laugh. Just look at those guys it rat costumes. Is that supposed to be frightening or hilarious?To mention a few good points, the minor characters of Inigo Montoya and Fezzik are very good. Also the cuts between the plot and the frame narrative about a grandfather and his grandson are pleasantly surprising. On the other hand, the frame narrative itself is unnecessary and only exists to provide the beginning and the ending that the plot is missing.Why do one third of the viewers rate this 10? According to my wife, she loved the movie as a kid, but was disappointed too when she saw it recently. I guess it just did not mature well.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful. The Beginning of Everything.,"""I've heard so much about this movie with references in pop culture and more than one mentions of how it was the best screenplay ever made, and while it is never good to go into a movie overhyped, it definitely delivered.This movie contained everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, plot twists, deceit, and most of all, true love.Overall, it is just a beautiful movie.It is a shame I was not old enough to see this movie when it came out to realize that the pacing and style was intentional. I thought it was simply a relic of the times. Now that I know I can appreciate the added layer of parody and the genius of the balance between parody and tribute.The whimsical fairy tale mood takes us along on a heartwarming journey that has us root for the heroes while smirking at the quips. Every character is lovable, every line is quotable, and every layer is clever and witty. The script itself will definitely be worth further scrutiny.The cultural effect this has had is well deserved. It is slightly surreal to recognize modern tropes, characters, and stories in this script and realize that I am watching what has inspired them.Dread Pirate Roberts. Vizzini. Inigo Montoya. Count Rugen. The Grandfather. I will revisit these characters and story again in the future.Not to do so would be inconceivable.""",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A SLEEPER HIT,"We were pleasantly surprised with ""The Princess Bride"". This is a very cleverly written movie. Also, it is obvious that the direction and acting had to be cleverly and skillfully done. The actors do not ""try"" to be funny. They trust the script. Actors who try to ham it up, even with a funny script (Milton Berle, for example), water down the humor of the scene. I found myself chuckling at many lines and situations. The casting is wonderful, and the cast and direction of Rob Reiner make the time period work. This production took some risks, but the gutsy move pays off with a definite sleeper hit.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A forgettable boys' film,"I guess I'm in the minority in finding this film thoroughly annoying. The person who insisted on showing this to me described it as ""the most quotable film ever"", and I can't help but feel that those are the people who enjoy this film - the kind of people who are obsessed with quoting things.I've always found those people so annoying.There's a clear storyline and some typecast characters and moments that feel vaguely feminist in a way that makes Feminist Guys feel good about themselves. (The entire film, of course, revolves around men.) Visually the whole thing is beautiful in the way things used to be beautiful in the 80s, before overly fast-paced editing and the constant grittiness of everything.I feel like such an old crank for giving a low rating to a film so well loved.

A Masterpiece as you would wish for.,"This is going to date me, but when I was a kid, my sister loved the soap opera 'Santa Barbara,' and because of Robin Wright, she wanted to see 'The Princess Bride.' It became one of her favorites, getting me to watch it. After watching and only being a kid, I just ""liked"" it. Since then, I must have seen this 20+ times. It is truly a timeless classic, made with pure heart, adventure, comedy, excitement, romance, etc – in other words, all of the needed elements of a masterpiece. (I do use the word ""timeless"" if you forgive the He-Man guys behind the all-but two-year-old Fred Savage and the high-tech ""video game"" he is playing. Other than that, it can be viewed in any decade.) We have Grandfather that reads the said-title to his ill grandson and so the story unfolds, beautifully. Westley and Buttercup are the central characters in this fairy-tale land, but all of the actors/characters have such depth and realism, it's almost never-ending in excitement when one appears, leaves and/or returns. You will see hilarious comedy, exciting sword-fighting or mind-games and true love. This movie is also perfect for the whole family. You might see people die, but it's as graphic as people simply falling off screen. Little blood, no nudity, no language, no sexI love the fact when they set out to make this, they didn't need to add any of that in and now have an all-time-classic. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprises, or the people the characters meet along the way or the near-death experiences they take with strides, so I would just highly recommend this all ages, to all audiences. If you've already experienced one of the best movies of all time, enjoy it again; see how movies should be made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
To think I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this...,"Confession. I don't usually like fantasy films. I didn't mind them as a kid and I think I quite liked this, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. I'd put it in the same category as Labyrinth. To be fair, they're both films that have garnered cult status. I've not watched Labyrinth in 30 years (nor do I feel the need to), but I'm guessing that this has aged better. I'd forgetten all about the story-telling narration aspect, Peter Falk reading 'The Princess Bride' to Fred Savage in his all- American bedroom, what a bizarre premise that seems, but it's ridiculously charming and effective. The opening scenes are pure schmaltzy over blown medieval romance and would be pretty unbearable without Fred's voice over, rolling its eyes. It's silly, but never really farcical, deftly balancing it's comedic wit with what feels like a genuine love for its characters. Ah the characters, if you're not smiling within 10 minutes, check your pulse, they're all wonderful! I'm hooked... and so is Fred. Let's not beat around the bush. It takes me no time at all to fall in love, it's 100 times better than I recall. Do you like perfectly choreographed swashbuckling sword fights? This has you covered, with added academic commentary from the combatants. Too flashy? How about ""You put down your rock, I'll put down my sword, we'll try kill each other like civilised people"". I'd also forgotten how quotable this is. ""Life is pain (heiress), anyone who says differently is selling something"" and of course ""Hello my name is Inigo Montoya, prepare to die."" The dialogue really is bloody flawless, littered with fun quips and even the haughty grandising from Prince Humperdink is fun. He is the weak link here though if there is one. Cary Elwes is absolutely marvellous, his lovely exposition explaining his becoming the Dread Pirate Roberts whilst dodging death in the fire swamp is so simple and effective, it's quite disarming and if you didn't already root for our hero, you do now. Then bang, bloody quicksand! (aka Lightning Sand) and 'Rodents of Unusual Size' cementing it's 80s calibre. If someone made this now (please say the rumours aren't true) they'd ruin it with CGI. You really can't beat a bloke in a giant rat suit. You also can't beat Mel Smith in dodgy make-up or Billy Crystal layered in tons of it. It's around this time too that I realise that Prince Humperdink's right hand man is no other than Nigel ""This one goes to up to 11"" Tufnel!! and he's still obsessed with numbers as he cranks up The Machine in The Pit of Dispair. It's all quite simple, the lower class good guys verses the villainous royalty, both chasing the prize that is Princess Buttercup. As we get toward the finale, the threatened wedding of Humperdink & Buttercup, I nearly fall off my chair as Peter Cook announces ""Mawwage is what bwings us together today"". It limps a little as the final minutes draw in, but Andre the Giant keeps the tone light as Buttercup is inevitably rescued, Inigo avenges his father and the as the fairytale ends, I'm left with a warm smile. To think I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this, ""Inconceivable!""",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Action, Adventure, Romance, Sword Play, Witty Dialogue","Cary Elwes and Robyn Wright in a fantasy story of epic proportions, how can you improve on that? Even with Peter Falk as the Narrator being interrupted by his grandson Fred Savage just seem to fit and rather than distract from an epic movie it just enhances the viewers experience.The Princess Bride is a fantasy romantic adventure movie with just the right blend of comedy, action, adventure and romance to suit everyone's taste.I love Andre the Giant as the Brute, Fezzik. Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya will forever be to me the perfect model of a Spanish duelist.His line from the move is almost as famous as the movie itself. ""My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father!

Wondrous fantasy that refuses to take itself seriously,"A gloriously witty fantasy film with its heart and soul in the right place -- on its sleeve.  All the performances are good (although Chrystal is too showy for my taste) but Patinkin's is exceptional.  Also features an endearing performance by wrestling star Andre ""The Giant"".  Special note should go to writer William Goldman, who does an almost perfect adaption of his wonderful novel.  Reiner acquits himself well, particularly through the wit and style of the performances (some of them from actors who have not done work so good in the rest of their careers), but relies on close-ups a bit too much.  Reiner should be credited, though, with letting the material speak for itself for the most part, providing fairly straightforward camera movement and positioning.

It has elements of romance, comedy, action, some magic, fantastic fight scenes, and several incredible plot twists that drive you deeper into the movie. All in all a very good movie and worthy of the following it has gathered over the years. The biggest downside to the movie, in my humble opinion, the narration and the inclusion of the boy and his grandfather break up the story enough for younger children to watch. These breaks happen mostly during kissing or scary scenes so children are saved from that, but as an adult it can make the film seem a bit disjointed and misleading.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cute story, but needs improvement","Before actually sitting down and watching this movie, I had heard that the film was a classic, must-see. I had also heard that the film had some sort of following since it was so well appraised. That being said, I had high hopes for something cute, cliché, and funny.This movie was definitely cute. This movie was definitely cliché. But funny is a bit of a stretch for me. Maybe it's because I'm not an 80's child, but I just didn't get any of the humour that was in this movie. I felt that what was obviously supposed to be comic relief just turned out to be awkward.And perhaps the directors might have intended this, but the first twenty minutes of the movie I wanted to just quit. The actors were so half-hearted, the whole plot line was just a little bit ridiculous and I shared the same feeling as the little boy being read the story: ""Why am I here? Why am I watching this movie?"" And so, right then and there, I would've given it a 5 star rating had I simply stopped the movie.But as the story went on, the characters developed a bit more and whether you want to or not, you feel yourself rooting for the hero to get the girl and for the Spanish swordsman to get revenge for his father and of course for the no good Humperdinck to be locked away. And for this, I upped the rating. At the end of the day, it really is a cute story.However, don't be expecting stellar acting performances, particularly clever plot twists nor great special effects (i.e. the blood in this movie literally looks like ketchup). Don't expect any major exploration of deep themes, and for feminists don't expect a strong female lead.

Even as a movie based on a fairy tale, this film feels too farcical in a lot of places to be taken seriously as a film that can establish an emotional connection with its audience.

Only (slight) saving grace is Cary Elwes,"Let me just start out by saying to the legions of fans that I just did not find this movie to be that good. Now, don't get me wrong...I love a lot of 80s movies, AND Monty Python, AND I have a pretty good sense of humor. All the rabid fans of ""The Princess Bride"" seem to use those as guidelines for who likes this movie, but I'm not buying it. This just did not do ANYTHING for me.My college roommate was shocked and appalled freshman year that I had never seen, or even heard of, ""The Princess Bride."" So, she had me set aside some time to watch it with her. Let's just say it was like this: have you ever been watching something, and thought ""when does this get good?"" That was exactly what I was thinking by about 20 minutes in. I gave it a fair shake: I'd never heard of it except for the glowing reviews of my roommate, and we also have pretty similar tastes in movies for the most part, so I was expecting it to be at least fairly good if she liked it THAT much. Ah, geez, was I wrong. It was all I could do to sit through this. I won't go summarizing the entire movie, but these are my main points:1. Cary Elwes is pretty good as Westley. But then again, I like him. I didn't really like any of the other characters at all, especially not Buttercup. I didn't even really want Westley to end up with her.2. This whole ""quotability factor"" is blown way out of proportion. Especially this ""inconceivable!"" line that everyone thinks is so great...only mildly amusing at best.3. The sheer repetitiveness of all the ""Prepare to die"" and ""Inconceivable"" stuff is ridiculous and tiresome (it gets that way VERY quickly). Even the oddly endearing ""As you wish""...you just get tired of hearing it. All the ""un-funniness"" really just takes away from the few amusing parts.4. When it comes down to it, I was just bored.

"THE PRINCESS BRIDE (Rob Reiner, 1987) **1/2","I knew of this film's reputation as a cult item before going in but, for the life of me, despite a few amusing scenes scattered throughout, I just can't fathom why this is so!

Its silly linear story telling and predictability is quite unnerving. This would be a great movie for fans of Sesame Street and I think they forgot to include the Muppets in this tale. But as for a movie to cater to adults it is very mediocre. The cast felt too protected and it was silly childish fun. I cannot emphasize enough the predictability and lack of substance this film has. I know I'm the minority to just sees this film for what it is but it was a waste of time.

Genuine classic.,"""This is Spinal Tap"", ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""The Princess Bride"" give director Rob Reiner a trio of timeless classics. ""Princess Bride"" takes the classic boy-meets-girl setup and adds ""Wizard of Oz""-level lines such as ""life is pain, anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something"" and ""you keep saying that word (inconceivable)-I do not think it means what you think it means."" He also adds a flawless cast including the under-appreciated Mandy Patinkin, a shockingly menacing portrayal from the normally silly Christopher Guest and the previously unusable Andre' the Giant who is somehow made to deliver an understandable and winning performance. By the turns the movie is funny, frightening, dramatic, comedic, suspenseful and whimsical.

It made me love adventure and question whether or not a pirate and thief could be honorable. It was a great movie at this level.As I got older I began to appreciate the comedy. I laughed at Miracle Max. I laughed at the wedding scene. I laughed at the Sicilian and Fezzik's rhyming. I began to appreciate how the fencing was not just well done, but given a humorous tone. It works even better like this, and was like an entirely new movie.Even in the last few years, I have gained a new appreciation for the movie. I have noticed the different archetypes, and I understand that the movie and the book are of great literary value as well.

But movies have something taken out of them when you have to watch it with the means of studying it.I know it is spoke highly of, so I decided to rent it to watch it again since I love fairy tales and satire and am much more of a movie buff than I was at 15.I have to say, while I was entertained throughout, I still feel, after 13 years, much the same as I did then. Often my opinions change after so much time, but not in this case. It had its funny moments, but I just felt like it wasn't quite there. There were funny parts about it, but it wasn't consistent. Buttercup had no humorous aspect whatsoever which made the mood confusing. It isn't as though I can't appreciate subtlety, but I felt that after some comical scenes with Westly and Inigo, the characters didn't remain funny. It seemed indecisive with humour in spurts so that otherwise serious people would occasionally make funny remarks.I think my overall feeling is that I don't feel pulled towards having watched a comedy or a magical fairy tale. I feel a little lost. I think it's not as funny as it was supposed to be. It wasn't full of jokes that didn't work. The ones they had were good. There just weren't that many jokes to begin with. If Buttercup had been more of an airhead as she was supposed to be in the book, it might have opened the door for more humour.I still enjoyed the film, but I feel it fell short of what it was intended to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The plot was unexciting, the timing of the ""gags"" was awful, the set was ludicrous, the editing was substandard, the lighting was quaint, the lead actress lacked appeal, the lead actor - what's with that little moustache?, and the comedians weren't (with one honourable exception) funny. The honourable exception was the clergyman as played by Peter Cook. We miss you, Peter. But what on earth were you doing in this morass of mediocrity?!For the first twenty minutes I kept thinking that it would get better to justify its rating. Not a chance. So how did it get into the IMDb top 250? Come on guys, let me into the secret here. It can't be a ""cult"" thing, you could go to any bad movie and laugh at how bad it is. So is everyone marking it based on some hazy recollection from childhood? Have you actually WATCHED it recently? If this movie came out today, it would tank at the box office and struggle to get above 5.0 on IMDb.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My fav,"My favorite movie of all time, hands down. I watched it for the first time in the theatre. As it ended, the audience sat motionless and quiet for several beats, then burst into loud applause as the ending credits rolled. I'm not always so prophetic, but I was incredibly moved. I said to my husband, ""We've just seen the Academy Award winner."" If I had no other basis for recommendation, I would say the breathtaking cinematography and transporting musical score would make a viewing worthwhile . But these are merely the window dressings. The screenplay is enchanting. Also, without an understanding of the historical times, it would be too easy to say simplistically that this is a woman trying to live within the terms of a marriage of convenience and then compensating with pursuit of a doomed passion. What was crafted out of a mishmash of a more-or-less factual account is still a beautiful love and adventure story.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't Let the Title Fool You,"I put off seeing this movie simply because of the title. I figured that this was just another chick flick. It's not...I have been told by many that I have to watch this film. I hear people throw out words like, ""great"", ""classic"", and ""must see"". Even my wife said to me, ""You're a collector, and never seen the 'Princess Bride'?"" So, I gave it a shot, and I loved it. I can't put my finger on the reason why though. I must say though, that there's something about this movie, it grows on you, and I do love it now. Let me tell you a bit about it:Hard to talk about without giving away spoilers, so forgive me if there isn't much info here, but I hope this helps you. Let me start by saying that this is a great movie to watch whether you're alone, with your friends, or even with your girlfriend. There's action, though not intense like say, Bloodsport. There's A TON of comedy. There's a love story. A fantastic cast. Sword fights, monsters, poison, dungeons, castle sieges. What more could you ask for? Despite all of these things, this is not a very serious film. Which some people like. For me, it depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a serious medieval period piece like ""Kingdom of Heaven"", sometimes I'm in the mood for the opposite, like ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" I would say that, in terms of seriousness vs spoof, this film is sandwiched exactly between ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""Men in Tights"". Not too spoofy, but not one that stays with you and keeps you thinking all night either.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Princess Bride is a wonder movie that can be enjoyed by any audience.,"The Princess Bride is an amazing movie for people of all ages. It has so many elements to it that it can be classified under multiple genres, and the acting is excellent.

(Here it must be pointed out that William Goldman, the author of the novel version of The Princess Bride, was the screenwriter for the movie version.) The Princess Bride is an endearing movie with all the ingredients needed to produce a ""feel good"" experience. It is highly recommended by this ""critic.""

I don't think this movie is terrible like I thought Titanic was, but I don't think it was all that great either. I actually found it rather boring, the special effects lame, and the love story unbelievable. But as usual, people buy into this kind of thing, especially teenage girls. I'm just thankful that there are people around with sense who don't buy into every bit of syrupy sappy love stories Hollywood serves up. I give the movie about a 6 out of 10. I might have given it a seven, but the fact that it is in the top 100 of all times made me feel otherwise. Watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail for some great comedy, but only watch this if you are drawn in by sappy syrupy love stories.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Still simply stunning,"Having just recently sat through Dungeons and Dragons (*shudder*) with my daughter, I decided that I should show her that there is indeed good in the world, blew the dust off my VHS copy of The Princess Bride, and settled down to watch it with her.I'm not going to draw a comparison, though. It'd be so unfair, for this film remains one of the very best I've ever seen. It's beautifully photographed and directed, it's extremely funny, and succeeds captivatingly at poking fun at itself too, and it's totally engaging throughout. There's not a weak piece of acting in there - okay, admittedly we're talking about fairy tale stereotypes almost throughout, but even so every performance meshes just perfectly. Cary Elwes (and what *has* happened to his career?) is just ideal in his slightly self-mocking role as boyscout meets Errol Flynn, and Robin Wright just shines as the Princess - she's possibly the most beautiful woman I've ever sen on film, giving Grace Kelly a real run for her money. Chris Sarandon makes an excellent scheming evil prince, and the comic vignettes from the likes of Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn and Mel Smith are a sheer delight.Fred Savage, who I am no particular fan of, gives a very creditable performance as the grandson, capturing the truculence of a 9 year old without once becoming annoying, and his relationship with the accomplished Peter Falk as his grandfather is touchingly and accurately observed.But the whole show is entirely stolen by Mandy Potemkin as Inigo, the bandit with a mission. His role is both a comic tour de force, and poignant too. I'm sure that even in 30 years' time, if I hear the words ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"", I'll start smiling and chuckling at the evoked memory of a movie that is in its genre simply beyond compare.Oh and my daughter sat simply spellbound through every frame.

Nicely done fantasy romance comedy movie.,"This movie has a grandfather reading to his grandson, and we get to see the story he is reading unfold before our eyes.  Rather good movie that entertains in so many ways.  The cast is excellent, even Andre the Giant is very good in this one.  Turns out he is the only wrestler that can act.  The story is fast moving and has some nice twists and surprises along the way, they surprised me the first time I saw this one (I won't give anything away though).  What made this film good for me though was that it contained quite a lot of humor and it really worked well.  I loved Cary Elwes delivery and Patinkin was also very good in his role too.  Billy Crystal and Carol Kane also make memorable appearances in this one.  Though one of my favorite scenes has to be when Cary's character has a battle of wits with the one guy.  One of the funnier scenes I found in this one.  There are also nice set designs like in the fire swamp.  The periodic interruptions also work, as they never let you forget that it is a simple story being read by a grandfather.  Good movie all around and fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Filled with dashing heroes, giants, sword-fights, true love, evil princes, fencing, it is a true fairytale at heart, but don't let that put you off. The sheer excitement of it will impress it into your heart when young, and the great one-liners will have you chuckling as an adult. It is obvious that the cast had great fun making this movie, and it stars the beloved Cary Elwes, who apart from 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' and a few bit-parts, hasn't done much at all.

A Classic Fairy Tale with an Inconceivable Twist!,"The Princess Bride is one of the most brilliant romantic comedies of all time. It is carefully constructed to fill so many film genres, including: romance, fairy tale, satire, comedy, and adventure. This film features an all star cast, who collaborated on every aspect of the film. The actors brought so much to their characters, creating well rounded personalities from even the most grotesque caricatures.The tale is based on a satirical novel by William Goldman. The film begins with a grandfather reading the story to his sick grandson, and as Goldman said: the grandfather is only retelling the ""good parts"" of the supposed historical tale. If you haven't read the book, but love the movie, I seriously recommend you sit down to read as soon as possible.This film is perfect for all people who enjoy a good laugh, and an even better romance.

It is truly a story that will stand the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slightly overrated,"Before you jump on my head about the title of my comment, please hear me out. I definitely do not think The Princess Bride is a bad film, per se. I have heard it called all sorts of things, from a timeless classic to a great fantasy romp for all ages. Neither of those things are quite true. The film is as dated as most of the Nightmare On Elm Street episodes (especially the Clown Freddy ones). It also falls into the trap of trying to appeal to everyone, and as a result limiting its audience more than it otherwise would. But what it lacks in classic status, it (almost) makes up for in some other areas. On one hand, I can see why I was so reluctant to see the film when it was recommended to me around ten years ago. It was, after all, released in the same year as the holy chunk of awesome that is RoboCop. On the other hand, I can see why it was recommended to me on two occasions that span over a decade apart. I won't put this in my list of favourite films, but I admire it for its uniqueness among the fodder that was made in the same year.I will get the negatives out of the way, since they are the smaller part of this comment. The extraneous storyline involving Peter Falk playing a grandfather who reads this tale to his grandson, played with impeccable irritation by a very young Fred Savage, was utterly unnecessary. They get in the way of the story rather than enhancing it, especially when the action is interrupted to make some comment or to beat us over the head with how universal the story supposedly is. The characters are about as deep as a puddle, and we get no sense of why Westley loves Buttercup (or vice versa) so dearly. None of what passes for motivation or character development here is shown to us, it is all told. Some of the locations shown in the film have names so daft it will make your eye muscles twitch. Yes, there were names with a daft factor in adventure films like The Goonies (a far better children's adventure film in spite of what the IMDb would have you believe), but The Goonies succeeded in making the audience not notice (or care).Now that the problems are out of the way, let's concentrate for a moment of the film's strengths. Mandy Patinkin would have been a far better choice for the focal point of the story, as he runs with the campiness of the story at a speed that would impress Olympic champions. Christopher Guest portrays Patinkin's nemesis with a grace and, dare I say it, subtlety that could have worked wonders if it had transferred to the rest of the film. Robin Wright does the best she can with a very unidimensional role. She is mainly there to tell off the villain or beg for the hero's aid. The real jewel of the cast here is André the Giant, one of showbusiness' true well... gentle giants. As he is making comedy based around his knowledge of how big he is, the softer side of him that realises he is not in the best of health even for a forty-one year old shines through every time he delivers a line. Granted, one can only understand half of what he says at best. But of all the performers in the film, André is the one that will be remembered long after the rest have been forgotten.Some of the trick shots or effects sequences are lousy. The shrieking eels sequence was obviously meant to induce tension in the target audience, but even in five year olds, if the manner in which it is set up doesn't induce laughs or groans, the eels themselves surely will. Others, however, are very well-realised, and work well enough to make the film watchable. When André the Giant carries his castmates up the face of a cliff, one does not see whether it is just trick photography or a set, but it suspends disbelief enough to leave one in awe of the character. I don't know why the IMDb lists the stunt rider of André in the final ride-away scene as being obvious. Maybe I am not as cynical or jaded as I would like to believe, but this shot sold itself well enough that I could feel sorry for the horse. This, friends and neighbours, is a sign of a well-made film.In summation, The Princess Bride is a lot better than I thought it would be, but it is nowhere near as good as many make out. For fantasy adventures, I am far more inclined to recommend The Goonies, which is far more realistic in the sense of being less normalistic than is the case here. Nonetheless, if you have already seen The Goonies, then The Princess Bride is worth a look. I gave it a seven out of ten. Of the hundreds of DVDs I have around me, it is far from the last I would watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Generally A Fun Film, So No Reason For Religious Cheap Shots","Here's another movie I just loved the first time I saw it, but it went downhill with subsequent viewing. That's not knocking the film overall, because it is entertaining. The dialog is funny throughout most of it and the scenery is beautiful. It's a nice-looking disc which enhances the interesting visuals.The Spaniard, played by Mandy Patinkin, was the most interesting character, I thought, along with Wallace Shawn (the short, bald-headed guy). However, ""Inigo Montoya's"" (Patinkin) whole life was centered on revenge, a poor message to give all the kids who watched this film. Robin Wright made her film debut and looked extremely pretty.Speaking of poor messages, I didn't think the cheap shot given the clergy-figure, dressed up like the Pope, was appropriate. Of course, being a Rob Reiner film, it's no surprise the extreme left-winger would put that in the film. At the ending credits, the reverend is sarcastically labeled ""The Impressive Clergyman."" Also, hearing young Fred Savage utter the Lord's name in vain was not necessary, even if it was in the book.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I've read the book and I recommend you go check it out after seeing the film. There are a lot of little funny bits that didn't make it to the screen.

Terrible,"I don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to after watching this. I watched this with my g/f last night. I'm working my way through most of top films at the moment and was looking forward to it after its 8.1 rating from over 100,000 people. I'm also a big fan of the fantasy genre.Well, all I can say is this was just abysmal. Not a patch on films such as Neverending story or Willow. As others have suggested I can only imagine the high rating due to kids have fond memories of this from their child hood.Not remotely funny, at least not intentionally. The only part that had me and my g/f laughing was the part where they encounter the rats. They looked so bad it was amusing. The best part was when one leaped at the main character. It looked like someone in the studio had simply picked up the rat and thrown it at him(can't even remember his name).Luckily I fell asleep about 50 mins and my g/f had the decency not to wake me up. She assured me I didn't miss anything.If you're over 15 and watching this for the 1st time expect to be disappointed. The film hasn't aged at all well, the effects are really terrible, the small villain has to be one of the most annoying characters I've ever witnessed. Looks like they had a budget of £20.Even Army of Darkness was marginally better than this and I thought that was terrible and not at all funny either.Receives a 2, rather than a 1 thanks to the rat scene making us both laugh hard for 30 seconds or so.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a fun fairytale satire, as much as it is a successful fable for pure genre fans","Rob Reiner was on a streak in the mid 80s, and though it could be argued he his his peak at the start with Spinal Tap, this and Stand by Me can be considered two other important works in his decidedly since mixed career as a director. Princess Bride is as self-conscious as comedies get, but it's also a lot of fun for the whole family, and it's not just a typical aside to say so. On the contrary, as an adult now I find it funnier seeing it for the first time then I might have if I had seen it as a kid. This isn't to say that it doesn't have some special quality about it, that it's almost like a sprightly live-action cartoon. But there's a generous wink and nod behind most of the good jokes in the film, like how dialog between many of the characters point out some of the loops medieval fantasies take, in small things like climbing up a rocky cliff or in drinking a poisoned drink or going through a nasty swamp or in the convoluted mechanics of a ""Machine"", or even how to revive one from the dead with a, uh, whatever it is that's given to Cary Elwes.It's the tale as simple as can be: girl and boy fall in love, girl loses boy, girl gets engaged to bad man, girl gets kidnapped by dastardly (and inept) figures, girl gets re-captured by a man in a mask that turns out to be the boy again, boy loses girl again, boy comes back from dead, boy and girl go back together again. OK, a bit complicated, but the fun in William Goldman's script is seeing how the questioning of the archetypes goes hand-in-hand with telling a conventionally satisfying story. There's not a whole lot of dimension to most of them- certainly not to the bride- but that's part of the excitement is to see how the characters meet their fates (particularly Patikin's character, who will stop at nothing to kill the six-fingered man who killed his father, as he says about ten times while in the big climactic sword-fight). And why should there be, as the story itself is being read to a precocious child (Fred Savage) by a mustached Peter Falk.Actually, the script probably isn't even the best part, and neither is Reiner's often wonderful direction (though it helps, minus the score by Knopfler which is way too cheesy even for the material here). What makes this so watchable a comedy are the actors, who are all at the top of their games. Wallace Shawn (inconceivable!), Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal (65? can't do it for that), Patinkin, Christopher Guest in his most deadpan character yet, and Elwes and Robin Wright Penn in such straight roles, are equally enthralling and hilarious in how they dance around such good material, giving it the proper edge when needed and light touches of pure irony as well. Being more aware of what some of these character actors and stars have done now it makes for it to be hilarious, but what makes it work for kids too is that the actors never stray from being true to the goofy levels to their roles. This isn't quite Monty Python being dealt with here, but more family-friendly satire, and it's a success through and through.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Lively swashbuckler,"THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those well-loved 1980s classics that I'd never seen before, so I thought I'd better get around to watching it as everybody else has, it seems. It turns out to be a slight but lively swashbuckler in which various heroic characters team up to battle a dastardly prince and his allies in a quasi-historical world.The film had a budget of 16 million dollars and yet it looks rather cheap in places, but I guess that's part of the fun. Although the narrative is set in some kind of unspecified historical past, the script is replete with modern-day gags which work nicely somehow. It's the humour that makes this so entertaining, and without these gags I think it would have been rather ho hum.Cast-wise, we're saddled with the weak and weedy Cary Elwes as the erstwhile hero and Robin Wright as the uninteresting damsel-in-distress, but the best actor by far is Mandy Patinkin who excels as the master Spanish swordsman. Patinkin has natural wit and flair, plus plenty of charisma that really comes across. Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon are the pantomime villains, there are cameos for comedians like Billy Crystal, Mel Smith, and Peter Cook, and a nice supporting role for lovable wrestler Andre the Giant. In fact this is an all-star thing with a wraparound story involving Fred Savage and Peter Falk. THE PRINCESS BRIDE was shot mainly in the Peak District here in the UK, which looks fantastic, and contains a lovely fencing bout that brings to mind the likes of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn.

Very over-rated in my humble opinion,"Peter Falk gives my favorite performance of his as the Grandfather who reads to his sick grandson, (played by Fred Savage, who gives an on and off cheesy performance) a book about a farm boy Westley (played by Carl Elwes, in his best performance,) who falls in love with a beautiful girl named Buttercup.

Another performance was Fred Savage, although a minor role, it too didn't have me going either.

Great one for the whole family,"A grandfather reads a fantasy story to his grandson.This is a strong comedy adventure with great humour and performances.One of the major strengths of 'The Princess Bride' is its potential to be enjoyed by everyone in the household.

Everyone looks and acts the part, from the swashbuckling heroes, to sneering villains, and unusual characters, well placed in a fantasy movie. Robin Wright is perfectly cast in the title role and also functions nicely as a straight-man to the humour. Billy Crystal and Carol Kane also stand out in a hilarious cameo.The humour quite absurd and self deprecating. I love how it keeps a generally serious tone as certain characters spout dialogue that makes fun of the genre.Visually it works very well, particularly the location shots in various well-chosen landscapes in the Britain and Ireland. There is also some good practical effects used to bring certain creatures to life.Peter Falk and Fred Savage are very entertaining in the narrator and audience roles. These scenes add another level to the humour and make the story quite distinctive from other stories within the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

inconceivable that it is rated as high as it is.,"This is just an absolutely terrible movie. It dragged for the most part. Dialogue was juvenile. Jokes weren't funny at all. Acting was very bad. Rating is probably as high as it is as kids remember it fondly. Can't understand how anyone who is 25 years or older could possible have liked this movie. For me I always liked Andre the Giant and was happy to see him in this film but the rest of the characters were not believable and it actually looked like they were acting. It was as if they were auditioning for a part but weren't. The only part I liked was the line ""You killed my father, prepare to die.

A short review and commentary.,"The Princess Bride is a wonderful tale of True Love and True Adventure, as told by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to a sick grandson (Fred Savage).  It does not take long for the viewer to become invested in the characters, and our frustration when things don't seem to work out the way we expect them to is ably voiced by the sick grandson, who exclaims ""Grandpa, you're messing up the story"".The beautiful Buttercup has lost her true love Westley and seems fated to marry the evil Prince.  Will her True Love come and save her?  Will Grandpa get the story right?? And will there be any kissy scenes?An epic tale of Pirates, Giants, Princesses and Miracles, The Princess Bride will be equally enjoyed by viewers of all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ah, yes ... The Princess Bride ...","A dazzling tale of a princess, a peasant, swordplay, revenge, good and evil - so why does William Goldman feel it needs a frame story?  The frame story he uses in the novel is intrusive and, to be frank, pungently offensive; here he uses the more conventional device of having an old man tell the story to his grandson, which may be hackneyed but is nonetheless a distinct improvement.  At any rate it helps me understand why the frame story is there.  It's Goldman's way of announcing that he has a real corker of a story to tell - a story so superb that it's simply impossible not to be enthralled by it.  Goldman is daring us to find fault.  `My main story is SO GOOD,' he says, `that I can afford to encumber it with this irritating framing device, and it will STILL make your heart pound.  I can dare you to be indifferent and you'll STILL care.'And he's right.So are you ready for it?  Can you handle what Goldman is presenting as the Ultimate Story?  Then proceed - and I'd advise you to proceed with the film, rather than the book.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My favorite fantasy,"Let me say that ""The Princess Bride"" is probably the best fairy tale presented on screen since John Boorman's ""Excalibur"" (1981). Of course there's been plenty of other's I've left out, but this all just squarely my opinion. William Goldman seemed to really have a ball writing the book the film is based off, as well as the screenplay. Rob Reiner directs, much in the same league as ""Stand By Me"" the previous year, with some pretty hard laughs. But what gets me loving this picture so much is the portrayal of true love. Let me explain: I've never had a girlfriend, which allows me to relate to the main character and his experiences in a number of ways: Westley (Cary Elwes) is the ""farm boy"" for the lovely Buttercup (Robin Wright), who takes nearly every opportunity to insult him and realizes one day, out of the blue, she loves him. But Westley journeys across the ocean to collect a fortune and is attacked by pirates and presumed killed in the fray. Buttercup sinks to the lowest level of grief, and finds companionship with arrogant Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), who forces her into an unwilling marriage. But a mysterious figure known only as the Dread Pirate Roberts (could it be Westley in disguise?) appears on the scene and along with two others including the vengeance-driven Spanish fencer Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and the towering Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant), they seek to rescue Buttercup. ""The Princess Bride"" is pure fun from start to finish, and the cast (what a cast - many of whom are American - faking their best European accents) seems to be having a ball. But love is what is at the center, and that's what I find the most impressive. Every classic fairy tale has such qualities and ""The Princess Bride"" satirizes each trait and then some more. A classic, lovely story, ""The Princess Bride.""10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A gem from the 80s that still holds up well...,"I first saw this film in fifth grade and thought it was fantastic. I mean, come on, it had action, fantasy, romance, and comedy all in one! And even watching the movie now, the only thing that doesn't hold up as well are the special effects in the film, notably the R.O.U.S., the fires in the fire swamp, and the obvious body doubles here and there.But as for the rest of the film:The acting isn't Oscar-worthy, but it definitely isn't unmemorable. The characters are well-beloved (my favorites being Miracle Max and Valerie, the bishop, and Fezzik), and the actors were well-cast in their roles and also performed quite well.If you haven't read the book (by William Goldman) that this was adapted from, then read it. The movie is very similar to the book. In fact a lot of quotes in the movie are direct (or similar) to quite a few quotes in the book. Although there are very few differences, the book is just as exciting and witty as the movie.The costumes, makeup, and hairstyling were pretty good for a 1987 film. Props for Carol Kane and Billy Crystal's makeup and Buttercup's beautiful wedding dress.And props for Mark Knopler's music score as well. Aside from the action music, most of the score is sweet, poignant, and beautiful, especially the main theme. I'm glad that ""Storybook Love"" was up for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song because I would have selected it as one of the best that year as well.Overall, I know millions of people have seen this film (which makes it kind of a ""cult film""), but if you haven't seen it, you definitely should. Great casting, memorable characters, a wonderful storyline, great music, and lots of comedy, fantasy, action, and romance all in one. Who could ask for more? I can easily see why so many people adore this movie. It really is a treasure.My Personal Oscar Picks for this movie:Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Song (""Storybook Love""), and possibly Best Original Score",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Everyone Smiles, 'cept her","I like this movie, but I'm going to point out it's weakest point first:  the Princess Bride herself.  As the heroine of this tongue in cheek fairy tale, Robin Wright is lovely, but sorta wooden and unemotive.  I don't think she cracks a smile once.  Other than that, this is one of those fun movies that anyone could watch and find something to enjoy.Though Inigo Montoya is probably the most quoted character, I thought Wallace Shawn's character was the most fun.  The versatile Christopher Guest is also a hoot.  This is one of those films like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" that will continue to be watched for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

GREAT movie for kids and a classic,"I loved this movie as a kid, it has a little of everything (action, romance, adventure, humor, supernatural, fantasy, to name most). But now as an adult, sadly I do not think this movie held up over time (at least for myself). I actually found it boring and rather childish, but I still rate this highly because I am sure a lot of people will like watching this.Definitely a classic movie and worth a watch, just no longer up there with my favorites. The acting is great, characters are classic, and it has a lot to like. I just wish it held up better for me, but I still recommend it (if that makes sense). Cary Elwes proves yet again that he is a great and very under-rated actor, as he carries this movie and plays the part naturally. He was pretty young in this as well, the rest of the cast is spot on in their respective parts. For kids, this movie could not be more highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Undeserved Popularity,"I am one of the few people I know who truly does not like this movie- and I usually love fantasy. Although the movie had some great (very quotable) lines and several strong characters, it seemed very two-dimensional to me.The main problem I had with this movie: (some minor spoilers) - Buttercup is a complete ditz. She has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and her bravest act is to contemplate suicide when she believes her ""true love"" to be dead. Even the earliest Disney princesses had more personality than her. I thought we were past movies in which the fair maiden does nothing but let the handsome guy come rescue her, but apparently we aren't.All in all, I felt that this movie had some good parts, but I simply could not get past Buttercup's character enough to enjoy the rest of the movie. Therefore, I give it a 5.0 out of 10 for being fun and original, but anti-feminist.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clever and fun fantasy film,"One of the most well-known and respected fantasy films and for a good reason. The Princess Bride is a genre-defining film that has endured the test of time beautifully and still stands as one of the best adventure films and the one film you should see if you're interested in swashbuckler films.What I like the most about this film is its unpredictability. Sure, it's an adventure film aimed for all audiences, so the good guys are going to win and all that, but the way they go about accomplishing that task is what makes this film enjoyable. You're never sure what's going to happen next, the characters are very creative and there are a lot of them, the plot twists come right out of nowhere and the humorous tongue-in-cheek tone ties it all together. There is drama and high stages, yes, but it's still an adventure film and meant to be enjoyed with a smile on your face.The story develops rather erratically, going from one scene to another with very few tie-ins, but in this case it works, because the whole film is told more like a fairy tale than a typical story. So it's more of a preference of style than a flaw.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the frame story involving a grandfather reading his grandson a book while he lies sick in bed is not as interesting as the actual story and sometimes the kid's interruptions in the story come at the worst possible times. This is only a nitpick, however, because the banter between these two is actually quite humorous, which keeps it from becoming an annoyance. It'd be interesting to see just how well the actual adventure would flow without the frame story, just for comparison.I like this film, I like a lot. It has a strong story, it's fun and charming without being immature, its characters are great, it has a lot of memorable dialogues and as a whole it's just bursting with imagination. One of the best adventure films I've ever seen and well worth your time, whoever you happen to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film to share with your kids like the grandfather did with the book ...,"It is not surprising that Rob Reiner chose to narrate ""The Princess Bride"" from the frame story of a grandfather (Peter Falk) reading a book to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). The film is a fairy tale written by an adult who understood children, not any children, but modern children impregnated with action films and video games, who would more likely open their minds to thrilling sword-fights and adventures than anything involving 'a lot of kissing'.Reiner amusingly punctuates the story with the kid's reaction as to reassure the most skeptical of us that this won't be your typical 'fairy tale' fantasy. And rightfully so because the overture would hardly make kids lower their guard, the film starts with a (typical) love story between the beautiful Buttercup (Robyn Wright) and her servant Wesley (Cary Elwes). Wesley obeys every demand with an enamored ""as you wish"", until Buttercup realizes she loves him too, and the film hasn't make it to the fifth minute before the two leads embrace in land of Florin's bucolic landscape.The signature shot of ""The Princess Bride"" cuts immediately to the kid who can't listen anymore to that cutesy stuff, and at this time, Reiner got us, and by us, I mean, children and adults, the audience is relieved to see that the emotion shared by the listener is taken into consideration, and will work as the premise to a whole other material. I remember very well, the first time I saw the film, on 7th grade class, we were all 12 or 13-year old preteens and our teacher used the film to illustrate the value of 'narrative structure', we were all, 'what the hell is that?' until that immediate reaction, and the story could finally pick up.Wesley leaves the country to get rich and marry Buttercup but he's taken by Dread Pirate Roberts, known for never leaving anyone alive. Buttercup, out of despair, agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) but she's kidnapped by three eccentric outlaws whose different frames works like a comic-book gag. There's Vizzini, the Sicilian boss, played by a cunning and detestable Wallace Shawn, Inigo Monotoya (Mandy Patinkin) as the skilled swordsman and Fezzik, played by champion wrestling Andre the Giant who doesn't seem to carry the symptoms of gentleness  not yet. They take the Princess offshore, followed by a masked stranger who seems to be Private Roberts and Prince Humperdinck and his men.When the film was screened, the teacher referred to many scenes as parodies : the Screaming Eels were an imitation of ""Jaws"", the investigating styles of Prince Humperdinck were borrowed from Sherlock Holmes, the masked estranger combined with Montoya's Spanish accent made Zorro, and so on and so forth. ""The Princess Bride"" could easily be labeled as a parody, feeling and talking like one, but I'm positive that the film isn't as much a parody as it's a fairy tale, in fact, it deliberately floats between these two levels, making possible to touch your heart with a genuine innocence, not incompatible with its sharp wit.And this is another power of the film, it takes some distance from Disney-like stuff without turning it into derision either, it's like a wink to the audience with a friendly tap on the shoulder. The story presents a series of adventures where we discover that there are more than simple characters in the film: Montoya plans to kill the six-fingered man who killed his father, he's already prepared his speech and naturally, with the repeated ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"", everyone cheered in the classroom, not to mention the last quote before the final slay. After triumphing over Montoya and Fezzik, there's also an unforgettable duel of spirits with Vizzini whose outcome is not only unpredictable but cynically hilarious.The film is full of eccentric characters that all have their shining moments. It also reminded me of these Grimm fairy tales we read on 11th grade, where everyone served a purpose, the villains, the antagonists, sometimes a place like the Forest with the fire spouts, lightning sand, and Rodents of Unusual Size, the helpers, like an unrecognizable Billy Crystal and Carol Kane, as Mr and Mrs. Miracle Max who'll resurrect the hero and allow the film to conclude on a satisfying way. And there's the eternal idea that brains triumph over brawn have and the way, Wesley defeats Count Humperdinck (Sarandon is excellent!) is also funny and original at the same time.The film has the wit and fun of Rob Reiner's ""Spinal Tap"" but it ends with the same bittersweet melancholy than his ""Stand by Me"", when after the excitement, we're left with the feeling to have witnessed something so miraculously sweet and tender, (the music helps and the ""Storybook Love"" enhance that emotionality) that we've had our share of thrills or fun and we're not that reluctant to have a final kiss at the end. The grandfather closes the book before the kissing, but the kid's reaction again matches ours  the film is one beautiful romance and deserves a romantic finale, we wouldn't have accept it from a spoof, but if it was one, the film wouldn't have been this endearing and so lovable classic.""The Princess Bride"" is a timeless classic full of unforgettable characters, a sweet thought to the late Andre the Giant who marked forever Cinema with his giant footprint, and unforgettable quotes. The grandfather couldn't give a more appropriate answer than his 'as you wish' when his grandson asked him to tell him the story again the day after. And like the book, the film can be seen over and over and I'm looking forward to show it to my little girl when she'll be old enough to appreciate it, hoping that her generation wouldn't be made of children reluctant to watch such a cinematic treasure.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""As you wish""","A good friend of mine loves this movie and convinced me to watch it.

As You Wish,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time! THe thing is,I saw this in the theater almost eighteen years ago and at the time,while I enjoyed it a lot,I didn't realize what kind of special movie it was until I'd watch it again years later.To me,what marks this film as special is the fact that it dares to make the simple method of storytelling as the crux to the film. Even though the movie is,on face value,a tale of the love between Princes Butercup(Robin Wright,now Penn)and her servant boy Westley(Cary Elwes,whose career since seems to be underusing his talents),it's also many things:a caper,a comedy,a uniquely created characters,a drama,a morality tale and a love story that isn't as clichéd as it might appear. It's unapologetically anachronistic and yet still seemingly true to the sword-and-sorcerer fairy tale genre.It's also the underlying tale of the ability for the bond between a grandfather(the always solid Peter Falk) and grandson(Fred Savage,pre-""Wonder Years"")to supercede a contemporary kid's need for all the comforts and instant gratification kids tend to expect anymore.BAsically,this is a well crafted weaving of two stories to fit one movie. Very strong supporting roles from Billy Crystal,Andre the Giant,Mandy Patinkin,Christopher Guest,CArol Kane,Wallace Shawn and Chris Sarandon also flesh this story out effectively.It makes me sad that Rob Reiner doesn't seem to think he needs to direct anything even remotely like this film anymore.Mark KNopfler's score is absolutely beautiful,too.I could try to say more to tell you why I think this is such a great film,but you'll just have to see this yourself to get the idea.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So many perfect elements... Where to begin?,"In '86 I was lucky to find an old paperback copy of William Goldman's ""The Princess Bride"" at a yard sale. I had already read some of his novels, and while I hadn't heard of this particular one, I quickly consumed it, enjoying it tremendously. It was a very clever, but ultimately affectionate, parody of fairy-tale conventions with an equally clever and complicated narrative. It was a fun, memorable book, and when I heard not long after about a film adaptation, I wondered how much of the book's clever tone would translate to the screen.Quite a bit, as it turned out. Rob Reiner's movie version is an outstanding movie, and one that I was pleased to see holds up incredibly well, even a quarter-century later.The brilliance to this movie is in its tone. As I said, it's a parody of fairy-tale conventions. Goldman's characters start out as cardboard-cutout stereotypes, and the events of the story itself are outlandishly improbable (up to and including resurrection), but even as the story gently mocks those conventions, it ultimately still depends on them in the end.The characters are marvelous. Vizzini and his outbursts of ""Inconceivable!!"", kind-hearted Fezzik with his rhyming, and Inigo Montoya, with his graciousness, honor, and drive for revenge. Carey Elwes' Wesley is a great balance of clever humor and chivalry, and Robin Wright's Buttercup is a smart, strong fairytale princess. All the performances are note-perfect.And the script is brilliant (as well it should be, with Goldman adapting his own novel). The dialogue sparkles, with enough memorable lines to fill a book. We get to love these characters, and care what happens to them (when Inigo finally gets the chance to avenge his father's death, it's surprisingly dramatic and emotional).The story in the film is simpler than that of the book. Among other things, the book goes WAY further into Vizzini's, Fezzik's, and Inigo's backstories, and it's absolutely a worthwhile read, but there was no way it could have all been translated to the screen. As I say, it's an unusually good adaptation.I enjoyed it even more than I did on its original release. That's an easy definition of ""classic"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Robin Wright, Kelly Capwell, Princess Buttercup... who needs grandpa?","This is gonna be a long story. It is not meant as a serious review. So skip it if you are in a bad mood.***DORKY TALE ALERT***Back in 1986, armed with my Philips VCR, I stumbled across the TV show SANTA BARBARA while monitoring for music videos and glam/fashion inserts. It had this pretty girl in it, who looked like a teen model, I eventually learned she was in a minor yet regular part (Jade Perkins), but as soap operas with their slow, daily unwinding story arcs go, there was also this other wonderfully beautiful very very cool chick playing the part of Kelly Capwell. I watched regularly, for those two. The other girl gradually disappeared, but Kelly became {like wow, man!}...When I learned about THE PRINCESS BRIDE, I of course pursued it. It wasn't drive-in theater material (I live in a small town, no cinema) but I got it at a video-rent store, VHS, the good old days with the weak systems. My friend was about to copy* it for me. Now, this happened decades ago, and I cannot quite remember how it came to pass that I sneaked a peek, but to cut a long story short, I learned that it was kind of a Peter Falk show, was really miffed about the old man taking up such valuable time in the movie, what a waste of tape, hell, can't I do something about it? I then got the idea to record only an edited version, eliminating Peter Falk. I had several beauty competitions on tape, and was always exasperated by the ubiquitous 'vultures' taking up screen time, lounge lizard singers strutting their stuff, coming out of the woodwork, hogging the spotlight... So I was used to editing out glut. But I had my doubts about how my edit of THE PRINCESS BRIDE would appear. My objective was to do it in such a way that it wouldn't look silly, it still had to make sense.Dear people, to this day I remember that I was quite satisfied with my effort. I had thought it would look like a mess, but it ran fairly smoothly, as far as I can remember.Years later, watching on DVD, I was kinda skeptical about me ever having done that. I don't know what I would have said about my effort today. Back then I thought my version was better.But I maintain that Peter Falk was nothing more than excess baggage. A sweet charm? No, wholly unnecessary, the whole fairy-tale from GrandPa to the kid, holding back the story, give me extra footage of Princess Buttercup!Despite my view of THE PRINCESS BRIDE as weighed down by a dorky addition, it was still one of my early DVD purchases when I started collecting, not only was it considered a classic by the mail order company, it is a charming movie with a cute fairy-tale romance and a darling heroine. It's Robin Wright's best movie. (Forget about THE PLAYBOYS, that one's a bummer!) She should have been a major star!*yeah, yeah, copyright violator. Back in those days, years before DVD, that was the only way to hang on to a movie.

The screenplay was refreshingly witty, particularly the banter and line execution from the characters. The perfect scene to describe this is when swordsman Inigo waits for Westley to rest before duelling. Sharp, concise and punchy. Plus, many many many memorable lines. Two that spring to mind are ""inconceivable"" and ""the cliffs of insanity"" which were both delivered by Wallace Shawn. Acting all round was good in the whole, stand outs were Cary Elwes and Mandy Pantinkin. Robin Wright held her own as well in which was one of her earliest roles. The romance between Elwes and Wright was all too brief, I would've like some more development between the two. The first and third acts were extremely well paced and memorable, the second dipped dramatically to a point where I've forgotten what happened. A shame really. The use of props enhanced the authenticity of the world that the film is set in, so I admired that. Overall, The Princess Bride was immensely enjoyable with a light whimsical nature that can entertain pretty much everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Grand Fantasy Film,"The Princess Bride is a grand movie. A sick boy (played by Fred Savage is told a story by his grandfather (played by Peter Falk) about a farmboy named Wesley (played by. Cary Elwes), who became a pirate after his ship is attacked, as he goes on a quest to reunite with his childhood love, Princess Buttercup (played by Robin Wright).This is one of the greatest films of the 1980's. The story is a great fantasy tale told by a grandfather, and has some memorable characters, like Inigo Montoya (played by Mandy Patrikin) and Fezzik (played by professional wrestling legend Andre The Giant).

I dare you to not like this movie,"The real question we must ask ourselves here is, what rock have you been hiding under that you still haven't seen this movie? I don't think there is a more played rainy-day recess video at elementary schools nationwide. And that is really a commentary on how wonderful the movie is, because it is accessible to children and adults alike.Do yourself a favor and actually LISTEN to all of the dialogue.

Traditional Cinema at its Best,"This is about as close to a perfect traditional Hollywood movie as has been made post 1960 or so. It's pure escapist entertainment, and as such, it succeeds as well as any movie possibly could.It is by turns funny, exciting, uplifting, sentimental, and endlessly entertaining. The hero is dashing and (mostly) pure. The heroine is pretty and chaste. The companions are, in every situation, unfailingly true to themselves. The villains are threatening enough to provide dramatic tension, but sufficiently comic that they're never too scary for kids.Speaking of kids - this is a great movie for them. It has all the elements of a great story, but it never gets too scary, violent or otherwise unwholesome. It extolls true love throughout but there's not a hint of sex beyond the ""perfect kiss"" at the end. But it's entertaining and well made enough that adults will find plenty to love.One aspect of this movie that might fly under the radar is the fantastic score by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits fame. Knopfler's film soundtracks are terrific and nearly as good as his albums.Anyway, to paraphrase David Letterman: If you haven't seen this movie, there's something WRONG with you.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fine,"I think it's a bit overrated. I've heard a lot of praise for this movie, how outstanding it is, almost ahead of its time, and perhaps it would have been better, if I did not hear any of that.It's not a bad movie, that's for sure, the story as a whole is good, even though most pieces, if looked at alone, would end up being quite silly. On the other hand that ""silliness"" plays into the ""fairy tale""-like vibe of the movie. I certainly appreciated care to some minor details and certain ""practical"" things, that I do miss in most of modern movies.But is it a movie of a lifetime? No. Maybe it looked much better at the time of release, maybe it was more ""contextual"" then, but right now - not really. I also think that it's quite underdeveloped in terms of its characters, but possibly because of time constraints. While watching I was reminded of ""The 10th Kingdom"", which was a definite ""fairy tale"" and it was amazing, but it was shot much later (2000), and it was a TV series, so it's obviously not a fair comparison.""The Princess Bride"" felt was fine for 1 evening for me, but it did not find a place in my heart. Perhaps, if I saw it as a kid, things would have been different.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Utterly woeful.,"I last saw The Princess Bride around 20+ years ago. I can't recall what I thought of it then but I have always been aware that it has a great following. Having just re-watched it I am utterly dismayed that a film this poorly written, so poorly acted and with such a jarring almost absurdly bad musical score has such devotion. I can only guess that it's nostalgia that's clouding the minds of its fans. It's not even remotely funny and this coming from the guy that gave us This Is Spinal Tap? The sets look worse than the cheapest TV shows. It even makes reference to Australia being full if convicts yet has a Medieval period setting, hundreds of years before Autralia's convict influx. Did nobody vet the script? Where's the alleged humour? Please give me a funny line that I may have missed. This is woefully amateurish stuff.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Maybe I am just too old and cynical for it,"Or maybe I had too high expectations, maybe I have no taste, but The Princess Bride is the worst piece of garbage I've seen in months, if not years.Yesterday, after listening for years on end what a great movie it is, I went, got the DVD and popped it in my computer, curious what all the fuss was all about. I wish I didn't. I managed to put up with it for a little over an hour, and now I want that hour of my life that I wasted on it BACK! Even if one is willing to excuse the awful, cheap props, costumes and special effects due to the movie being shot in the 80s and on a small budget, nothing, absolutely NOTHING excuses to awful writing and even worse delivery. It's been toted to me as some paragon of witty, hilarious dialogue, but frankly, with one single exception (the ""In which cup is the poison"" scene) the rest was just painful to sit through. I saw nothing particularly funny or witty about the dialogue, and even if there was some flash of brilliance here and there it was torn apart, set on fire and then stomped on by the wooden delivery of the actors. I have never seen people who lack comic timing so badly. They sounded like they were reading a phonebook, rather than delivering funny dialogue.Though it's obvious from the rest of the review, I am severely disappointed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
good movie,"I thought this movie would be bad but it turned out to be really good and the movies about a boy who is sick and his grandfather comes over and reads him a book about a man and woman in love and then he disappears for 5 years and she is going to marry a prince but he comes back and thats when the fun begins.The film has an all star cast with actors and actress like Cary Elwes,Mandy Patinkin,Chris Sarandon,Christopher Guest (I),Ardre The Giant,Robin Wright Penn and Billy Crystal.Cary Elwes from the good film saw does a great job at acting in this movie and the huge 7 foot tall Ardre The Giant is not a very good actor but he does a good job.Over all this film was good with some flaws and my rating is 6 and a half out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A parody that's also a loving celebration of fairy tales,"Another quarantine film appreciation class with my kids was a hit (""Labyrinth"" also got a thumbs-up. ""E.T."" got a Meh). From writer William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" ""All the Presidents Men"" ""Misery"") and director Rob Reiner (""This is Spinal Tap"" ""Stand by Me"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and also ""Misery"") comes a very subversive fairy tale send-up. It's charming and wimiscal enough that the kids will love it and it's witty and subversive that adults will love it even more so. What makes this parody film unique is that while Goldman and Reiner are certainly poking fun at fairy tale tropes, they also tell a fairy tale with genuine charm and sweetness. Compared to other parody films like ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Airplane"" which are entirely mocking and ridicule, ""The Princess Bride"" is at its heart is still a fairy tale love story. I won't bother summarizing the story, since I'm assuming everyone has already watched this film, but ""The Princess Bride"" boasts a stellar cast, led by then unknown Cary Elwes (""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" ""Glory"" ""Days of Thunder"" ""Stranger Things"") and Robin Wright (""Forrest Gump"" ""Moneyball"" ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" ""House of Cards""). The scene stealing supporting cast has SO many iconic moments! Wallace Shawn shouting ""Inconceivable!"" and the battle of wits face-off. Peter Cook's speech impaired clergyman. Mel Smith's throat clogged Albino. Carol Kane and Billy Crystal as the bickering Valerie and Miracle Max. Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya is the main standout in the cast, who's performance still gave me chills when he has his final confrontation with Christopher Guest's six-fingered Count Rugen. Patinkin brings a level of emotion to the film that brings unexpected depth and heart. Then there's the enormous André the Giant, who pretty much steals every scene he's in. I also usually dislike wraparound or story bookends, but Fred Savage and Peter Falk are wonderful as a grandfather and grandson reading the story together, which affords lots of opportunities for commentary on the story and to even skip over the boring parts. The film's Once-Upon-A-Time feel is greatly aided is a lush score by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and beautiful photography by Adrian Biddle (""Aliens"" ""Thelma & Louise"" ""V for Vendetta"") that gives the film a timeless feel. On the downside, the film's villains seem underdeveloped and not all that interesting. Also, the film does have some pacing issues where the story drags a bit at times. Still, those are minor quibbles for a film that really does deserve its status as a classic film that both kids and adults (for different reasons) will enjoy. FUN FACT: André the Giant called almost everybody on set (be they director, producers, co-stars or crew) ""boss"", a technique he employed to defer to people he liked and go some way towards counteracting the way he would tower over them.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

the kind of movie you can watch a hundred times,"This movie has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I have seen it countless times, with my family, with friends, or by myself when I've needed something funny and comforting. It is the princess story that all kids love, but without the corny and dumb aspects that usually keep princess stories from appealing to humans over the age of 10. The Fred Savage character is a clever way to make fun of the genre while still indulging in it. The whole fantasy world that serves as the backdrop is beautifully done, certainly much more basic than today's movies (Lord of the Rings, for example), but it is no less magical, and I don't think kids today would have any trouble getting pulled into the world of rodents of unusual size, fire pits, and albinos.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A flawed, but timeless classic for the whole family.","The Princess Bride is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary this year and is still considered a timeless classic. Its mix of fairy tale adventure and comedy makes it a perfect film that both kids and adults can enjoy. However, all that nostalgic glitter can't hide a mix of subpar acting, characters, and directing choices.The characters of The Princess Bride are the usual fairy tale characters you grew up on as a kid. There's the swashbuckling hero Westley and his damsel in distress Buttercup (still one of the worst character names in film), a gallery of rogues, and the dastardly king. We are immediately attached to these characters because of their specific traits that help them stand out. However, each character only has one trait that they exhibit, making them very one dimensional and predictable.The plot of the film is just as familiar as the characters. It's predictable, which isn't a bad thing here since we're all accustomed to classic fairy tales about true love. Buttercup and Westley fall in love, but Westley must go away to work. He is soon presumed dead and Buttercup goes into a deep depression. The king takes an interest in her and makes her his queen even though there is no love between them. Soon she is kidnapped by rogues in a plot to plunge two rival kingdoms into war.The one thing that stands out in this film from others is that it takes place entirely inside of the book The Princess Bride (the same one the film is based on). In the real world, a young boy is sick in bed and his grandfather comes over to read him the story. He immediately exclaims his dislike of fairy tales, but his attitude slowly changes as the story continues. We as the audience are like the kid, immediately pessimistic about another fairytale movie, but then come around to appreciate the film for its charm and wit.It's not hard to tell that the theme of here is that true love will conquer all. It's heavily present and is the only thing that keeps the story going, but what else do you expect from a fantasy film with an evil king who has taken someone's love hostage.I feel that both parents and kids can enjoy this film, especially parents today that grew up watching it as a child. There are a few jokes that are purely aimed at adults that will go over kids heads, but most are family friendly and offer some genuine laughs.Director Rob Reiner makes a fantasy film that ages well compared to other films in the same genre and timeframe. The jokes are still pretty fresh thirty years later and the practical effects aren't embarrassing. While Reiner perfected the preservation of this film, he did not effectively create a story free of plot holes. Some events in the film happen with little to no explanation and some details are glossed over for the sake of keeping the plot going. I'm starting to think I am nitpicking since this is lighthearted family movie, but it's hard to not pay attention to such prominent issues.The acting throughout the film is either hit or miss. Cary Elwes as Westley is a highlight as he uses his natural charisma and good looks to create a dashing hero for the audience to root for. Robin Wright as Buttercup is the exact opposite of Elwes. She doesn't make a very good character and becomes a burden to watch. While Westley is the main character, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya is the clear fan favorite as he strives to get revenge on the man who killed his father. His famous line ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" is said close to ten times, but gets better each time he gets closer to completing his mission. André the Giant shines as the gentle giant (practically portraying himself in real life). Wallace Shawn is also good as the annoying ""Inconceivable!"" guy but can be over the top and too annoying by the end of his screen time.The Princess Bride is a family film that will live on for generations as parents pass it down to their kids. Even though flaws are present, not many films have this great a legacy and can deliver on the overplayed fairytale genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WARNING: You may choke on the sappy-ness.,"The Princess Bride is widely regarded as a classic fantasy-romance semi-spoof movie for children of all ages. I started off with that description because I supposedly saw this movie. But it's very strange: the movie I saw was a crappy, predictable, sappy princess movie without a single subversive element to it, held together one or two fun characters and quotable lines.I'll get right to it: this is really just every crappy 80s fantasy movie, full of hammy acting and dialogue, that everyone treats like a classic. It's Space Jam for children of the late 70s/early 80s. It doesn't have the imagination or production value of something like Labyrinth or The Neverending Story. And good god...have I mentioned how goddamn sappy this film is?It's doesn't even work on the level of being a ""spoof"". It's a semi-spoof, i.e. the exact same as the material it's spoofing, except with more laughing involved. It doesn't try to piss-take or subvert your expectations.There are one or two characters and lines that you'll remember, but on the whole this movie is one of those films that deserves to be forgotten. A comfort film for those of a certain vintage, completely value-less to those younger than it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Inconceivable!,"The Princess Bride has long been seen as a cinema classic and it has often been voted as one of the top films of the 80's, a sentiment that I would have a hard time disagreeing with. As a fan of the fantasy genre, this film falls in my wheelhouse. Despite me probably liking this film no matter what, there is no denying the talent behind the film. The story is simple, but sweet and written very well. The film is expertly directed and well-acted. The visuals even do a good job standing the test of time. In all, this was a very entertaining fantasy romp about the quest for true love.Rob Reiner's film is about a poor farm girl named Buttercup who is forced to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck, but her childhood love named Westley comes back as the Dreaded Pirate Roberts to rescue her from the clutches of the prince.The film may not have the most exotic cast in the world, but there is no denying how good they were and how much fun they seemed to have. I liked Cary Elwes as Westley as well as Robin Wright as Buttercup. Andre the Giant was actually very good as Fezzik, and likewise Christopher Guest as Count Rugen and Chris Sarandon as the Prince.Overall, The Princess Bride is the film for all ages. It is the kind of film that shall be passed down from generation to generation. As a fantasy lover, it has all the elements you can ask for as you expect from such a film. I loved the theme about true love as it's a theme that will always be relevant. It's such a gorgeous film and one that is also funny.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Knowing modern fairy tale that sits between affectionate spoof and poor B-movie,"When a man visits his sick Grandson, he keeps him amused with a fairy tale. We find that the beautiful Buttercup has lost her true love and years later has agreed to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck.  She is kidnapped by three mercenaries but is later rescued by a mysterious masked man.  When she discovers the identity of the man she faces a dilemma between returning to her intended or staying with true love.  When the decision is made for her Wesley must fight (with a little help) to win her back.There is something about this film that requires you to be in the right mood to watch it.  The story is pitched as a standard fairy tale and it feels like a B-movie, if it was played straight.  Happily Reiner adds spoof and comedy to the mix that allows the fairy tale to follow the traditional routes while poking fun at itself.  The story is still nice, but really it's the knowing comedy that makes it.The comedy is generally consistent  gentle rather than cruel.  The film uses unlikely fairy tale mechanisms (like having the ideal thing to hand when needed or the idea of honour etc) with a knowing wink to the audience to let us know it's not serious.  It also uses comedy cameos by the bucket  some work well (Billy Crystal, Wallace Shaw) and some work less well (Peter Jones and Mel Smith are unused).  And the rest of it is full of absurd humour.  Most of it hits the mark  but if you're not in the mood of this type of silly affectionate humour then you'll probably dislike it.Elwes is good  he looks like a handsome B-movie actor and plays it like such, while also spoofing himself.  That's why he was so good in Hot Shots too.  A young Robin Wright does the wide-eyed damsel in distress so-so, but she doesn't get the same comedy as the others and feels a little dull. Mandy Patinkin is really good in a hammy role and has a good character. Shaw is hilarious in a small role and even Andre the Giant is good  if a little hard to understand at times.  The villains are well played by Guest and Sarandon  indeed they have the best characters as they don't play it for laughs as much as the others.Overall this is an enjoyable little film from Reiner  it doesn't have the development or the sharpness of much of his other, funnier work but as a gently affectionate spoof it works just fine if you're in the mood).",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I used to absolutely love this movie,"The Princess Bride is a whimsical mix of fantasy, romance, and comedy that has earned a cult following over the years. While it's easy to see why the film has such enduring appeal, it didn't quite hit the mark for me in the same way it has for many others.The story, framed as a fairy tale read by a grandfather to his grandson, is filled with memorable characters and quotable lines. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright give charming performances as the leads, and supporting characters like Inigo Montoya and Vizzini add a lot of personality to the film. However, the humor, while clever at times, didn't always land for me, and the pacing felt uneven in spots.The mix of genres is unique, and the film certainly doesn't take itself too seriously, which is part of its charm. But the lighthearted tone sometimes undermines the emotional stakes, making it hard to fully invest in the characters or their journey.That said, The Princess Bride does have undeniable charm, and I can appreciate its wit and creativity. It's a fun, family-friendly movie, but it didn't leave a lasting impression on me the way it seems to for so many others. Fans of quirky, nostalgic storytelling will likely enjoy it more than I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Storybook Chick Flick for Everyone,"In the mid to late 80s, screenwriter and author William Goldman managed to get a book of his published called The Princess Bride, with Rob Reiner on board as director. Alongside obtaining critical acclaim and becoming a cult classic, it introduced the likes of Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Andre the Giant and more into the mainstream crowd. In addition, it is one of the few chick flicks that is not only beloved by guys, but pretty much everyone as it has enough romance, action, adventure, and witty banter to keep all invested. No wonder this became one of the most quotable movies of all time.The film is essentially a story within a story, as a sick boy is being told the story in book form by his grandfather. The actual story itself centers around a farmhand named Westley, who along with several befriended companions as the story progresses, must rescue his true love Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck after being lost for five years. While the story itself is simple in concept, the execution is what makes the movie stand out. There is more emphasis on dialogue than action, but the banter and conversations with the characters are not only humorous, but make them all delightful and memorable in their own right. There's a reason many of the movie's lines are still quoted to this day, not only because they're well delivered, but also because of the multitude of lovable personalities and character arches.In terms of the individuals, Westley is the courageous and charismatic poor farm boy turned pirate who shows more amounts of stealth than one might assume, Inigo Montoya is as sympathetic as his backstory which drove him to vengeance despite caring immensely for those around him, and Fezzik the giant is the oafish albeit kind spirited brute with a heart of gold. Each character has their moment to shine and their interactions with pretty much everyone make them a riot to watch, so it's pretty easy to get caught up in their arches. Even though Buttercup doesn't have much personality herself, the torment she goes through between Westley and the repugnant albeit cowardly Humperdinck does make one passionate feel for her and to see her obtain true love once again. The rest are either antagonistic albeit cynically amusing such as Count Rugen and Vizzini, or just straight up hysterical like Miracle Max and the grandfather.Needless to say, I still think The Princess Bride stands as one of the most delightfully amusing and enchanting rom com fantasies ever created with enough tongue-in-cheek humor, lovable characters and sweet passion to draw anybody in. Similar to the boy whom the grandfather tells the story to, it may seem cheesy and schmaltzy at first, but sticking with it long enough will make you forget you're even listening to a story, it's just that entertaining. So, if you're still yet to see this flick, either read the book or pick a dvd/bluray copy up at your local store or website and give it a watch. There may be a chance that you'll reconsider calling fantasy books simply ""childish"".",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The opening and the main soundtrack - brilliant!,"How this made it to the top 250 I do not know. If the movie was made in the 70s I would consider giving it a better rating. Im well aware that the main-focus of the movie is the story-telling and therefore it's made a bit sloppy on purpose - I hope. The movie could've been done a lot better and still maintain the good storytelling. I also think that the director could've done a better job in making the viewer feel more with the characters - make the passion more passionate, the hate and lust for revenge more hateful and lusting.The only things convincing in the movie were: The main soundtrack, a sound that gave me buttterflies during the first commence of the two main characters, and thrills in the end. Truly deserving of the Oscar that year.The character of Miracle-MAX - hilarious, his sarcasm is a warm welcome.""...and while you're at it why don't you go ahead and give a nice papercut and pour some lemonjuice on it"" - best quote of the movie and made me laugh out loudAnd the first 6-7 minutes of the movie - brilliant!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Its tone isn't as solid as you'd expect, but its better moments can still be enjoyed without much hesitation.","'The Princess Bride (1987)' revolves around a bizarre framing device that does little other than lessen the impact of the main narrative's events, since it is clear they are only part of a story and 'never really happened' even within the wider fictional product. The movie's overall tone isn't as solid as you might expect, either, bouncing from slightly satirical to straight-up silly quite clumsily and often to distracting effect. Still, there's some fun to be had and the breezy pace pushes past some of the more contrived aspects, which are also covered by the picture's knowingly tongue-in-cheek outlook, so that the most entertaining of scenes, including a pretty fantastic - if slightly 'dinner-show' - swashbuckling sword fight, and chuckle-worthy of moments can be enjoyed without too much hesitation. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Delightful classic,"A fun movie for the whole family that's wholesome and doesn't take itself to seriously. Unlike some of the critics on here....

DISAPPOINTED,"Finally got around to watching this. Expected great things based on its cult status. Avoided many times just because I dislike Patinkin. Still dislike, unfortunately. It became available for free, so finally decided to try it. I probably would have liked it more when it came out. It seems a too familiar type now, a bit stale because it's now been redone and better. Just not my cup of tea, I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Strange film.,"A Strange film, it's a kind of medieval fantasy but not remotely realistic or believable nor trying to be. It's American and strangely modern. Some of the comedic performances are quite good and like we've seen some of the films that have come out in the past are ripe for satire. The film is shot quite naturally with clear bold colours and the outdoor scenes look good, I don't know where it was shot but I do gather that a lot of it was filmed in England. The film might annoy some people but I think it was quite good, especially as a kids movie, but nothing more really. In some ways the film anticipates Sherk which came a bit later on.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hated it.,"I really did not see the appeal in this film - maybe it's because I first watched at the age of 19 rather than a lot younger. I didn't think there was much of a plot, and there seemed to be no relationship ever forming between the two lovers. I literally could not believe I'd wasted an hour and a half watching this alongside two friends who had grown up with it and adored it. Honestly I think I would probably have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd seen it when younger and grown up with it. Seeing it as a young adult just made me hate the whole thing and want to criticise every aspect of the film. I don't plan on ever watching it again and if you are also a first-time watcher at a later age I can't imagine you'd see what the hype about it is either.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Partly nostalgia perhaps...,"I read the book (*abridged) sooo many times. Ppl tend to either love or hate this movie. They will complain that Buttercup is useless/boring/mean, or that it's cheesy. Yes, Buttercup is useless, and yeah, it's super cheesy. That's not the point. The point is that Wesley, Inigo, Fezzik, and even Viccini are hilarious and awesome. Who can say that they didn't tear up a bit when they heard ""I want my father back, you SOB?"" It's a silly romp, one with tons of quotable lines and lovable characters (or hate-able characters lol). That's the point of the movie; Buttercup is just a very pretty girl of very average intelligence (which the book labors to point out, if I remember rightly :D). Watch it to have fun, not to criticize it like its high art. It was never meant to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It makes you feel good from head to toe once viewed.The casting and acting is spot on.  Nobody was ever going to win an oscar, but the acting is camp enough with out going to far.  The humour runs all the way through the film to make this a real belter of a film.We can even forgive the director for book-ending the film with Peter Falk reading the story of the ""Princess Bride"" to his sick Grandson.If you are looking for a film for the kids, forget Toy Story or Pokemon the movie.

I think it's supposed to be funny,There's a couple of amusing one liners. I drifted between being interested and bored while watching this. The story isn't bad but not great. It's a fairly simple story and the film only goes for 1.5 hours so not too long to really lose interest. If it was any longer I might have turned it off. This films feels like a Mel Brooks film such as Spaceballs. It's kind of a spoof fantasy film. It would have been better with some better music and if it was a bit more realistic. The fights were a bit boring and not very dramatic. The female lead was pretty one dimensional. Andre the giant is very hard to understand and I had to turn on subtitles. Billy crystal was a nice surprise.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A True Whimsical Fantasy Classic,"Charming, witty and beautiful, a short saga which wears its fairy tale inspirations on one sleeve and fantasy inspirations on the other. And, if there were a third sleeve, there we'd see the trace of a swashbuckling influence, too. This one hits all the right notes, from the gently-plucked musical score (provided by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits) to the familiar-yet-surprising twists and turns of the plot to the positively irreplaceable casting decisions.That last one really stuck with me on this viewing, the realization that every last role was occupied by the perfect actor. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright as the smitten, star-crossed lovers; Mandy Patinkin in a vigorously youthful revenge role, complete with a spectacularly great catchphrase; Andre the Giant as the good natured, softly-spoken mountain of a man; Wallace Shawn as a smooth-talking Sicilian who might be too smart for his own good; Billy Crystal and Carol Kane effortlessly lightening the mood; Christopher Guest as a cowardly enforcer; Peter Falk and Fred Savage as the story's connection to the modern world. Take away any one of those players and the film suffers.Rob Reiner, working from novelist William Goldman's screenplay, brings an inherently literary tale to life in ways that must have seemed impossible at the onset. Together, they deliver just the right mix of levity and romance, dramatic tension and comic timing. A few seams show here and there, particularly when scenes aren't shot on-location or monsters threaten the key players, but somehow that just adds to the bemusing magic of it all. Tough to think of a better love letter to the not-so-innocent myths of old, or a more timeless rendition of their common themes.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Really fun script and characters, not the best filmmaking. Love this movie anyway!","I feel like with a lot of these movies from the '80s that are insanely popular and nostalgic, I feel like I completely missed the boat and don't find much of anything to enjoy about it (lookin' at you, Labyrinth).I'm happy to say Princess Bride is not one of those movies! I actually really enjoyed seeing this for the first time in college seven-ish years ago and rewatching it tonight for this review. On a film-as-a-work-of-art level, this movie really suffers. The production design is pretty cheap, the cinematography is fine at best and pretty uninspired at worst, and the score is pretty cheesy all the way around. That being said, though, the tone is what makes Princess Bride works-at no point does this movie want you to take it seriously and that's why it has endured so well.The screenplay and comedic performances are where Princess Bride really shines. There are so many iconic lines and bits in the film, it would be futile to try to compile the list here of times I smiled or laughed. The ensemble cast was full of lovable characters spouting iconic lines of dialogue, definitely worth revisiting again and again. I have to point out the child acting performance of the boy who played the boy being read the story. His line delivery was pitch-perfect, and I laughed out loud more than a few times at his running commentary on the story.This movie is so fun and I adore it, but as a finished product of cinema, I've definitely seen better. But that definitely doesn't mean I don't love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just got back from watching The Princess Bride at the Arclight where Cary Elwes did a question and answering segment after the film. He was so nice. He stayed until everyone that wanted a pix took one with him, and he would ask your name and shake your hand too. What a class act. And the best Westley that could've ever been cast. Swoon... ;) The princess Bride was always my favorite movie as a kid. I love everything about it. The wit, the physical comedy, the love story, the action, And all of the cast is perfection.

"""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.""","This film must be one of the highest-rated films of all time. At least in the top twenties or thirties, maybe a little further than that; absolute praise and love towards it everywhere. It certainly has to be one of the most beloved. Yes, you've likely guessed where I'm heading with this. I didn't love it as much as pretty much everyone did/has.Now, a big part to play was, without a doubt, the fact that I wasn't 100% paying attention to it because as I was watching it, stuff was happening in the room I was in, and my laptop sucks, so I didn't want to pause it, as it would've taken minutes to start playing again; I know, I need a new laptop. I've been using it for close to a decade, I think. And I don't use headphones/earbuds/AirPods, so I had to lower the volume to where I couldn't hear what was said.However, I watch every film three times, so not following along fully and not getting some of the humor won't be an issue with the next and final viewing. But more importantly, I know I didn't love this film as much as most people do. I know that sounds premature, as I missed some things on my first viewing, but I'm pretty sure I'll still ""feel"" the same toward it with my subsequent viewings.(This is subsequent-viewings-me chiming in: I was correct.)The primary impression I'm getting out of this film is that, somehow, it's like it has a consciousness, in a sense, although that might not be the correct word. I don't know what I just said. It seems to me that this film will be better and better with each viewing, something to always come back to (but I suppose that's more to do with the individual watching it, not the film itself), and as a bonus, it'll never get old, unlike Monty Python and the Holy Grail. My God, that film wasn't that good. And Hot Fuzz? Ugh. I'm about to throw up. British comedy, hit-or-miss, more misses instead of hits; you love to see it.On a broader scale, as this film marinates in a person's consciousness with time continuously passing, I think one's feelings and outlook toward it will improve and evolve. I can't explain it or why that came to mind. I feel that, regardless of initial feelings from first viewing it, this film will continue increasing in enjoyment. It's lighthearted and fun. It has enjoyable characters/performances, a bit of (well-choreographed) action, cheesy but witty dialogue tightly written, and comedy; it has something for everyone, all of which have a good balance and utilization.I know most of what I said may seem negative. But I was vibing quite well with the film. That is, until after the MOST iconic and best scene that has ever (been seen) scene-d, in cinema history, the fight sequence between Westley and Inigo Montoya: everything about it was peak-anything-you'll-ever-see (Can we get much higher? So high), the witty dialogue, both characters/performances, the choreography. I don't know which character the majority like more. While I like Cary Elwes and the deadpan line delivery, including the emotionless/blank or smug facial expressions that he does so well, Inigo's my man. My King.After that, I felt like the film declined a bit, although the end catches you by surprise with the feels, making it seem like, maybe, everything after that fight sequence didn't dip or as much as you thought or that the fight sequence was so good that everything else paled in comparison. And that end-credits song? Man, that was the final nail in the coffin. It had a similar effect as the end-credits song in Robin Hood: Men in Tights.All-in-all, plenty of goofiness and silliness is present in this film, which adds to a particular not-quite-explainable charm; that much is undeniable. It has ""everything"" and more. This film is undoubtedly a classic, especially regarding every component. I doubt there are many films (or TV shows) like that. I think once it's in your consciousness, it's likely to improve in your eyes whenever you inevitably view it again and again and again. That's to say: it's, more or less, a ""perfect"" film.Even if you didn't like it as much as most people did on your first viewing, or if you may have disliked it, you signed yourself up for a continuously evolving experience by entering this film into your consciousness. As a result, your negative feelings may eventually become the opposite, or your already positive feelings will exponentially become more positive.Additional thoughts: Robin Wright was hot as hell in this film, but dare I say, she's even hotter now, like Antiope in the Wonder Woman films, which is astronomically hot; you love to see it. And Peter Cook, as the Impressive Clergyman, looked alarmingly like Sun Wukong.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The plot is interesting enough, and some of the scenes (such as the sword fight between Inigo Montoya and the Man In Black, or the torture scene with the machine) are particularly amusing, but I still don't think they are enough to make this film such a huge classic.This film reminds me a great deal of Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"".

"Warm, sweet and fuzzy","""The Princess Bride"" (1987) is a romantic comedy that has achieved cult status over the years. Directed by Rob Reiner and based on William Goldman's novel, the film is a delightful blend of fairy tale fantasy, romance, and witty humor.The story is framed as a bedtime tale read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). The tale centers on the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love, Westley (Cary Elwes), who must rescue her from an evil prince (Chris Sarandon). Along the way, they encounter a memorable cast of characters, including a skilled swordsman (Mandy Patinkin) and a comical giant (Andre the Giant).The charm of ""The Princess Bride"" lies in its clever script, filled with memorable lines and playful banter. The film's dialogue is both funny and endearing, with lines like ""As you wish"" becoming iconic. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright deliver performances that are both charming and heartfelt, capturing the essence of their fairy tale romance with a perfect blend of sincerity and humor.The film's supporting cast also shines, particularly Mandy Patinkin as the vengeful Inigo Montoya and Wallace Shawn as the scheming Vizzini. Their performances add depth and color to the story, creating a film that is as entertaining as it is whimsical.Rob Reiner's direction balances fantasy with humor, creating a story that appeals to both children and adults. The film's fairy tale elements are handled with a light touch, allowing for both magical moments and laugh-out-loud scenes.While ""The Princess Bride"" may not have been a major box office hit upon its release, it has since garnered a devoted following and remains a beloved classic. Its unique mix of romance, adventure, and comedy ensures its place as a timeless and charming film that continues to delight audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic comedy that wallows in its silliness,"This film reminds me of the improvised stories and games that we used to play out during school drama class. It's silly, we knew it, and we just rolled with it. The fantasy/fairytale setting is a malleable backdrop used for playful pastiche rather than any kind of satirical critique. The characters all have very distinct personalities and motivations, bolstered by repetitive jokes and catchphrases. The plot (if you can call it that) is full of memorable and witty moments fuelled by rather exaggerated character emotions. My main gripe is the modern framing story which serves only as a distraction and an excuse to skip over parts of the plot without using traditional transitions.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is not one of those family movies that are only cool for the children but instead this movie has several layers of complexity and is directed by a rather talented director who also directed Stand By Me, another excellent film.This is one of the must see for film buffs.

Found it to be overly cheesy and I guess it just tries to hard. After the class was over with, I put the movie in the back of my mind as one to never watch again. That was 1997.So I hadn't watched it until a few days ago when my roommate took it out of the DVD selection as something to watch. So I watched it again, well, some of it. At one point I got up and went to my room. I have better things to do with my time. It's attempt to be witty and fun just came off as horribly staged to me.

"Good, but not Great","""The Princess Bride"" is a well-written and acted genre picture. Unfortunately, it's hampered by some significant production problems that keep it from becoming a truly great movie.  Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable flick, but I had some small problems that really could have been fixed.First off, the princess' name is Buttercup.  Who names their daughter Buttercup?  I kept thinking they were talking about a horse when they mention her name.  I suppose that if the other names were as bizarre it might have worked, but her love is named Wesley.  Wesley and Buttercup?  I don't think so.Second, the wonderful fight scene between Inigo and Wesley is done on a very cheap looking set, complete with fake boulders, gym mats and parallel bars. Almost every other scene is done outside in gorgeous fields, or in far more believable sets.  The most exciting scene in the film is on the ugliest set. Very distracting.Third, the music for this movie is absolutely dreadful.  Loud, obnoxious, full of fake synthesized instruments instead of the real thing, it sounds more fitting for a ""Naked Gun"" retread of the Princess Bride than the actual film itself.  A new score would help the film immensley.I know I sound negative, but this is really only disappointment speaking. The film is charming, filled with wonderful dialogue, delivered with flair by stars Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin.  I recommend it, but I can't help think this movie could have been perfect.

How to get tone right.,"A very fun revisitI 100% understand the love for this movie. It´s been a while since I could lean back and just watch a fun fantasy movie. I love when they come around again because it is a gerne that lends itself to whimsy and wonder as well as seriousness. The Princess Bride is delightful in it´s presentation and humour every step of the way, giving away to a fun experience. It feels short and too the point, but I would love to have just a few more minutes added to tie every plot thread and character together just that much stronger.After a commoner girl falls in love with a farmhand, he is killed off by a pirate and she is married to the king, unhappy. She is kidnapped by people wanting to start a war, but a mysterious stranger is pursuing them. All of this is a story, told to a sick kid.What really elevates this story is it´s incredible characters. Every single actor is memorable in their role and the tone really works here. It´s a children's story so instead of a lot of seriousness, the story is full of happiness, respect, and just nice people. Even people fighting to the death respects each other and complements each other during fights. But every actor needs a shoutout if they could. Cary Elwes as Westly is charming and fun, Mandy Patinkin a Inigo is incredible. Wallace Shawn as Vizzini is oh so funny and Andre Roussimoff is charming and wonderful. They all carry this movie with tiher charm, wits and incredibly memorable and quotable lines.The humour in this movie really lands with me. It´s so nice and charming and at the same time so deadpan and over the top. I genuinely laugh at this movie, it really understands it´s own humour to a T, making everything land that much more.I love the way this movie is told from a storybook perspective. It excuses a lot of things and makes everything feel so much more wonderful. The characters are cute because it can´t be too scary. The sets work because it´s a kid imagining the story. More movies should really use this tone more to be cuter with fantasy instead of brooding darkness all the time.This is a rather basic fantasy story though and it feels done with quickly. A bit too quickly for me but I think that´s a me thing. I love when a movie get´s to spread it´s leaves a bit more and start to really impact you, but this is a quickly done deal. Maybe we need more movies that doesn't need the long screentime, but I feel like this movie needed it. I loved the universe, characters and tiher motivations so much, I really feel like we needed more to elevate this to a perfect romantic, fantasy comedy.But I will watch this again and love what it´s doing great again. I don't think it will ever elevate itself to me, but it will forever be a good movie I can return to.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"cute, but...","OK, the movie is cute, with some clever lines, but, among the top 120 movies of all time? Please... you haven't seen enough movies!

Too much of anything is not very good. This is a good movie with which to pass a pleasant rainy afternoon or even to watch with a first date, but it only masquerades as a classic and only then with the teen (or thereabouts) set.

This time, I decided to try with the help of some die hard Princess Bride fans to point out the ""charm"" of the film.To make a long story short, I am truly disappointed that the American public believes this to be a good film.  That the masses are so drawn in to this pointless, under-acted, substandard, ferociously uninspired remake of a mediocre book is just more fuel for the fire against the ""ugly american."" Are we this stupid?  Is it this type of entertainment that explains why long lines of traffic form to watch the aftermath of accidents on the freeway?For those who are unfamiliar with this film, let me summarize: A masked Cary Elwes tries to save a Princess, Buttercup.  That's it.  The rest of the plot is unimportant.  Fred Savage, stretches his acting abilities by playing a cute kid, while Andre the Giant (arguably the best performance in this film) plays...well...a giant.

"Best senseless fun, sweet, enjoyable and should watch","Right from the beginning the movie is captive. The kid and his grandfather both are cute and the firm base of the story. Each and everything is non-sense but it is a children-story and hence it must be the way it is.Characters were good and enjoyable, love story was cute as we wish and set design was apt. The best point in the movie is that it doesn't work too much to make it look realistic and the usual-ness present in the princess bride made it appreciable. The movie is must watch for anyone who wants some entertainment. But among all, the best thing the director did is to take out appropriate acting out of the kid who is listening to the story.

Not only a fairy tail...,"""The Princess Bride"" is a family movie in which we watch a grandfather reading a story to his grandson. And we are transfered from the words of the grandfather inside the story and we watch a story which combines romance and love with fights and much of adventure.First of all I have to admit that I did not expect to like so much this movie. I liked this movie because it was a nice surprise for me and also because of the nice direction which made by Rob Reiner. The most important thing that I liked in this movie was the whole story which showed us that true love always finds the way to win and from whatever happen to it, it will always win. This movie also shows us what is the definition or even better the meaning of true love and what a man and a woman who are in love have to do in order to be together. I also believe that the interpretation of Cary Elwes who played as Westley has to be mentioned because it was really good and equally good was the interpretation of the beautiful Robin Wright who played as The Princess Bride.Lastly I have to say that ""The Princess Bride"" is not just a nice fairy tail as my title says but is something bigger and better. This movie shows us what difficulties has true love to surpass in order to win and finally to have a happy ending. One other thing that I really loved in this movie was the combination of some comedy moments with some romance moments. ""The Princess Bride"" is a family movie and I strongly recommend it because I am sure that if you watch it you will have a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Near Perfect Storytelling,"I saw first saw this film when my kids were little, and have watched it maybe a dozen times since. Never gets old.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
There are other stories (film) this can be compared to, but no one film matches its expanse, variety, tension, levity, and fun.The primary issue here is the quality of the storytelling, which is rare. Yes, the key facets below were equally important in
actually delivering the story par excellence, but the story itself is brilliantly woven.I would say that unless your heart is cold and you're immune to good story, then you'll love this film and its story.ACTING:
The cast ... wow ... so much to write, not enough time or space.1. Perfect casting. I've seen lots for bad, mediocre, and good casting. This. Individually and collectively. Was superb.2. Everyone stands out !!! Rarely can I say that about another film, from Wallace Shawn to Andre the Giant.One could argue that ""Lord of the Rings"" casting was also excellent, and I would agree ... but it wasn't exceptional, like this.It's the blending and rapport among the cast you can feel here. Note: Funny thing is Elwes (Westley) was flat in Mel Brooks'
""Robinhood - Men in Tights"" --- but it was the film that was actually the horror there. So Good actors in bad films still make for bad film.PS - It's bewildering to see Andre's hands cup fully grown adult heads. Truly, he was a modern giant.TEMPO:
The ebb and flow of this film runs largely without a hitch.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
Quite beautifulDIRECTING / WRITING:
From ""Meathead"" on the show ""All in the Family"" to directing this and ""When Harry met Sally"" ... Reiner demonstrated
unusual skill as actor, writer, and director. Most of his other films just never appealed to me, but this is one-of-a-kind.The writer (Goldman) has done other work I liked, e.g. ""All the Presidents Men,"" but like with Reiner, I didn't care for most.My guess is this was just serendipity, where together with Reiner they executed near perfect storytelling through film.Is it a very good film? Yes, absolutelyShould you watch this once? No. Watch it at least three (3) times during your lifetimeRating: 9+",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So I currently got COVID for th first time after avoiding it for the first time in 2.5 years so time for a rewatch.This movie has something for everyone and was done beautifully well especially considering it's 1987 release.

Similar to 'Spinal Tap'...really?,"This film is a wonderful piece of work by Reiner. His 'Spinal Tap' movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest rock movies ever, even though it is a spoof! In many ways, Reiner has pulled the same trick here. The middle eighties was a brave time to film a fairy story, and it would have been so easy to go for a slick, urbane allegorical story set in Manhattan or some such. Reiner goes the other way, and parodies the fairy tale genre, ramping it up and camping it up with ridiculous characters and settings. This gung-ho larger than life approach has given us a wonderful fantasy with heroes we love to love and villians we love to hate.And whoever penned the line ""...with eyes like the sea after a storm"" please make themselves known. Call me an old romantic, but I would lay down and die for any girl who said that about me :-)",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shortage of Perfect Movies,"DO NOT REMAKE THIS MOVIE!! When rumors of a remake began circulating, Cary Elwes astutely remarked, ""There's a shortage of perfect movies in this world.

The little banter between the grandfather and child gets old real quick, in my opinion, interrupting the illusion of the rescued princess tale.With a name like Buttercup, you better hope they play that song from There's Something About Mary! The story takes us on a windy road full of weird occurrences, like the moment a henchman stays back to fight a masked swordsman on their tail, conversing like workmates all the while!A very unconventional rescued princess love story but Andre the Giant always makes me smile!

Not a Monty Python but definitely entertaining,"It struck me as a combination of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and Rob Reiner's own 'This is Spinal Tap'. While it has moments of laugh-out-loud slapstick humor like the former, also tries to invest a story of its own no matter how clichéd the characters or storyline is (of course it was intentional) as the latter. The exchanges between the kid and his grandfather starts a little disconnected but develops wonderfully as the story moves on. But Cary Elwes was the weak point as he neither has the comic timing nor the persona to pull this off.The bride (Robin Wright) falls in love with her farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes). When Westley heads out to the world to make a living, the news of his death in the hands of a dreaded pirate devastates the bride. An egotistic and scheming Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) betroths her to hatch an evil plot. By staging an abduction and blaming the neighboring kingdom, he plans to woo his citizens to back his war. He uses the help of Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) the brains, Inigo Motoya (Mandy Patinkin) the steel and Fezzik (André the Giant) the muscle. When the dreaded pirate comes thwart his plan, it becomes personal.Rob Reiner knows how to make a slapstick. Just like 'This is Spinal Tap', he doesn't go all out nasty - but picks the essential clichés and use it to his advantage. But the movie is far from perfect due to relatively shortage of gags where it ebbs and tides between lull and hilarity. The thread between the grandfather and kid was so important for this movie to click as they interrupt the fairytale in the exact moments where it starts to become too much or too dull. The trio of the brains, steel and muscle were so perfect together and they produce some real entertainment. Cary Elwes was missing the quality that the rest of the cast had - natural comic timing and comes off as a weakling and makes it difficult to root for him.Not a Monty Python but definitely entertaining",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Timeless Adventure,"So, I really only watched this movie when I did to prepare for Once Upon a Deadpool, but I'm glad I finally came around to watching one of the classic fantasy-adventure films of the last century.

I don't think anyone can say the film isn't completely cheeseball at times with some of the dialogue and performances, but I'll take that sword fight between Westley and Inigo any day of the week.

You know it's a classic - but that doesn't mean it's perfect,"There's not much to say about ""The Princess Bride"" that hasn't already been said. It's one of the most beloved cult classics ever made for a reason. The characters are memorable, lines of dialogue stay with you, and it is even laugh-out-loud funny at times. The framing story of Colombo reading to Kevin Arnold makes the experience more than just a classic fairy tale, but a tribute to fairy tales and the imagination itself.It's not perfect, though. The ending is kind of disappointing, a bit anticlimactic, if you ask me, and the movie seems to run out of steam toward the end in general.

"A Must-See, Plain and Simple","Buttercup is madly in love with the farmboy Westley, but soon after her love blossoms he is captured and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Picked by the prince to be her bride, she is rescued from ruffians by the pirate who killed her love. Will true love prevail in this tale of romance, action, adventure and more? Like many films, ""The Princess Bride"" isn't one i really have to praise. If you don't already love it, you have a friend who will swear up and down that it's one of the most amazing films ever. So you don't need me to convince you. In fact, you've probably already seen it and I'm surprised if you haven't. (Although, the reason for this review is that I was able to recently show my girlfriend the film for the first time, so some of you may have missed out.) As my introduction says, this is a film of romance, action and adventure. I left out comedy. The film has a lot of great one-liners and quotable jokes you'll treasure for a lifetime. Author William Goldman is incredible -- read the novel and you'll see the humor jump off the page -- and the director, Rob Reiner, perfected it for the screen. Of course, if you've seen ""This is Spinal Tap"", you already knew how great Reiner was with comedy.Cary Elwes, one of my favorite actors, is great in the leading role (very similar to his role in ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights""). Robin Wright does an adequate job as Buttercup. And then the supporting cast is just some of the best in the business: Fred Savage, Peter Falk, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Wallace Shawn, Chris Sarandon (who came off as sort of a jerk in person, but is a solid actor). I could do without Billy Crystal, but someone probably appreciated him.Again, you've probably seen this or have someone you know pushing it. I, too, would push it. I don't know why you're reading reviews for this film. If you're looking for people's thoughts, I'm sure they're overwhelmingly positive. I won't deviate from those people.

A woman who thinks she's been married without having agreed to it by saying ""I do""? A hero who has to be dragged to climactic action because he's ""mostly dead""?

Wait, i don't mean to disclass it, what i meant was yes this film is a Joke which will make laugh. Are you up for some slapstick jokes which will certainly bring laughters. Are you ready to keep your brain and critic mind aside for 98 Minutes? If yes then welcome to the fantasy world of 'The Princess Bride'. It's a film about a farmboy-turned-pirate who encounters numerous obstacles, enemies and allies in his quest to be reunited with his true love who is gonna marry a prince. You know it's predictable and quite normal thing to see but guess what? The narrator himself says so. He says something which you already know is not gonna happen and which you already know is gonna happen. Call it predictable but this humour in narration is a different thing altogether. I have problem with some inconceivable errors in the writing and i am not gonna show any mercy for those faults in my final rating. I have expectations of high quality product when i am watching a film from the list of IMDb Top Rated 250 Films and then if such errors are gonna cross my way, i am not gonna spare the users. I mean this doesn't deserved to be here. Anyways, the writing sparkles despite dead conflicts and mostly because of satirical humour. Acting by Cary Elwes, Mandy Patikin was impressive whereas Robin Wright looked gorgeous. Supporting cast was okay. Rob Reiner is a good director, I recently watched 'Stand By Me' which was a dignified Classic therefore it took me a few moments to believe that he has made this childish film.

"The classic cult movie, otherwise known as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time.""","Starring: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant I felt it would be wrong to make a hobby of writing movie reviews if I didn't start with my favorite movie of all time.So, the movie was made in the late 80s. The reason I mention this is because if you haven't seen it, prepare for a smattering of cheesy acting and low budget glory. However, this does not detract from the overall appeal of the film. If anything, it adds. For the 80s, this is an exceptional movie. For any time period, this is an exceptional movie.It all takes place in the imaginary kingdom of Florin, ruled by the charismatic and devious Prince Humperdink (imagine what elementary school was like for THAT guy). Technically, he is not yet the king, but in the same way that Cardinal Richeleau ruled France in The Three Muskateers, so does Prince Humperdink rule Florin.The heart of the movie opens on a small farm, where Buttercup, allegedly the most beautiful girl in the kingdom, is living her life. She commands Westley, the farm boy, around for pleasure. Eventually she realizes that Westley loves her, sparks fly, and we are hit with one of the movie's most infamous lines: ""Hold it, hold it! Grandpa, what is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? (pause) Is this a kissing book?"" Westley has no money for marriage, so he sets out in seek of fame and fortune. In a matter of weeks, news comes back to Buttercup that Westley has been murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Five years later the Prince decides that he is going to take Buttercup as his wife, and the movie sets into action. A mysterious Man in Black (like we don't know who it is) comes to get Buttercup, and faces impossible odds to get her, fighting master swordsmen, giants, and of course, Vizzini, in the classic Battle of Wits.The movie is a fairy tale, and as such, we know right from the beginning it is going to have a cheesy happy ending. Does that really matter? Of course not. First off, it's just entertainment. Second, the point of the movie is that true love conquers all. A nice little romanticized thought, even if evidence of this fact often fails to be seen in the real world.For the most part, the acting is solid. Cary Elwes does a knockout job as Westley, Robin Wright as the naïve but charming Princess Buttercup, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, the master swordsman seeking revenge for his father, Andre the Giant as Vizzini, the big hearted yet small brained giant, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, the criminal mastermind with a large IQ and yet no real intelligence, Billy Crystal in a strange turn as Miracle Max, and Peter Falk as the grandfather telling the story to his sick grandson. The acting is not flawless, but for the type of movie that this is, it is spot on.This is the must see movie of the century. It has action, romance, comedy, adventure, and suspense.

Archetypal...Fun...Heartwarming...Haunting,"Just got the new DVD version this week, and watched it... memories of college years, watching it over and over on VHS, came flooding back... What to say about this film... no, the acting isn't the best; no, the special effects aren't from George Lucas; no, it's not a perfect film... but, there is *something* about this film... it takes your run-of-the-mill archetypal fairy tale structure, turns it sideways in a really fun way, and manages to capture the heart and haunt you.Sure, the story is simplistic, but this film truly does get more powerful with repeated viewings. Recommendation: watch it a few times, then go away from it for a while. When you come back to it, it'll get you in the heart even more strongly. Or at least, it did to me... friends of mine from college even used the closing theme, ""Storybook Love"", as their first dance on their wedding day.One final word about Cary Elwes... the boy is quite the looker... And his lines are quite memorable... ""Drop Your Sword"" scene in particular. And, who will ever forget ""As You Wish..."" Shivers!SEE THE MOVIE! SEE IT AGAIN!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Back when movies were magic.,"The writing. The story. The casting. One of the best movies of all time. No movie is as quotable. The cinematography is fantastic and the music is perfect. Every actor was perfectly cast and their acting amazing.And many stories from the cast about times during filming are hilarious. Like Cary Elwes talking about Andre riding around on his 3 wheeler - ""Hey boss. You like my toy? You want to ride it? You know you waaaant to!""Or talking about casting Princess Buttercup
""I will never forget this for as long as I live,"" Jenkins said. ""The doorbell rang. Rob went to the door, and literally, as he opened the door, Wright was standing there in this little white summer dress, with her long blonde hair, and she had a halo from the sun. She was backlit by God. And Bill Goldman looked across the room at her, and he said, 'Well, that's what I wrote.' It was the most perfect thing.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
whee!,"Looking at this movie from a completely cinematic angle, one realizes that the acting is botched terribly by many (ahem, Buttercup, ahem), everything is wholly unrealistic, and the writing is terrible; there are some truly throw-away lines, especially by Buttercup. And yet, the movie will always remain one of my all-time favorites among other such cinematic abominations as Rocky Horror Picture Show and Four Rooms.  I have been watching this movie since I was 7, and I doubt I will ever stop.  And to (duly) shower praise upon Rob Reiner's head, there has never been a buddy movie that has come close to rivaling Fezzik and Inigo's wonderful chemistry.  And there has never been a better, awful, movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Innovative but not hilarious,"I had been meaning to watch ""The Princess Bride"" in full for ages and finally got around to it. I enjoyed it but was slightly disappointed.The movie opens with a sick young boy being visited by his grandfather, who offers to read him a story. The boy isn't very enthusiastic at first but he gradually realises that this fairy story is slightly different to those he has heard before.The script (by Hollywood royalty William Goldman)is full of comic one-liners that are mostly aimed at adults, while the basic framework stays within the fairy tale genre with a beautiful princess, a handsome hero and a nasty villain determined to get his way.While it is very watchable, I thought the film wasn't consistently funny enough for adults, though kids will probably be happy enough with the fight and chase scenes The performances are excellent, particularly Peter Falk as the grandfather, Robin Wright as Princess Buttercup and Carey Elwes as the hero. The supporting cast are also very good.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best films of all time,"Iconic in so many ways. Brilliant writing, brilliant adaptation, brilliant casting, brilliant acting, brilliant costumes, brilliant scenery, brilliant sets, brilliant cinematography, brilliant soundtrack, brilliant love story, brilliant action, brilliant comedy; a timeless, classic movie probably in the top twenty of all time. Appropriate for all ages, yet relatable to anyone with a sense of humor, regardless of age.I was born the year this came out, and had practically memorized it by the time I was ten. It's a staple in our family that I'm joyously sharing with my children now; although they're too young to appreciate it, they're not too young to be entertained by it.

Childhood favourite.,"This is the sort of movie that entire families get hooked on and you can always recognize a fellow fan, even through a simple ""inconcievable!"" or something perhaps a little more obscure like ""We are men of action..."".I've never written a comment but i felt i'd like to start and figured i'd better start with my favourite movie of all time. I know movies seldom deserve a rating of 10, and that if i were to pick this movie apart as i do with others i'd find a reason to rate it otherwise, but i just can't. This movie is perfect to me. I think it's the same uncanny feeling of enchantment i experienced the first time i saw it (as is the story with most people) that keeps me loving it with every new viewing. I have most definitely seen the Princess Bride more than any other movie (and it even came out a year before i was born..) and yet still i can sit down and simply marvel at it, as i did less than an hour ago. The sword fight remains my favourite choreography in any movie (challenged only by the duel between Hector and Achilles in Troy) and i will always love the witty dialogue. And of course, love is blind, so i can even forgive the corny fanfare whenever you see the man in black. Some of the lines are so beautiful they still astound me. Buttercup is so pure and Westley is so beautiful. The movie was perfectly cast.I recently read the Author's note in the novel by William Goldman, where he talks about getting the movie organized. I highly recommend reading it to any fan, it is very interesting and you will truly feel as though you were part of its creation.This quote says it all: ""Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles...

I discovered that I had missed out on one of filmdom's true treasures all these years!The storyline is passable, the scenery is nice, but what really makes this film a standout is the incredible wit that permeates it.

Totally and in all other ways inconceivable!!!!!!,"Superb, sublime, imaginative family entertainment from Rob Reiner. Tongue in cheek fairy tale/adventure that hits the ground running with a breathless first 25mins of fantastic set pieces that includes one of the best sword fights in cinema as well as some great characters. Vezzini, Fezzick and Inigo are characters that stayed with me all through my childhood but until a recent watching of this film I hadn't realised just how good this was for adults & children. It hasn't dated at all in the intervening years and compares well with modern fantasy films mainly due to a tone that wouldn't benefit from expensive CG.All the cast are memorable, Chris Sarandon as the pompous prince and Christopher Guest's Basil Rathbone style duke are great villains but Wallace Shawn as Vezzini steals best baddie honours. For the good guys Cary Elewes is superb as the Errol Flynn style hero swashbuckling and joking his way through duels, torture, chases and more with support from Innigo (the always superb Mandy Patinken) with Andre the Giant the ideal person to play Fezzick the good natured giant. Memorable cameos include Peter Cooke, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane and Mel Smith. As the Princess of the title Robin Wright really fits the bill looking like she just stepped out of the pages of a fairy tale but never letting her performance slip into the sappy, mushiness it could have become.It's magic spell never loses grip through chases, romance, duels and brawls its a treat my one complaint I wish it was longer so there was even more to enjoy. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
pretty perfect,"sorry for my clumsy English, but here it goes.this is perfect. it was a great inspiration back in the 1987. in the name of true love, we could invade ""girls only"" slumber parties, with nothing but a dagger of the mind and a quick quote: as you wish, this is true love..., (or if going for dramatic sympathy) hallo, my name is... Those were the good old days.Now you have to pay drinks and play straight just to get attention.

The perfect movie,"I read ""The Princess Bride"" for the first time when the paperback first came out. By the time the movie version was due to come out I read it again. I no longer had my old copy, so I bought a new one (The cover had been attached upside down, which I thought was cool).There are very few books that I have read twice, let alone bought twice. I loved this book. It's a great fantasy love story, told with style and wit. And, like all great fantasies, the characters are bigger than life -- and sometimes, just a bit corny.It's just enjoyable, first to last. Part romance, part adventure, part revenge story (""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"") and all fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The best movie ever.,"Let's start this off by saying I am in no way a fan of love stories. However, this is not your traditional love story. This is a classic movie and what was done in it has not been accomplished since. Many have tried and many have failed. This movie was made in the 80's so don't expect top of the line graphics. But it does have something for everyone. It will have the drama and love for the little lady. It has action for men and boys alike. It's a great family movie because anyone can watch it.If you get the chance to watch it watch it you definitely will not be disappointed. They do not make movies like this anymore, and it will make a lasting impression on you. I have loved this movie since I was a kid. I've read a lot of the other reviews of this movie and I don't really see any negative ones.

As you wish!,"The Princess Bride is just brilliant. The characters are perfectly cast by known, yet lesser used actors. This isn't a Tom Cruise, Ben Afleck, Julia Roberts type film and that's one of the reasons for it's long lasting appeal. It's hard to imagine anyone other than André the Giant as the lovable Fessik. Arguably the most recognizable actor in the movie is Billy Crystal in a short but hilarious scene. Most people have already watched The Princess Bride, and it's hard to find anyone that doesn't like it. As a side note, this movie is the source of one of the most famous movie quotes of all time...

a blend of blandness and bloodiness,"For an adult, this movie is way too bland and tasteless. There are only two relatively snappy and enjoyable scenes (the poison duel and the fight of Inigo and Westley). Most of the rest of the movie is simply uninteresting. The good characters are too characterless, and the villains are too unconvincing (perhaps with the single exception of Vizzini). The plot is soapy and overstretched. The props are cheap looking.Now, you might say, this can be said of a lot of other movies too. Why 1/10?Because for its target audience - kids - the movie is not simply average. It's outright disgusting. The torture scene alone is enough to get this movie banned from my family video library. It's so senselessly, meaninglessly cruel that I couldn't watch it myself, let alone show to my kids. The sick obsession with bloody vengeance (""Prepare to die! Prepare to die! Prepare to die! Prepare to die!"" ad infinitum) is immoral almost to the point of absurdity. The entire movie is just a painful, endless gallery of people (both ""good"" and ""bad"") beating and killing other people by various means. There's no beauty or catharsis in any of this. Just blood.And you say this is a ""family classic""? Are you serious?Now, British cinema seems to always have had a certain feel for cruelty, but when Monthy Python does it, it's at least funny. Here, it's not funny at all. It's just plain ugly.I'm having serious difficulty trying to imagine a normal sane person who can watch this movie without skipping... let alone _enjoy_ it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Boring,"Now, I know boring is a subjective term to describe a movie, but here it's almost not. Why? Because the pacing is so slow that I cannot understand how one would not get bored. Without much connection, we move from scene to scene, which all seem to be thought up around one single ""joke"" or supposedly funny setting, but had to be dragged out gor a few minutes to pad the movie's running time. As noted in other reviews, nostalgia must be at work here to produce high ratings, because watching it for my first time in my forties, I just cannot understand it, and no, I will not honor the movie by using that one word to describe it.I tracked down this movie because it was supposed to be similar to Stardust (2007), a movie I like a lot; whilst it certainly has flaws, it actually executes the ""fantasy comedy"" genre quite well. This movie, as far as I am concerned, is far less funny (I kept waiting for the first joke to happen) and is to clunky and cheaply made (even for the time) to work as a fantasy. Another trigger to watch it were the Inigo Montoya lines which I had seen quoted every now and then. Well, that character was indeed the best part in the movie, but far from able to save it.My suggestion then - if you watched this movie when you were young, leave the memory be and don't watch it again, if you are tempted to watch the movie now (as an adult), just don't, because there is really nothing here.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The most dramatic use of the word ""bitch"" ever.","This movie is a contradiction in terms.  By all rationality it should not be as popular as it is.  It is basically one cliche after another played out on some of the most obvious soundstages ever seen.  Somehow Rob Reiner has made one of the most popular and endearing fables of all time.  I still have not ruled out a pact with Satan.  Somehow though, it all works brilliantly. Cary Elwes' dry humor, Mandy Patinkin's delectable portrayal of a Spaniard, Andre the Giant's paradoxical boyish charm, and Wallace Shawn's immortal use of the word ""inconceivable"" have made this the fairytale of the latter half of the 20th century.  As always Reiner relies on the innocence of childhood to win audiences as he plays out the plot within a plot of Peter Falk reading a young, sick Fred Savage a story in a moment of grandfatherly bonding.  Throw in a beautiful damsel in distress, an evil prince, a vow of revenge, a miracle man, a senile king, the greatest sword fight in cinematic history, incredibly large rodents, an abbot with a speech impediment, a holocaust cloak and a wheelbarrow, and you've got a movie that no one except those who have forgotten how to believe in fairies could dislike.

I haven't read the original book that the movie is based on, but after seeing how god the movie is (courtesy of Rob Reiner), I should most definitely read it.The casting is perfect. Cary Elwes plays Westly, a poor farm boy who is in love with Princess Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and follows her every command with ""As you Wish."" When Buttercup is captured by three men and then eventually forced to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), It's up to Westly to rescue her. All of this is being told to A grandson (Fred Savage) by his grandpa (Peter Falk).The scenery is beautiful. From the pirate ship out at sea facing the shrieking eels, to the deadly Fire Swamp, the visuals and scenery will leave you in awe. Don't forget about the Cliffs of Insanity, where and epic fencing battle takes place.I remember watching this as a child and loving it very much. As I watch it again when I'm older, I love it just as much and I also realize how good of a movie it is altogether.

Star rating: 2 out of 5,"The Princess Bride (as of 31 October 2002) commands 86th place on the Internet Movie Database's 'Top 250 Films' list, which rather begs the question: WHY???  It is a somewhat alarming thought that there are only 85 films in the world considered to be superior to this mish-mash of action and syrupy sentiment held together by cheesy acting and wobbly scenery. Admittedly, there are some elements of the story which are really rather good, including the large variety of perils our hero (Westley) and heroine (Buttercup) must face; the shrieking eels, cliffs of insanity and fire-swamp are original and nasty pitfalls awaiting the unwary.Unfortunately viewers must wade through a lot of dross for these occasional rewards and the plot is a perfect example of this.  A grandfather is reading his rather peevish grandson a story about two young lovers with somewhat unlikely names.  Buttercup's sweetheart (supposedly killed by pirates five years ago) is in fact still alive, cleverly ""disguised"" with a black blindfold and an incredibly silly little moustache and pigtail.  But Buttercup has become engaged (against her will) to the nasty Prince Humperdinck.  This of course is a cue for multiple sword fights and near death experiences as the soulmates prove that true love will conquer all.Apart from the notable exception of Christopher Guest who plays Humperdinck's sidekick Count Rugen with a deliciously understated sadistic malice, the acting is largely overcooked.  Perhaps this is just as well; if the viewer's attention is monopolised by the actors, they will be less likely to notice the bendable swords and polystyrene rocks.

A movie worth rewatching...and rewatching...and rewatching...,"Every time I watch this movie, it blows me away. It's just so great it's hard to believe. I like spoofs and that's one of the reasons I love this movie so much. Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, pick a spoof, they're all great but this movie, as much as it parodies the fantasy genre, it's an incredible adventure in itself. The sword fight between Wesley and Inigo might be the greatest fight I've ever seen. The acting is great too. I love the combination of Mandy Partinkin, Andre the Giant, and Wallace Shawn. They're so hilarious together that every time I watch the movie I want to rewatch their scenes again. The dry sense of humor that goes on between Partinkin and Shawn is the highlight of the film. It doesn't last long but every moment is hysterical. The word 'Inconceivable' makes me crack up every time I hear it. I always love Cary Elwes and he is, of course, great in this film. He's cool, collected but isn't afraid to kick ass and take names. I also love the relationship between Fred Savage and Peter Falke. They work so well together, even though they're only in a few scenes. Billy Crystal is hilarious. Chris Sarandon is the guy you love to hate. Christopher Guest (who of course had to be in the movie because it's directed by Reiner) is the guy you love to hate even more than Sarandon.It's action, adventure, comedy, romance, parody and swashbuckling blended so well together it's simply stunning. It's just so rewatchable. So many moments that I could talk about for hours. My all time favorite movie. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What more could you want?,"True Love.  What can now these days be seen as ""inconceivable"" is brought effortlessly to film in this tale of a couple parted by ""death"" brought back to life amidst fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, monsters, giants, chases, escapes, miracles and a really annoyingly snotty prince.  The film is brilliantly cast.  Every one fits their part perfectly.  I can't imagine anyone else but Cary Elwes playing Westley, Robin Wright playing Buttercup, Mandy Patinkin as the vengeful Inigo, Andre the Giant as the good natured Giant, Wallace Shawn as the ""brilliant"" Sicilian...so on and so forth....each character in each of their quirks fits the bill in this fantasy great....all the way down to the priest with the speech impediment.  Together they make one of the greatest stories ever told.  It brings hope and wonder back to a world that is lacking both.  It is just pure goodness (matched with subtle, yet delightful humor) .  If you are looking for an escape from the way things work in this day and time, I definitely suggest watching this movie and taking it to heart.  It will remind you that there is still good left in the world and that true love is the greatest thing God has given us.  Westley and Buttercup have to be one of the great couples ever to have ""lived"" If you are looking for other movies that personify this goodness that does exist in human nature, i would have to suggest the timeless Anne of Green Gables.

I think I saw the wrong film!,"I just finished watching this movie on DVD after a friend strongly recommended it. Not having ever heard of it before I didn't have much in the way of expectations so it's hard to believe I was let down. Actually I was shocked at how mediocre this movie is! I went up and down the user comments and can only conclude that I must have seen the wrong movie. Sure, there were cute and funny bits along the way but for the most part this was purely for little kids. I was honestly embarrassed during almost the whole thing. This movie couldn't really decide whether it was a farcical comedy, an adventure story or a medieval saga. The only thing I felt when Peter Falk put away the book was relief that it was over and so was the awkwardness.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inconceivable,"""Ever heard of Plato? Aristotle? Socrates? Morons."" This is one of the best pieces of comedic acting I think I've ever seen, partly because simply looking at this balding midget with the absurdly self assured smile can leave me in hysterics and also because of the sheer cheek of it all, the way he says it with a slight lisp and a raised eyebrow as if emulating someone much more handsome and suave than himself.  And the timing is truly impeccable.  Where is Wallace Shawn amongst the list of the comic greats? It is a true injustice that the man has not been seen as the god he is.This film is full of the most wonderful characters; even the image of this cracked old guy, S. Morgenstern writing of pirates and giants in his senility is a wonderful one and I was loathe to admit he was fictional.  I loved the idea of this audacious old guy writing a book doomed to obscurity only to be found and revered by this cool grandad (Columbo or Peter Faulk if we're going to get picky and I feel I should when discussing this film) and read to the kid from The Wonder Years (who was so rightly cast in everything in the late 80s, his face when he disgusted, inquires `Is this a kissing book?' is a picture of scornful perfection.  How sad that all he is now is 'The Mole' in Austin Powers 3).So Columbo tells the story of The Princess Bride and eventually the cynical kid becomes engrossed which is exactly how my love for this film started. Some things are severely hampered by their titles.  Many, consider things beneath them simply from the name, and that's why people miss out on the joys of Buffy The Vampire Slayer which on the surface I'll admit looks like idle crap but is awash with surreal humor and endearing characters.  Much in the same way, as a world-weary 11 year old I was wary of a film with the words Princess and Bride featuring so prominently in the title but as soon as I saw Andre The Giant (an idol of mine at the time) rhyming about peanuts and the hilarious swordfight (also wonderfully choreographed, swishy hand movements, acrobatics and all) I was won over.  After watching it enough times to confidently quote it (`I'm not left handed either' whoever saw that coming?) it's become sort of a comfort blanket.  I've grown to love Prince Humperdink and his shamelessly hysterical lack of morals and childish campery who expresses his displeasure with terrifying rage: `I should be very put out'.But this film has depths I never really considered until my 20th viewing. for instance The Dread Pirate Roberts was real, I read about him as a little girl, he was the longest pirate ever to be marauding and this film nicely explains how (and I firmly believe that this explanation is accurate). It is also anti war (no, it is) as it thoroughly takes the piss out of creating wars `we're starting a war, it's a long and prestigious line of work' (or something to that effect, apparently i'm not as familiar with this as i believed... i'll just have to watch it again...) So, a political satire and historical account, too.I do however have one quibble and it's a biggie...  In the fire swamp they fall into a pit of sinking sand and the amount of debris on top varies from shot to shot. such oversights in continuity are simply unacceptable...This film is charming and brilliant and incase I haven't hammered my point down quite hard enough yet. I love it. Oh! and this film contains the greatest line in film history (bonus points for featuring it more than once): ""My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!""10/10, actually 9/10 for the continuity... ahemSubtle and sweet spoofery at its best :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

As You Wish...,"This movie is definitely my favorite movie.  I have long sections of it committed to memory (including sound effects!).If you enjoy multiple genre works, you should be interested in this film...it delightfully blends romance, comedy and action.  Along with memorable characters (Fezzik, Miracle Max), it has witty dialog (""You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.""), a great chain of events leading to the climax (sword fight, wrestling match, battle of wits, etc.), and a satisfying ending in both the fantasy world of Wesley and Buttercup and the real world of the sick boy and his grandfather.If you like the movie, you may also like the book (by William Goldman...still in print), although not for the same reasons.  The book uses narrative to amuse where the movie uses surprise or quirky characters.

"You, your partner, and The Princess Bride - Perfect.","This is undoubtedly the best movie to watch with a partner.

Andre the giant does quite well with Fezic, the kind-hearted giant, and Mandy Patinkin's performance as Inigo Montoya is incredible.The swordfight scene between Wesley and Inigo deserves special mention as it has been voted the best in any movie by IMDB and displays the talent of the fencers very well.

A Classic That Will Be Loved Forever,"Sometimes, when renting a DVD, I'm surprised to find a gem, that I missed on its original run. Rob Reiner's ""Princess Bride"" is one of those. For it's duration, I was transported to my childhood, and watched a dream play out on the screen.The film on its original release was badly marketed. If one of my films had been butchered that way, I would have been screaming to the rooftops. To his credit, Rob Reiner did not strangle the head of Business Affairs at Fox.This movie is pure storytelling by the premier screenwriter of our time, directed by an actor's director. It's hard to believe Reiner brought it in at $15 million.  He is admittedly not a special effects wizard, ala Lucas, but nevermind. Each of his films has been something special, and in my opinion, Reiner hasn't received the recognition that some of his peers have enjoyed.It's not surprising that a son of Carl and Estelle Reiner should have a spark of genius himself.After renting the movie, I bought two copies. One goes in my collection. The other I put into storage at a Los Angeles Film Vault. When my daughter has children, that pristine copy is meant for them.Seldom has a movie had such cross over that adults and children love it. Although it failed to turn a profit at the box office, I trust later incarnations in VHS and DVD have remedied that. Today, our children read fairy tales that go back centuries.  I would be very surprised if some 23rd century viewer wasn't charmed by this film no matter what the media.  Bravo to the actors, the writer, the producer and director.  Yes and to Norman Lear, who footed the bill. You did yourselves proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Film everyone should see,"I have yet to meet a person who watched this move and didn't find it evnjoyable. It's a simple, yet innovative idea: they made a classic, archetypical Dark Ages hero/romance flick, but set it right on the edge between satire and earnestness. The whole story is, supposedly, a book a grandfather (Peter Falk) reads to his sick grandkid (Fred Savage). It should tell you all you need to know about this film when, the first time the two estranged lovers find each other and embrace, you all of the sudden hear, ""Wait, I don't wanna hear about kissing.""The principle actors here are all very good. Cary Elwes is fine as our dashing hero. Mandy Patinkin is his foil/friend, with his own subplot. Robin Wright is fine as the damsel in love and distress, and Chris Sarandon makes a good evil, scheming villain, and he's a highly underrated character actor (see ""Dog Day Afternoon"" if you don't believe me).The real beauty of this film, however, is the performances turned in by such actors as Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal, Carol, Kane, and that noted thespian, Andre the Giant. Shawn, for instance, is the con man with a list who is the early (not final) villain. His character is short, has a lisp, and uses the same word (he prounounces it ""inconthievable"") to address every situation (which leads to the best quote of the film, Patinkin's response ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."") It's this kind of dialogue that seems out of place in such an action/romance film. ""The African Queen"" or something or the like, while being fine movies, would never have a character like Billy Crystal's ""Miracle Max"", who plays a sort of caricature of a Jewish parent (to me, anyway).The beauty of this film is that you aren't quite sure if you should be laughing, or should be caught up in the story, and the beauty is that you can do both.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Princess Bride OKish,"The princess bride ushers you into a mystical world of giants, pirates, and castles. This 1987 fairytale spoof has all the right intentions, like the story being read from grandfather to grandson it seems like it would be a nice way to just relax on a lazy day, or a day when you are sick. it's a harmless film but lacked something for me.Rob Reiner (This Is Spinal Tap) directed this film which is based on the novel of the same name by William Goldman who as well wrote the screenplay. The story begins with a sick child (Fred Savage) being read a fairytale by his grandfather (Peter Falk). Quickly we are whisked away as well with the grandson who at first is dreading the fairytale story. The story introduces us too Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and Westley (Carey Elwes) a couple who are madly in love. Immediately we are told that Westley must leave Buttercup for no apparent reason. Quickly Buttercup is kidnapped by three pirate like men, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), and Fezzik (André The Giant). It seems like they are being followed by a Zorro-esquire character which quickly eliminates one of the kidnappers one at a time. It quickly becomes repetitive but that's not the least of the problems here. 'Zorro' quickly makes it through the kidnappers using swords, poison, and his own hands. Later on the princess is endangered by the prince of her land who plans a marriage.One of the major problems to me with the film is the continuation of certain aspects. An example of which was when the kidnappers and the princess make it up the mountain cliff by climbing, after they move on the prince somehow managed to reach the top of the mountain with the rest of his crew which includes a large number of horses. The props at times seem fake but mostly are average, the acting is OK, but the laughs just don't come. The movie sets out to spoof fairy tale movies and do, in some ways, succeed, but rarely did I laugh out loud when a joke was delivered, and in some ways these moments don't even spoof or satirize this classification of films. The film has its moments, I thought the poison scene was clever at best, but overall I was displeased with this film. If I was recommending a spoof of these types of films I would much rather recommend the 'Shrek' movies. I truly dreaded this film experience around 5 minutes in when we were jumped around making me feel overwhelmed and rushed, overall it was a unique experience which I do not think I will revisit.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The princess bride is to fantasy is as Chucky is to horror.,"Before I begin there are a few times I will make comments as to certain parts of the story and specific details but I do not reveal any critical points in the story. To start the story itself is horrible. I admit it has a few good characters, I enjoyed the spainard. The first time I saw it it was easy to tell what would be happening 10 minutes ahead. The simplicity of it all was dumbfounding. The story is nothing more than cliche. Several people I know seem to like it some how in one way or another, something I dont seem to understand. The acting I found to be subpar but acceptable given the roles. Andre the Giant, as he has become known as, fit the role of his character very well from a physicly ominious standpoint, but his poor diction detracted from the moment most any time that he spoke. The Vizzini character was utterly annoying through and through. As for Cary Elwes, his performance I felt was decent given the seemingly two dimensional persona that the script gave him to work with. Something that really got on my nerves was how that it was chosen to retain the annoyence from the book of using that horrible acronym: ROUS. Rodents Of Unusual Size. Its one thing to include a rodent as an enemy but its quite another thing in the way they handles the scene with the rodents. When Elwes's character was attacked by one of these ""rous""s  he was even pinned down by this animal half his size. To me this was a horrible way to handle it. It reminded me much of chucky *shudders* (now THAT was a horrible movie) where a childs doll somehow had the weight and strength to pin down grown people. The physics of it just dont make any sense. My ultimate opinion is this. As a satire, mocking the fantasy genre, it was a masterpiece of its time. As a fantasy (which is what its listed as for some reason), it was an abomination and a slap in the face to the rest of the genre in my opinion. I cant quite put my finger on a specific of why i loathe it so much, but to sit and watch it makes me sick.Would i Reccomend this movie? If you havent seen it: yes. I have heard enough good things from other people that odds are you may enjoy it too, so you might as well struggle through it once.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's all been said before, hasn't it?!Of course there are cheesy bits, but those are the bits I love most ""Have fun storming the castle,"" ""Think it'll work?"" ""It'd take a miracle"" when Miracle Max is waving the good guys on their way. Every moment for me is sheer joy (although when I introduced it to my friends here at uni, none of them cared much for it) but I cannot think how anyone couldn't be uplifted by it.I should stop raving about it, I'm too biased for a fair opinion, I've been watching this film for years and don't think I'll ever stop!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Princess Bride: Greatest Film ever made,"I really love this movie and the book. I could watch it over and over (and frequently do).Its a story of True Love and High Adventure.Great lines, great characters, great scenery.You may get the feeling I like this movie.Mandy Patinkin is great as Inigo Montoya and his line ""Hallo, I am Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die"" goes down as one of my favourite quotes.If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out.why are you still reading this? Go see the film now!Xyzandra.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of my Top 10 - definitely,"I saw this film for the first time in a crowded cafeteria at Geneva College in 1987.  I remember little about it, other than the *huge* cheer of the crowd when Count Rugen turns tail and runs when Inigo confronts him in the castle.It is definitely a movie that grows on you.  I have downloaded (and edited!) a copy of the script, made a Windows theme, and like many of you, have committed much of the movie to memory.  It was also one of the first movies I watched with my wife when we were still dating.It's one of those movies that you can watch again and again.  The subtle humor, one-liners, and satire of The Princess Bride make it one of my favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Movie!,"This is by far the greatest movie ever made!  Well, at least the greatest comedy!  Cary Elwes is brilliant as Westley, and who could every forget Inigo's ""Prepare to die""?  Andre the Giant turns in his best role ever (and remember, he was a professional wrestler, so he's done a whole lotta acting).  A star-studded cast with Rob Reiner in his greatest directorial effort.  I've seen this many, many times and it never gets old -- it's even better when you can say the lines along with the characters!  If you've seen this movie, go see it again...if you haven't, well, go see it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very entertaining and worth watching! Made my night!,"I came across this title a few days ago. I became curious because of the high ratings and the reviews posted. I was a bit hesitant at first when I saw that it's quite an old flick (1987).Finally, was able to watch this film last night. I can't help but to create an account to register just to rate the movie. How thankful I am that I gave it a try because it really made my night. We enjoyed it a lot! It's an entertaining film. We laughed hard. The characters were great! The film was brilliantly done. The characters were well-chosen. Each one of them portrayed their roles excellently.. There are values to be learned. I loved how polite and well-mannered the main characters were; Westley,, Buttercup, Inigo Montoya, Fezzik. The value of the word, ""please,"" was mentioned. Inigo Montoya was a respectful person and kept saying ""thank you"" whenever he asks a favor or request from someone. The script is admirable. You can watch this just with anyone; even with your kids. It's a film for all ages. It doesn't contain violence .This film is highly commendable. It's worth watching. When the movie ended, I want more and wished that there's a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My own opinion of the film...,"In a society so characterized by hate and violence, it is refreshing to occasionally have a film that forgets all those hidden rules and entertains the child inside of us all. The Princess Bride is without a doubt one of these movies! It will almost assuredly make you drop on the floor and roll with laughter. This is Rob Reiners greatest comedy, and not far off from being his finest all together. Reiner not only creates a histaricall movie, but also ties up all the loose ends with unmatched comical acting, and beautiful scenery. From the beginning scene with the sickly child, through the very end, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh. I only wish that there were more movies like this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Put it next to Casablanca,"For years, while my kids were growing up, I thought this was the best movie ever made. Then I saw Casablanca again, and moved it down to number 2.

I simply love this movie too !!,I can say that I experienced love at first sight with this movie when i watched it for the first time.. And all the people I've shown it to enjoyed it just as much as I did (and still do). I know it almost by heart and it has become a game for my brother and I to recite entire parts of the dialogues to each other whenever we happen to meet. My six-year-old brother likes it so much that he sometimes pretends to be Inigo and therefore wants to avenge his father with a sword fight with...his own father !

A Classic Childhood Favorite About Love and Adventure,"https://youtu.be/Ldmi1UeMKd0 The link above contains my full review and summary of the movie. I watched it with my friend Rachel who'd never seen it before, if you can believe that! She liked it a lot (she even cried just a few minutes in!) I've loved this movie for a LONG time. I grew up on silly comedies and action movies like Big Trouble in Little China and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. In fact, I used to confuse Men in Tights with PRINCESS BRIDE because the lead actor is the same in each! The brilliant Carey Elwes! The script is my one of my favorite writers, William Goldman, from his book. If you're a fan of the movie and haven't read the book, you are missing out! The book is just as amazing as the movie and in some ways it's EVEN BETTER.The swordfight on the Cliffs of Insanity, the themes of true love and revenge, the relationship between the boy and his grandfather, the quotable lines and the AMAZING cast, make this a fantastic film. Give it a watch and show it to your friends if they haven't seen it!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I thought that the acting on the part of Robin Wright was great and I always enjoy watching Cary Elwes.

Still i must say, we did both laugh twice. But i wouldn't want to spoiler.If you like love-stories watch s.th. like ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"".

The cure for what ails you,"Once I had the flu, and I hurt all over so badly I couldn't sleep. I was trapped on the living room couch, wondering if I'd ever recover, and the only thing that made me feel better was ""The Princess Bride."" I think I watched it five times that night. That was about 10 years ago, but even today I can't watch just a little of it without watching the whole thing, and I can't watch any of it without smiling. It does an end run around my pessimism and cynicism and gets right at the uncorruptible romantic inside me.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My favourite 'sick' film,"This film is definitely the best film for days when you're off sick, snuggled up in bed and not feeling too hot, which was exactly how it was introduced to me by my mum. It always perks me up no matter what and despite the fact that it was made in the 80s it still rocks and gets better the more times you see it. If you've already seen it but haven't read the book, are you insane?! What are you reading this for? Sprint down to your nearest bookshop and get a copy!! It's ""The Princess Bride"" by William Goldman. So go! Stop reading this and read the book instead!Despite the fact that the film is one of my favourites, the book has to be my favourite book of all time and probably will remain so forever. In fact all my friends agree with me and I don't think it matters if you've seen the film first or read the book first, both should appeal to everyone! In fact I recently forced one of my friends to watch it (he's refused twice and said it looked rubbish and girlie) but behold! After about an hour I stopped it, teasing him that I wouldn't force him to watch any more of this rubbish and he looked physical pained. You should have seen the look on his face! He immediately got up and tried to get the remote off me, begging me to put it back on so he could find out what was going to happen to Wesley (I stopped it at a particularly exciting part).It's got something for everyone: there's fencing and giants and evil princes and heroes and (incredibly irritating and stupid) damsels in distress and midget geniuses and a pit of despair (the zoo of death is much better in the book) and miracles and the grandson who comes in with funny one-liners every now and again (eg ""Hold it, hold it. What is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports?(suspiciously) Is this a kissing book?"" or my favourite line: ""oh, murdered by pirates is good"") and revenge and torture and dragons, just kidding, no dragons, but it's got everything else! It's a bit like a fairytale but sooo much better. And it's funny! So you see, anyone from little kids to the elderly, girls and boys alike will enjoy this film.

"I Don't Get What's So Great About It, but Whatever Floats Your Boat...","I've heard a lot about this movie, especially praise for it's mix of comedy, romance, and action. Well, they certainly did have all 3, but none of them came off very effectively to me. Most of the jokes didn't work with me, evident by my family laughing as I sat in silence trying to deduce what was so comical about a given line. The action was not too exciting to me, although the coordination on the sword fighting was pretty good. The romance was...arguably absent, to put it gently. I didn't feel any real connection between Westley and Buttercup since they fell in love as soon as we are introduced to them. No build up, no suspense, no nothing. I also found the idea of them being in love totally unbelievable. He did odd jobs around the home and she fell in love with him? Pretty low standards there, Buttercup.Aside from these ineffective aspects, the story also had me emotionally slamming my head against a proverbial wall. I always thought Twilight was the worst offender in the category of having a female lead who is totally bland and male dependent, which hence causes a completely agitating love story to ensue, but Buttercup and her relationship with Westly might just take the cake....OK that's going too far. However, it's still pretty bad, and the story suffers horribly because of it. Most of the movie came off as a way to please adolescent girls who dream of their own prince charming saving them from everything and tending to their every whim and issue. Aside from Buttercup, the characters range from forgettable, to decent, to pretty good. The only character I came to actually like was Inigo, but that isn't saying much given his competition.Overall, I really don't get why this movie is rated so highly, but if people enjoy it, good for them. I'll be avoiding it from now on, however.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

When it works, the sword fight between Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin for example, it really excels. When it doesn't ... Billy Crystal, some of Andre the Giant's acting ... it just kind of lies there, but never for too long.

As I grew, I learned to appreciate the exceptional writing and the comedic timing that every player is gifted with.  The lines would be only half as funny if you didn't know how they were delivered.

Plus, I was hoping something would come and turn this movie around and add some spice to it, but it didn't happen, so that was disappointing.  Little kids would probably enjoy this movie, but I didn't enjoy this movie at all.  Big disappointment!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best. Ever.,"The best movie ever.  No movie surpasses this.  I can only hope that there will ever be a movie that is any better than this.  Everything about it is great.  The book is just as good as the movie.  The soundtrack is also pretty nice(there's always a soft spot in my heart for classical guitar music).

It's in a kiss,"A story of true love that harks back to old Hollywood. All the performances are strong, It's not one of those films where one performance stands out and makes you go wow, look what they can do. For me it's about putting a group of actors together who, without fail, compliment each other.Over the years it has gained a somewhat cult status, which is strange for a film of this type, could it be that the story and the deft touches appeal even in this cynical world of ours. That could be it, it shows us a time, abet imaginary, where things are simpler, honour is important and true love is worth fighting for.This film is a joy to watch, every now and then I will return to it, expecting it to have aged.

I Don't See Why This Is An All-Time Classic,"I know that the reputation of ""The Princess Bride"" is that it is considered to be one of the greatest fairytale stories ever put to film. Besides some understandably iconic characters, however, I just don't quite understand why it is such a classic, as I found it to be rather underwhelming in large portions.For a basic plot summary, ""Princess Bride"" is a fairytale read to a young boy (Fred Savage) by his grandfather (Peter Falk). The tale focuses on Westley (Cary Elwes) and his quest to find his beloved Buttercup (Robin Wright), now engaged to be wed to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Along the way, Westley meets up with a motley crew of characters that include the giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant), swashbuckling swordsman Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), and the annoying little imp Vizzini (Wallace Shawn).For the first 20-30 minutes of ""Princess Bride"", I was engaged and interested. I liked the setup (story being read to a child), the Andre/Patinkin/Shawn interactions are hilarious, and Elwes has just the right sense of humor to pull off his role. There is also just a sense of irreverence that pervades the whole beginning of the film, setting the humorous tone perfectly.After that opening salvo, however, the film seems to trend towards a more conventional ""quest"" tale, at which point my interest severely waned. Simply put, when the movie turns toward serious plot and away from goofy humor, it completely lost me. There were times where I was even outright bored, as the ""meat"" of this fairytale isn't anything to write home about. To me, the goofy comedic tone of ""Princess Bride"" is its calling card, and when most of that was used up in the early goings it fell flat afterwards.Perhaps my view of this film is colored by the fact that I never saw it as a child, but seeing it for the first time as an adult left me wondering why it is considered one of the greats. I'll always remember some of the iconic characters/moments, but taken as a whole ""Princess Bride"" was mostly underwhelming for me.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Now, watching it I love it for all those reasons and more.  I appreciate the tougue in cheek humor and can enjoy it's silly, almost campy attitude.  I love this movie.

The Princess Bride has a little bit of everything -- comedy, adventure, romance you name it, it's there.

It tells of the love between Westley and Buttercup, the gallant Inigo Montoya on a quest to honor his father, and the obnoxious Prince Humperdincks quest to have Buttercup for his own.  The rapport between the characters is wonderful giving leave to some of the best quotes that you still hear people reciting today!

"A timeless, funny, action-filled love story!!","""The Princess Bride"" is a fun ride that audiences will enjoy. When you mix pirates, sword wielding Spaniards, good-natured giants, evil masterminds, six-fingered counts, and the Cliffs of Insanity, what do you get? An adventurous, fun-filled, action-packed movie that will have you laughing, crying, cheering, and counting your fingers! The story opens to find a young princess, Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her servant, a quiet, well-mannered Westly (Carey Elwes). As they fall in love, Westly decides he must leave Buttercup to pursue his fortune so he may provide a life for her. Westly leaves and is not heard from again, thought to be killed at the hands of the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup, broken-hearted, is then betrothed to a Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon) who is not as kind as Westly.At this point, the movie becomes a witty, dialogue-driven, action flick. Buttercup is kidnapped by an evil mastermind (Wallace Shawn) and his henchmen; a Spaniard (Mandy Patinkin) bent on the revenge of his murdered father, and a giant (Andre the Giant) who just wants to do things right. Chasing the kidnappers is Buttercup's fiancé, Humperdink, and the shadowy figure in black, the Dread Pirate Roberts.Not all are who they seem to be as the characters interact. The action continues as the settings change quite rapidly throughout the movie, as does the pace. This tends to keep the viewer reminded of the original theme of the movie, which is the love story. And even though it is of the age old plot to rescue the beautiful princess from the mean old bad guy, the entertainment value of the film is well worth it. Movie goers that may have seen the film ""Willow"" can relate to the type of plot, settings, and characters here.Though the comic lines and sometimes even silly dialogue might suggest this film is aimed at children, the action sequences might suggest otherwise. A few scenes display violence and blood, contemplation of suicide, and big, scary rodents.Another positive for this film is that it is timeless. It should never grow old and out of date as it has a medieval setting, including castles, villages, horses, torches, and swordplay. It is a great story that any one, at any age, can relate to because it appeals to the hero in all of us. Viewers will love the characters, the action, the love, and will find themselves rooting for the good guys.or are they the bad guys?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

okay story but poor production,"'The Princess Bride' is a fantasy film about a man who goes to rescue a kidnapped princess that he has fallen in love with. The main problem that I had with this film is the production; the monsters and fights did not look realistic, and the romance was silly and awkward in places. The production of this film could have been much better. As a story, I think that the film succeeded. The way that it was presented as a tale from the grandfather to the boy also put it into perspective, but the production made it seem like an unprofessional film, and I did have trouble taking it seriously. As this film is generally well-liked by a wide audience, I would recommend it. Just try to not let the production put you off.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I've Finally Seen This 80's Classic...,"THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is almost pointless to comment on because pretty much everyone has seen it, and everyone has their opinion. And yet here I am. I'd managed to go a long time without ever actually having seen the film, though I was familiar with some of it's more popular moments from their repetition and spoofing in pop culture. I also read the script as part of an assignment in college for a creative writing course but, at the time, didn't find anything particularly special about it. It just read like any other fairy tale film with some moments of appreciable comedy scattered throughout. When a friend of mine found out I hadn't seen the movie and gave me a confounded stare, I figured it was time. So finally, last year at the age of 31, I sat down to watch THE PRINCESS BRIDE andit was good. I enjoyed it. My daughter seemed to enjoy it. But neither of us had the reaction that most others seem to have in regards to Rob Reiner's 1987 fantasy/comedy. Since then, I've watched it a few more times and I'll admit it's grown on me more with each subsequent viewing. I've developed some respect for the film and I understand why it seems to have developed such a cult following. It sticks with you. I didn't think much of it when I first watched it, but now I can't go a day without mentally or verbally making reference to it.The story is your average fairy tale: young lovers are separated, the man is thought dead and the woman is forced into a marriage engagement with a corrupt prince. The price plans to use the woman in a plot to start a war with a neighboring kingdom, and the young man returns in disguise to rescue her. Et cetera, et cetera, and they live happily ever after. But the characters themselves are just so much fun. Reiner's casting in the film is absolutely perfect. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are the epitome of fairy tale lovers: young and beautiful, with real chemistry. And Elwes is fantastically dashing as the swashbuckling hero. As good as the two of them are, I would've much preferred an entire movie about the trio of mercenaries who kidnap Buttercup (Wright) on orders from the prince and jumpstart the plot. Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), Fezzik (André the Giant), and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) drive the first half of the film as the mysterious ""Man in Black"" pursues them to retrieve our damsel in distress. I loved these guys and the first half of the movie was, in my opinion, where all the best material lies. Once it all shifts to our hero versus the corrupt Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), my interest wanes a bit. There's still some good material there but it loses a lot of the fun, fantastical parody elementsthe Cliffs of Insanity, the Fire Swamp with the R.O.U.Sthat kept me laughing along.Despite it's minor flaws, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is undeniably a classic. It's infinitely quotable. It hits all the right buttons for a good comedy or adventure or fantasy film. And it's populated with an incredible cast. I love the 80's reliance on practical effects, from a time before CG became popular and turned everything into high-tech cartoons. The R.O.U.S. would never have been as fun a sequence if it weren't puppetry and people in suits. As fantastic as Elwes was in the hero's role, Inigo Montoya is easily my (and certainly many other's) favorite character with Fezzik in a close second. André the Giant made for the perfect simple giant with a heart of gold. His speech can be hard to understand at times, but subtitles made sure I wouldn't miss out on some of his classic lines. Chances are anyone reading this comment have already seen this movie and aren't looking to be convinced whether to watch it or not, so I'm not here to promote the film. I'm just here to admit I was mistaken in blowing off this movie for so long and I can now be counted among the myriad of PRINCESS BRIDE fans. I don't know that I'm much of a die-hard fan but it's got my massive respect for what it is and what it's become. Without a doubt, I'm sure I'll find myself quoting the film and I'll be more apt to stop and watch it when I stumble across it on television.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why did it take me so long to watch this,"After watching the complete Columbo series back to back, I thought I'd go back and finally watch this as I'd become addicted to Peter Falk.The movies is brilliant from the story to the one liners and gags that came through some subtle and others requiring the knowledge of the actors other work.Each character brilliantly portrayed, if a Terry Pratchett movie was to be done with justice to his writing, this would be it.

One of the most Brilliant Films ever made...,"I first saw this movie when it premiered in the theatres in 1987. My mother took me to see when I was a child, and we both loved it. Many years passed, and while I remembered it, years went by before I saw it again. Some years ago back in high school, friends and I were discussing it and we all reminisced about how much we had enjoyed it as kids. So, we decided we had to see it again and dashed out to rent it. What a surprise! It was like seeing it for the first time again, only this time it was even better! It was so amazing and so hysterically funny that we had tears in our eyes from laughing so hard. From that day on, it was added to my 'favourite films' list and every year that passes I love it more. I own it on VHS, DVD, and now wonderfully on the brand new Special Edition DVD. Out of all the various films I own on VHS and DVD, The Princess Bride is the only film I own three copies of. Now, THAT's dedication! ;-) I have to say the regular DVD edition from last year was sadly disappointing. It only has a chapter search, original theatrical trailer, and the film on it. So, if you haven't purchased this film on DVD yet, I highly recommend the Special Edition version which arrived September 4, 2001. It is exactly what I have always wished for, full feature commentary, actor interviews, ""making of"" featurettes, etc.This film is an amazing classic, a film I feel that is generally enjoyed even more by adults than children. That is certainly the case for my own generation that remembers it from childhood as well as adulthood. With it's satirical comedy, witty romance, and high adventure, for me this film ranks high with other classics such as Breakfast at Tiffany's, Rear Window, and Notting Hill, which are some of my other favourites. Not to mention some of the most spectacular scenery. For many years after so many viewings I thought that the Cliffs of Insanity scenes were filmed on the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland. I am happy to report that with the Special Edition DVD this confirms my belief as correct! I realize that some scenes were shot on a set, but mostly they really did film it on the Cliffs of Moher. I have been to the Cliffs of Moher, and they are even more breathtaking in person than on film. For anyone who hasn't been there, the Cliffs of Moher (pronounced ""More"") are 700 ft cliffs that drop off sharply into the Atlantic ocean off of the coast of County Clare in the West coast of Ireland. Ireland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and the wonderful scenery this country provides really adds to the ambiance of the film.Anyone who enjoyed this movie should definitely read the book this film is based on. It's a wonderful book and seeing the differences between William Goldman's book and his screenplay is fascinating.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better than a bottle of aspirin.,"I was sitting at home in a snowstorm with a fever, chills and a bit of nausea. Time to watch a movie - but which movie? I spied my copy of the Princess Bride I bought after getting my DVD a few months ago. The last time I saw this was several years ago on VHS at a friend's in monophonic. What a spectacular experience on my new Sony Trinitron with a good stereo sound system! The nuances of color are wonderful and the sound track impeccable.I have seen this movie several times over the years, and enjoy it just as much each time. How many movies can you say that of? Still, you don't want to wear it out. My suggestion is every home should have a copy of The Princess Bride, but save it for when someone is sick, just like the book in the movie. It sure made me feel better, even though I am a grown up.Rob Reiner and the rest of the crew deserve a lot of credit for this movie. It is one of those gems where everything seems to fall into place perfectly. Thank you!Evidently there is at least one cynic out there, though, who was not touched by this gentle fairy tale, which is ironic considering one of the greatest cynics of all worked on this movie: Norman Lear, creator of All in the Family. I agree with ""markwilson"" about Titanic; if I had to watch that when I was sick, I would probably shoot myself.

My only real problem with this movie ...,"... is that it is billed first and foremost as a children's movie.  I just purchased the movie and it comes in a children's clamshell cover and begins with previews of video tapes that might appeal to a two year old.Ok, it _is_ in fact, a fairy tale.  I buy that.  But the ending contains a sword fight which makes one as squirmish as anything in the movie Scream!  And the dialog is some of the wittiest I've heard from any movie, children's or not.  In fact, minus the bathroom humor, the Naked Gun series is much more child-oriented (and certainly more childish) than The Princess Bride.So what is The Princess Bride?  It's a witty, funny, entertaining fairy tale spoof, which never takes itself too seriously.  As most reviewers before me have already pointed out, the movie contains an over-abundance of quotable lines.  Unless you're almost dead, or all dead, you can't help but enjoy the dialog.What makes this film refreshing is that it's a true spoof of the fairy-tale genre, and succeeds as well or better as Airplane succeeds as being a spoof of hero movies, or as Scream succeeds as being a spoof of horror movies, or as Naked Gun (aka Police Squad) succeeds as being a spoof of police detective flicks.Some more quick points:  1) I don't know if you'll ever see a Cary Elwes performance as good as this. 2) The scenery is magnificent.  3) Robin Wright is a sight for sore eyes. 4) I think we're really due for a Princess Bride II.Oh know, I'm rhyming!Westley: You mean you wish to surrender to me?

The Princess Bride was indeed a priceless classic,"Wow. I must say, Rob Reiner did it again. What an entertaining, fun movie. I did not realize that it was Robin Wright's first major film. No wonder everyone fell in love with her. Her facial expressions were priceless. I would have to say, however that Mandy Patinkin stole the show. His acting skills are so brilliant. I believe he could portray any role however its difficulty. Also, I love it when he says, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" I dedicate this comment to ""Andre the Giant"" whom I loved as a kid growing up. I watched his ""fake"" wrestling matches with my friends, and we always were very supportive of him. I thought it was great that he got to make a film with such good actors. ""The Princess Bride"" is a timeless piece and has its humor as well as its intense moments. Now that's pure genius. Thank you to the writer of this great film. It will be a classic like ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Oliver"" and ""The Sound of Music,"" the musicals. Also, who can resist Cary Elwes? How easily he made his character come to life. He portrayed his character effortlessly. (You really went from bad to good, Sean Penn, when you left Madonna for Robin. Well done! She's a true beauty.

Beautiful yet scandalous,"Ancient formulas creatively mix with new elements.  In particular, the humor is wonderfully tasteful.  Overall, this is a darn good movie; I could go on for hours about it.Unfortunately, it's tainted with a some rather disturbing elements.  The movie closes out with a tasteless 80's-style love song.  (Viewers of ""The Hobbit"" know that adopting music popular to an era is the surest way to kill a classic soundtrack.)  Also, the sexism is disturbing.  Buttercup, complete with the cheesy name, can be forgiven as the typical ""bait chick"".  After all, as bait chicks go, she does have a few redeeming qualities and some individuality.  However, even with her excluded and the time period considered, the cast is disturbingly male-dominated.These offenses are not coincidental and hence inexcusable, but they shouldn't deter anyone from enjoying the film.

It contains the typical elements of a fairytale - the prince, the princess, a kingdom etc but with a different plot and a different way in how things are laid out.Of all the movies of I have seen, this is by far the most quotable one. It is loaded with quotes, most of them for bringing laughs but every now and then some wisdom pops up. For meme people: most quotes in this movie are meme-able. I've seen them everywhere.I almost never rewatch movies since I did not felt the need, but I've been on The Princess Bride over and over again to the point I can recall the plot and most of the lines in my head. A solid 10/10 from me, definitely would recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Possibly the most contemporary fairy tale that has already become a classic.,"Rob Reiner brings William Goldman's timeless story to life on the big screen, capturing and enhancing all its magic. Generations of parents who grew up watching this film have since shared it with their children, much like past generations shared the Grimms' Fairy Tales, adding it to the ever-expanding list of society's shared stories.One of its biggest strengths is the fantastic cast, with some of the best-cast characters ever, particularly André René Roussimoff as Fezzik who makes the character truly appear as a real giant. The relationship between the Cary Elwes and Robin Wright characters, Westley and Buttercup, is the emotional center of the film and has the power to win over even the biggest skeptics of romance.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"If I was stuck in a medieval love story, this would be the one","Witty, delightful, colorful, astounding, and endearing. For anyone who does not like this film, its clear you have nothing else to look forward to in life. Even after 15 years, I have yet to find a film that even closely resembles this classic. That's why it will have such staying power, a presence which one will remember and pass it on for others to see. The film was well cast, from Wallace Shawn to Billy Crystal, all the way down to Mandy Patinkin, Christopher Guest and Andre the Giant. Sadly, Cary Elwes proved to be his own demon by starring in some fairly horrid films after this feature, forever placing himself in the annals of B-stardom. Hopefully, this film does not fall into the doldrums of anonymity. If you haven't seen this film, go out and get the DVD. You won't regret it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True Family Entertainment!,"What can I say about this film? It is one of my all time favourites that has a truly superb cast mixing well know and established actors (Billy Crystal, Peter Cooke, Peter Falk) with at the time unknowns (Carey Elwes, Robin Wright). I watched this many times as a kid not appreciating various aspects but watching it now I realise how corny it is in places and that only adds to the films excellence, this film could not have been totally serious with Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Peter Cooke as the impressive Clergy Man. This is one the whole family can enjoy, either together or alone. Every so often a true Gem of a film comes along and this was one. If you have the misfortune not to have seen this film then I highly recommend it, if you have already seen it, I'm sure you love it and I urge you to watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical,"I first saw this film as a teenage girl and was instantly enchanted. Occasionally, things just GEL -writing, direction, music, casting- in a way that words cannot really describe. This was one of those movies.Goldman does a brilliant job of giving us a satirical fairy-tale that is not so heavy on ""satire"" that is steals the enchantment and romance. The swordfighting scenes are probably among the best that have ever been captured on film. The romance is beautiful (between two beautiful people; Mr. Elwes and Ms. Wright (now Wright-Penn) are, as director Rob Reiner describes them in his commentary, ""two of the better-looking people on the planet""). And, leaving aside our maturity and independence, what woman was not once a girl who daydreamed about falling in love with and being saved by a dashing hero and being given a kiss like the ones shared by our couple in this film? There are classics ""for their time"", and there are classics of all-time; this belongs in the all-time category.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Flick,"Once when I was in the Navy, I was on an extended deployment where we spent over 70 days at sea.  About 8 of us would watch a movie every evening--since we had over 200 titles on board we had an unofficial rule that we would never watch the same movie twice in a given 70 day patrol.  We also were 8 guys with several distinctly different tastes in movies so we took turns either picking the movie or enduring another's choice.  The night we first watched PRINCESS BRIDE, it was remarkable how each and every one of us had really loved that movie.  It was the ONLY movie that ever violated the once per patrol rule--we saw it once a week and enjoyed it more each time we saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I wanted to give this film an 11!,"This is my all time favourite movie.I first saw this as a 14 year old, and it has just been getting better and better with each viewing.

Inconceivable!,"Inconceivable! Funny ass movie, never gets old! 150% ClassicA mix of comedy, drama, action and adventure all wrapped into one movie.There are some corny scenes, but those will no doubt fly right over the heads of young viewers :PThen again... It was made in the 80s and they did not have the CGI back then that we have today.This movie is good in all the right places... it's a shame there are not more like it these days.If you liked this one I would suggest you try Robinhood Men In Tights played by the same lead actor.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another risky review but here we go.,"I hate to diss a beloved classic and I'm probably going to get hate for it but I really don't get it. I've never seen it as a kid so nostalgia is not helping. Since this is such a classic among my fellow nerds, highly praised and often quoted I thought it was time I watched it. But honestly I was bored halfway through and almost stopped right there and then. I could see the youngest kids maybe liking it (I could see not liking it when I was a kid, the same way I never really liked The Goonies). But a lot of kid movies these days have enough to keep adults interested as well. This just feels old, campy without the charm, clumsy, not really funny, and overall just ridiculous.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
All time classic,"Among my favorite movies. This has it all - action, romance, and comedy rolled into one masterfully woven package. All of the performances are exceptional and this certainly ranks among the few movies in the last 30 years that is perfectly cast. It has the feel of a spoof, which is no surprise with Rob Reiner at the helm. Yet at the same time it is very genuine and sincere.No other picture for me has such a plethora of infinitely quotable lines, and I still use many of them to this day. They always bring a smile to my face.I don't have anything negative to say about the Princess Bride - it has a wide appeal and with good reason. Enjoy with my warmest recommendations.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Top 5 Movie of All-time,"One of the film's greatest strengths is its ensemble cast, each member bringing their characters to life with unforgettable performances. Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, the vengeful swordsman on a quest to avenge his father's death, delivers some of the film's most iconic lines, particularly the famous, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" Patinkin's portrayal of Inigo is both intense and endearing, making him one of the most memorable characters in the film. Similarly, Wallace Shawn's portrayal of Vizzini, the self-proclaimed genius who constantly declares everything ""inconceivable,"" provides much of the film's comedic flair. Shawn's comedic timing is impeccable, and his scenes with Elwes and Patinkin are among the film's highlights. Andre the Giant, as the gentle giant Fezzik, rounds out the trio of lovable rogues who aid Westley in his quest. Despite his intimidating size, Andre brings a warmth and charm to Fezzik that makes him impossible not to love. Chris Sarandon's Prince Humperdinck and Christopher Guest's Count Rugen are equally effective as the film's villains. Humperdinck is both cowardly and conniving, while Rugen is cold and calculating, particularly in his scenes with Inigo Montoya. Together, they create a formidable opposition to Westley and his allies, adding tension and drama to the otherwise lighthearted narrative. Beyond its stellar cast, The Princess Bride excels in its script, written by William Goldman, who also authored the original novel. Goldman's screenplay is a masterclass in blending humor with heart, crafting dialogue that is both sharp and timeless. The film's wit and humor are laced with a subtle irony that allows it to poke fun at the traditional tropes of fairy tales, while still embracing them. Lines like, ""As you wish,"" and, ""Have fun storming the castle!"" have become iconic in popular culture, a testament to the film's enduring appeal. The film's visuals and production design also contribute to its fairy tale atmosphere. The scenic landscapes, from the Cliffs of Insanity to the Fire Swamp, provide a fantastical backdrop for the story's events. While the special effects may not be as advanced as those in modern films, they possess a charm and practicality that lend authenticity to the film's world. Coupled with Mark Knopfler's enchanting score, the movie's aesthetic perfectly complements its narrative. One of the most remarkable aspects of The Princess Bride is its ability to appeal to a wide range of audiences. Children can enjoy the adventure, the humor, and the fantastical elements, while adults can appreciate the film's wit, the romance, and the deeper themes of loyalty, revenge, and true love. The movie never takes itself too seriously, which allows it to balance its moments of humor and drama seamlessly. In conclusion, The Princess Bride is a perfect 10 out of 10. It stands as a testament to the power of storytelling, bringing together an exceptional cast, a sharp and witty script, and a timeless love story. The film's charm lies in its ability to transcend generations, offering something for everyone. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the fiftieth, The Princess Bride never fails to entertain, enchant, and inspire. It's a film that reminds us of the magic of cinema and the enduring power of love and adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most entertainig movies ever made. For the whole family,"I just wanted to say that this is one of my favorite movies. The grandiosity of this movie is in the story.

Almost fell asleep,"Watched this because of the raving reviews, and also because the torture machine scared me so much as an 8 year old that I turned off the movie, so I wanted to check how scary it really is.Ok so the torture scenes are not so scary now. I also admit that the movie does have its moments, and that some lines are funny and quotable.Overall though, I didn't enjoy it. The story is bland, the different parts seem rather disconnected, and the characters don't experience any growth and therefore feel flat and lifeless.What does this movie want to be? Epic, funny, quirky, scary? It did feel like a fairly random hodge-podge to me. As I'm writing this, I am reminded of the corncob scene in Troll 2. It's awkward, a little bid fascinating, and totally out of place. And my next thought is that Troll 2 is actually the better movie. It didn't take itself seriously at all, and I've found it to be entertaining, which unfortunately I cannot say about The Princess Bride.There, I compared TPB, one of the web's most beloved movies, with Troll 2, which a lot of people love to call out as the worst movie ever, and the latter came out on top.If you really want to watch this one, I'd suggest putting it on as a background movie while you're busy with something else.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is a film directed by a childlike director,"This is a funny movie, originally a childish fairy tale, but because of some childishness, the color of the joke has become cold, and the ridicule and cuteness that can be seen everywhere can't help but endure.The music inside is especially worth mentioning, it is very interesting, it adds a lot of color to the movie, you listen to music, you know the situation and urgency, the protagonist is impatient, etc.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Romance and High adventure,It is inconceivable how they could make such a good movie. This is one of those movies that the story is being told and periodically you are drawn back to the reader and listener to see what they think of the story.The reader is a grandfather played by Peter Falk and the grandson that is listening to the bedtime story is Fred Savage. Of course we are listening also.Watch the expressions on Prince Humperdinck's (Chris Sarandon) face as he gets foiled again. Exceptional good story and actors. Lots of mush and unexpected trials.See Peter Falk again with Cyndi Lauper in....Vibes (1988).,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inconceivably good fun!,"I have a fond spot for this movie. Its gentle humour and simple values (and perhaps offputting title) combine to make a movie that just keeps going and going.If you asked any person in the street to tell you what sort of film might star the diverse talents of Peter Falk, Fred Savage, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal and Peter Cook, they might have a hard time coming up with an answer. I can't think of a more varied cast for any film.If a film leaves you muttering some line of dialogue for days, or even weeks after you've watched it, then you know it must be pretty good. But when a film drags that same line out of you year after year after year, then you know it must be something special. You too will look incredulous when something goes wrong in your life and the word ""Inconceivable!"" will spring unbidden to your lips. Trust me, it happens.Princess Bride is an action comedy that must be seen to be believed. There are no flashy special effects, no CGI. Just simple, honest comedy and action.Strongly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not since ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has a movie been so quoted.  All the acting by previously unknown actors is superb, considering the budget the movie had.

One of the Best of the 80's,"The Princess Bride is a near-perfect fantasy/adventure/comedy, and one of the best films that the 1980's have to offer.  Based on a hilarious book by S. Morgenstern and scripted by William Goldman, Rob Reiner showcased a deft touch for directing material which required just the right tone to work. The casting made the film, IMHO.  Cary Elwes was a dashing Wesley, Robin Wright a beautiful Buttercup, Andre the Giant was born to play Fezzick.

"Imaginative Fun,","The Princess Bride is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific comedic cast. It's a fun, very imaginative film set in a fantasy world as a young man sets out to save his beloved princess. Rob Reiner brings this world to life very effectively and further displays his versatility as a director. I do not believe it would have worked out half as much without his involvement.However, I did find the plot itself light on any real excitement, it is far too dialogue heavy and did not move as quick as it should have. Films like Monty Python & The Holy Grail, which I am sure this movie took inspiration from, keeps its plot moving at all times, which is why I was bothered by how often this slowed down.The cast is top notch and enter in to the persona of these bizarre characters well, the likes of Cary Elwes, Robin Wright and Mandy Patinkin, as well as great cameos, such as an unforgettable few minutes with Billy Crystal, all come together to bring this eccentric universe to life.It did not hold back on its wacky characters and story, which I admired, it clearly never got any push from the studio to tone it down a little. Funny and with a top notch cast, The Princess Bride is worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy.A grandfather reads his sick grandson a story involving a young farm boy setting out to save a kidnapped princess.Best Performance: Mandy Patinkin",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
