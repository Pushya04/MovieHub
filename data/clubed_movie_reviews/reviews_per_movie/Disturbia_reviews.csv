The most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.,"Not expecting a masterpiece, I can honest say I was very pleasantly surprised at just how much fun I had watching this movie. While it clearly tries way too hard to be hip, and the staggering amount of product placement serves only to distract, the story serves its purpose of allowing DJ Caruso to pull every trick out of the book, to very satisfying effect.Shia LaBeouf just about gets by on his charm, but also hints at his ability as an actor, which was firmly cemented through his stunning performance in 'A Guide To Recoginzing Your Saints' last year. His character is nothing new, nor is his predicament, but he remains likable enough and it is hardly difficult to see why he is so taken by his new neighbour, played by the gorgeous Sarah Roemer.David Morse is appropriately creepy as the neighbourhood nut-job and Carrie Anne Moss, while given little to work with, is fine as LaBeouf's mother.The story unfolds well, and the red herrings serves to stretch the anticipation until the brutally tense finale. If you're looking for 90 minutes of unabashed, self-indulgent fun, you could do a lot worse than 'Disturbia'.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Terrific PG13 Horror thriller,"Disturbia is one of the best PG13 thrillers that I've seen in a long time. After all the other rated PG13 thrillers that have come out in the past six years or so, DJ Caruso, who directed, proves that it has always been possible to make a good suspenseful thriller these days without all the gore.Shia Labeouf plays Kale Brecht. After witnessing the death of his father in a car accident, he becomes sullen and withdrawn. This leads to him being put under house arrest after he punches out an unsympathetic teacher. Imprisoned in his own house, and unable to go beyond 100 yards, he finds himself turning into a peeping tom and spying on all the neighbors. One of them is the attractive new girl in town named Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and another may be a killer named Mr. Turner (David Morse). With the help of the new girl Ashley, his friend Ronnie (a great comedic turn by Aaron Yoo), Kale goes about investigating Mr. Turner to see if he is the killer or not. The three teenagers use cell phones and the internet as well as video cameras in the investigation, and DJ Caruso shows some of his sly wit by using these same devices in the film to not only investigate the spooky neighbor, but also to create some humor to go along with everything else.The plot is a familiar one. That would be because the great Alfred Hitchcock used it first with his famous suspense thriller Rear Window. Yes Disturbia is a blatant rip-off of that movie, but it is done with skill, and the acting by all, including Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mother, was very good. All the characters are likable, and David Morse's turn as the creepy Mr. Turner was well done as well.Disturbia may not be a great movie, but it is definitely one of the best PG13 thrillers in years. It outshines such horror thrillers as Cursed and Pulse, as well as the recent horror thriller The Messengers. Disturbia also once again proves that you don't need a bunch of gore to make an effective horror thriller. Horror directors take note.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
it could be called teenage version of rear window,"Although this movie is based on the plot of hitchcock's movie ""rear window'', it also has it's own merits and some of it's elements were surprising . It's catered to a teen audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Solid Thriller,"This movie was extremely well paced -- there was very good character development without excessive dialog. The story is exciting and thrilling: a modernized Rear Window. The acting was very solid, and every actor, major or minor, sold their part. Shia LeBeouf was a likable protagonist, Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job in her role as the mother, and David Morse played an exceedingly ominous and creepy neighbor. The climax is very suspenseful, although it did contain a few minor lapses in rational behavior by both the heroes and the villain, but I suppose that could be written off as desperation. Overall, it was refreshing to see a well-paced thriller with great suspense, humor, and character development.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A new introduction of a terrific story,"The first time I saw this preview, the first thought that came into my head was ""Oh, my God, how could they rip off Rear Window?"", Rear Window is one of my all time favorite movies. But my boyfriend and I had nothing better to do last week and decided to see it, I have to say that actually, it wasn't as bad as I expected, I have to admit that it was a pretty good re-introduction to one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked, despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window, it still was pretty clever.Kale has had a rough year, while driving his father back from their father/son fishing trip, they get into a horrible fatal car accident, the Father dies, but Kale is alive trying to deal with the guilt of what happened. But a teacher pushes him too far in his high school Spanish class and he hits the teacher, putting him on house arrest, he cannot leave outside his property. But he's in luck when a hot young girl moves next door, they quickly develop a peeping tom type of relationship, they spy on the neighbors, but when they see the neighbor across the street on a date, but the date ""never leaves the house"" and they want to prove him as a cold hearted murderer, but is he? You'll have to see this movie to find out.So Distubia was a pretty good movie, I would recommend it, although before you see it, I would highly recommend seeing Rear Window, but this was a good updated version that I'm sure you'll enjoy. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and will make you ask questions over and over again, those are always the thrillers that are worth seeing.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best thriller I've seen in a while.,"Disturbia tells the story of a teenage boy named Kale who is sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father. When his mother takes away his TV and his computer, he resorts to spying on the houses surrounding him. Things begin to get frightening when he begins to suspect one of his neighbours is a serial killer. He gets his friends involved with his impromptu investigation, and soon the neighbour realizes he's being watched...And he's not too happy about it. Disturbia is loosely based off the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, but it is still a film all in itself, and it is the best thriller I've seen in a while.What makes this movie better than most horror movies that are released today is that is doesn't rely on excessive gore and gross out tactics to frighten you. It relies on mood and suspense, and that works so much better. As the film went on, the tension got so high that I was literally on the edge of my seat rubbing my hands together because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next. I actually felt the adrenaline rush that the characters in the film must have been feeling when they were snooping around in the neighbour's garage. The movie has a realistic feel of how creepy it would be to have a serial killer living across the street from you and you had no way to prove it. Everything in this movie is done well. The writing, the directing, the way it all pans out. I was actually shocked when I left the theatre over how good this movie really was.The acting was very good from everybody involved. Shia LaBeouf has come a long way from Even Stevens. Something tells me that he has a nice career ahead of him. David Morse is perfectly sinister as the neighbour. He's just one of those actors that you might not know who he is to hear his name, but he pops up here and there and you always say, ""Cool, it's that guy."" Overall, this was an amazing thriller, and I'm glad I went to see it because I really wasn't expecting that much. It leads me to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump out absolute garbage like the Saw trilogy, Hostel, and Dead Silence when they could be making movies like this instead.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbing the Neighborhood,"This film is a call back to that 2005-2010 era of movies where they have something special about them, less CGI, less connected storylines, just a basic plot and some decent young acting.Disturbia is an entertaining movie that showcases Shia LaBeouf's acting skills and commitment in his roles. He is the main focus of this movie and he certainly holds it as well, the side characters are alright, but this is definitely a Shia Showcase!The plot of the movie is okay enough, nothing special happening, typical teenager thinks his neighbor is a killer and then proceeds to play detective and see if it is true type of story.All in all, this movie is worth watching or re-watching just for Shia alone, but the movie holds promise albeit letting some cliches hold it back. So strap in, make sure your seat belt is on and swerve into this guilty pleasure.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Coffee and donutsÂ…Disturbia,"I understand that the new movie Disturbia is about a person who is unable to leave his room and must look out the window for entertainment. During his peeping sessions, he finds that his neighbor might be a killer and by doing so, tries to get everyone around him to help find out the truth. That premise, and that premise alone, is the ONLY thing that likens this movie to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of tension and technical genius, Rear Window. Director D.J. Caruso has taken this script, no credit listed to the writers of that classic, and created a contemporary world around which he can create a cat and mouse chase from the small radius that our protagonist is allowed to travel within having a house arrest anklet affixed to his leg. If the critics are to be believed that this is a ripoff/remake, then every romantic comedy coming down the pipeline is one as well. Boy meets girl, boy must win girl, conflict causes relationship to stay strained, boy ultimately wins girl. Actually since every rom-com follows that exact plot sketch, they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a premise, updates it, and makes it his own.Worried that this might end up as another lame duck attempt from the director, I didn't have too lofty of expectations. I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, ever since his ""Even Stevens"" days, and knew he could give it credibility. Fortunately, after the highly disappointing Taking Lives and the ho-hum Two for the Money, it seems Caruso has come back to the form he had with his brilliant debut Salton Sea. Maybe it was the recent work on ""The Shield,"" but we have some nice grit, close-up composition, and stylish camera-work. The realism from Sea is back and Disturbia brings it all to make one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year. We have fantastic humorÂ—LaBeouf's delivery and everyman rapport lends to this wellÂ—as well as effective scares and edge of your seat suspense. This is a PG-13 movie that knows what it is and rather than titillate with coming as close to the line as possible, stays in check and deals out a healthy dose of mood and emotion rather than blood and sex. I'd even go as far as saying Sarah Roemer's girl-next-door is the most sensual role this year. It is all about her confidence and eyes, her body language makes it work, and you fall for her just as LaBeouf does, whereas the usual R-rated nudity and over the top craziness has been going so far as to numb audiences by doing what every film now does. Credit Caruso for showing restraint for everything and leading us along by uncovering pieces of the story only when we need to know them.Besides LaBeouf, Roemer, and a funny turn from Aaron Yoo, the main driving force here is David Morse. This gem of a character actor is at the top of his game as the villainous, did he or didn't he, neighborhood serial killer. He is good as the conflicted heavy who does wrong only when the world around him has forced him to, (like in Dancer in the Dark and Down in the Valley), but he is perfect as the all out creepy, sly-smiling force being accused of kidnapping and killing numerous women. Morse was allowed to run free and he took the opportunity and went even further with it. Where many suspense films like this would become laughable eventually, the realism brought out through LaBeouf and Morse keep the audience enthralled and interested in how everything will play out. I was never bored and at times actually wondering what would happen next because I was so caught up. When the climax comes, I actually was surprised thinking it was crazy that they would get us there so early, but I was just so into it that I didn't realize how much time had past.Disturbia is a genre film and won't be winning any awards any time soon. What it may lack in total originality it more than makes up for in mood and effective thrills. It had everything you could want from a movie without making you have to think too much. Sit down, go for the ride and walk out of the theatre with the knowledge that your time was well spent. D.J. Caruso, thank you for redeeming yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the better mystery thrillers,"'Disturbia' is a solid, entertaining thriller that does exactly what it says on the tin.

Disturbia,"I had seen the trailer of the movie and found it appealing. Later I found that it is somewhat similar to Rear Window Â– the Hitchcock movie and is on the same lines; that made me go and see this movie.It is the story of a young boy Kale (Shia LaBeouf) who is sentenced to 3 months of house arrest and finds ways to peep through his windows in neighbors' lives Â– one, the recently moved neighbor girl Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and another middle aged guy Mr.Turner (David Morse) who our young boy and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yo) suspects as a killer. Is Mr.Turner a killer? Or this is just paranoia of our young gang? The Director D.J.Caruso Â– who has specialized in crime thrillers in past 4-5 movies, does a very decent job in keeping the audience engrossed in the narrative and unfolds the story slowly and nicely. The movie presents many aspects of drama, and takes us through a ride of varied sub-plots with good interest. There are a couple of minor annoying scenes Â– like the love aspect (quite unnecessary I thought, but may be required for today's young audiences) and the usual clichÃ© of thriller movies. But overall the movie is entertaining.Shia LaBeouf is not a great actor, but does a decent job, so does the Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yo and David Morse.The camera work is excellent because it shows only that much which would make you eager to peep beyond the camera frame to see what is there Â– and that keeps you engaged. The music is okay.Yes, the movie is not close to the classic Rear Window, but I should say that I liked the movie.(Stars 6.75 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Millennial's entertaining version of ""Rear Window""","After hitting his Spanish teacher, seventeen year-old Kale (Shia Labouf) is sentenced to three months of house arrest and must wear an ankle bracelet to make sure he stays put.After Mom (Carrie Ann-Moss) literally cuts the cord to other forms of diversion, Kale begins watching his neighbors. The cute new girl (Sarah Roemer) that just moved in the house next door gets most of his attention, but Kale also begins to notice strange happenings at the nearby home of Mr. Turner (David Morse.)LaBouf's Kale doesn't quite measure up to the standard set by Jimmy Stewart so many years before and the frenetic pace of the film can be annoying. but ""Disturbia is still a somewhat entertaining re-telling of ""Rear Window"" complete with bathroom humor, close-up shots of female rear-ends, and the inevitable use of cell phones and personal computers as plot devices.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Boy and his Binoculars,"This statement will not make me very popular, but whatever. I think ""Rear Window"" is one of the most overrated movies of all times. I love the Master of Suspense, and worship practically all his movies, but not that one. Hence, I wasn't really in a hurry to see this post 2000 re-interpretation of the same story, despite the overall positive reviews ""Disturbia"" was receiving and despite the confidence I have in director D. J Caruso since ""The Salton Sea"".The film starts out overly melodramatic, with young protagonist Kale and his father getting involved in a tragic car accident after a delightful afternoon of bonding. The father dies, which turns Kale into an emotionally numb and rebellious teenager. After punching his Spanish teacher in the nose, Kale is sentenced to house arrest with an ankle bracelet. So, purely out of boredom, the boy develops a close friendship with a pair of binoculars and starts spying on his neighbors. There's the couple across the street who are involved in an affair, the gorgeous new neighbor girl who sits on her roof and goes into her pool with lovely bikinis, and the creep on the other side who mows his lawn every day and might just be the sadist serial killer whose crimes are all over the news.To be totally honest, ""Disturbia"" delivered everything I could hope for regarding this sort of thriller. It's fast-paced and compelling, with a skillful director in charge who knows exactly at what times there is a need for tension peaks, red herrings, fake jump scares, and even - quite surprising - a bit of grueling gore during the finale. Many sequences will be stretching out your suspension of disbelief, but it's very tolerable. Performances are good, from the younger cast as well as by the lovely Carrie-Anne Moss as desperate mother/widow, and by David Morse as the weirdo/potential killer.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Very Cool Teen Romantic Comedy/Drama...

Rear End Window,"I went to see this because of the advertised, ""Rear Window.""That film was an amazing experience for me. Hitchcock can be said to have invented the curious camera, the camera that moves and explores as if it were a character. It probes, it withdraws, it discovers. It ""finds"" the story. It only does in some of his films. Actually, for most of his career, he was merely a highly skilled craftsman. But then he developed this idea. With ""Rear Window"" he turned it all upside down. The camera could explore: the world had to be a stage that was composed before and for the camera.Its frozen noir. That film and ""Touch of Evil"" ended the ordinary noir period. Since then we can only reference it.Just because it is a kiddie film didn't phase me. These sometimes have the cleverest nuances, the most oblique perspectives.But oh, not here, not here. There's the slightest nod to ""Rear Window,"" updated via ""Blair Witch"" to have the film within be a genuine film.What we have instead is one of those irrelevant things about teen remoteness and improbable companionship. Onto that is spliced a modern horror bit, with a cabbage patch Hannibal. And only onto that dog's mess do we have the remnant of the fixed pane.Odd, because the serial killer notion often finds its way into films with a strong story, and this is embedded as a movie within, often a counter-noir where the killer and his opposite fight for control over fate, the shape of fate.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good!,"I didn't have high hopes for this film because it seemed like it was just going to be another predictable thriller.

That's a name that's going to be on everyone's lips by the end of the year after this one is followed by TRANSFORMERS. Very good and never over the top.Sarah Roemer -- She's hot. The role luckily didn't require much more from her.Carrie-Anne Moss -- Ehh. She should stick to The Matrix where emotion isn't part of her character. She really offered nothing to the film. In her only scene to really shine she performed dimly.David Morse -- Excellent through and through! Very creepy.CINEMATOGRAPHY: A+ Rogier Stoffers -- For a guy that usually works in comedy, he did a great job with the angles and movements.DIRECTION: A D.J. Caruso -- More used to episodic work but made the transition to feature very nicely.ART and SET DECORATION: A + + Attention to detail was always there.SOUND: A Very nice and steady.The movie started out with an incredible action scene put together by stunt coordinator Manny Perry and SFX Coordinator Darrell Pritchett that seemed as if to set the pace for the entire film. It did not, however. Instead the film began to lag for about 20 minutes before finally getting back on track and speeding to and end that we all knew was coming. Even when the scenes lacked any entertaining dialogue they were still pleasant to watch due to the incredible job of Direction and camera work.

Very fun and great in creating special summer feeling,"I've seen this movie a couple of days ago and it delivered exactly what I wanted to see: a relaxing and fun mystery movie in which some young people do detective business in their neighborhood. Relaxing relates to the first part of the movie while fun describes the whole experience.In the first half of the movie you get acquainted with main characters and the neighborhood they live in. I really enjoyed it since it set relaxing summer tone. Then there comes the second part where mysterious things start to happen. And that's what's so cool about this movie; it's always fun to see unexpected horrific events taking place in the regular setting, entering into and dwelling in ordinary, not being main occupation and starting point. Horror is thus subsumed in the tone set by the first part and gets its flavor from it.Furthermore, there's a linear progress in terror - it starts benign, builds slowly by adding more elements which raise suspicion and then suddenly bursts. This terror is not characterized by macabre tone or gruesome imagery but rather builds tension and makes things more mysterious until the very end.All in all, this is a very fun movie to watch in the evening by yourself or with friends!P.S. As I was writing this review, for some reason I just couldn't get another movie out of my head: The Goonies (1985) directed by Steven Spielberg.

Rear Window for teens,"Mid budget thriller fare and one of the better clones of a classic. This film upgrades for the tech world and often proves that updating films can be quite flawed. The simplistic style of Rear Window showcases the basics, Disturbia dials that to 11. Fun and aimed at a certain demographic, this suffers from an overly complicated storyline.

great Rear Window vibe,"While driving home from a fishing trip, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) gets into a car accident which kills his father.

Aaron is a great slacker friend. Sarah Roemer has a friendly sexiness. The trio has good chemistry together. David Morse is creepy as hell and the scene in the car with Roemer is hair raising. The ending runs on a little too long. I would have prefer not to spend more time in Turner's underground dungeon.

Not exactly disturbing....,"DJ Caruso's Disturbia is a rip-off at heart. It never plays that way, though, which is one of it's saving qualities. However, Hitchcock's Rear Window is definitely the inspiration here. It's a great idea. Unfortunately, this version couldn't quite seem to decide what genre it was.Shia Lebouf plays the lead guy, Kale. He witnesses his father's death in a car accident, and becomes withdrawn and sullen as a result. This attitude leads him to punch one of his teacher's in the face, which lands him under house arrest. He can only go 100 hundred feet from his house, or the police will be there in seconds. Soon, he finds himself becoming a peeping tom on all his neighbors, including new neighborhood hottie Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and possibly homicidal neighbor Mr. Turner. This is where the movie gets a little confused. For about the first hour and a half, it can't seem to figure out whether it's a horror, comedy, or even possibly a romance. Some of the drama that occurs between Kale and his new girlfriend Ashley is downright stupid. On the other hand, though, when it gets to the horror parts, it does it superbly. The comedy pretty much stays intermixed throughout, which is odd. That's kind of how I would describe the entire movie.Shia Lebouf does do a fine job of acting. He proves himself better with every movie he's in. Sarah Roemer also actually does an excellent job with her easily over-played part. The always dependable David Morse also is sufficiently terrifying as the killer next door neighbor.So really, Disturbia is not awful. Most of it's elements are very well played out.

a guilty pleasure of mine my all time favorite mystery thriller,"I admit this is guilty pleasure of mine, Disturbia is my all time favorite Shia LaBeouf film. Probably his only best movie he did before he went and stared in The Transformers trilogy. I love this movie to death, I got this movie this Thursday on Blu-ray disc that I have I bought and I watch it next day and I had a really fun. I really love this movie and it is a good mystery thriller movie. Sadly it is not a horror movie and it is rated PG-13 movie not R to bad. So sadly it is not scary enough but it is thrilled and it is suspense with fast paced. Do I think it is the best film or the greatest one? Of course not but is not a bad movie it is an entertaining mystery film that keeps you guessing what will happen next.This movie is partly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. I know also there were 2 movies in the 90's that also come out: Rear Window (1998) with Christopher Reeve and of course The Darklings (1999) with Suzanne Somers I watched that movie in 2003 and Rear Window with Christopher Reeve I have seen long time ago after he did. I am big fan of Christopher Reeve and I really miss him. I will re watch that movie again, but I can't find The Darklings (1999) anywhere on the net.*Even on this quiet three-lined street, no one is safe...especially from the savage killer next door. Welcome to Disturbia, a cool thriller with big scares.""Living under three months house arrest, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf, Transformers)passes his days spying on the neighbors. It's all fun and games until things take a horrifying turn for the worse. Kale is convinced his neighbor next door is a serial killer- but he can't prove anything, can't convince anyone and can't leave his house without triggering an alarm. Enlisting the help oh his good friends. Kale is determined to expose the truth - but have they all taken on more than they bargained for with a cold blooded murderer on the loose? With nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, Kale and his friends are in a race for their lives in this electrifying thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Shia LaBeouf turns in a terrific pulse pending performance, the cast also includes David Morse, Sarah Roemer and Carrie-Anne Moss in this film. I love the cast in this movie beside Shia LaBeouf, here is Carrie-Anne Moss the hot sexy babe from The Matrix who play's Kale's mom awesome. Sarah Roemer as Ashley (Kale's neighbor) is one hot sexy hot chick and really awesome. David Morse is terrific as the villain serial killer.I love everything about this movie the story about a high school student who loses his dad in a car accident and he attacks his Spanish teacher and he get's 3 month house arrest. When he starts spy's on his neighbors out of boredom he finds a shocking truth about his neighbor Robert Turner (David Morse) that he is am actual serial killer. This movie has also a good soundtracks like are: Louque - Whoa now and Taper Jean Girl by Kings of Leon I like these two soundtracks they are good.I love the chemistry between Kale and Ashley and I just love this movie to death! On the end of the film was really creepy when Kale found skeletons of the body's. I have enjoy this movie it is really a guilty pleasure of mine I only wish it would be a horror movie that is why I didn't give a 10 but I give this movie B+ 7/10 it is really a good movie I recommended it.Disturbia is a 2007 American horror thriller film directed by D.

There was a boom mic in EVERY SINGLE SHOT,"I have to get that (see title) out of the way up front. I have never seen such an incredible proliferation of visible boom microphones in any other movie. Seriously, there was a microphone visible somewhere at the top of the screen for almost the entire length of the film. At some points in the movie, more than one microphone could be seen at a time. I understand that things slip through the editing process but this was just ridiculous.The movie itself was not too bad. I was a little put off about twenty minutes into the movie when it suddenly dawned on me that I was basically watching a reworking of Rear Window but who really expects anything original from a movie, these days?. As far as teen idol vehicles go, I think Disturbia was slightly better than most. The beginning of the movie was beautifully shot and paced with a very convincing father-son dynamic. I actually felt the bond between the characters. Shia LaBeouf seems to be a decent actor and Carrie-Anne Moss's mother character was one of the most realistic I've ever seen in this type of movie; she was neither an overbearing troll nor a doormat for her son. Aaron Yoo's Ronnie was great comic relief and the kind of friend a lot of us have had (or have ourselves been to others). All in all, I think the casting was done well and the actors all turned in decent performances, with David Morse's Turner standing out the most.Unlike the other review I just read, I don't think the pacing in this movie was all that good. There were huge blocks of what I like to call ""nothing"". I guess if you're a seventeen year old male, you'll enjoy the 65% of the movie that is spent watching Kale's new female neighbor through binoculars, but to me it just seemed to slow down the film. There was a little action in the beginning, a huge stretch of watching a girl swim, then a massive rush of violence at the end of the flick. I think Disturbia would benefit from a few less minutes of swimming neighbors and Hostess products towers (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie).I gave this movie a six because, despite what I said above and the constant presence of boom mics, this movie actually got my heart racing once or twice and the acting was quite good. If you like murder mysteries and/or teen-oriented movies, this one is worth a watch on some Sunday afternoon.Seriously, though, there's a microphone in nearly every shot.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Rear Window for the Xbox generation,"Now this is an example of why we all like Shia Labeouf. He just plays it all very naturally. The nice thing is all his co-stars do as well.

It's got nice performances by the lead and the supporting actors. David Morse certainly pulls off the cold and calculating freak next door well. Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer do a good job as Shia's friends. This movie also does a nice examination on the subject of voyeurism. Hopefully Hitchcock would be proud.My complaints to this film, I feel are minor. Such as some clichÃ©d character actions, and a few cheesy lines of dialogue here and there.

Good Thriller,"Disturbia stars Shia LaBeouf as an incapacitated voyeur who comes to believe there is a murderer in his neighborhood. LaBeouf (Kale), a hot-tempered high-school kid who punches his Spanish teacher and is forced to spend his summer under house arrest, wearing an ankle-bracelet that alerts police when he strays more than a few feet from his front door. The self-pitying Kale wallows in the distractions of iPods, video games and digital cable until his angry mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) cuts him off from all things electrical.Disturbia then turns into a throwback to typical late 80/90's stalker films where the suspense is brought into over the top suspension of disbelief.

He and his two friends Ronnie and Ashley really complement each other. They act as teenagers, discovering/obsessing over the opposite sex all while in the vicinity of their neighbourhood - while the town was gripped in the deaths of missing young women.The level of excitement is a bit like the movie Foul Play starring Goldie Hawn..

"Typical Hollywood fluff, but you could do worse . . .","All right, so this is your typical Hollywood thriller of today, fluffy with teen angst and all that stuff. It borrows heavily from the better thrillers of yesteryear, most notably Silence of the Lambs and Rear Window. Obviously. Nevertheless, it does have some great elements. Although the story is simple and rather predictable at times, also unbelievable, it's a good enough ride for an hour and a half. The acting from Shia Lebouf and Carrie Anne Moss is the better side of the film along with Lebouf's friend in the film, Ronnie.I saw it for free. I think it would make for a good summer matinÃ©e at the dollar theater. But I wouldn't pay top dollar at an AMC to see it. I felt there were some decent scares, but your typical stuff. The opening scenes were perhaps the best and most shocking. I think it put me in the right mood for the rest of the film. There were also some great comedic moments which lightened up much of the film.Ultimately, I was satisfied but I'm not saying it's worthy of awards or major box office receipts. Just maybe a matinÃ©e or a dollar cinema. It'll make a good stormy Saturday night rental in the summer.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
updated version of Rear Window for the young crowd,"Strictly speaking, this isn't a remake of Hitchcock's fabulous Rear Window; rather, it takes the same basic idea and runs with it.In Disturbia, a young man, Kale, (Shia LaBeouf) under house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher, is bored out of his mind and starts spying on his neighbors. He becomes convinced that one of them (David Morse) is a murderer.Where Hitchcock depended on building suspense, Disturbia uses action for both humor and thriller elements. Kale figures out just how far he can go before his ankle device goes from green to red, meaning the police show up, and this becomes important to the story.His friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) does Kale's leg work (i.e., breaking and entering and rifling through the neighbor's car). Kale also makes use of a webcam.The love interest here is the pretty Sarah Roemer, another neighbor Kale spied on.Disturbia has some very exciting scenes and some fun ones, and because it's based on a solid story, it holds interest. The young characters are familiar and likable to anyone who deals with teens, and the acting is very natural. As the suspected neighbor, David Morse, who used to play good guys, makes a very effective sinister neighbor.I really liked this film and I highly recommend it. It wasn't made for my age bracket but nonetheless, I found it very entertaining and well done.Don't make the mistake of comparing it with Hitchcock. There was only one Hitchcock, and this is very different.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Oh my god, you've made the tower of Twinkie! Is that in a stalker's handbook somewhere?","As the all mighty great and powerful Hollywood continued to mine ""Hitchcock's"" works for inspiration, they landed upon the idea of re-imaging ""Rear Window"" for a modern audience. Directed by D.J. Caruso, Disturbia actually turns out to be a solid suspense thriller. The first half of the pic is all jocular with hormonal character introductions that come with giggly slices of humour, and then there's the big shift to the thriller that most viewers were expecting, as the makers manage to pull it off with a great final act that is edge of the seat viewing.There's nothing new on offer here, the formula has been (and will for ever more be) done a zillion times, but the two fold splicing of genres works well and the makers aren't trying to fool anyone with their approach work. Cast are fine, Shia LaBeouf's follows on from his enjoyable turn in ""Transformers"" with this pleasing on the eye show, he shows signs of some good acting chops around some rougher edges. Sarah Roemer is solid enough, and nails down that teen love interest characterisation, whilst Carrie-Anne Moss puts a bit of meat onto the adult bones of the Mother character.Unfortunately, in what is one of the key roles, David Morse is underused, he does OK with what he has to work with, and convinces in a two layer role, but one feels his talent doesn't quite come to the fore here. Still, it's a minor complaint, for this is a solid genre entry with both halves of the film never less than entertaining - even if you might find yourself yearning for some ""Hitchcock"" genius afterwards. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Stylish and well done,"There have been inevitable comparisons to Hitchcock's Rear Window, and there are those who call Disturbia a rip off of the Hitchcock classic. While I personally wouldn't go as far to say that, I can see some uncanny similarities. If I were to compare the two, I think Rear Window is a masterpiece, but I liked this very much and feel that it may perhaps appeal more to some.I do think though Disturbia does have a slow start with not a lot standing out really. However when it gets going, it does get very suspenseful and the rest up to the exciting finale is an entertaining mix of suspense, thrills, mystery and comedy. The story may have its predictable twists and turns and the odd crack but overall it is entertaining and slow start aside well-structured and slickly paced.Visually Disturbia is stylish, with some nice shots and lighting which add to the atmosphere and great sets and location shooting, the direction is taut and the dialogue is on the whole witty. The acting is fine, Shia LaBoeuf and Sara Roehmmer are likable in the lead roles and show a good chemistry. Carrie Ann-Moss is also good, though I would have liked to have seen more of her, but David Morse in a shy, quiet yet altogether sinister performance is the one who steals the show.Overall, a stylish and well done film and worth the watch. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Entertaining and successful film about a teenager is placed under house arrest, he then begins spying on his neighbors.","Following the death of his father (Matt Craven) in a violent car accident, Kale's character (Shia LaBeouf) changes completely and he becomes a silent, unsociable, withdrawn and disturbed boy. Because of a rebellion at his school, the judge sentences him to house arrest. Kale is locked in his home, where he lives along his mother (Carrie-Ann Moss). Bored, Kale watches his neighborhood with binoculars, including his attractive new neighbor Ashley Carlson (Sarah Roemer), and Robert Turner (David Morse), a solitary man. Every killer lives next door to someone !. Welcome to...The quieter the street, the darker the secrets....DJ Caruso's fourth film inevitably reminds us ""Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window"", although this time the protagonists are teenagers and are supported by new technologies. 'Disturbia' is rife with sub-plots, dynamic action, tense, peppered with humor and teen romance. This is an agreeable and also some hilarious picture that has a memorable scene after another, and was one of the main films made by D. J. Caruso for DreamWorks (Jerry Katzemberg , David Geffen, Steven Spielberg) . This charming as well as inventive mystery movie contains enjoyable intrigue, surprising situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The first part of this production is slow and artificial; however, the rest of this suspense picture takes off at high speed with continuous twisted events, surprises and noisy action . Well produced by DreamWorks, the copyright holders of Cornell Woolrich's short story 'It Had to Be Murder', which Rear Window (1954) was based on, sued DreamWorks, Paramount Pictures, and Steven Spielberg for using the story without permission.Disturbia was filmed on location in the cities of Whittier, California and Pasadena, California, shot by cameraman Rogier Stoffers. Along with intriguing and suspenseful musical score by composer Geoff Zanelli. This motion picture was adequately and professionally directed by D. J. Caruso . He is a good craftsman whose films often have intense car crashes , and he has directed successful films , such as : Taking lives (2004) , Disturbia (2007), The Eagle eye (2008) , Standing up (2013), XXX Reactivated (2017) , Shut in (2022) and Reedeming love (2022) .

What kind of clown names their kid Kale??,"But seriously, aside from the RIDICULOUS name given to Shia LaBeouf's character, this is a pretty capable reworking of Hitchcock's movie Rear Window.Shia plays his usual charismatic, affable, ever-so-slightly-nerdy-and-awkward style well here, Sarah Roemer is decent enough to make her Ashley more than just ""the hot girl next door"", and Carrie Anne Moss is...there? She really could have been replaced by almost anyone because she's barely there.David Morse, however, is the real star for me. Even though his character is absolutely nothing remarkable, and doesn't distinguish himself at all from the dozens upon dozens of similar villains in similar movies, there's just something about David Morse himself that always gets me invested.All that being said, it IS a capable movie, but it's not a Must Watch.

There's no SF-scenes or some great effects(i'm sick of all that). It's just great action. But there are some things which bothered me, such as the fights between Turner and the kid. The kid wins every time. How can he beat a guy like Turner? And Turner did not killed kid's mother when he had the chance. That's a bit strange.

teenager on house arrest winds up finding some very creative things to do,"I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a very well done movie from start to finish. The movie itself is actually a remake of theHitchcock classic ""rear window"" but it has definitely been modernized but in a fun way.The main character winds up under house arrest with a high tech sensor attached to his leg which literally doesn't allow him to be more than a few more feet from the house without there being serious consequences. The nice part about this movie is that the script is really polished nicely from beginning to end. Once the main character starts off being under house arrest the fun begins. He is told to be very creative with his time, and even though he has his TV and computer games taken away from him he winds up having to use the environment around him to keep himself amused. This is where the well done script kicks into high gear with the other characters being well developed into action, each helping to make the story more interesting. Mainly the different characters help to make up different types of suspense which make it a top notch thriller. Even the ""girl next door"" who turns into his love interest develops in a nice realistic fashion. The best part about this movie is that the script is developed in such a professional manner that it just keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how things are going to turn out. Probably the best part of this movie is that it is totally worth watching, because the director did such a good job and the actors did such a great job.

Too Predictable,"Overall the movie Disturbia was pretty good. The choice of actors was great and the storyline was even better. The only problem that I had with this movie was the fact that it was too predictable. You knew every time what was coming next so you weren't surprised when it happened. There should have been some kind of twist in it. They should have had the killer be someone you wouldn't expect because once you knew, the suspense was gone. It would have been a little more interesting that way. I wouldn't consider this movie a horror movie either but more of a teen love movie.

If I had to rate this movie I would have to give it a 6 out 10.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Interesting, but it takes the (very) easy way out.","An intriguing premise is a must for any good thriller. Whatever bizarre set of rules or restrictions the film can set on it's protagonist, as long as they aren't outright ridiculous, can propel him/her/them on a wild ride. ""Disturbia"" starts like that with a great opening act that sets up an interesting situation: a housebound high schooler is convinced that his neighbor is a serial killer. He is on probation and on house arrest so he gets his friend and another neighbor to help him investigate. Obviously this is virtually a remake on the Hitchcock classic ""Rear Window,"" but the fresh setting and reworked scenario make way for some great suspense as doubts about characters and situations are teasingly probed along the way.However, this clever and tense setup leads to a tense, but highly dull overdone conclusion. Thus, the set up is reworked, but the end is all the same, but with more violence than Hitchcock ever showed. All doubts are simply erased and the characters and situations suddenly become black and white. It's a shame that a film goes through obvious and noble attempts at showing something new, but then reverts back to the same old clichÃ© for the end. It would have been better the other way around with a clichÃ©d start and an unexpected and unpredictable ending. That way there would have been a good pay-off.

"Disturbia, unfortunately, seems far too outdated.","This is a tough one to review. On the one side I remember really enjoying this as a smart little teen thriller back in my youth. Re-watching it now, it's far too clichÃ©d and problematic to withstand any real thrills. Do I score this based on the time it was released, or how badly it's dated? We shall see. A grieving and troublesome boy is put under house arrest where he lives his daily routine by spying on his neighbours, a new girl on the block on one side and a potential serial killer on the other. You could class this as a modernised version of Hitchcock's famous 'Rear Window', it does indeed pay homage to this in a few subtle ways. The slow build up of suspense and tension is well crafted, much like 'Rear Window'. The first half is focussed purely on building up the protagonist, the second then descends into thriller territory. Do the two marinate? Not consistently. It does feel like you are watching two different films. A comedic light hearted teen flick then contrasts with a dark suspenseful thriller. I understand why, to show that any neighbourhood no matter how pleasant the exterior seems does indeed hold ominous secrets. In this case, a murdering psychopath. Separately these two halves work really well and are thoroughly enjoyable, although filled with mediocrity. They just don't blend together. Shia LaBeouf actually gives a decent lead performance. David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss needed way more screen time, although the former was very menacing. Unfortunately, director DJ Caruso was too focussed on filming Sarah Roemer's ass and having fans blow into the actor's faces just to blissfully move their hair in a gentle breeze to care about the technical aspects of the film. The cheap alt-rock soundtrack, the forced romance which amounts to nothing in the final act and lack of character development. The whole film felt mediocre, but still pleasantly enjoyable. It's a weird one this, but I'm in a good mood so will grant it with the higher score. Entertaining but far too many flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Maybe not original, but highly entertaining","Disturbia follows the well trodden feet of its genre, but provides a high entertaining, engrossing and non cheesy example of how to do this movie right.The premise of the movies follows Kale who having recently lost his father goes off the rails and assaults his teacher. This leads to him being put under house arrest, electronically tagged that sound an alarm if he leaves the boundaries of his home. What follows is Kale's obsession in watching his neighbours day after day. Whilst following close attention to a hot new girl who just moved in next door, his sights are drawn to a middle aged guy, who after seeing a news report on a serial killer Kale is convinced he fits the profile.This one really surprised me. Without giving spoilers this type of movie, that was all the rage, in the 90s and the early 00s, rarely interested me. However the subtly of this movie elevated it from the pointless serial killer type movies we all seen before. That being said the opening scene was completely pointless. It seemed like they had a budget and wanted to use it, because a action car crash, didn't seem in-keeping with the rest of the movie and wasn't at all necessary as there are no call backs to it.The acting here by a young Shia LeBeouf is a at a career high. All of the supplementary actors are so-so, whist they are not bad at all we really could have had any of them replaced without any detriment to the overall presentation. That being said David Morse was chilling at times. LeBeouf less replaceable here, he put in a real shift here as a believable teen who becomes obsessed by his environment and neighbours.Whilst the concept of the movie is not 100% original (what is) the execution is very good and high entertaining. The direction of the movie is excellent and the suspense is well executed, particularly as the movie progresses to a climax. The soundtrack is different. A range of indie and rock and very 90s, however for the most part the songs are well chosen for the vibe they were going for.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good,"Really good version of Rear Window where a kid on house arrest realizes that his neighbor is a serial killer.While not scary as such (you can pretty much guess where this is going to go because it is by the numbers) this is a nice thrill ride that will keep you watching to the end. You like the kid and his friends and can sympathize with his plight. If there is a flaw its that the film could almost be a well made TV movie, there really is no reason this needed to be seen on the big screen (other than the attention a genuinely good thriller would attract). Still this is worth seeing though I'd wait for a bargain matinÃ©e or a rental on a rainy Saturday night once it comes out on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hichcock Goes Teen,"I was disappointed by this film as I was expecting a solid thriller and got a disposable teen, comedy, thriller with indie soundtrack chucked in.That aside, it was a solid enough film that keeps your attention but not a film I would pay money to see.One thing that concerned me about the movie was the bit were Kale tells Ashley that she's a conformist after she set up a house party.This coming from a guy with a 60 gig iPod, iTunes subscription, XBox Live subscription, what seems to be a PSP, a quality mobile phone, video cameras, flat screen TV's and a huge poster of London Calling by the Clash on his wall.Talk about the Pot calling the kettle Black.Anyway, not much good about this film except for Shia LaBeouf (Kale)who had some great one liners and was the only person who could act in this film.He's got a good chance of being the next Toby McGuire.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Contemporary Rear Window,"""Rear Window"" for the 21st century with Shia LeBeouf in the Jimmy Stewart role, here instead of being in traction, under house arrest and forced to occupy his time covertly spying on his neighbours. His hot single mother Carrie-Anne Moss strikes up a budding romance with neighbour David Morse, but LeBeouf is convinced he's been piling up the bodies somewhere in his house.Aaron Yoo has an hilarious role as LeBeouf's sidekick who accompanies him on an ill-fated inspection of Morse's house, while Sarah Roemer plays the Grace Kelly part as an attractive neighbour with whom LeBeouf becomes smitten.There's a solid shock climax that was a bit of a surprise, something to elevate the film from a PG status to an R in just a few frames. Without spoiling the surprise, it's worth the wait. As far as remakes go, this one is pretty decent, doesn't stray from the core content, while every character counts in an economically well-paced plot that gains momentum toward a rousing finale. If you had to remake a classic film in contemporary style, this is a reasonable blueprint.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbia,"Review: The movie was disappointing because the atmosphere wasn't strong enough especially the suspense and tension. Shia La Beouf performed brilliantly but not as well as Morse because you would forget that he was acting. I didn't like the way the film was directed because it didn't drag a strong ingredient from the original picture (Rare Window) that could capture you. The soundtrack was quite poor and I thought the film was just aimed at teenagers because of it themes and the Western culture. The movie didn't focus strongly on other themes like investigation, the main character's upbringing or deeply how the next door serial Killer's motive or reason on slaying people. Instead the film focused too much on teenagers and how they live their lives in the Western culture. Robert Turner played by Morse portrayed his role in a sinister way but he could of performed a lot better because of his potential. I give the picture a 4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Love it!,"I really like this movie. I've watched it several times during the years since it came out. Good acting, good concept, good pace. A fun thriller to watch on a rainy day. If you've never watched it, give it a shot! Even though the technology has changed a lot since it came out it still works. I think the concept of the neighbor is and always will work. Do we really know our neighbors? Are they what they appear? It's scary and interesting to watch (and think about). I think this movie is great. Highly recommended!!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The boom should have gotten top billing!,"I saw it last night, and as far as these sorts of movies go it wasn't bad. It was quite sweet and funny in parts and had a few moments that weren't completely obvious and clichÃ©d. Of course then there was the rest of it. The acting was good, but the one thing i could NOT get past was the boom in the top of the frame! It's basically a main star at the beginning of the film, then it makes a comeback toward the end! How hard is it to find some footage where you can't see the boom in the shot? it was ridiculous and quite put me off. It was like i was watching an amateur film! Re-shoot or re-edit.

Definitely one of the best thrillers in film history.,"What a movie! My God! This has got to be the best thriller I've seen in years, and maybe the best thriller ever? Dare I say it? Yes I do: to me, Disturbia is the best thriller there ever was. It totally blew me away! I was actually stunned when the credits appeared on the screen, and the first word I said afterward was ""Wow"". This movie is very impressive, definitely D.J. Caruso's best movie to date.To make a good thriller, the first thing you need is a good script, a good story. Then you need a good crew which consists of a qualified director and qualified producers to deal with that story. Finally, you have to look for the right cast. Disturbia has a great story, a great crew and a fantastic cast, and those things resulted in a unique film.The way D.J. Caruso can bring such tension and such excitement into this movie is absolutely amazing. He paid a lot of attention to the structure of the movie, and you can really notice that. The film evolves from an average teen movie into a suspenseful thriller which makes sure you don't blink during the whole second half of the movie. I went to see this movie because I heard it was good, but 'good' doesn't even come close to define this movie, 'incredible' would be more appropriate.I liked everything about this movie, but when I think about it, the thing that surprised me the most was the cast, especially Shia LaBeouf. He did great! Really, he did a very good job and proves to be a talented young actor. You could really admire him for this role. David Morse's performance is another honorable element on his respectable career, and also Carrie-Anne Moss deserves to be mentioned: she did good, as always.I recommend everyone to go and see this movie in theaters, you will NOT be disappointed. And although the so called critics say that it's a rip-off of Hitchcock's Rear Window, I can assure you: it's not. Yes, it has some elements that also occur in Rear Window and also in other movies, but Disturbia has got a whole different storyline. I guess some people just can't admit that not only Hitchcock could made great thrillers. Because that's what Disturbia is: one of the best thrillers in film history.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasantly Surprised,"Going into this movie I figured it was just the same stuff Hollywood puts out nowadays with mediocre acting and shallow plot lines. Although obviously this movie is a lot like Rear Window I don't think thats a bad thing. The acting was great, especially by David Morse. His performance was great. Most movies I have seen him in, like The Green Mile, his character was much different but he tackled this role and really had me believing he was a serial killer. The rest of the cast was a surprise as well, when I think Shia LaBeouf, I think Even Stevens. He played a great role though, and I enjoyed the witty comments. It was great. Nice Movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Does justice to Hitchcock's Rear Window - an excellent modern thriller!,"Like most serious horror fans, I'm not pleased by the way that the genre is being flooded by too many remakes! A modern re-imaging of Alfred Hitchcock's classic 'Rear Window' therefore didn't seem too promising on paper, but director D.J. Caruso has done an excellent job with this film! It takes all the things that made Rear Window a classic, adds in a modern twist and keeps the whole piece just different enough for Disturbia not to feel like a rip-off! Rather than a broken leg, our protagonist this time around is housebound via a modern means. After a family tragedy, Kale finds himself frustrated and angry, and a smart comment from his Spanish teacher ends up with the teacher on the floor and the Kale under house arrest, enforced by an electronic tag that puts an automatic call into the police station if he's more than 100 years away from his house for more than 10 seconds. Bored, he turns to the window, where he discovers sexy new neighbour Ashley...and something more sinister in the form of 'Mr Turner' - the next door neighbour whom Kale comes to believe may be a Texan serial killer...Disturbia is brought to life by an excellent cast, who all perform excellently in their respective roles. Shia LeBeouf is thoroughly likable in the central role; giving it a nice mix of angsty teenager and curious rogue. Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo fill out the other two young persons' roles nicely, while Carrie-Anne Moss convinces as the mother - and David Morse gives his best performance in years as the villain of the piece! Being more used to seeing him in more gentle roles in films such as The Green Mile, it's surprising to see just how well he fits into the bad guy role. Director D.J. Caruso, who previously made the less than brilliant Taking Lives, does a real good job of providing the thrills with Disturbia. The film works on two levels; on the one hand, it's a teen drama and on the other it's a thriller and these two elements mix brilliantly. At times, the tension is almost unbearable - and it's that which made Rear Window such a blast fifty three years earlier! Overall, this might not be completely original - but it's a great thriller in spite of that fact, and I'm sure it will appeal to most members of the audience. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspense-Free Hitchcock Rip-Off -- 100 Minutes of ZZZZ!,"It was a first rate rip-off they schemed at Dreamworks Pictures. Let's remake Hitchcock's Rear Window, but THIS TIME we'll make it a teen make-out flick, make the killer not just a wife murderer but a serial killer, toss in lots of Porky's style gawking and drooling, jazz it up with cell phones and computers; and we'll have the perfect movie for today's audiences, which at Dreamworks they assume are idiots. Idiots we are, unless the input of thousands of 10's is another studio-induced corruption of this website.This picture has no suspense whatever. It goes from one stupid and inept misconception to another. We always know what happens next; except... except at the climax. Here they combine a bunch of leftover rotting corpses with the action; until.....The final confrontation with the killer --- not to give anything away, but ---- the screen goes so dark that we have no clue what happens.The only redeeming entertainment value is I enjoyed watching Ashley, slender body, long hair, looking good! Somehow, though, there seem to be way too many 2007 movies where watching a pretty actress is the only thing the movie has going for it.REAR WINDOW was a classic 40 years ago and it still reaches an audience in 2007. It will still be a classic in 2057. DISTURBIA is a piece of trash and won't even be a bad memory in 4 months. We paid $1.35 to rent the DVD. That's 67.5 cents each.

Good Update,"Disturbia (2007)*** (out of 4)An updated version of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window has a troubled teen (Shia LaBeouf) put on house arrest and with nothing else to do he starts watching his neighbors when he think he sees one (David Morse) kill a woman. I don't think there's anyway to deny that this film was largely influenced by the Hitchcock movie and that includes the movies overall structure. As with the original movie, the director here takes his time building up to the suspense. The murder doesn't happen until the halfway point and the suspense really doesn't start until the final twenty minutes. The first part of the movie lets us get to know the characters and while it does go on a tad bit too long it pays off in the end. The character stuff also tends to be on the dumb teenager side but once the suspense gets going the film is a home run. LaBeouf and Sarah Roemer are good in their roles but it's Morse who really steals the film. I've always felt he was one of the most underrated and underseen character actors out there so it was nice that this film was a hit and allowed people to see him.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Tower of Twinkies,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director DJ Caruso lapses into the same thing here that prevented his ""Two For the Money"" from being better. The interaction between characters, including the exchange of dialogue, just doesn't flow naturally. We never escape the feeling that these are actors reading their lines.That said, this was a better film than expected. Sure, it is a blatant rip-off of Hitchcock's classic ""Rear Window"". The only things missing are a wheelchair (an electronic ankle monitor instead) and the fabulous wardrobe of Grace Kelly (replaced here by the tight jeans of Sarah Roemer). Of course, Jimmy Stewart's telephoto lens from the original has been given a high-tech face lift utilizing computers and digital movie cameras. Regardless of the changes, the story remains the same. Shia LaBeouf is a teenager under house arrest for slugging a teacher who asked for it. To prevent boredom, LaBeouf ""observes"" his neighbors and stumbles on what appears to be a very bad guy next door played by the eternally (and wrongfully) stereotyped David Morse. LaBeouf manages to draw a couple of others into his web, most notably his beautiful new neighbor (Roemer), who reads on the roof, dips in the pool and yogas in front of her open windows. In other words, a peepers best friend!Nothing to give away here because there are no real surprises. That is what's missing! How about a twist? Instead, every one in the movie is exactly as first presented to us. Where is the filmmaker sleight-of-hand? Where is the blind side? Those are the things that make a successful thriller. Still, LaBeouf shows some acting potential and could develop into a star if the vehicle is ever just right. Playing his mom here is the terrific Carrie-Anne Moss (""The Matrix""), but she is really given little to do. What I really wish is that someone would cast Mr. Morse in a role where he can really stretch a bit. The guy is a good actor but these days is relegated to playing the strong, silent bad guys. Whatever happened to ""St. Elsewhere""?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Reality without the tv,"I first saw Disturbia during its initial theatrical release in 2007. I was 18 at the time Disturbia came out, so D.J. Caruso's thriller rife with subplots including the anguish of coming-of-age and teen romance meant that I was part of the target audience. I enjoyed Disturbia a great deal in the theatre and bought the DVD soon after as one of the last Hollywood Video rental stores closed in my area. After not seeing Disturbia for a few years, I was nervous to revisit it, for fear that it would be one of those films I enjoyed once because it fit a particular time in my life that I wouldn't get much out of after more maturation. I can pleasantly affirm my love for Disturbia is just as strong today as it was when I sat in the theatre the first time I saw it. I suppose it makes sense that I enjoyed it, I'm a massive fan of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. In 2010, the copyright holder of the Cornell Woolrich story that Rear Window was based off of, sued producer Steven Spielberg and his film studio DreamWorks for infringement. The lawsuit was dismissed, as the courts rightly recognized that there is much more to Disturbia than simply a Rear Window rip-off. Though the same voyeuristic protagonist and a mystery exist in both, the existence of one far from hampers the other.After a summer fishing trip ends with 17-year-old Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) behind the wheel of the vehicle transporting he and his father back home when it crashes killing his father, he feels responsible for his death. Kale's entire demeanor changes after his father's death, understandably so. His violent outbursts and increased aggression have led him to a few run-ins with the law. Just before school lets out for summer, Kale is sleeping through his final classes when he is called upon by his Spanish teacher to dictate his summer plans. Unable to do so, the Spanish teacher becomes upset and implores Kale to assess what his father would think of the situation. Triggered by the implied disappointment his father would feel towards him, Kale unleashes his anger and punches his teacher. Given a lenient sentence of 3-months house arrest, Kale is stuck with his internet and video game subscription canceled, left with nothing to do but gaze at his neighborhood through his window. ""Reality without the tv"", as Kale calls it, is made all the more interesting when a beautiful young girl moves in next door. Determined to get to know her despite his spatial challenges, Kale charms the young girl enough that she begins to spend afternoons with him, giving him a welcome break from his only other visitor, his best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). Kale soon understands that his new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) has a depth and sense of mystery to her that he has not encountered with any of the girls at his school, making Ashley the perfect partner to investigate his standoffish and private neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse). Turner seems to fit the bill of a suspect police have been hunting believed to have killed multiple women. With little else to do but watch the comings and goings of his neighbors all day, Kale appoints himself as the prime investigator tasked to figure out if his neighbor is a cold-blooded killer.One thing I truly appreciate is when a director shows rather than tells his audience certain aspects of the plot. D.J. Caruso makes a brilliant directorial choice when he shows us the look on Kale's face as he makes his way to his father's side of the vehicle at the opening of the film. Seeing the shock and pain on Kale's face provides much more impact than the makeup and effects required to show a mangled body. The opening moments showing the fishing trip and its aftermath acted as a wonderful introduction to Kale and his personality before his loss and provided wonderful insight to Kale and his father's relationship. Each introduction to the nuances of the neighbors Kale sees from his room was exceptional, and just as uniquely descriptive as the ones in Rear WIndow which the scene brings to mind. The pacing and scares of the thriller side of the film were masterful adeptly creating the mood of intrigue. Shia LaBeouf has one of those yells that turns into a blood-curdling scream a bit too quickly for my liking, and his room was so large it was difficult to believe he couldn't find some new hobby to keep himself busy for the summer, but those complaints do little to detract from my enjoyment of the film. A tightly paced teen drama/mystery/thriller, Disturbia is compelling and a film that always provides a compelling ride with each revisit.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A pleasure to watch...Suspense,Thriller","Unlike, say, ""Smokin Aces"", ""Disturbia"" manages its elements well and it's a pleasure to watch. This is because DJ Caruso is an intelligent, effective guy who delivers. He's not the most inventive director out there but, and this is a compliment, ""Disturbia"" with someone more inventive directing, would have been another movieÂ…A worse movie.However, after some very disturbing (matches with the title) couple of scenes, Kale (Shia LaBeouf) finds himself in the situation of 'house arrest', which is not good for any teenager. The monotony is boring but well managed, with scenes like Kale marking his territory because, if he goes ten meters away from his house, a device he wears goes red and the police come running. Then Ronnie (Aaron Yo) comes along, and they discover Ashley (model turned actress Sarah Roemer), and they sense something wrong about a neighbor (David Morse)Â…And they start watching.Once this basic premise is established, things start flowing. More than once, the storyline turns repetitive, but we don't mind because ""Disturbia"" doesn't play games. Christopher Landon's story and his script alongside Carl Ellsworth don't take us for fools by surprising us unnecessarily, but they make sure we enjoy the ride. In other words, the film has no twist but justifies its killings and the amount of gore.This amount of gore, however, is a trick; because the scary thing is in the unexpected images and score (the prolific Geoff Zanelli), not in the visual blood. The movie is PG-13 but it generates more jumps than so many R rated stuff. Again, this is the director; and that's not the only thing he does well (false perception)Â…During one moment, everything is dark and a light is turned on; try to remember a moment like that and tell me if that's shot is not perfect. Also the sense of timeÂ…When a cop is walking down a hall and the killer is haunting someone, the cameras change several times, but they are both moving; because it is how it is and time in film shouldn't stop.Another thing that ""Disturbia"" excels at (and that's why it's better than good), which also has to do with false perception, is in not giving you what you want. If you are the kind of person that likes to guess what the next scene is like, ""Disturbia"" will mess with you, because when you're expecting something, it will put a cut to black and you won't have it; but you'll feel like the movie knew you were expecting it.I can't forget that the work of the cast is a big part of ""Disturbia's"" success. At this point, I still don't know if LaBeouf's talent is for real. But he is convincing, his voice is powerful and I respect him because he always gets to kiss some gorgeous women. Women like Sarah Roemer, who, for our luck, can act. And Aaron Yo is very funny; and Carrie Anne Moss, who plays LaBeouf's mom, is full of grace; and David Morse is one of the creepiest guys in cinema when he wants to...Guess what? In ""Disturbia"" he really wants to.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do NOT watch the trailer before watching the movie,"Because it's a case of the trailer basically telling you the whole plot which is very bad especially in the case of a thriller. In case you didn't know, this is a remake with modern technological trappings (cell phone, hand-held camera, computer, etc) of an old 1954 Hitchcock thriller called Rear Window. I haven't seen the original so cannot compare. I found Disturbia to be a good little teen movie/suspense thriller, little in terms of scope and surprises. Yes for me, it was a bit predictable even though I didn't watch the trailer. The concept of the guy under house arrest spying on his neighbours to pass the time and potentially discovering something disturbing is somewhat interesting but didn't feel fully exploited. The first third of the movie is fun and is more like a teen movie about a boy being grounded all summer. It grounds the characters and the restricted setting.Shia LaBeouf is very good playing an average ordinary joe as he usually is. The second third of the movie starts being more suspenseful as clues point towards one of the neighbours being a potential serial killer unless it's just the teen being paranoid (the french title of the film is Paranoiak btw). The third act I cannot speak about too much, unless to say the trailer reveals way too much. For a suspense, I cannot say I was ever truly afraid although I was surprised a couple of times. I fear Disturbia might have been slightly overrated because it was a surprise commercial success. Box office gross is unfortunately too often associated with movie quality. I did like Disturbia but I was underwhelmed. I would say it's worth a rental but not a purchase because I doubt you'd find it disturbing or intriguing enough to watch twice.Rating: 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"They Change the ""Make-up"", but In the End, the Storyline Remains the Same.","After the death of his father in a car accident, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) becomes a troublemaker and aggressive teenager.

Kale snoops his neighbors with a binoculars and video camera for killing time, and becomes a voyeur of his next door neighbor Ashley Carlson (Sarah Roemer).

The trio sneaks around his house, and Kale begins to suspect that Mr. Turner might really be the murderer.How many times have I seen this story? The masterpiece ""Rear Window"" (1954) is as far as I remember the original story. ""The Bedroom Window"" is a decent thriller; the Christopher Reeve's remake of ""Rear Window""; the cult and funny ""Fright Night"". All these movies tell the story of neighbor spying neighbor, but ""Disturbia"" is too predictable and full of clichÃ©s. The car accident in the very beginning is the best part of this film. In the rest, they have changed the ""make-up"", with the excellent David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss and the gorgeous and sexy Sarah Roemer, but in the end, the story line remains the same.

The young cast is engaging, the violence and gore are minimal, and the language inoffensive.The pacing is a little slow in places but, more often, ""Disturbia"" is entertaining and reasonably suspenseful.

A great Horror Flick,"First let me just say this, I haven't seen ""Rear Window."" I actually haven't seen any Alfred Hitchcock movies yet, but I will. I bring this up because this movie is basically a remake of ""Rear Window."" It has the same basic premise just brought into the 21st century. And I'm surprised this movie actually got pretty good reviews. Remaking a classic starring the kid from Transformers, sounds like it should have been hated. I really liked this movie, I would say it's probably my favorite PG-13 horror film and one of the best thrillers of the last decade.For the negative side, it does take a while to get going, the main villain doesn't appear until about 30 minutes in. I don't like the subplot involving the neighborhood kids who torment Kale. When people are fighting the camera begins to get all shaky. And near the end it gets way, way too dark, I can't tell what is going on even when I watch it in pictch darkness.Now Shia LaBeouf seems to be an actor who gets a lot of hate. Personally I really like him though, he's a good actor and is pretty likable. Sam Witwicky would have been a completely unbearable character had Shia not brought any likability to him. And this movie is his best film in my opinion. I like all the characters, Ronnie is really funny at times, his mom is Kary Ann Mosse, aka Trinity who is always awesome. I really like the atmosphere, the direction make the suspense high with the camera shots, music and lighting. There are some pretty good jump scares, and it does a good job of making you feel trapped in the house with Kale.Disturbia is a great example of how to do PG-13 horror. It doesn't have much blood, or swearing. It just has atmosphere and suspense, with a few jump scares thrown in.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Kale is my favourite green besides Spinach, but besides that this film is awesome","Disturbia is a horror thriller about a boy named Kale Brecht(played by Shia LaBeouf) who after being involved in a car crash with his dad and survives but his dad dies, is saddened by his fathers death and finds it hard to focus on things in life such as his education. When he struggles to stay focused in class in High School because of the traumas of his fathers death, Kales teacher asks him questions, asks if he's done his homework, and then says ''what would your father think'', but because he's heartbroken and traumatised by the death of his father, Kale punches the teacher in the face. Kale ends up being put under house arrest which he finds is not comfortable. His mum Julie(played by Carrie-Anne Moss) is concerned about him, but he is disturbed and curious to know what's going on in his neighbourhood and what the neighbours are up to. He does this by using his binoculars day and night to see what's going on and also keeps in touch with his friend Ronnie(played Aaron Yoo) who also comes over to his house.

I have only seen Shia LaBeouf in the first three Transformers films but hadn't seen him in any other films but when I saw this film I was amazed and impressed. He really stood out in this film and his acting as an innocent, loving boy having suspicions about a malicious and manipulative killer as a neighbour was brilliant. The film was very tense, dramatic and scary and is an excellent film. This horror thriller had a combination of action, drama animosity, tension, rage, violence and light horror.

decent thriller marred by clichÃ©d ending,"These days, when it comes to making horror or thriller movies it seems for the most part you have to go for bloody violence almost from the first minute to the last. Recently however, some movies have tried to buck this trend. Vacancy did it quite well, building suspense until the action kicked in. And Disturbia does it too.Cale is given house arrest over the summer, for punching one of his teachers. Fitted with an electronic tag to stop him going too far from the house, he soon gets bored, and begins spying on his neighbours, including Ashley, whose parents have moved in next door, and a Mr. Turner. A combination of news reports over a missing woman, coupled with what appears to be suspicious behaviour from Mr. Turner makes Cale think that Turner may be involved with the missing woman....Although it doesn't say it anywhere, this movie is a modern take on Hitchcock's Rear Window. However this doesn't detract from the fact that for most of it's running time, Disturbia is very entertaining.It starts slowly, giving the characters time to develop, until the main plot kicks in. D.J. Curuso keeps the story moving at a pace, and builds up the tension as Cale tries to find out if Turner is up to no good. He also adds some nice humour into the movie too. The actors are all good. David Morse is suitably mysterious as Turner. Carrie Anne Moss, does well as Cale' mother. Sarah Roemer as Ashley is good, although her joining Cale in watching the neighbours, without getting creeped out by the possibility that he's been watching her is one of several plot holes unresolved. However, like Transformers, the success of this movie is down to Shia Lebeouf. He's fast becoming one of Hollywood's best young actors, and his performance is the best thing in the movie.However what lets the movie down is the end. I won't reveal details, but up till the last 20 minutes or so this movie was high on tension and suspense. However, by the end it has sadly descended into horror clichÃ©s. This is a shame as up till this point it was very impressive.Still the movie deserves credit for not going down the gore and violence route, and trying for suspense. I just wish they could have avoided the clichÃ©s at the end.It turns a great fun movie, into only a good one.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful Movie,"I cannot believe that the rating is 7.3/10. I believe this is one of the worst thriller/suspense movies I have ever seen! Nearly the entire movie is about him lusting after his neighbor and it was more of a teenage crush movie than a thriller. The porno clips were just ridiculous and there is no reason for them. The movie was simply overwhelmingly painful to watch.When the suspense did come ALL the way at the end, I was bored and restless to leave. I could not take this movie seriously because the ""bad guy"" wasn't creepy and it was more about the teenagers making out than anything. Since it took too long to get to the scary part, I was just annoyed with the movie.Save your money and time...do not see this movie! I am sorry I did.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Finally... a horror movie that thinks.,"Very little is implausible in Disturbia if you think about it. Okay, maybe a chick won't fall for a stalker so easily, and maybe it's not likely a visually unobstructed car will be hit by another car going full speed on the highway, and a few other small goofs, but Disturbia packs a lot of thought into what it does and removes the questions from the audience. This is the way horror films should be and exactly the reason why I avoid the genre of horror... because they never stop and think about how ridiculous their situations are. Meanwhile, I'm squirming in my seat, unable to enjoy the ride because I'm thinking to myself... Jesus, this movie is so dumb.Disturbia isn't like that. Everything that is done is done by believable characters... Shia LeBeouf and the girl are excellent in their roles, as is the Asian friend. Everyone's excellent! Shia's character never falls into an emotionally devastated lull and continually whine or bring up the death of his father, as many trite and unsincere movies are wont to do. Shia sets his friend up to break into his suspicious neighbor's car, which may seem like a stupid scene, until you see that he has a lookout trailing the neighbor at the store. This alleviates the false tension which comes from many movies who simply throw their characters into situations without considering the obvious consequence (If you venture into a dark house, someone's going to pop out and stab you.) What I enjoyed the most? When Shia is in danger, in every scene, the first thing he picks up... is a weapon. AMAZING. More horror films should be like that. When I see horror protagonists carrying around weapons instead of running around locked complexes with their heads chopped off, I will start to care. Shia fights like someone who is trying to survive and win, instead of someone who has given up himself to die and merely wants to make that death as entertaining and gory as possible.It's just so strong, the performance that the primary cast gives. The mother, a good mix of caring and firmness, the girlfriend, the friend, and not to forget the villain... a neighbor who wears an amicable veneer with a savage rage underneath (at one point he piledrives a female victim into a doorsill, knocking her unconscious).Another thing of note is how MacGuyverish the movie plays out... as a boy on house arrest, Shia finds the time to rig a transmitter to his video camera and find blueprints of his neighbor's house. A pursuit worthy of someone whose xbox and itunes have been canceled.One of the best movies this year, and one of the best suspense/thrillers I've ever seen, period. I never thought it'd be this good, but it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
JUST PURE THRILLER GOODNESS,I think one of the best suits of this film was how fast the mood of the film changes. The first half felt like jist another one of those teen romantic flicks. Then it gets deeper and deeper towards the end. I think the director deliberately made it that way to really make the movie feel like its own kind of thriller. The writing and direction was a bit simplistic and lazy but overall I think it was still good and effective. David Morse's portrayal of a serial killer really resonated throughout the film because he made it so relatable and made everyone felt clueless about the true nature of his character.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A surprisingly taut, well crafted horror/thriller.","When troubled teen Kale (Shia LaBeouf) takes a pop at his Spanish teacher, he is sentenced to three months house arrest, with an electronic tag around his ankle to prevent him from straying too far from home. His X-Box and iTunes privileges revoked by his milf-ilicious mother (Carrie-Anne Moss, who I wouldn't mind being shacked up with for three months), Kale indulges in a spot of voyeurism, which proves to be far more interesting than any video game: the man in the house opposite is having an affair with his maid; sexy new girl-next-door Ashley (Sarah Roemer) spends much of her time relaxing in the pool; and it appears as though creepy neighbour Mr. Turner (David Morse) has been busy abducting and hacking up local women. Enlisting the help of best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and, of course, Ashley, Kale attempts to prove that the man next door is the cold-blooded psycho he believes him to be.A contemporary PG-13 (or Cert 15 here in the UK) take on Hitchcock's classic Rear Window cursed with a silly title and Shia LaBeouf in the central role: sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it? Thankfully, Disturbia's director D.J. Caruso steers well clear of the expected trappings that blight many a modern youth-orientated horror/thriller (extremely obnoxious characters, MTV style gimmicky visuals, OTT gore) and opts instead for good-old fashioned suspense and edge of your seat thrills. Caruso successfully creates a palpable sense of tension, which he somehow sustains even when occasionally pushing the limits of believability, and his cast all give commendable performances, the younger performers actually making their characters fairly likable and the more experienced thesps providing solid support (Morse in particular gives a very memorable turn as the sinister Mr. Turner).The film builds inexorably to a well executed and nail-biting finale deep inside the bowels of the murderer's house, where some nasty surprises await intrepid young Kale (extra points awarded for the inclusion of a water logged pit full of mouldy corpses!).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pretty good modern day thriller,"I saw a review state that it's a modern day Rear Window and I completely agree, it's obviously not on that same wavelength, but it's definitely something to relate to.
Here you have a teen who's extremely relatable for teens, but also very likeable. There's an argument throughout that he's the guy in the wrong for spying out his window, but the film does well in illustrating that he's the good guy to root for.
This makes for a very interesting thriller. There was parts that had me on the edge of my seat and overall I thought the plot was decent.Only negative is that the love/relationship side of the film I didn't really give a toss about. It didn't really fish me in. But I can see why people would be more invested in it. I'm going 7/10, it's a great watch.

Terrifying.,"In a world where technology rules all, ""Disturbia"" fits right on in. Kale is your average seventeen-year-old, who just so happens to have been put under house arrest for assaulting his Spanish teacher. He's distant from his mother, has only one close friend, and finds his days at home becoming increasingly dull. He has a tracking device around his ankle, preventing him from going further than one hundred feet from his house. With little to do (as a result of his mother canceling everything from his iTunes account to his XBox), Kale takes to spying on his neighbors, who lead very different lives from what most might think. Especially Mr. Turner, who Kale suspects, is a serial killer. With the police not believing him and his mother thinking he's just acting out, Kale enlists the help of his best friend Ronnie, and the new girl next door, Ashley, to further prove his suspicions.I'd been following the progress of this film since I first heard about it some months ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the film ""Rear Window"" and assumed this would be a great take on the same story. People think of ""Disturbia"" as a remake, or a rip-off, when in actuality, it's not. ""Disturbia"" is it's own film, and it's a damn good one at that! Shia LaBeouf will definitely surprise you; clearly, he's grown up since his days on ""Even Stevens"". All around, the acting is great. Sarah Roemer plays Ashley, the hot-to-trot girl, who's just moved in next door to Kale. She, along with Kale's friend Ronnie (hilariously played by Aaron Yoo; honestly, he's the definition of what comic relief should be) help Kale sift through Mr. Turner's life, and discover what he's really hiding. David Morse is excellent here as Mr. Turner, he's hulking, intimidating, and absolutely horrifying; but he doesn't show his ""psychotic side"" until the last parts of the movie. Just watch for the scene in which he runs into the character of Ashley in a parking deck; it'll have you in complete shock.Granted, I would have liked to have seen a little more of Carrie-Anne Moss' character, but her delivery of Julie (Kale's mother) was excellent. She was caring and sweet, just like a real mother. The film also has it's fair share of scares, with various tension-filled stalk sequences, and action scenes that would put Michael Bay to shame, this film does no wrong. The sets are beautifully put together. It's funny, as Kale's room reminds me of my own room in so many ways.Is it original? No. Is it a fun film, that will never leave you bored? Yes. With a classic, slow-build, characters you actually care about (I was all for the relationship between Kale and Ashley) and a last act that will have you on the edge of your seat, ""Disturbia"" is definitely a film for fans of the genre to check out.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Predictable thriller but still a great ride.,"I enjoyed this more than I expected too. As a thriller it's very predictable, yet it still works, borrowing and updating Rear Window in a clever way. Shia LaBeouf plays a teen sentenced to house arrest who becomes convinced (through boredom) that his neighbor (played by a super creepy David Morse) is a serial killer. He does a great job, the kid can act and I liked his interaction with the entire cast. There are some laughs and a bit of romance with the girl next door and I felt like this showed teens in a realistic way. The opening scene with the car accident is shocking and brutal. It does fall apart a bit in the last 15 minutes but still a great ride. 7/23/14",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys vs. Ed Gein,"I had to fight the urge to get up and leave. This is ""Rear Window"" for idiots.

Tense and entertaining,"Disturbia stars LaBeouf as the troubled Kale, who is confined to his home under house arrest after he punches out his Spanish teacher in the middle of class. Kale's array of available diversions dwindle considerably after his mom (Carrie Ann Moss) shuts off his X-Box and his i-Tunes, and he turns to voyeurism instead, carefully noting the daily activities of his neighbors. These include the swimming schedule of the hot girl who just moved in next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), whom he ogles with his best friend, the class clown, Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). When Ashley unexpectedly shows up and wants to know what the boys are doing behind their binoculars, they concoct a story about their neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse), and their suspicions that he is the serial killer currently on the loose... Disturbia seems to be a modern take on Hitchcock's 'Rear Window which I haven't seen but I plan to, because this little thriller was very enjoyable. The story is pretty straightforward and somewhat predictable, and truth be told, it could use a twist or two but, thanks to a good direction, the atmosphere is always very tense and suspenseful and keeps the viewer engaged and on the edge of the seat. Shia LaBeouf delivered a very effective and charismatic performance as Kale and this was one of the films that helped him become the star he is today. In the end, Disturbia is nothing groundbreaking, but it's a nicely done thriller and an entertaining film.6.5/10",,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm not saying the movie was a masterpiece or anything like that, but if you take it for what it is; a suspense thriller meant to attract a certain demographic of movie watcher, you won't be disappointed.The young starring cast did surprisingly well in their roles and were comedic at all the right times. I especially liked Carrie-Ann Moss in her role and thought she was very believable outside her matrix outfit. The music in the movie was appropriate and the scenes kept you on the edge of your seat.

confession: I liked the movie. I liked it a lot more than I thought I was going to...and a lot more than it probably deserves,"I have a confession to make. It's almost like a plea of guilty to a criminal charge. I recently saw the Shia LaBeouf movie ""Disturbia"", which was a big hit among the teenage audience of 2007, and my 'crime' is that, much to my surprise and to my delight, I liked the movie. I liked it a lot more than I thought I was going to and frankly, a lot more than it probably deserves keeping in mind that this is a more than obvious rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller ""Rear Window."" So close are the two movies in plot (not story) that the producers of ""Disturbia"" actually now face a lawsuit for not obtaining the proper copyright permissions that would have allowed their film to be released without raising a legal bout.As for me, I was surprised. No, it's not as good as ""Rear Window"". Not even close. It's standard, it's predictable, it's packed with clichÃ©s with almost all of its primal moments owed to the movie it is borrowing from, but in the end, I found myself moderately entertained from a movie I was rather sure I was going to find distasteful since it is a rip-off of one of my all-time favorites.""Disturbia"" is basically ""Rear Window"" converted for a teenage audience. Instead of a photographer crippled and confined to apartment by a broken leg, Shia LaBeouf stars an adolescent under house arrest for assault. After his mother severs the plug to his television, LaBeouf finds himself with little else to do but set up binoculars and video cameras at his windows and spy on his neighbors, including the new girl next door (Sarah Roemer) who likes to undress in front of an open window and a strange old man (David Morse) who he's convinced is a serial killer.If you thought James Stewart's actions in ""Rear Window"" were a little unethical and perhaps a little creepy, wait till you get a load of LaBeouf in this movie. Actually, though, LaBeouf is what really this movie has to boast about and what the movie owes for its success. Shia LaBeouf, one of the more competent young actors of this generation, is very good in this movie. He brings a lot of charisma and enthusiasm to his role to make a surprisingly likable character out of who otherwise seems an obnoxious little punk in need of a lesson.Like in ""Rear Window"", ""Disturbia"" sets up the plot and the characters for the first half of the movie, introduces the mystery about midpoint, and saves the third act for the majority of thrills and shocking moments. And although I was not 'scared out of my shoes' as a lot of my peers said I would be, I will admit there were some moments that had the hair of my arms raising and this made up for some moments that were otherwise quite dull and ponderous. The only thrill I had a problem with was the climax, which I felt was just clichÃ© and out of place and didn't seem to correspond very well with the resolution.Now what does not work in ""Disturbia""? Well, apart from LaBeouf, there aren't any really interesting characters. Whereas James Stewart had a great supporting cast in ""Rear Window"", LaBeouf only has standard stick figures to call his allies. Sarah Roemer is a beautiful and surprisingly good young actress, but her character does not have much of a personality. Aaron Yoo, also competent, is just playing the typical dweeb's best friend here. And David Morse is not all that frightening of a villain as we can predict every single thing he's going to do next. And because of these weaker supporting characters, the middle of ""Disturbia"" lags a little.In the end, I was delighted to admit that I was not bored to tears with ""Disturbia"" as I was afraid I was going to be. It does have its weaker points and moments and it's no classic like the film it's obviously mimicking, but it is a moderately competent thriller however clichÃ©d and standard it may be.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
High Tech Voyeurism Enhances a Good Thriller,"DISTURBIA is a fine little thriller of a movie. Though some viewers are commenting that it is merely a takeoff on REAR WINDOW and finding it not up to that caliber - and if that bothers potential viewers then be advised, for this viewer it is more a film that addresses our progressive invasion of privacy by high tech instruments, and as such the film makes an important statement. Writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have produced a solid script that manages to capture teenage angst and view of the world and with director D.J. Caruso the story is propelled along with a hold-your-breath pace that makes for a very entertaining and scary movie! Kale (a very fine Shia LaBeouf) had a great relationship with his father (Matt Craven), but in a hideous auto accident Kale witnesses the death of his father, an event that disturbs him so greatly even a year later that he misbehaves in school and eventually is put under house arrest wearing an alarm bracelet on his ankle. Kale's mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) tries to cope with the 'incarcerated' Kale, but tires of his aimless wasting of time and energy. Out of boredom Kale stares out his windows with binoculars, observing the neighbors, not the least of which is an attractive young Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Kale's best friend Ronnie (a very promising Aaron Yoo) is Kale's only contact with the outside world and when the two boys spy on Ashley in her swimming pool, they together find more sophisticated means of voyeurism. And, once Ashley visits Kale the three join in spying on a strange neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), finding him similar to a media-described serial killer. From there the plot thickens and quickens as the threesome made dangerous discoveries and end up in an investigation of scary proportions.The final fifteen minutes of the film are a bit over-the-top, but the rest of the movie is so well done that the ending can be forgiven. There are some fine cameo roles by Viola Davis as the detective in charge of Kale's house arrest, Jose Pablo Cantillo as officer who is stuck with responding to Kale's multiple infringements of his house arrest, among others. Shia LaBeouf is young in his craft but demonstrates a fine screen presence and a lot of polish: he carries the movie well. This is not a major film (though it did very well at the box office!), but is a surefire entertainment! Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Disturbia? I would say,""Annoying""","I looked forward to seeing this movie especially after reading all the wonderful comments written on this web site. Unfortunately, this may have been the worst movie that I have seen to date. The first three-quarters of the movie was about self-serving, self-absorbed snotty teen-agers which I imagine is the movies biggest draw. The adolescents depicted here would have grown up bruised, if allowed to have grown up at all in my household which made the majority of the movie tedious to watch. David Morse played the ""heavy"" and has a magnificent film presence. I'm sorry to see that his role was so implausible that it rendered him almost useless. If he were the main focus and his character expanded, this movie would be hard to beat. I was on the edge of my seat three times but it was contemplating getting my $4 early show ticket refunded. The camera work smacked of ""The Blair Witch Project"" which was my pick for the worst film ever until now. Please, can the movie companies ever make a suspenseful thriller for grown-ups and forget pandering to an audience that will accept such low standards for entertainment? Number one at the box office? I feel cheated after watching this. At 54 years old, I feel as if I were much too old to get the interactions of teenagers. This movie was slow, went no-where and lacked even the hint of surprise.

Okay.,"Shia's got that everyman thing about him and good comedic timing and all that. This movie's alright in terms of delivering some modest entertainment without being nearly as retarded as most movies of its genre typically are. The Asian side-kick guy was pretty funny but other than that I thought the acting was not that good. The girl next door was a pretty shallow character and the performance just felt very obvious, for lack of me thinking of a better way of putting it. David Morse was okay but his character was terribly clichÃ©d and he couldn't shake that. Carrie-Ann Moss didn't do anything but was fine otherwise. Shia, of course, is cool.

"It's no Rear Window, but it's still entertaining","Disturbia is standing on the shoulders of giants and trying to carve out its own niche. Once you get past the fact that it is a low-rent version of Rear Window, there's a decent thriller here. I've always been a fan of movies like this where a character is convinced they know something dramatic that everyone else around them doesn't know, but they are struggling to convince others of the truth. I also appreciate when the movie is able to build suspense by not revealing whether the protagonist is right or wrong for a large chunk of the film. I was convinced somewhat early on because the movie tips its hand a little too much (and casting David Morse is a dead giveaway too.) That being said, I was on pins and needles through most of the climax in fear of what might happen and if our hero and his friends will be able to survive. The climax is non-stop excitement, and takes things to a surprising extreme, but I was on board for the thrills at that point, and couldn't wait to see how it would end.There are definitely some weak points in Disturbia's plot, though. For starters, this movie has a nasty habit of forgetting about the female lead for large chunks of time. There were so many moments when I was just waiting for her to pop up, or wondering why she wasn't helping. It's as though they just assume when she's off camera we will forget she exists and will fail to notice that she could be there saving the day. Then there's the stubborn reluctance that people show in these movies towards calling the police. There were so many times while watching where I was saying to myself it was time for them to call the cops, but they never did it. I understand the protagonist has some issues with the law, but when it comes to suspected murder you typically would assume even someone under house arrest would be willing to phone for help. While there are those frustrating elements, all you can ask from a movie like Disturbia is that it keeps you on the edge of your seat and delivers some exciting thrills, and it succeeded at that, so I still enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

We get some scenes that accentuate the guilt and grief he is carrying inside, then the tale and the tonality takes a surprising turn and the emotional core loses its significance.It then turned into a cliched teenage romance, which again lost ground soon thereafter.

When Shia LaBeouf Ruled The Teenage World,"When evaluated as the thriller it is advertised to be, ""Disturbia"" is slightly above average, providing just enough drama/suspense to keep viewers interested. However, add in the incredible acting of Shia LaBeouf, and the film easily jumps up into the ""very solid"" category.For a basic plot summary, ""Disturbia"" very loosely follows the premise of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"". In this case, young Kale (LaBeouf) is confined to house arrest after slugging a teacher. While homebound, Kale enlists the help of friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and new-to-town girlfriend Ashley (Sarah Roemer) to spy on the next-door-neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), who they believe to be a serial killer.As I mentioned in the opener, as a ""thriller"" alone this movie is passable. If you are a veteran of the genre you'll likely know what is coming a mile away, but it's watchable. Some may deride the effort as a ""Hitchcock rip-off"", but it should instead be viewed as a ""Hitchcock re-interpretation"" for the younger generation (the ones who have no interest in watching Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly).The hallmark of the experience, though, is easily the acting of LaBeouf, who (as he so often did during that time period) represents the typical American teenage boy. He struggles with the utter boredom of house arrest, spies on the bikini-clad teenage girl across the yard (and then befriends her in his awkward way), and lets himself get completely swept up in a fantastical plot involving Mr. Turner. These are all things that teenagers can relate to (or even older folks can remember relating to!) and make the movie much more personal to the viewer.To me, ""Disturbia"" will always represent the peak of LaBeouf's teen flicks (right along with ""Holes"" & ""Transformers""). Every time I watch this movie, I actually find myself enjoying the setup (first 2/3) more than the resolution (1/3), and his interactions with all the characters is the primary reason for that. I can't say it's an all-time classic, but it represents a certain time of life for me that has become cemented by the sands of time. That's why I can always still enjoy this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
1 Good Acting Performance coupled with an Obvious Story ...,"The first half of this movie is really good because the lead actor, Shia LaBeouf, is really interesting to watch. You simply want to see what his character will do next. However, the second half of the movie brings in weak characters and an obvious plot. The quality of the movie drops off a bit.Basically, the film is about a teenager who spies on his neighbors using binoculars. It's his way of passing time since he's serving a 3 month jail sentence at home. Initially, his primary target is an attractive girl next door. However, he soon begins to suspect that his other neighbor may be linked to a missing persons case in the news.Shia LeBeouf puts in a great performance as the teenager under house-arrest. His mannerisms and dialog make his character interesting to watch. Unfortunately, when other characters enter into the foreground, they detract from the quality of the movie. The attractive girl neighbor is not quite believable - she's a little too over the top. And the suspicious neighbor is a little too obvious.Plot-wise, it's pretty average by today's standards. The movie doesn't quite deliver things you can't already guess ... and for a movie like this, that's not ideal.If you're looking for an above-average movie with a mix of good and bad elements, this is OK to watch. If you're looking for an all-around great thriller, this doesn't quite fit the bill.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just watch Rear Window,"Stupid shitty angst ridden teen pretends he is Jimmy Stewart in this horrible almost remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic. Instead of a cast he has an ankle bracelet since hes so badass that he punched a teacher. There's no point in even discussing this trash, if you like the crapper that stars in this movie watch transformers at least there's some cgi, which I'm sure is far more important to you then story or characters. There isn't even any boobies to make up for the stupidity of this movie, so stupid. All in all, just watch rear window, if you want to see someone spying on people, only you also want to see a good movie at the same time.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Despite some flaws, this is still an entertaining thriller.","I've seen 'Disturbia' many times and although I do have some issues with the film, I'm entertained every time.After losing his dad in a freak accident, Kale (Shia LaBeouf) becomes a troubled teenager. After punching his teacher, he is sentenced three months house arrest. I somehow don't believe Shia was the perfect candidate for the role. He over-acted a bit, and I didn't take him all that seriously during the serious moments. On the other hand, I thought David Morse was excellent as the antagonist, Mr. Turner. There was an eeriness about him that suited the character perfectly.The film is off to a slow start, which I believe was necessary to set up the scene. However, even once the film enters the second act, there are far too many distractions not relevant to the premise - especially his adoration for Ashley, the girl next door. The 'love interest' between them was comedic, and consistently ruined the suspense. At times I believed the film to be dragged out because they didn't have enough material for a full-length movie. Or at least it felt that way...The final act is much better paced, and quite thrilling, actually, with a very good climax. So, despite the aforementioned flaws, I do still enjoy 'Disturbia' every time.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Keep an eye on Morse,"DISTURBIA is a youth-oriented version of Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW. We have already had two youth-oriented versions of REAR WINDOW, namely FRIGHT NIGHT and MIMIC 3. But so be it. A good plot never wears thin. Shia L. plays a kid under house arrest with little to keep him occupied. So he starts spying on his neighbors, one of whom, played by David Morse of CONTACT and HACK fame, may be a serial killer. At least, Shia's character thinks so. He enlists the aid of a pretty newcomer to the neighborhood (Sarah Roehmer) and one of his school buddies (Aaron Yu) to try and trip the guy up. Morse is appropriately sinister and menacing. Shia does his best with a role that largely confines him to one room. This PG-13 film has its moments, and will best appeal to a young crowd. Adults, beware.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Best teen scare movie in a while,"This film is aimed right at my demographic (16 year old) so I thought it was great. I went in a group of 5 on opening night in a theater packed with teens just like me. I was skeptical due to the genre and Shia Leobouf, who i didn't like in Holes. The movie starts right away and keeps you in right to the end. This movie relies on suspense and the suspense sticks around until the awesome climax of the last 20 minutes of the movie. In a theater of jumpy teenagers, the last 20 minutes caused everyone to scream at every little shock, which were genuine, not cheesy. This movie didn't rely on gore, which is good because i'm not good with gore. Although there were a few clichÃ©s (the thunder & lightning at the climax, Why don't people call the cops BEFORE going into a persons house) the rest of the movie overcame them and it isn't surprising that this movie was a hit at the box office. I liked it so much that i got my sister to see it again with me so i could prove how good it was. 9/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Creepiness At It's Best!,"Disturbia is one excellent, but creepy film. I am not a big fan of movies with horror elements but I had to check this film out based on rave reviews, good storyline, and likable cast. To say the least, this film has made me more interested in the thriller/horror genre.This is film is about a teenager named Kale. He is placed under house arrest and he decides to use his time to spy on his neighbors. He discovers that one of his neighbors is not the peaceful neighbor he claims to be.The acting is very good and better than what I expected. Shia LaBeouf really plays the central role quite well. Carrie-Ann Moss does a great job in her limited time on screen. But the best actor of the bunch has to be David Morse as the creepy neighbor.D.J Caruso made a really good film thats a welcome addition to the thriller genre. He also blended in some comedy to go with the thrills and chills.Overall, this a very good film! It works because it loaded me up with suspense during the whole movie.

good,"This was a good movie in the Rear Window theme. I certainly didn't regret seeing it, and I guarantee you won't either. I enjoyed it. Shia LeBeouf plays a teenager whose father is killed in a car accident in a well-played-out opening scene. In the next scene, Shia pops his Spanish teacher when the teacher makes a comment about what the father would think of it and, because he is still a minor, Shia winds up under three months house arrest. One of the police officers is the teacher's cousin and enjoys torturing him with this. There are news stories about a serial killer, and when David Morse moves next door, Shia begins to suspect that this might be him. A gorgeous teenaged girl also moves in to the other house next door, and they start spying on him along with Shia's best friend, and they also frustrate Shia's mother and spy on neighbors as well and receive torture from the pesky kids, including the ""flaming poop bag"" trick. Boy, do they get revenge. I enjoyed watching this movie. It was very suspenseful. You will like it too. The suspense never lets up. Morse portrays his character very creepy and very effectively, and everyone is very good. Shia is also good in the lead. I liked it.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not too shabby...,"I just watched ""Disturbia"", this idle nightÂ…or technically, morning. It was unrealistic; a typical teenage type flick, seemingly derived from a proverbial taleÂ…you know the one, about the guy who broke his leg and only had his vivid imagination and a telescope as entertaining deviations.Don't worry, no spoilers there. Anyway the lead female role ""love interest"" was horribly skinny, the type of skinny that makes you wonder if they had to put makeup on her scarred knuckles between takes, the type of skinny that gives young girls horrible body complexes-though she was not a horrible casting choice. The ""asian guy"" best friend character was a little disappointingly portrayed. Bad acting, a token kooky characterÂ…the character was cool but contrived.All in all though, the collective cast, special effects and phenomenal soundtrack made for a not so regrettable movie. I give it a 7, and that's good! I hardly ever give 10s or even 9s.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Every Killer Lives Next Door,"After his father's death, Kale Brecht becomes sullen, withdrawn, and troubled -- so much so that he finds himself under a court-ordered sentence of house arrest. He becomes a voyeur as his interests turn outside the windows of his suburban home towards those of his neighbors, one of which Kale begins to suspect is a serial killer.After coming back from the movie, I was happy. Although it could've been better, I still liked the film for being clever and humorous. Carl Ellsworth wrote this film, who also wrote Red Eye. I would have to say that Red Eye was slightly better.Shia LaBeouf's acting is very good in the film. He's realistic playing the techno-savvy teenager who falls in love with the sexy Ashley, played by Sarah Roemer. Carrie-Anne Moss also gives a good performance playing the naive mother and Aaron Yoo as the comedic friend, providing the laughs for the film. I also like to say David Morse's acting was very creepy. He plays a realistic sinister man in the neighborhood.Some people might go in here, getting restless for the film beginning too slow. I didn't mind that the real action happened close to the last half hour of the film. The first hour of the film gives a set up as the teen being a voyeur which makes you feel for the character and makes the film much more thrilling rather than beginning the action right away.This film is very well done, great score and cinematography, and has its own suspenseful and thrilling scenes. If you want a thriller, mixed with romance and comedy, watch Disturbia but don't get restless for the first hour of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"good, and fun, But lets try without the boom mic.","Well, this movie was actually good and very fun. Of course, it was a remake of the classic, Hitchcock film ""Rear Window"". One of the main reason forme to see this film was for Shia Labouf. Who is turning out to become abit of a Star (with another Film coming out this summer ""Tramsformers""). The acting was great, Shia played great in it along with the rest of the cast. The biggest problem you'll notice , is the boom. It seems to creep into the shot(or frame) often.

A Competent Re-Working of the Rear Window Story for the Modern Generation,"Disturbia reviewed by Samuel OsbornTalking to Dylan McDermott about The Messengers a couple months ago, the topic of remakes was brought up. I asked if people would write his film off as an Asian knock-off of Hitchcock's The Birds. He said, maybe cynically, in response: ""Unfortunately, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't remember The Birds. Nobody cares. The trouble with making movies is that every ten years it's a whole new generation. It's all about getting the teenagers in the theatre. The thirteen year old girl rules this world."" And so now we have Disturbia, a PG-13 remake-in-spirit of Hitchcock's Rear Window. But before we all turn the page and look for a better movie to see, allow me to clarify any misconception. The target demographic may still be the thirteen year old girl, but Disturbia is a competent re-working of Rear Window for the modern generation. Jimmy Stewart had only binoculars and a telescopic lens to perform his long-range detective work. Shia LaBeouf has a cell phone, an iPod, a digital camcorder, live video feeds, and the internet on his side. Technology is this generation's Cultural Revolution and it's shifted the way we are sensitive to those around us. Disturbia is hyper-aware of this development and employs it smartly towards a story that is valid and justified in its re-telling.Sentenced to three months of house arrest for the summer between his Junior and Senior year at High School, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) is bored out his noggin. His mother's discontinued his Itunes account, cancelled his Xbox Live subscription and sliced the wire powering his bedroom television. The punishment arises out of Kale's raging outbreak at school that rounded out the third in a three strike penal system. Charges were pressed and Kale got slapped with an ankle bracelet that has the cops skidding up to his driveway any time he leaves the 100-foot radius surrounding his home. The only thing distracting him is the perpetually swimming next-door neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer), just moved-in from the city. Kale schedules his day around her swimming and yoga cycles, microwaving a bowl of popcorn and lounging in a chair with his good friend the binoculars to his eyes. She catches him one day and mutual teenaged horniness welds a friendship spent trading binos spying on the neighbors. Soon they notice some striking correlations between Mr. Turner (David Morse) across the street and the unidentified stalker lifting women from the city. Wild conspiracies are formed and soon they've launched an impromptu control center in Kale's house, playing detectives with modern technology filling their holsters.Shia LaBeouf, the young actor steadily separating himself from his Disney Channel origins, joins Justin Chatwin (The Invisible), Adam Brody (In the Land of Women), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (The Lookout) in a gaggle of promising young male actors with medium-sized movies releasing this month. He finishes a close second to the moody-faced, brilliant Gordon-Levitt, but nevertheless turns in a compelling argument for casting directors to place him in more leading roles for the future. The rest of the characters are also cast exceptionally well, particularly Kale's parents played by Matt Craven and an underused Carrie-Anne Moss.Director DJ Caruso took on the ambitious, potentially pretentious project apparently without any intention of mimicking Mr. Hitchcock. His style is sometimes inspired, but mostly mainstream. The opening father-son fishing sequence is expectedly touching, lit warmly and with a pleasant orchestral score purring along with the river. The script, penned by Christopher Landon and Red Eye veteran Carl Ellsworth, pulls most of the weight cinematically. Much of our belief in Kale's character hinges on the realism of his pain over the death of his father. One scene is taken to build the connection between father and son (the fishing scene, incidentally), and another scene to kill the father off. Landon and Ellsworth ace the fishing scene with the kind of easy dialogue that's organic enough to not set us off to the father's impending doom. Finishing the one-two punch, Mr. Caruso plays his singular card of directorial pizazz and scares the hell out of us with a cruel scene of vehicular misfortune.The rest of the film finds Mr. Caruso leaning heavily on the screenplay which switches rapidly between Kale and Ashley's romance and the terror across the neighborhood. The romance, though charming at times, is stilted with glib dialogue for Ashley. The writing pair apparently weren't too popular with the ladies in high school and understand them only well enough to make Ashley into an unrealistically seductive vixen. She isn't as human as the other characters, crippling the romantic segments significantly. And as in Red Eye, just as the tension mounts to a level of satisfying discomfort, the story unravels into an extended climax of action-film vapidity.But Disturbia works aside from all the moving parts of its strange device as a spiritual Rear Window remake. The film finds the colorful nature of a teenaged summer spent trapped in suburbia. The obsessions and the romances are mutually desperate and, in the same way, intensely gratifying. What you find holed away in a tract-home existence at seventeen, whether it's a murderer or a first love, is something, anything to hold on to.Samuel Osborn",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The main character Kale is put under house arrest for his recent bad behavior in school. With more then enough time on his hands Kale starts to ""keep an eye on"" his neighbors.","Overall the film proves to be a successful horror/thriller. The film proves to be successful because of it's jumpy and unexpected nature. But the true aspect of horror in the film begins when Kale, Shia LaBeouf, has nothing better to do then start spying on his neighbors, including Mr. Turner, David Morse, and his new neighbor Ashley, Sarah Roemer. The film can also be seen as the perfect teen horror film not because LaBeouf is so young and handsome in the movie but because of his love interest in his new neighbor Ashley. It's a great film in which has you on the edge of your seat questioning if what happens is in Kale's head or if it is in fact going on.

Great Flick!!! Spend the Money!!,"Usually, I am weary of these kind of movies. No one wants to risk blowing money on a movie that is just hype then turns out to fall short. This movie I liked. It was had it's suspense, thrills, and even brief chills. A good movie will carry you and keep you on a roller coaster ride to a final destination...no pun intended. Disturbia does take you on the ride. There were a few lagging moments and few scenes in the climatic ending that left you wondering why a certain co-star seems to vanish from the film until the very end. I kept thinking where did _______ go? Overall, it is entertaining and truly a lot of fun. So if you are going to spend the money to see a movie this is a sure bet.

"Bad movie, If you are a vapid moron you will like this","Shia LaBeouf, the actor who plays the main character in this movie, is terrible.

Disturbia is a stupid bad film, with annoying stupid teenage characters that I do not believe and have no reason to act as they do.LeBeouf's acting is so unbelievable - He does not seem sincerely the 'bad boy' after the death of his father. His best friend (who is the token minority in the film) is highly annoying. Then when the best friend apparently dies the two main chatacters forget all about him and don't care? It always puzzles me when characters do that, it's like: ""Oh our good friend was brutally murdered, and we were almost murdered too, but its the day after and near the end of the movie so lets pretend were not even thinking about that and just kiss each other and feel all well-adjusted and normal despite an unspeakable horrible ordeal"" In short I would expect this for a low-budget B-movie direct to DVD bad movie, but a major studio relese?

The Modern Day Rear Window.,"Shia is starting to become an active cinema star after his years as a teen star for the Disney Channel. This time he's in his own thriller. Portraying as a teen who was put on home arrest for punching a teacher. And for that, his own home is his prison. And was hooked with an advance meter that goes off if he were to exit outside his home.Unable to go outside for awhile. He ends up having the habit of watching what goes on in the neighborhood. And has suspicions that a neighbor is an undercover murder.This is what you would get if you modernize Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" without the whole broken leg bib. And it's one of the most thought up suspense movies you'll see this year besides all the common horror films. And another thing to note is this movie does have some originality to it.

Surprisingly enjoyable...,"This film has received some very mixed reviews but I've just got back from seeing it and enjoyed it.It has a gripping opening, is full of tension and suspense, has well developed characters that you actually care for and features some action-packed, nail-biting scenes towards the end. I guess the only thing I can fault with this film is how predictable it is as I knew exactly how it would pan out just from watching the trailer and that is exactly what happened. I don't think it's a bad thing at all though as in an age where horror films are full of twists and turns, it's actually refreshing to see a straight-forward yet effective film that delivers.Some say that it rips off 'Rear Window' but I personally consider it to be a modernisation of Hitchcock's classic. It should not be forgotten that Hitchcock's film was made in 1954 so modern audiences (unless they're avid Hitchcock fans) will be unaware of it. So is it not a good thing that 'Disturbia' has been made as whenever the film is mentioned, 'Rear Window' also gets mentioned so it sheds light on a great film that modern audiences may not have looked up otherwise..?Overall, 'Disturbia' is a simple yet effective little thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's like the darkness is the light,"Here's a teen thriller that isn't fueled by raging teenager hormones and doesn't act on impulse during tense situations. Well, most of the time. Disturbia is a crafty and intense thriller that may not pack in the originality of other films of the same genre, but has enough to effectively sustain its runtime and its ideas. Although not perfectly executed, it finds little shortcuts around some clichÃ©s, but still offers essentially the same things you'd get in a regular 2000's decade horror film.This is a treat for Shia LaBeouf and his fans as well. Finally we can see him in a film with coherency, plot, and characterization. He finally shows his acting talents that do not involve running away from metal giants and screaming at them with full power. He is more controlled, and more developed in Disturbia, leaving much to be desired. He plays Kale, who was just in a car accident that killed his father, and has been placed on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher. He's been throughout a lot, and is the typical teenager that likes music, TV, and girls, so we can still see he isn't a bad kid, but a victim of somewhat uncontrollable circumstances.In a random act of boredom, he starts spying on his neighbors which include deviant little kids, a gorgeous young woman (Roemer), a cheating couple, and a mysterious elder, played wonderfully by David Morse. He becomes more acquainted with the young woman, whose name is Ashley, and they begin spying on the elderly man, who they believe might match a killer who has been kidnapping women across town.LaBeouf and Roemer strike up a believable chemistry, and the film isn't too much sex, too much cartoony violence, or too much blood. It's all well managed. The film takes about an hour before it kicks itself into high gear, so these characters are left to develop at an efficient rate. The result works favorably, and when hell starts breaking loose, we feel even more sorry for the characters because we know them well. They're not faceless caricatures.As some could pick up from the plot, this is a modern retelling of Hitchcock's classic Rear Window, now updated with computers, cell phones, and cameras. I'm not for remakes, but I am somewhat for reimaginings and updated versions of films from decades past. As long as they're made with suspense, characters, coherency, and enjoyment. Here, there's respect for Hitchcock's original story, but there are also touches of the film's own personal take on the story. Because of these alterations, the films can't be dubbed as a remake, but a reimagining.Disturbia is a fine blend of terror, voyeurism, and suspense with good looking teen actors who are bound to do well in the future. Once LaBeouf ceases with the Transformers films, and Aaron Yoo wanders out of remake hell I can see both of them doing films of all different genres. Hopefully they'll put the binoculars away next time and go out and play.Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yoo, David Morse. Directed by: D.J. Caruso.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
disturbia DVD review R1,"Wow! I am pretty impressed with the movie, and this is not the type that will try to shock you all time like some horror thriller movies. It will slowly scare you at some scenes and I am not prepared to be scared at the scenes but suddenly it gave me the shock. After one scene that shocked me, I knew I would have to be prepared to be scared by other scenes. But for a thriller movie, I won't want to say that this is a horror movie, it had done a pretty good job.The story is about Kale and his father go fishing and on their way back to home, they meet with an accident which Kale's father gets smashed up by a zooming car. Then we see Kale in school, punching the Spanish teacher after the teacher mentions Kale's father. Then in the next scene, Kale is confined in home, not able to walk out of his house. His X-box line is cancelled and his mother cut off the line of his T.V in his room. He got nothing to do but to spy on his neighbours and met a hot girl. From there, he suspects that his neighbour is a murderer. He try to uncover him.Overall, it turns out to be a good thriller flick. But it could have been better, it is spitted into two parts, the first forty-five minutes is about the spying on his neighbours and the last hour is about the uncovering of the suspected neighbour.The DVD contains special features, it contains four deleted scenes which are boring, mostly extended. The usual making of the movie, bloopers, outtakes, music videos, trailers, quiz and audio Commentary. Worth to catch it on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Finest Thriller !,"Disturbia.. A must watch ! This movie was extremely well paced. The acting was very solid, and every actor, major or minor, sold their part.

sub-par teen movie,"While it has a moment or so of entertainment, DISTURBIA is not a good film and shouldn't be seen by anyone who loves thrillers. Everyone know the plot a la REAR WINDOW. What troubles me the most are those stupid plot holes which is laziness on the script writers part. The ending is the worse thing about the movie. The killer disappears for a while, the surfaces again? Why the wait? With so much going on with screaming and the noise of the fight, no other neighbor's notice? When the girl jumps out of the pool, she presumably goes to her parents and calls the police. Where were they? They come so late? The killers house is like the ""house of horrors"". Who can make a place with so many secret walls, floors and compartments? You'd have to have a mansion, not a suburban home to configurate such a place. Would a killer really settle down in the burbs? With his killings, why leave all the windows uncovered for anyone to see? Doesn't anyone think about these things when making a movie? Don't they sit around a table and discuss impausabilities?

When events starts to pile up that sound surprisingly like a murder case on TV, Kale finds himself in deep as the secrets of the neighborhood is revealed.What makes the movie work is the acting.

But the movie was superbly carried by David Morse.The movie is filmed in a great way, with a very dynamic and right-in-the-midst-of-it-all sense to it, which adds a lot of suspense to the movie.""Disturbia"" is a fairly generic thriller story-wise, but it is still well worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hmm.,"I was looking forward to this film a lot, i thought great plot, god story line and a bunch of good young actors and a few oldies.Firstly i think the acting was pulled of greatly and coming from Even Stevens Shia LaBeouf really did himself justice.for some part of the story i found it quite boring, and it really took about 45 minutes to get into the story which wasn't to great, but when they got into the story i thought they did a great job of pulling it off well, there was a few parts i found myself abit scared and in suspense. id recommend this to more of the teenager population than the older generation. overall i'd give this a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbia Delivers Entertainment at Its Finest,"This was my first time watching Disturbia. I had been wanting to see this movie for quite a while.Let me start by explaining why I gave it a ""10"", especially since many people rate it around a ""7"" or dismiss it as just a modern copy of Rear Window.I gave this movie a perfect score because it kept me thoroughly entertained from start to finish; something I haven't felt with a film in a long time. The casting is spot-on, the pacing is excellent, and there wasn't a single thing I didn't like about the movie.Maybe its a guilty pleasure of mine, but no. It can't be, because I don't see it that way. I genuinely believe the ""10"" is well-deserved because the movie is so well-executed. This is entertainment at its finest. It made me laugh, feel anxious, discomfort and even cringe at times. I went through a rollercoaster of emotions, and that's one of the things that makes this movie stand out.If you didn't enjoy this movie, I respect your opinion, but honestly, I think you missed the point. This movie is pure fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly Good!,I came into the movie theatre with no high hopes. I went in thinking it would be just another Hollywood thriller with regular Jump Scares and a weak script. Disturbia was really good. Its not an amazing work of art and will probably be forgotten in 4 years time. Disturbia is one to watch with your friends on a Friday/Saturday night. The casting isn't amazing and i did get sorta annoyed with Sarah Roemer. Shia LaBeouf is amazing in this movie and i think its maybe his best acting role to date. Disturbia keeps you going throughout and i rarely got bored. Im glad the movie didn't keep making you jump too much (like 1408). I give this movie 8 stars as its definitely my thriller of the year. So go buy your tickets!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Predictable, but well executed","Yes, I did enjoy the movie. BUT, let's just say the bad stuff up front to get it over with so we can focus on why I gave this movie such a strong rating. The Bad: First off, the story line is predictable - plus, it has strong resemblance to a classic horror movie which will remain unnamed to avoid any spoiler. Second, the last fourth of the movie threw all creativity to the wind (which, contrary to many others' beliefs, is perfectly fine with me - It compensates for this by including intense action and energy during this time). The killer, who has spent countless years planning and perfectly executing his murders, seemingly snaps?... Not likely. Fortunately, it works anyway. The Good: The movie was entertaining. So often, I hear people speaking of how terrible a script was, but they still enjoyed the movie. Where is the problem? Why do we see movies? We seek entertainment! This movie will give that quality. Second, the acting, while occasionally dependent on powerful camera angles, computer tricks, is good. The characters are likable, and the acting choices are justified. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good, clean thriller. It is rated PG-13, so there is no fear of unnecessary nudity or desperate attempts to obtain shock value through vulgarity in language or gore. It's a clean, well depicted thriller. Overall rating - B/B+",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: Disturbia,"Disturbia played it smart in its release locally, by having pushed back its release date until almost every cinema goer had seen Michael Bay's Transformers, and become acquainted with the latest Hollywood ""It"" kid, Shia LaBeou, otherwise also better known as ""the Transformers boy"".Being an uncredited remake of Hitchcock's classic Rear Window, Disturbia has our boy hero playing Kale, who's put on house arrest for having knocked the lights out of his teacher. So his home and front yard becomes his playground, but when mom (Carrie-Anne Moss, would you believe that?) cut off his XBox and ITunes subscription, he turns to voyeurism to beat the blues and occupy time. In a scene in Transformers, LaBeou had to look for something at home. Now he turns to looking for entertainment in other people's home. And that included spying on the hot chick new neighbour Ashley (Sarah Roemer), while keeping an eye on a possible serial killer staying next door, Mr Turner (David Morse).It doesn't help that the trailer plays out almost the entire plot of the movie, and therefore you're pretty sure of what you're gonna get from it. The first half played on the teenage drama romance bit, with Kale figuring out how to woo the most attractive girl on the block, with the handicap of not being able to meet her in proper circumstances outside his home. But the movie banked heavily on Shia LaBeouf's boyish charisma, and that probably payed off loads. He's a lucky chap, as Sarah Roemer makes it two in a row (the other being Megan Fox) where his character gets up close and personal with hot chicks.The second half of the movie turned the spotlight a bit on the mystery on hand to solve, and while it isn't naturally original, I'd say it still managed to pull off an above average thriller, thanks to David Morse's ability to send some chills with his build, and two-faced acting, being perturbed by his privacy being invaded (hey, serial killers need time alone to do their stuff), and yet wanting to be perceived as a gentle giant. Morse's one of the understated character actors today, and while his role is nothing groundbreaking, it still served its purpose.Don't expect too much from this movie, and you might find it an enjoyable breeze. Just keep a look out for LaBeouf's name to marquee bigger projects in the near future, starting with the new Indiana Jones movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Scary mix of teen angst and horror works pretty well...,"DISTURBIA is a hip tale about a restless teen (SHIA LaBEOUF--what a name!!) under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher and forced to wear a leg bracelet that sets off an alarm if he goes outside his restricted bounds. When his mother deprives him of entertainment as further punishment, he starts spying on some interesting neighbors, a la James Stewart in REAR WINDOW.The tale starts with a brutal road accident after a fishing trip with his dad that ends with a startling scene before the title credit. But it takes awhile for the story to get into high gear and start delivering the chills one is waiting for in a tale of this kind.SARAH ROEMER is the pretty girl next door who is soon joining Shia in his spying activities; AARON YOO supplies plenty of comic relief as Shia's Oriental friend; CARRIE-ANNE MOSS is understandably under a strain as Shia's stressed out mother; and David MORSE is sufficiently creepy as the neighbor suspected of harboring some dark secrets.Handsomely photographed, it's a letdown only when the shaky camera movement is used for certain crucial scenes such as the finale in a dark cellar. It seems that every filmmaker today likes to use that technique which should have been restricted to the likes of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.The last twenty-five minutes are well staged and exciting, building up to the suspenseful climax. Shia deserves full praise for practically carrying the film with an authentic portrait of an energetic teen with too much time on his hands.It's a satisfying thrill ride but not something to go out of your way to see.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I can't disagree with any of the complaints but I like this one anyway.,"I've seen more than enough movies about teenagers being harrassed by serial killers, but I liked this one anyway. It's basically REAR WINDOW updated for the tech age, with cell phones, camcorders and PCs powering the old-school plot. Shia LaBeouf stars as a hotheaded teen (oddly named ""Kale"" just like the salad ingredient) is sentenced to spend his summer under house arrest for punching a teacher. After his long-suffering mom (Carrie-Anne Moss, playing a role that suits her much better than her Trinity character in THE MATRIX) takes away his TV and video games, he turns to spying on his neighbors for entertainment. As happens in a great many movies but never in real life, everybody in the neighborhood does everything while standing in front of large curtainless windows in well-lit rooms, so he gets to see the usual movie cliches like people cheating on their spouses, women taking their clothes off, etc. Another only-in-the-movies development is that a beautiful, smart, witty, confident teenage girl just happens to move in next door and almost immediately takes a romantic interest in her obviously troubled, nosey, convicted-of-assault new neighbor. News reports tell of a police manhunt for a crazed murderer of young women, and of course our angst-ridden antihero begins to suspect that the quiet middle-aged guy who lives alone nearby is the killer. You can pretty much guess everything that's going to happen in DISTURBIA and the story takes a long time to get going, but the performances are first-rate, the dialogue is clever enough to be bearable and the film's last third, in which everybody chases everybody else around in the dark, is tight and suspenseful. A water-filled chamber packed with rotted corpses should have been a lot scarier than it is here, but at least it steers the later portion of the film into demented, pseudo-Argento territoty. It's kind of a shame that the plot relies upon one outlandish coincidence after another, because the finished film falls far short of plausibility, thus making it an easy movie to forget. But if you don't mind psychokiller tales being a little on the mild side and if you can get past the problem of some phony-baloney Hollywood contrivance setting the action in motion, you ought to find DISTURBIA fun and entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

enjoyable thriller,"My husband and I watched this movie last night and we liked it pretty well. The only problem we had was that it started off a little slow. But it was entertaining and that's really what I expected from this movie. I was on the edge of my seat a few time and one time I did jump, so that is what I expect from a thriller.The concept of the movie was good, but it could have been a little deeper because you don't get to know the characters very well except for the main boy on house arrest. I am not sorry we rented it which does sometimes happen, but I doubt it would win any awards.Well, if you are in the mood for a thriller that doesn't require a lot of thought on your part (which I often am) then this movie is definitely a good choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"From 'Rear Window' To This? Now, That's 'Disturbing!'","This is a modern-day teen version of the 1954 classic ""Rear Window."" To show you how far down the tubes Hollywood has gone since then, instead of a grown, mature adult spotting a criminal across the way, we now have a snotty teenager under house arrest for slugging his high school Spanish teacher. And, we have the teen and his horny friend ""Ronald"" (Aaron Yoo) spying mainly on the new teen girl ""Ashley"" (Sarah Roemer) who has moved in across the street. The camera zooms in on her skin as frequently as possible.In the process, the kid, ""Kale"" (Shia LeBeouf) hears reports on television about a missing girl and description of a vehicle last seen at her last whereabouts. Kale spots that car belong to another neighbor. He tells his buddy and then the girl, after she had come over to visit, and the ""kids"" now take this eavesdropping seriously.Things get really tense when Kale spots the suspect, ""Mr. Turner"" (David Morse) stab a woman in his living room. It really gets carried away, story-wise, when more and more dramatic things occur and some stupid scenes like Kale and his buddy standing in front of a well-lit window spying. Come on! This script was believable for awhile but really starts to get stupid. I won't say anymore for fear of spoilers.Frankly, I liked ""Rear Window"" much better, and I am not one of those older folks who always prefers the classics. No, usually the opposite. I also loved LeBeouf in ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" where he plays the great (and nice kid, not like the one here) golfer ""Francis Ouimet.""",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Best Hitchcock Film Not Directed by Alfred Hitchcock,"I went to see this film with very low expectations, not thinking that it could even compare to the brilliant ""Rear Window"" that it is, for all intents and purposes, a remake of. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Not claiming to be a remake in the title and credits gave the filmmakers creative license to change the plot and characters while keeping the premise essentially the same. This results in a picture that is not so much a shot for shot remake (a la Gus van Zant's ""Psycho""), but ""Rear Window"" as it could have been had Alfred Hitchcock chosen to set the film in suburbia. It is fun for fans of ""Rear Window"" to catch all the homages to the original. The movie oozes suspense, and is very Hitchcock in its style of creating tension. There are some quibbles however, some dialogue and plot points were not believable, and the movie relied too heavily ""jump"" scenes. On the whole, though a good movie, not a great one like ""Rear Window,"" ""Disturbia"" comes highly recommended even for (especially for) fans of Alfred Hitchcock and ""Rear Window"".7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""How many other perfect little houses hide really twisted secrets""","No not the hit song by Rhianna, but Disturbia takes you in what feels like way back to the days where Apple was still a baby, Nokia phones were in, camcorders, Innocence and much of my childhood Nostalgia.Disturbia makes me feel old as hell. Watching as a teenager this film gripped me immensely and became a bit of a cult film, that I always wanted to revisit.Watching Disturbia today the biggest difference is how the film has aged. Back in 2007 I was a brisk eighteen year old that resonated with Kale and Ashley was absolutely set as ""The Girl Next Door"" pardon the pun.Fast forward to 2024. I am thirty five and after we see the father fishing with his son a great realisation smacks me in the face.I now don't feel as compatible with Kale, would still find Ashley is someone you would take home. But it really dawned on me that nothing is ever the same then second time around.Before Shia LaBeouf (Kale) was a household name and went through his own battles and when David Morse (Mr. Turner) and Carrie-Ann Moss (Julie) became instantly recognisable on film.Disturbia holds up today as a film that surprised many back in 2007. It is a teen thriller but manages to invoke intense paranoia while being a bit of a slow build.The warm lighting in the home where Kale is imprisoned for ninety days feels incredibly suburban with claustrophobic realism.Most of the film is set in Kale's home and the neighbours yards which is what we see as Kale's entire world.As the films opens up so do more of the character development and your personal connection to Kale, Ronnie, Julie or Ashley.I found the final twenty minutes the film goes from obsessions and delusions and transforms very quickly into a tense battle for survival. Morse and Shia own their performances and their chemistry is what keeps Disturbia real and frightening.Don't be afraid to go back to yesteryear although you might find yourself if a world of memories that your forget ever existed.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great movie, Alfred would be amused. I could only wish he had the same tech advancements back then. CGI and Lucas' digital effects.

"""Rear Window"" it isn't, but still OK","By reading the DVD case, I derived that ""Disturbia"" was basically the same thing as Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"": a confined person suspects that a neighbor may be a killer (""The Simpsons"" even had an episode like that many years ago). Watching it, I saw that it is basically the same concept - a ripoff, I guess - but with some modern conveniences thrown in.The plot goes like this: young Kale Brecht (Shia LeBoeuf) and his father are out fishing, when the father gets killed in a car wreck. A year later, Kale is still distraught over the incident. When a Spanish teacher badmouths him in front of the whole class, Kale punches the guy, resulting in three months house arrest. With nothing to do, Kale begins spying on the neighbors, in particular on hot girl Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who just moved in next door. But through this, he starts to suspect this another neighbor (David Morse) may be up to something.This isn't really intended as a horror movie; more of a suspense thriller. The absence of gore makes it slightly more interesting than the average entry in this genre. The main strength is how they set it up so that you're not sure which character really is doing what, and each character gets to make his/her point about things. No, this movie's not a masterpiece by any stretch; it doesn't even begin to reach ""Rear Window"" in terms of quality. But if you're looking for a better-than-usual suspense thriller, this is one that I would recommend. Also starring Carrie-Anne Moss (of ""The Matrix"") and Aaron Yoo.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"simple, effective thriller","""Disturbia"" is ""Rear Window"" with gadgets - lots and lots of gadgets. Forget the high-powered binoculars that Jimmy Stewart had to rely upon in that earlier film to fulfill his voyeuristic tendencies; that's strictly old school stuff compared to the PCs, cell phones, camcorders and various other technological marvels the hero of ""Disturbia"" uses for his spying and sleuthing. Thus, what is a bane for modern-day paranoiacs is clearly a boon for neighborhood Peeping Toms.Shia LeBeouf is Kale, a suburban teen placed under house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher after the latter makes a cutting remark about Kale's recently deceased father one day in class. Literally stuck at home with nothing to do, Kale begins to wile away the hours spying on his various neighbors, including, naturally, a young blonde hottie who has conveniently moved in right next door to the horny prisoner. Kale also begins to suspect that the man down the street, who spends most of his free time benignly mowing his lawn, may, in fact, be a serial killer who lures beautiful women into his home and violently dispatches them. Soon, Kale, his best friend from school, Ronnie, and the blonde cutie, named (what else?) Ashley, are crime-solving with the best of them, uncovering clues and closing in on the suspect even as they become aware that they might not be quite as invisible to their intended target as they originally thought they were.Despite its tendency to wander off into Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew-level melodramatics at times, ""Disturbia"" is a generally tidy little thriller, refreshingly simple and straightforward in a time when such films tends to be just a little too clever and a little too convoluted for their own good (the screenplay is blessedly devoid of those ""surprise"" turnabout plot twists that are practically de rigeur in modern movie thrillers). There are plenty of holes and inconsistencies in the storyline, as is perhaps to be expected, but co-writers Christopher B. Landon and Carl Ellsworth, and director D. J. Caruso keep us from fixating too much on them with the skill of their film-making. The climactic scenes are wickedly suspenseful, even if just about every shot feels derived from some previous film (""The Silence of the Lambs,"" ""The Shining,"" ""Poltergeist,"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" seem to be the primary sources here).The key factor in ""Disturbia""'s success lies in LaBeouf's star-making performance in the lead role. This talented and charismatic young actor has a slightly befuddled, puppy dog expression that gives the character the vulnerability he needs to make his heroics convincing. He is nicely complemented by Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer as his partners in crime-detection, and by David Morse (the dad in ""Contact"") as the killer next door.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I jumped out of my chair!,"I was pretty excited to watch Disturbia. Actually, I just couldn't wait to watch it... and as I expected the movie ended up to be a great movie, appealing to the eye and very interesting. Shia Labeouf showed once more the great talent he possesses (such a talent that I've seen in many other movies he was in). I've seen a lot of horror movies and thrillers and with Disturbia I really jumped out of my chair! There were quite scary scenes and I really enjoyed it. The soundtrack is fabulous and it mixed perfectly with the scene. The only thing I disagree with is the ending. I think it could have been done in a different way, I mean, all that kissing makes us think that we have been watching a romantic comedy. Well, the movie had (in deed) some really funny scenes: like Ronnie and Kale's embarrassment because of Ashley's presence. I laughed a lot. I really enjoyed watching it and I gotta agree that it is definitely one of the best thrillers I've seen. And one more time I have to congratulate Shia Labeouf because he is on the good way to become one of the best actors ever, and for me he already is one of the best actors - it all because of the natural way that he speaks, the easy way that he makes us laugh and cry.

Could have been much better,"There are undeniably positive aspects to this sort of Rear Window remake that is Disturbia: the actors are accurate, the direction is rather good and the script is very dynamic so that it is hard to get bored.But the mix of genres D.J. Caruso wanted to rely on works badly. The teen movie aspect, particularly present during the first hour, is superfluous and doesn't match particularly well the thriller part which actually deserved more development and most importantly a lot sooner in the movie in order to create a real build-up of tension. In fact, the plot starts to unfold too late and therefore the twists flow together a bit roughly and too fast. Moreover, the transitions aren't particularly smooth and you go from a light and clichÃ© scene to tense and thriller one in just an instant which is a bit awkward.It is frustrating because there was much better to do with these elements. Yet, the movie, though not outstanding, is enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A decent movie,"I always like to see the original before i see the remake but i had not seen Alfred Hitchcock's's 'Rear Window' when i stumbled across this movie but decided to watch it anyway.First off i like the idea of this movie. A late teen is forced to stay home during summer holidays. So it doesn't seem a big deal because of all the technology he has in his room but thanks to his mum he no longer has that. Now that in itself would be my worst nightmare.He starts spying on his neighbors and begins to suspect one of them is a murderer. A fairly simple plot but it works.Before this i had only seen Shia LaBeouf in minor roles in such films as I, Robot and Constantine but his performance was fantastic in the lead role, Sarah Roemer did a good job playing 'The girl next door' and David Morse was exceptional as the creepy neighbor who is a suspected murderer.This movie is not overly good but is definitely worth watching, if not owning in your DVD collection. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbingly good.,"At first, when I discovered that the movie was being made, the elitist gene kicked in. It annoyed me that another classic film (Rear Window) was being given a 'teen flick' make-over, and I refused to entertain the possibility that Disturbia would be anything short of an asinine, tensionless attempt at a thriller; however, my preconceptions were soon crippled.While I was watching Disturbia I found myself thinking: 'This movie has no right be this good!' I realise this sounds ridiculous, every film should be judged on its own merits, but this is based on a classic Hitchcock film. Don't get me wrong, the Hitchcockian tension is missing; though there is a nice air of mild tension brought about through generic action, rather than the subtle style and meaningful camera shots of Rear Window. Shia Lebeouf and David Morse (especially) help bring about suspense through strong performances; Morse is at his best, giving a particularly unsettling performance.Disturbia's lighting, camera-work and cinematography also lend nicely to the film's caliginous atmosphere; creating uneasiness through shadows and a sense of unknown. The camera-work is especially tense when shot through the hand held camera, drawing the audience into the action, in essence putting them where the characters are.The film also moves along at an interesting pace, always keeping the attention and not letting the audience drift off to think about something else. Even when the teenagers are watching Morse's character the story still remains interesting and captivating.Obviously the ending of the film is a typical Hollywood one. The change from tense atmospheric film-making to fast paced action does take something away from the overall feel of the film, although it is not without its good points; the action is enthralling and there is still a slight sense of the tension (through lighting an camera-work) that came before it.All in all, Disturbia offers a lot more than one may first think. The atmospheric tension and the strong performances alone are enough to warrant watching the film. If the idea of a Rear Window remake is putting you off watching this film, it shouldn't. Disturbia differs enough from Rear Window to stop a constant comparison, but contains enough of the basic plot line to allow the film a decent story.Not a must see, but definitely not a waste of time. A solid, highly enjoyable thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

We've needed a jumpy scary movie just to let us rest awhile from the gore fest that we've had the past couple of years. This movie made me laugh like nothing else, but made me jump.

"Problems aside, the film is an effective and solid thriller","Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a troubled teen, and seems to not be learning any lessons. A provoked assault leads him to court, where he is sentenced to house arrest for three months, and is fitted with an ankle monitor ensuring he is not going anywhere. He slowly begins to grow bored, and eventually, begins to spy on his neighbours. While he begins to take a liking to Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the new girl next door, he begins to suspect another neighbour, Robert Turner (David Morse), may be a serial killer.When I first saw the trailer, I immediately equated Disturbia together with Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (and all of the classic imitations and parodies that have come with it since its debut well over fifty years ago. And while it does follow some very familiar ground in its premise, Disturbia actually turned out to be much more than a simple re-imagining for the teenage crowd in the 2000's.For one, Disturbia is more thrilling than you could imagine. Yes, it is highly predictable (although the opening ten minutes, if you know very little about the film, may come as a surprise), but that does not stop it from keeping you on alert for almost the entirety of the last third of the film. It does a lot of building up to certain moments, and when they hit, they hit rapidly and do not stop coming. It is suspenseful right to its core, and does not feel like it is trying too hard to be like so many other teenage thrillers. It is not particularly scary in most respects however (unless you are a bit too easily jumpy), but for what it sets out to accomplish, it does a very good job.What may prove to be bothersome is the fact that the film takes a bit too long to build towards the actual spying Kale does after he begins to suspect Turner as a killer. He is not introduced as any character of importance until well into the film, and after he is, it takes another little while before he really begins to do anything for it. Instead, we have to endure through Kale slowly losing his sanity (and never once really using the Internet, despite it and the living room cable TV being the only thing his mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) does not seem to take away) and almost stalking Ashley. I realize that they want to flesh out Kale as much as they can, but there is only so much that can be done before the film becomes overly tedious with its fleshing out. The creepy voyeur aspect to the film is a little weird to accept at times, but its merit as a social satire is quite intriguing nonetheless. And when Morse finally gets to chew up some screen time, the film does not want to let him, and almost forces him to continue to stay in the background.And speaking of Moss's character, what purpose does she serve in any of this? She has a point in the ending, and she serves a point to take away Kale's X-Box Live and iTunes accounts (at least the product placement does not get nearly as bad as in Transformers), but does not do much else. Her character has basically no motivations, and when she gets a little bit of the emotional material in the film, you do not know whether it is worth feeling for her or just wishing they completely cut her out of the film entirely. Much the same goes for the annoying Jose Pablo Cantillo playing Officer Gutierrez, the police officer who always seems to be on hand if Kale steps out of his proximity zone. He gives the film a few laughs, but is pretty much useless in the grand scheme of things.I do like what they tried to do with the story and the focus on Kale's character, but I think they could have tightened a bit further by losing some of his exposition and making Turner's a little more honed in (so when the inevitability of the predictable moments begin, there is more to him than the plainly obvious things). This is a movie with a very small cast of speaking roles, and they easily could have shifted things around and reworked certain moments in the film to be a lot more synthetic than others. As said previously, I was actually kind of surprised with how much better the film was than I ever would have assumed, so these gripes could have only made the film all the better than it already is.LaBeouf does very well as the main character. He has a certain likability about him that makes us genuinely invested in what his character feels and does throughout the film, and he never once loses it. He makes the character very believable, and lends him a certain aura of authenticity. This is a character that LaBeouf could actually be like in real life, and it shows in how easy it seems for him to be acting within the role (and how he is not straining so hard like he does in Transfomers).Morse, as always, does very well in his role. I do not want to spoil his most meaty scenes, but suffice to say, he is very kind and terrifyingly frightening all at once. He easily switches from emotion to emotion like someone is flicking a lightswitch, and much like LaBeouf, makes the role believable and real.Roemer, Moss and Aaron Yoo as Kale's friend Ronnie all put in worthwhile performances that only further complement the work done by LaBeouf and Morse. Each (especially Moss) could have done with a little bit more exposition though.As much as I hate to say it, I was rather impressed with Disturbia. It is an effective thriller with a few problems, but is otherwise quite a worthwhile watch.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Kale, in spite of himself....","Kale, simply isn't into studying, especially Spanish. And when confronted in class about not doing the assignment, he slugs the teacher. Not good, but the judge cuts him a break, as apparently it was not his first brush with the legal system. He is sentenced to three months home confinement with strict rules. And what is worst, tormented by three neighborhood boys, quite young and obnoxious. And to make things worse, a cousin of the teacher is a police officer. If he ventures more than 100 feet from the monitor, an alarm goes off and the police immediately arrive, especially the cousin.. Well, the neighbor kids light a bag of you what on the porch and he tries to stomp it out, and naturally starts to chase them, with the obvious results. His mother also cuts off some of his streaming services, so he gets stir crazy. He starts spying on the neighbors. In some ways, if he pursued his education with half the effort of spying, he would be much better off. But then there would be no story. Without going further into the story, the climax of the film is full of tension and suspense, and actually redeems what seemed to be a failing movie. Kale is of high school age, and has a friend Ronnie which makes for quite a pair. And Ashley is the neighbor girl who of course is quite attractive.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Go See Disturbia!!!  (*May Contain Spoilers!!!*),"Other viewers may disagree, but Disturbia is a wonderful teen thriller that, more often than not, borrows the basis of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (with elements of The Silence of the Lambs) and expands on it.Shia LaBeouf is Kale, a young high-schooler on house arrest, after popping his Spanish teacher, who made a rude remark about the teen's late father.Definitely not handling the ankle-bracelet-thingie as gracefully as Martha Stewart did, Kale comically begins to go stir-crazy in the confines of his house.When new neighbors move in next door, Kale becomes interested in the lovely young Ashley, nicely portrayed by Sarah Roemer.Kale begins to watch her every move (from the lonely confines of his house) and also begins to take in the abnormal-normal routines of his neighborhood (hence the title).Aaron Yoo wonderfully plays Kale's computer geek buddy Ronnie with a wonderful ease and naturalness; seeing him and LaBeouf work off each other is a treat (and doesn't feel one bit phony). Soon, the two of them have Ashley in Kale's upstairs lair, observing the neighbors.And it's not long when one character really starts their suspicions: the subtly creepy Mr. Turner, played with ease by David Morse (Brutal in The Green Mile) Mr. Morse's turn gives oomph! to this snake-in-the-grass, and it's this addition that makes the similarities to Rear Window kick in.Of more, I cannot say, except that Kale has a few run-ins with the police (the ankle-bracelet works!) and unwittingly plays into the villain's hands when his emotions get the better of him, before the conclusion of this enjoyable film.I'll definitely be buying this one on DVD when it is finally released.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thriller Plus Teenage Angst,"The prologue scene before the opening credits really gave me quite a jolt! Turns out that that smashing scene sort of just sets up the personality of the lead character Kale played by Shia LaBeouf.He socks his Spanish teacher one day and gets put under house arrest. I am the type who might even enjoy this type of confinement. But apparently Kale most definitely isn't. He gets very restless on the very first day since his X-Box and Online activities were curtailed. In addition, he gets sassy with his mom, who gets even by cutting off the plug of his TV. Bereft of things to do, he starts looking out his windows, into the lives of his next-door neighbors. He gets very excited with pretty and tone Ashley, who just so happened to just move in with her family. However, the suspense comes in when he notices very strange goings-on with his other neighbor Mr. Turner. Is he involved with a series of missing women?As far as the actors, I see Shia as a young John Cusack, with a sad-sack charm about him. I just have to say that this guy is lucky to be able to romance gorgeous Megan Fox in ""Transformers"", and now the beautiful and sexy Sarah Roemer in this movie. I just felt his room was too over-the-top messy. I couldn't be THAT bad! I totally failed to recognize Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mom! David Morse, on the other hand, is really getting the hang of playing these creepy characters. I certainly have seen him in other movies with characters like Mr. Turner. For the Asian best friend Ronnie, he just had to totally be geeky. What a stereotype! For his credit, actor Aaron Woo did quite well in this obnoxious role.This is teen angst meets ""Rear Window."" There were really scenes that bring you to the edge of your seats. The scene of Mr. Turner and Ashley in the car is classic creepy. Same with the ""Blair Witch""-style camera work when Ronnie breaks into Mr. Turner's garage and house. Exciting! The angst scenes however did not really sit well with me. I think they are way overblown.Just OK with me overall. I would not call it a waste of time. Some tense and exciting suspense scenes that make it worthwhile to catch in theaters.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The trio of young actors were very likable, giving professional and truthful performances and I feel that all three will enjoy even greater success given the breaks.

The movie is beautifully shot and edited and director Caruso is to be congratulated on his economy of style. I enjoyed his movie ""The Salton Sea"" enormously:the commercial success of ""Disturbia"" will do his cause nothing but good.

Very good!,After his father s accidental death Kale (Shia LaBeouf) remains withdrawn and troubled. When he lashes out at a well-intentioned but insensitive teacher he finds himself under a court-ordered house arrest. His mother continues to cope working extra shifts to support herself and her son as she tries in vain to understand the changes in his personality. The walls of his house begin to close in on Kale as he takes chances to extend the boundaries both physical and emotional of his confinement. His interests turn outside the windows of his suburban home toward those of his neighbors including a mutual attraction to the new girl next door (Sarah Roemer). Together they begin to suspect that another neighbor is a serial killer. Are their suspicions merely the product of Kale s cabin fever and vivid imagination?

Predictably Fun...Seriously!,"I don't wanna sound biased, but I do love Shia LaBeouf, but am not a huge fan of horror/crime movies. Since he was in this, I figured it would be worth a see. I have now seen it several times and plan on buying it in the near future.I love this movie! Okay, sure the plot is very predictable and we've seen this before, so what makes it so good?

"Strong middle, shame about beginning and end!","As teen movies go Disturbia certainly manages to reach new heights based on its dubious concept which can only be described as Alfred Hitchcock meets council estate chic.The elaborate opening car crash sets the tone for jumps a-plenty as Shia LaBeouf's angst-ridden teen Kale gets over his Dad's death the only way modern day teens can; by punching his teacher. His comeuppance is a summer holiday spent under house arrest with only last years must have fashion accessory (an electronic tag) for company. Never fear however as soon there is plenty to entertain him in the guise of fit-and-she-knows it Ashley (Sarah Roemer), comedy companion Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and is he/isn't he murderer Robert Turner (David Morse).The drama of Disturbia's opening, however, only serves to highlight its uselessness in terms of what it contributes to the whole piece. Obviously it's designed to ensure we feel sympathetic to Kale but by the time the film reaches the hour mark you'll be so far towards the edge of your seat that you'll have forgotten why it is he can't leave the house and spy on Turner anyway. The films conclusion is similarly pointless as director D. J. Caruso sacrifices all sense of tension and dread for a messy miss-match of genres and ideas which never leave us in any doubt about each respective character's fate.Disturbia's opening can be ignored but it is its end which spoils a fantastic middle section where Caruso shows real talent to increase the tension through clever suggestion rather than overt horror shtick. LaBeouf similarly turns his angst-ridden Kale into a sympathetic character whose frustration draws the audience in to a point where you really don't mind when he treads on thin ice spying on a near-naked Ashley in her bedroom and subsequently her pool.Occasionally Disturbia is too-ready to revert to simple scare tactics (jumping cats, hands on shoulders, etc.) but there is enough crafted tension here to keep you confined to your seat without the need for a smartly crafted ankle bracelet.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst movie ever!,"My husband an I watched this movie yesterday. We had recorded it from TV and I was so glad that we did not pay any money for it (cinema tickets or DVDs). It is by far the most predictable movie I have seen in a long time. Without reading any summary we knew what was going to happen within the first 10 minutes of the movie. And somehow we knew how it would end.Rough summary without spoilers: Boy looses father in accident and starts to behave badly. Boy gets house arrest. Boy gets bored and watches his neighbors - which soon includes the Girl. And a potential killer. Oh, spooky.... not! Just one of the fine examples of stupidity in this movie: No matter how bad it gets, they seem to always have their cell phones handy but none of them is clever enough to call 911.I cannot recommend this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid flick,"I'm not going to lie, I went into this movie pretty skeptical because of the whole ""It is exactly the same as Rear Window"" thing. However, upon viewing, it's a pretty solid flick. The only thing I noticed that would even be close to Rear Window is the fact that he is watching his neighbors. Actually, it kinda ties in to The 'Burbs more than it does Rear Window.Now to the brass tax. The film had some pretty solid acting for a movie of this type. Shia LaBeouf pulls off the paranoid character extremely well and his friend Ronnie, Aaron Yoo, does a great job as his accomplice. The beautiful Sarah Roemer as Shia love interest seems to act as the sensible one out of the three of them. David Morse also does a stellar job as the next-door potential serial killer.The filming is also done quite well, lots of tension building shots and quick cuts make for a thrilling ride.All in all, the film was pretty solid, definitely worth a rent.

Tittalating  yet affective teen-focused thriller...,"1st watched 2/27/2009 Â– 6 out of 10(Dir-D.J. Caruso): Tittalating yet affective teen-focused thriller with the newly christened big star, Shia Lebeouf. He's good enough to carry a movie despite his early goofball beginnings with his Disney channel comedy, ""Even Stevens.(which I have to admit I liked) This movie is similar to other peeping tom movies where they see something they shouldn't but this one's a little more complex. Shia's character is on house arrest by punching his teacher after he made a comment about his recently deceased father. After his mom pulls the plug on his xbox, Itunes, and TV he runs out of things to do and starts spying on his neighbors. At first he just entices his hormones by watching a teasing neighbor girl, but then gets interested in a neighbor who appears to be doing questionable things.(like possibly killing a woman he brought home?) He ties his suspicions in with a killer he read about in the newspaper and starts believing this is him. Sarah Roemer is very flirtacious as Shea's lust, I mean love, interest and he also has an Asian friend to do some of his dirty work for him. This group of teens are fun to watch and you never really know if their inklings are true until near the end. Then, of course, you get the good old chase with the main psycho character at the end. Despite the movie's similarities to other movies of this type the movie is fresh and exciting to watch mainly because of the new talent and they play out their characters well.

Beach Blanket Bingo meets Henry the Serial Killer,"****SPOILERS**** Funny in an unusual sort of way ""Disturbia"" despite it's last fifteen bloodcurdling minutes doesn't really have anyone in it's cast killed on screen. Yes the serial killer in the film had racked up over a score of victims all across the country but for some strange reason try as he could he couldn't as much as even draw blood much less kill, with the exception of an unfortunate policeman, the persons that he's really after in the film.The only person killed, besides the cop as his killer, on screen in the movie is its star young Kale's, Shia LaBeouf, dad Mr. Brecht, Matt Craven, in a spectacular car crash early in the film. Kale is very sensitive as well as guilty, he was in the car with his dad when the accident happened, over his fathers death. It's a year later that Kale gets a bit disturbed when his Spanish teacher Senor Gutierrez, Rene Rivera, told the disruptive student what his father would think of his actions if her were alive today. Kale not having an answer to Gutierrez's question lands a stiff right to his head, giving Gutierrez a king size shiner, and ends up with three months house arrest.The movie goes on with Kale stuck at home, with an electronic ankle brace, and having nothing to do but spy on his neighbors with his binoculars and state-of-the-art electronic spying equipment. Doing the usual crazy antics that you would expect from a teenager, without a cause, like Kale he gets his fellow Spanish class student Korean/American Ronnie, Aaron Yoo, to help him out. Ronnie goes outside the 100 foot perimeter, set by the court for Kale, checking things, with a video/DVD camera, out for him in what's going on, with the cute and sexy chicks, in the neighborhoodEverything is just groovy for Kale and Ronnie who later get to become friendly with Kale's new next door neighbor Ashley, Sarah Roemer. It's Ashley who the two horny teenagers had been spying on for days as she undressed in her bedroom, with the sades up, and went for daily dips, wearing an microscopic bikini, in her parents swimming pool. It's when Kale notices his other new next door neighbor Mr. Turnner, David Morse, acting a bit funny with the fact that a local young woman was just kidnapped the day before that he decides to play detective.***SPOILER ALERT***Throwing away all the good times he was having in spying on his neighbors, mostly scantly clad and shapely teenage girls, up until then Kale begins to stalk, together with Ronnie and Ashley, poor Mr. Turner day and night making his up until them serene and quite life a living hell. Kale is out to see if Mr.Turner is in fact someone you wouldn't want to leave alone with the kids wife or even family pet. Mr. Turner, wanting very much to be a good neighbor, for his part tries to be as friendly as he can be with the suspicious Kale and friends. The mild mannered and soft-spoken Mr. Turner goes so far as helping Kale's mom Mrs. Julie Brecht, Carrie-Ann Moss, with her groceries and even fixes her cars flat tire.Almost getting himself arrested by the police for breaking into Mr. Turners house Kale, whom the kind and understanding Mr. Turner refused to press charges against, is warned by the police and his guidance counselor that the next time he screws up they'll put him away in the lock-up, with hardened criminals, for a year. Still refusing to give up on his almost around the clock persecution of the very, who's nerves by now has reached their breaking point, kind and understanding Mr. Turner Kale gets exactly what he wants but not how he thought he would get it; A face to face confrontation with a psycho serial murderer. Kale by crying wolf for so long in accusing the lovable and Teddy Bear-like Mr. Turner of being a serial killer has no one believe, as if they did before, him now when a real live and blood-thirsty serial killer came on the scene.You never get the feeling that ""Disturbia"" is what it tries so hard to be in its scaring the hell out of you. Everything about it, in trying to be a horror film, is so out of focus that it comes across as a Three Stooges comedy short with almost nobody, despite all the suffering their put through, really getting hurt. The teenagers, Kale & friend, act like those playful and party going youths and teenagers in 1960's Frankie Avalon & Annette Funicello beach party movies. They don't for a moment give you the impression that their being stalked and attacked, with the intent of being murdered, by a serial psycho killer at all!P.S In fact Kale's ordeal in being involved with a serial psycho killer, whom in the end he does in, doesn't at all impressed the police or even his schools probation officer!

Thriller,"What would you do if you believed your next-door neighbor was a serial killer? Disturbia (2007) takes this question to an intense new level. After being put on house arrest for the entire three months of summer, 17-year-old Kale Brecht (Shia LeBeouf) has resorted to spying on his neighbors to pass the time. This is all very entertaining at first, but when reports of missing girls appear on the news, Kale begins to suspect his next-door neighbor is the serial killer. Kale has no hard evidence, and the only people who believe him are his two friends. Not being able to leave his house without setting off an alarm, Kale and his friends must feverishly work to find the proof they need in a race for time against a cold blooded killer.This action-packed thriller will have you gripping the edge of your seat, as well as laughing at the comedic personalities of Kale and his friends. The characters alter the mood of the movie by adding a surprising comic relief in key parts, making this movie as much of a romantic comedy as it is a horror film. But don't be fooled, the terrifying sequence of events, enhanced by a key selection of music and sound will keep you on your toes and constantly guessing. The director, D.J. Caruso, gives the audience a unique perspective into Kales' thoughts by means of his camera and his binoculars, which he is cleverly using to spy on his neighbor. The camera adds symbolic meaning by allowing the viewer to see the situation through Kales' eyes. Along with the entertaining character personalities, the setting really does a lot to draw the viewer in. Low lighting enhances the disturbing mood, and paired with a mixture of close up shots, this really shows the fear within the characters. Medium shots are also used, especially during the scene where Kale decides to break into his neighbors house in search of his friend who goes missing, to allow for the possibility of surprise to jump out from around every corner: this movie will leave the viewer in a constant state of suspense. Set in the suburbs, this movie really makes you wonder; ""Could there be a killer living next to me?"" making this film a nail-biting horror must see.I would give this movie five stars, for the captivating performance of the lead actors, as well as the action packed, mind gripping plot. D.J. Caruso did an amazing job at updating the classic Rear Window. By adding a few modern elements such as cameras, an updated plot, and a talented cast of young actors; Disturbia has set new standards for the chilling ""serial killer neighbor"" movie. Anyone who is in need of a suspenseful, action packed, yet witty movie, look no farther. Disturbia will have you jumping out of your seat.

WTF,This is literally just the plot of rear window but so much worse.,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Movie - Lousy Last Act,"Far more compelling than is to be reasonably expected of such teen-friendly PG13 thrillers. Of course, it lacks the wit and finesse of the original 'Rear Window', but in all honesty, 'Disturbia' really isn't trying to be a remake; it just steals the basic premise. The leads are all excellent Â– David Morse does his quietly chilling thing and LaBeouf really surprises with a far more complex performance than we've come to expect from such genre fodder. Sarah Roehmer is clearly the weakest link, struggling to bring any level of depth or realism to her character.The screenplay by Christopher Landon is packed with inexplicable and gaping plot holes Â– why is Kale's mother, a realtor, never at home at night? Where did all the party goers vanish to? Why did the police never check the VIN number on the neighbor's car? But such holes rarely get in the way of Caruso's expert handling of the mounting tension. As is the way with promising horror/thrillers of late, however, (remember 'Vacancy'?), a solid and suspenseful film morphs into a lazy and generic slasher movie in the final act.For those with an interest in such things, special note should be made of Tom Southwell, who spent the better part of twenty years as an illustrator on such movies as 'Blade Runner', 'Goonies', and 'Mission: Impossible', and here creates a beautifully detailed Craftsman home that acts as the primary location of the much of the action.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another good thriller from director D.J.

It wasn't so violent or bloody as described in many critics. This is a modern remake from the classic REAR WINDOW with James Stewart and the director succeeded in implementing more plots, suspense and twists than in Hitchcock's one. There were scenes that my wife has to close her eyes so you can easily imagine what kind of effects DISTURBIA offers.If you like this genre I recommend you TRAPPED, THE BONE COLLECTOR or DON'T SAY A WORD.

Not ordinarily the type of movie I'd watch but having recently watched a different Hitchcock remake, this came up as a recommendation in a similar vein, although I first had to get myself get over its awful title.The pitch is roughly the same, with the clever twist that the troublesome teenager here, Shia LeBouf's character, is restricted to his room (okay and to his garden too) not by a broken leg as James Stewart was, but by an electronic tag around his ankle which he git after punching out one of his teachers. For about an hour, you have to sit through the movie's teen sex-comedy tilt at its target audience as LeBouf and his Chinese-American chum get their kicks spying on his neighbours, in particular the bikinied young female who's just entered the neighbourhood. I could have happily missed out all the goofiness not to mention the casual voyeurism but things do pick up when the big bad serial-murderer comes into his view.Aided by a pounding soundtrack, the film builds to a decent climax as LeBouf, his mate and especially his new girlfriend-next-door combine to save his own mom, yes, seriously and of course take down David Morse's nightmare of a neighbour.Although the film can't escape it's widely over-contrived plot jumps, making allowances for my widely out-of-synch personal demographic, it's not that bad a thriller and if it also managed turn a few youngsters onto the real deal of one of the Master's very best features, even later in life, then I'm happy enough that this exists.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disrturbia is a remake Hitchcock would be proud of!,"OK so i don't pay full price to see movies these days because they are mostly just crap...""scary"" movies are just sex, violence, and gore...they lack any real suspense...is that not what makes you scared?... if i go to the theater i go to the dollar theater on 50 cent Tuesdays....that way if the movie is not any good i just dig into my couch cushions and I have recovered the 50 cents i just lost...but i went out with some friends and they paid for me to go see Disturbia on opening night...so again if it sucked i wouldn't feel it in my own pocket...and i am here to tell you that i am going back today 2 days later to see this movie again...and I'm paying the full price...it was truly intensely entertaining...it had suspense...like honest to god suspense...I have seen rear window so i knew the basic gist and outcome of the movie...and Shia LeBeouf is a really good actor(i will be honest i was a little skeptical)...because he is funny with dry sarcasm but he makes the scene feel real...he makes you feel his anxiety and his fear for the people he loves...i cant wait to see more of him...and the rest of the cast did an excellent job too...all in all it was a great movie...and that is a rare commodity today...",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

INCREDIBLE Thriller,"I LOVED this movie because I had been TRUELLY wanting a thriller that would actually make me jump in my seat. The acting is BETTER than most thriller that have mostly a teenage cast. The writing is also than most thriller with a teenage cast because they all interact with each other very well and the adult actors also have a GREAT chemistry with the younger actors. The execution is ALMOST FLAWLESS because there is very little continuity errors. The editing is also FANTASTIC because the transition between Kale's house and Ashley's house is EXCELLENT because Kale's house and Ashley's house were NOT next door to each other, Kale's house was shot at one location and Ashley's house was shout a completely different location and the continuity between them is SEAMLESS.

Not Another Teen Movie,"This is basically a teen comedy that should have been parodied by Not Another Teen Movie.This film bogs down in overlong cutesy scenes of domestic soap opera, romance, or the zany friend. This focus just evaporates any suspense. Then the film switches from comedy to suspense and things start to feel tense, but it soon jumps back to comedy again. Then the final act is just a ridiculous Dark Ride of over the top illogical horrors that do not fit anything we have seen in the lead up.Robert Morse is excellent playing the scary villain but the constant shifts in tone of the film mean the suspense never builds.Sarah Roemer was good as Ashley but the lingering shots of her in the pool are just too much.

"1st half is a waste, but 2nd half is good","I liked this film, I would've given it an 8 instead of a 7 had it not been for the tone of the first half of the movie.The first 51% of the movie spends so much unnecessary time focusing on the theme of ""angst-ridden, misunderstood teen meets the attractive, slightly eccentric, rebellious girl, who is seemingly part of the 'normal' crowd, yet is introspective and ordinary enough to understand and befriend that teen, who she becomes romantically interested in, afterall, what other outcome could there possibly be when two people like this meet each other."" Does that sound like the beginning to a suspense/thriller, or a melodrama like Garden State or The United States of Leland?On top of that, they made the first half of the movie a comedy. There's nothing wrong with any of these elements, but they didn't belong here. They should've used all that time to build suspense and intrigue, instead they put so much time into painting a very very detailed picture of his life (which is usually a good thing), and his relationship with the girl. What was the payoff in that? She played ZERO role in the finals acts of the film. See what I mean about wasted screen time?

Let down by the clichÃ©d David Morse character,"A bored suburban teenager (Shia LaBeouf) on house arrest starts spying on his neighbours, making one of them his girlfriend (Sarah Roemer), before the two begin suspecting that another neighbour (David Morse) might in fact be a serial killer. This by 2007 standards chic thriller directed by D. J. Caruso (Eagle Eye) retains a rather attractive offbeat quality for much of its running time, with LaBeouf serving as an effective tool for the film's study of various ethical borderlands. That is, until we're approaching the solution and the clichÃ©d David Morse character takes centre stage. Most everything about the finale is a let-down.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Refreshing to have thrills without gore,"Disturbia was a successful thriller, in that it had jolts. The plot was paint by numbers obvious - about everything you expect to have happen does- but the presentation got you jumping out of your seat. No gore, which disappointed my teen age son, who expected more of a horror movie than a conventional thriller.The romantic subplot was distracting, but Sarah Roemer, a twentysomething ex model playing the teen hottie was ornamental, and it filled in the spaces between jolts. Personally, I thought Carrie Ann Moss as the Mom was hotter than Roemer.Shia Lebeouf has enough charm to remain sympathetic as the hero despite being under house arrest. His twinkle in the eye makes the comic relief sparkle. He is a bit less convincing in the romantic lead side of things, and thus I have reservations about him being the next Tom Hanks, let alone the next Cary Grant. But being the next Jimmy Stewart would be just fine.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

too predictable.......,"First things first, Disturbia was not one of the must intense thriller's of the decade. No doubt Shia LeBouf is on his way to stardom, but even he couldn't save this movies predictable plot. My problem with this movie is almost like every other modern day ""thriller/horror"" movie. It took way too long to get good, I understand character development as well as having a general plot. But damn, was this a love story with a crazy murderer for a neighbor or was this supposed to keep me on the edge of my seat for the whole hour & a half? I was hoping for a twist, a turn or something shocking. After discovering that his neighbor moved from Texas & the murderer on the news was from Texas, Shia becomes obsessed with watching this guys every move. You spend the whole time wondering if this suspicious creepy neighbor is in fact the murderer from the news & wow it is! The last 20 minutes was cool but the previous hour was not worth siting through just to get to that point. Again, not taking away from Shia's acting, but dude if you want to be taken as a serious actor & be the next big thing you should pick your scripts a bit better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
not a spoiler,"Disturbia is a must see movie for people older than 13 but younger than 90 because some parts get very intense and we would not want a heart-attack to result. Anyway, Shia LaBeuf is amazing in this film and the neighbor also does a superb job of playing his role. Disturbia is a great film because it has its suspense, its romance, and it has comedy thrown in there as well. It is a very good movie to see in theaters because it is a thriller, so the big screen is always a plus. Its definitely a movie worth seeing, the actors are great and the plot is very well done. All in all its very well done and you will not find yourself at all bored during any point in this movie if anything you will be peeing your pants because it gets scary. Disturbia is a more realistic scary kind of movie, not like other horror or thriller films where it ends up not being scary at all because its just so ridiculous and unbelievable.

Good movie with some bumps on the way,"This movie is not perfect. But it does have some bright moments. The acting is very good, The one thing I really loved was the suspense. It was gut-wrenching.

The suspense was good for the first half of the movie. But then it got old and you wanted to go home. That doesn't completely effect this movie, but you will notice this. Also, some of the scenes were unrealistic. This is a good movie, but could improve. And with the IMDb score being 7.1, my rating is pretty accurate.

A pretty strong thriller,"Refreshing to see such a film that's capable of building up suspense at the right moments without taking itself too seriously. Impressive stuff considering there's no blood and gore and it's all for a PG-13 audience. The 'thriller' part of the film is almost forgotten at times since you're just having so much fun with the characters and the teen drama aspect of it. The actors all played their parts pretty well, none of them were glaringly out-of-place. Shia LaBeouf is shaping out to be quite a solid male lead, but Aaron Yoo was probably the MVP here with a hilarious turn as Ronnie. Sarah Roemer may not be Elisha, but she's still hot and teasing enough to keep you both intrigued and frustrated at the same time. I didn't think much of David Morse's acting Â– he was just quiet whilst lacking the intimidating intelligence exhibited by, say, Sir Anthony Hopkins. Some of the events were not entirely believable, and required a few deus ex machinas to move things along, but that's to be expected from a thriller where the protagonist is not a professional. The soundtrack is your typical teen-angsty stuff, perfect when you're feeling sorry for yourself. There's probably some deep philosophical subtext on the lack of privacy in the modern world if you dig around long enough, but really, what's the point? Overall, a pretty strong thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Red Herrings and David Morse...what more could you ask for?,"Troubled high school kid Kale(Shia LaBeouf,spelling?),already struggling with his father's death in accident that he survived and unable to connect to his equally agrieved mother(Carrie Anne Moss,probably the best looking mom on THAT block),then clocks his Spanish teacher and it lands him under arrest when the teacher presses charges. The condition of the arrest has him under house arrest,and his punishment becomes a fight with boredom. That fight becomes a practice in mostly harmless voyeurism that nets him two things: the improbable interest of the attractive new girl on the block(Sarah Roemer) and the realization that one of his other neighbors(David Morse)may be in fact a brutal serial killer. To anyone who has seen ""Rear Window""(or any other knock-off of Alfred Hitchcock movies will tell you),you kind of know where this story is going next.This show is,as per any Hitchcockian-type movie,possessing of no fewer than four ""Red Herings""(things that are thrown into a film to throw the viewer off the trail of what really is happening,who is doing what,or even misdirect as to the true source of menace)where KAle,Ashley(the girl) and doofy friend Ronnie(Aaron Yoo)find themselves tripping over to expose the true intentions of the otherwise quiet,reserved and perceivably friendly killer. If you can look past some of the implausibilities of the movie--examples being: how does a simple class three assault of a teacher amount to a house arrest with the potential for a felony upgrade or how a newly relocated would-be serial killer have the foresight and house space to relocate every single shred of evidence of their crimes?--and stay interested in the inevitabilities of the boy and girl getting together,it's quite possible(As it was for I)that you'll find this movie quite enthralling and even nerve-rattling. Director D.J.Caruso is able to effectively use space,movement and lots(and lots)of camera screens to enhance the visuals of this film,which is constricted to almost entirely the P.O.V. of the hero,Kale. Also,Morse as the would-be-scoundrel is VERY effective in a cool,calm,almost charming ""guy next door"",countering and blunting just about every attempt Kale has of exposing him of who he really suspect him to be.A good,solid,satisfying rent that won't make anybody's ""Best of..."" lists,if you can look past some rather pedestrian touches,you'll be drawn into to finding out just what is going on in this neighborhood.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"One order of thriller please, heavy on the everything else","I really don't know how I feel about this one.I mean, on the one hand, it was a pretty typical outing for circa 2007 Shia LaBeouf who, even then at the ""height"" of his career, was turning in performances that were capable though not very compelling. Pair that with a story that doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be, and so overcompensates by being too much of everything: Mystery, teenage ""romantic"" comedy, coming of age tale and genuine thriller/horror. Add in some mediocre acting by many of the supporting players and you get a movie that just doesn't seem to ever really take flight.On the other hand, there are genuine moments, few and far between as they may be, where the movie does accomplish what it sets out to be. Both in terms of it's individual aims (see list above) as well as the over arching feel I believe it is trying achieve by weaving them all together. Amidst the heavy sighs and eye rolls, I found myself more caught up in what was happening to the characters than I expected. Sometimes this suspension of skepticism would last long enough for me to ask myself ""is this actually good?"", right before something overblown or heavy handed would happen to snap me back into the disappointing reality.So, is this a good movie? Is it a bad movie? I could probably make a case for either position, in fact I kinda just did in the previous two paragraphs, but ultimately I think this one is gonna depend on the mood of the viewer and the atmosphere of the viewing. One day, one person might think it is great and another day another person might hate it.I guess this isn't really a bold statement since it could easily be applied to just about any movie, but it's what I've got today.My best recommendation would that anyone who finds the premise of this film interesting should really check out Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece Rear Window. It's everything that Disturbia want's to be and more.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie Review: Disturbia,"For a movie titled ""Disturbia"", it is not really disturbing, or should I say it is disturbingly undisturbed. When the tagline reads, ""Every killer lives next door to someone"", I am thinking toward a film that is suspenseful and thrilling.So is Disturbia the movie starring Shia Labeouf a movie of such? It is disturbingly not, at least for the most part.Kale (Shia Labeouf) is a typical teenager in a growing up phase. He is carefree, fun loving and shows a keen interest in the opposite sex, but all that is about to change. That change came when he loses his father in a car accident one vacation.All that enthusiastic energy is depleted and things got worse when he lands himself 3 months of house arrest for punching his Spanish teacher.What can a teenager do when he cannot even leave his house? He spends all his time playing video games and watching loads of entertainment on television of course. Great you'll think but only until his mum (Carrie-Anne Moss) decides that enough is enough because Kale is neglecting everything else. She cancels his Xbox, iTune and best of all cut off the wire to the television when Kale snaps at her sensitivity.The boy will have to look for other things for entertainment and so he invents his own reality channel; he spies on his neighbours. One of whom is a hot and sexy girl, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), who has just moved in next door while the other is boring Robert Turner (David Morse) who mows his lawn twice a day. The focus of the movie will revolve around Kale's interest in the two, one with sexual curiosity and the other with suspicious animosity.Kale suspects Mr. Turner to be a serial killer when a report hits the news that the suspect drives a blue Ford Mustang similar to that of his neighbour. With the help of best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and along with love interest Ashley, the trio will attempt to uncover the mystery behind Robert Turner.The pace of the film is rather slow to begin with. I find myself questioning what kind of a movie am I really watching. Is this a comedy or a thriller? Director D. J. Caruso probably wanted it to be both. It felt like a swing most of the time, teasing with the possibility of suspense and thrill then suddenly shifting the momentum to comedic exposition. Disturbing, very disturbing.The thing behind the suspicious Mr. Turner lacked depth. Many questions were left unanswered. It appears that the storywriters, Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon are more interested in making the romance work between Kale and Ashley rather than having the ""who really is Mr. Turner?"" work out. At least there was a climatic scene at the end to save it even if I thought it as being too convenient a plot to drop the curtains with. The murderer just messed up.So ""Every killer lives next door to someone""?Try ""Every hot girl lives next door to someone"". That sounds more like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good Thriller,"A lot of people have compared this to a poor version of Rear Window. I fail to see the comparison. The premise of being confined to his house and ultimately spying on his neighbors is as far as it goes. Notwithstanding his fathers death, his house arrest was the culmination of the run in with his Spanish teacher and from previous troubles. The stage is set as a typical restless teen who one by one has his sources of entertainment either cancelled or has his access blocked, turning to anything that can put off the boredom. I thought the scenes of his transformation from a rebel to being resigned to his fate were realistic. I watched it twice in one weekend and likened the characters to myself and my best friend when I was a teen. It's like the boy who cried wolf once too often. When you're that age you aren't taken seriously, especially if you have been prone to trouble, so you take matters into your own hands not thinking of the consequences. I thought the cast was superb, with David Morse turning in his usual excellent work. Carrie-Anne Moss played the part of a mother who has to balance earning a living and concern over her son and his problems perfectly.

"With a different script, director and cast, this film would have been good...","If you can't tell by my summary line, there really wasn't much saving this film. I got free passes to see Disturbia and was actually looking forward to it. I'm a huge fan of Rear Window (which this film borrows from liberally, substituting a rabbit for the dog that dug in the killer's garden in Rear Window) and find the whole dramatic content of voyeuristic thrillers to be full of possibilities. Unfortunately, Disturbia is flawed in every regards, from plot lines that are nothing more than a slapping together of ideas, to painful to listen to dialog, to direction that is laughable at best, to both poor performances and great actors poorly utilized. This film has it all.Right from the word go I had a bad feeling about this movie. Matt Craven is a solid performer, but it appeared from the opening sequence that the director didn't know how to use him in the opening scene. This set the stage for Shia LaBeouf who simply could not carry this film. His performance was, simply put, inconsistent and all over the place. Maybe he gives an accurate depiction of how modern teenagers act (and with access to more techno gadgets than Neo in the Matrix) but it doesn't mean that it is interesting to watch or even good drama. In any good performance there has to be a sense that we are looking at the same character in every scene with subtle nuances that show how the character developed. With LaBeouf's performance, it was as if he was a completely different person every five minutes with no sense of connection to the rest of the film.The dialog went from stale, to boring, to laughably bad to downright insulting of one's intelligence in no time flat. Mix this with a villain -- played by the always excellent David Morse -- who seems to know everybody and show up everywhere and you end up with more of a farce than a serious suspense film. One shot made him look like Michael Myers from Halloween, and by that point they might as well have made this a slasher film because all of the intelligent suspense aspects of the film had already been thrown out the window. And that is very disappointing considering how much respect I have for David Morse as an actor. It was painful for me to watch him have to suffer through the indignities that is this film.The ending of the film gave the impression that the writers and director had finally given up all hope of making any sense and devolved into a monster on the run project. All reality is thrown out the window as injuries that would kill any normal person become minor inconveniences, law enforcement procedure is tossed aside for happy Hollywood sentiment, and the final two minutes are so laughably bad that one has to wonder both who approved this film and what mafia Don it was that director D.J. Caruso insulted to land this gig.Perhaps my only lucky break of the night in seeing this was that the projectionist at the theater I was at screwed up the framing half-way through so that the boom mics were present in every shot in the last half of the film. At least that gave the night some enjoyment. However, I would not recommend this film to anybody when there are many more voyeuristic thrillers (did I mention Rear Window) out there that are far better in every regards.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Teen Thriller That Doesn't Condescend,"This isn't a great horror/thriller movie...But, it's actually fairly solid and good enough to hold the viewer. Most teen horror is just too unrealistic and ""campy"" (but without actual humor) too appeal to me. This movie entertains and creates enough tension so I'd recommend it as one both teens and adults can enjoy.Though it shares a basic premise with Hitchcock's Rear Window, the main character is confined to his home where he voyeuristic-ally passes time, it does not mimic otherwise. It is not, or is it intended, to be a re-make, loosely or otherwise.The acting is solid all the way around. The storyline, a bit slow, sets up and builds tension that works itself to a climatic ending. However, it's the ending that prevents me from giving this film but a 6.

Let's face it, he helped the Evil Empire (Disney for the uninitiated) grow thanks to his successful show Even Stevens. But as Shia has gotten away from Disney, his range continues to get better. Granted, Disturbia and Transformers are not Shakespeare, but it is far better than farcical garbage like The Greatest Game Ever Played.Anyway, Shia plays Kale, a pretty chippy kid who slugs his teacher after due to a crack the creep makes about his dead father (which he had a hand in). first of all, I will say this: the teacher deserves it, even if Kale was being an idiot and a jackass. Anyway, this puts Kale under house arrest and he has to spend all day with his hot mom Carrie-Ann Moss. Of course, this all leads into the eventual ""Rear Window"" plot line that was pushed in the trailers, but it is still pretty satisfying.Kale's paranoia is pretty interesting to see, considering he seems to have no qualms about jumping the gun. This leads to one of my eventual pet peeves about this film. Why in the world would this guy get any chick? Here's the formula: being a peeping tom and ruining a girl's party will get you some head. Nice equation there guys.I have always liked David Morse, and his creepy, swarmy antagonist certainly brought some cool moments within the film. Its good to see him playing a bad guy again, which suits him so well because of his charm and rugged good looks. Either way, a spot on choice for the bad guy.Other than that, there was really nothing that stood out about this film. I give it a seven for the effort and making a film that didn't utterly bore me to death while throwing in a little humor to boot. Good stuff for a midnight-type showing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very well done,"There's no doubt in my mind that Disturbia is a modern day spin off of Rear Window, but don't mistake it for a remake of the classic- it's far from it.It's certainly a movie that kept me wanting to watch it undisturbed (No pun intended!) and had a great mix of fun, thriller and mystery all rolled into one.In terms of the actors- Shia LaBeouf: was fantastic in this movie. Great young actor with loads of potential to go places.Sarah Roemer: to rip off Homer Simpson, ""mmmmmmmmm, Sarah Roemer"". Great actress with the looks to match.Carrie-Anne Moss: until I checked up on this website, I had no idea she played Trinity from The Matrix- looked good and payed her part well.David Morse: is one of those actors that pops up in a wide mix of movies and shows and you wonder who the hell he is! For me, he was the show stopper in this movie- he played his character so well, it was almost creepy to think about what your own neighbours could be doing when watching him perform!If you haven't seen it- do it!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I would give this a PG-16 and the musical ONCE a PG-14,"Although there is much to enjoy as far as shocking and jolting Narrative twists and turns that the director of DISTURBIA takes us on, it is ultimately a bit trivial in a bigger scheme of things. I understand that it was a project that got shelved and put into production after a long wait. The edginess of it all does OK with its updating of REAR WINDOW (the Hitchcock thriller about a crippled voyeuristic photographer in a stuffy NYC apartment.) DISTURBIA (2007) came out this spring around Easter/Spring Vacation in the close vicinity of a real-life drama that received publicity in the St. Louis area where a stalker-pedophile was trying to ""warehouse"" teenage boys and the seemingly ""normal neighbor"" was foiled in his last kidnap only by an observant fellow student on a school bus who reported to police the relevant clue about the make and color of car that was being driven to crate the victim to his ""lair"". There are comedic moments but also some gross-out ones that apparently enthralled a wide teen audience this spring ahead of the crowds awaiting SPIDER-MAN 3 in May. Due to the viciousness of certain actions of this film's villain I would rank it not as a PG limiting it to 13-year-olds but to 16-year-olds and older. That might also prove a bit of a severe lesson about driving while distracted by cell phone well above the speed limit. A much better film for those of the plus-14 age ranges is the UK musical-reality based feature film taking place in Dublin streets, a music store, a recording studio, and low-rent quarters titled ONCE (currently in theatres Summer 2007). After its R-rated language of the first moments, viewers must admire ONCE for its long-enduring and hummable soundtrack - display of musical virtuoso on the pop music end of things. I evaluate DISTURBIA at the level of 7 while I highly regard the suspense classic REAR WINDOW (1954) as a 10 here at Internet Movie Database.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining enough, even if you know the movies this is borrowing from.","I found ""Disturbia"" to a familiar thriller, but I have to admit that it has charm. It's decently made, with fair performances, a decent amount of thrills and just enough comedic moments to break up the tension and allow you a quick breather before getting back into the mystery of it all. Where I found that the movie really suffers is with the ending. It's a fairly goofy ending that really doesn't try anything new, which is unfortunate. This is a movie that's perfect for teens, or almost teens that want something of a horror thriller because this material will be fresher for them. Even if you've seen the movies this is borrowing from, it's still a fun watch. It just shows that being unpredictable isn't everything that counts in a movie.

Somewhat Disappointing Shia LaBeouf Vehicle,"With a title as cool as ""Disturbia,"" the final product couldn't quite live up to its name. The only disturbing thing about this movie is how studios can continue to peddle such run-of-the-mill fare.The pacing was indeed good, as was the acting. Shia LaBeouf and David Morse exhibited intensity in their roles and were enjoyable to watch. But the script and plot of the movie were so ho-hum and predictable that the wife and I left the theater with frowns on our faces. We were frustrated by the overall direction of the movie. It descended into a teen suspense film unwilling to take any risks. As a side note, the boom could be frequently spotted atop the screen.As far as I can tell, the only real theme to this movie is voyeurism pays dividends.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Waste of time,"Yawn. I've seen this film many times before, when it was called ""I know what you did last summer, and final destination, and all the other teenage/young adult horror/thriller/suspense movies that Hollywood has been spewing out. Nothing new here, except more pretty faces getting themselves into the same old situations. It's plot is paper thin, and the characters are generic. All that's missing is a few trendy rap-rock tunes, and the rapper-turned film star. This film is a dime a dozen, don't bother. I think Hollywood is running out of solid stories, and ideas, and are now just trying to cast the best looking people, from the most popular TV shows. I'll stick with Friday the 13th if I want to see teenagers in trouble. And if I want to see a good suspense movie that isn't completely predictable, I'll stay away from 90 percent of the crap Hollywood is dumping into theaters.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Talented Shia LaBeouf Elevates an Otherwise Mediocre Film,"I forget who, but someone said Shia LeBeouf was the next Tom Hanks. I seriously don't doubt it.

Thrilling And Gripping.,"Disturbia a clever different type of horror. Yes it doesn't have no gore or too much violence, because it's not meant for that, so if your looking for that type of movie you better avoid Disturbia. A great teen Horror/Thriller, executed well by D.J Caruso, it's not easy making a teen horror (keep in mind you are limited in many areas, such as gory scenes.)Getting straight to it Disturbia is Thrilling and Gripping, it keeps you on the edge of your seat at times, it has a touch of humour too. It's highly enjoyable film to watch with your friend's or a great thriller for your movie night. No it's not perfect it does lack some quality's in certain areas, like it take's a while before you really get into the movie, before you really get interested, Caruso should of bought the thrills in a bit quicker. But do not let that put you off, because when the movie does get interesting it really get's going and just get's more thrilling by the moment. But above all...The acting. Acting was pretty much flawless i can't think of someone else who could play Kale in a better way then Shia. LaBeouf again show's his talent and i think the success of the movie is because of him, i probably wouldn't be so interested in the movie if he was not on the cast. But even the rest of the cast were decent too. A great Gripping Thriller/Horror, load's of intense thrills. Simply go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stupid.,"I thought this movie would be good, but the minute I saw the car barrel rolling through the air near the beginning, I knew it would be a Hollywood crap fest. I was right. Why would a serial killer, someone who is obviously being extremely careful to keep his secret, kill people in his house with the lights on, the blinds on his windows up, and right in front of the windows, where all the neighbors can see. Furthermore, why, when he finds out that the neighbor kid is spying on him, continue these behaviors, not to mention then kidnap the kid's mother, pretty much ensuring that the kid gets involved even further? Oh I know, because fools will love it. When I pointed out these glaring flaws to the people I watched it with, they said I was over analyzing the movie, and that I should just enjoy it. I tend to enjoy movies that are believable. For instance, when the girl catches Kale spying on her, and he gives the most canned speech of all time ""You look at the whole world, when I only see you..."", and says something to the extent of ""Even though that's the creepiest thing I've ever heard, I find it romantic, and therefore, find you attractive, even though I just said I think you are creepy."" It's just dumb. Not to mention that entire plot just takes away from the story and is completely unnecessary. After Kale is captured by the serial killer, the man reveals his entire devious plan to him! Honestly, I thought movies got to the point where we didn't have the villains giving monologues anymore. Now there are talks for a sequel. What, does another serial killer happen to move into the same house and Kale starts spying on him too? Ugh. This is just a movie that had potential story-wise, ending up to be a disaster.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Cool mix of suspense, horror and teen romance with some great twisty story elements and admirable acting","I haven't seen ""Rear Window"" but I think this movie works just fine without being called a remake. I appreciated the pacing of story and how we didn't learn everything at once. Although it could be argued that this neighborhood has way too many people who don't go to work, it does make for a good story. Also makes you wonder what you might discover if you had a bird eye's view and all day to study your neighborhood.The setup was a little forced, but sufficient enough. The real fun begins when our ""hero"" gets his Xbox and iTunes accounts deactivated and he's forced to fill his house arrest boredom by spying on the neighborhood. Luckily for him a cute girl moves in next door and another neighbor seems suspiciously like a serial killer in the news.There were a number of good plot twists and the traditional ""bad guy tells good lies in front of the cops"" moments. It's also fun when the cute girl decides to check-in on her voyeuristic neighbor. I think it drags a bit in reaching its final conclusion, but not enough to ruin anything.If you like a little bit of scare from time to time but aren't a big fan of gore (maybe a little?) then you'll enjoy this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A very well done suspense, a story, yes, a little foreseeable if you wanna guess it too much, but if you take it the relax way and that you let the final punch come to you instead of looking for it, that really is diverting.

one the best thrillers,"Alright, Hollywood has been upsetting me with these cheap movies with the same story lines and horrible actors for the past ten years. Every now and then there has been a good thriller/horror (ex. Seven, Silence of Lambs, Red Dragon), but for the most part every movie is the same as the last, and quite frankly i'm tired of it. It's like beating your head against the wall, and then doing it again and again. Truly it is all pointless, but as I was watching Disturbia I began to realize their may still be hope in Hollywood. As I watched the previews for the first time I realized that I recognized most of the actors, and liked them, the storyline looked decent, and I was hoping that this movie may just give me a good scare, and oh...how it did. When the movie started off in the beginning I liked the nice twist on Shia's character and I new this would later lead to something although I did not know what. He becomes messed up, hits his teacher blah, blah, blah, and then all of the sudden after the spying had begun the movie started getting intense.

Better than rear window you chumps,"Disturbia is a film that stars Shia in a horror thriller where he is on house arrest with nothing to do. His Mom took away his privileges and now he must resort to spying on the neighbors to keep his mind occupied. Now most would say Rear Window is better and I whole heartedly disagree with that opinion. Rear Window lacks the suspense Disturbia bring to the table. It has less build up and is overall more interesting. There is great moments of gripping terror as you wonder what will happen next. The game of cat and mouse of the protagonist and antagonist is believable chemistry in their rivalry. I watched this movie as a kid not knowing the impact it would have on me as an adult. I truly love this film and you should show it to any person on house arrest so they can know that even if you make mistakes, you are worthy of redemption when the moment arises.

Whether it's the clichÃ©d love element, the goofy but lovable sidekick, the lashings of teen angst, the bad decisions of the characters, the familiar psycho, or, well, too many other aspects to mention, this is never anything other than by the numbers.I suppose if your a teenager and like Buffy, Dawson's Creek, and Scream this might work great for you.

There are some ingredients that made the classic a classic. John Michael Hayes screenplay for starters. James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter and of course Hitchock himself. Shia LeBoeuf is a mystery to me, a cocky, unbearable presence on the screen. He must have somebody really powerful behind him otherwise how can anyone explain it. Everything is acted and phony.

Modern day Hitchcock,"Vertigo meets the 21st century.In what is essentially a remake of Hitchcock's classic, a high school teenager (Shia LeBeouf) is sentenced to house arrest and has a tracking device placed on him, thereby making him unable to leave his home. After a while he starts spying on his neighbors, most notably a pretty young girl who moved in next door. But all is not well in suburbia as one of the neighbors is up to some pretty strange things. With the help of a classmate and his new found love interest, LeBeouf sets off to discover what is really going on.As I have mentioned before, this is Vertigo in the 21st century- a man unable to leave his house thinks one of his neighbors is a murderer and then with the help of his friends, starts playing detective. Although casting someone like LeBeouf in the lead and including the whole teenage angle might make this seem like another run on the mill teen slasher, this is not it. The youth element is treated very effectively in the sense that it is there but it is not overplayed and is in fact kept to a relative minimum. There is some humor but the main focus is instead on the story and this is where the film's strength lies.LeBeouf, despite his youth, is an excellent actor and I look forward to seeing him in more films. He manages to find that excellent balance between providing some comedic relief while at the same time still staying serious. DJ Caruso does a pretty good job of directing this film. There is of course quite a bit of modern style camera shaking and fast cutting (when compared to Hitchcock's version) but fortunately this too is kept in check and isn't overdone like it is in so many other films.A nice film to keep you thrilled for an evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Distubria Movie Review,"Disturbia (2007)How would you feel if you were almost positive that a wanted serial killer was living across the street in what you thought was your quiet and peaceful neighborhood? Unfortunately, for the protagonist, Kale Brecht (Shia LeBeouf) in the thrilling movie Disturbia (2007), these thoughts turn out to be the real thing. Why would the 17 year old teen even begin to even suspect such a thing? After losing his father in a tragic car accident, Kale's anger from such a loss seemed to cause him to lose control and punch his Spanish teacher in the face, therefore, sentencing him to house arrest. Because of this, Kale finds himself that the only way to keep himself occupied during the day (since being restricted from the TV and video games), is to spy on the neighbors around him through his binoculars. It is because of this, does Kale begin to question the safety of his own self and integrity of others around him. The viewer is able to get the sense of how the protagonist gradually develops along with the other main characters. We get a sense of Kale's background in the beginning of the movie when he was in the accident as well as how and why he was sentenced to house arrest. The other main character named Ashley Carlson (Sarah Roemer), who is introduced later on, is developed through the protagonist's interest in spying on her through the window of his own house. With this development of character, a conflict is soon arises. Even though the basis of this movie is suspense, there are many cases of irony also, such as when Kale tries breaking into the suspected killer, Mr. Turner's (David Morse), house with a wireless webcam. Although the effects for the movie are really good, this would be highly unlikely in a real life situation since the film tricks the viewer of sight and sound by combining technology, and ingenuity. A second ironic instance that occurs more towards the end of the movie is when Kale proves to the cops and to this own mother that Mr. Turner really was an actual criminal, when, in the beginning, no one was a believer. What makes this movie special are the unique effects on set and each character's special way of acting. The two most significant examples that play an important role are props and the variety of sets for the movie. The different sets are vital for any type of movie because it helps develop the different background areas in each scene. In Disturbia, the main props that are used throughout are Kale's binoculars, cell phones, and web cameras. Windows are also essential due to the fact that characters use them to look in and out at each other. Without these windows, the movie couldn't even be made. Also, without Kale's binoculars spying out the windows, he wouldn't have noticed the suspicious activity happening in his neighborhood. As for hair and makeup, it should be obvious to the viewer that the movie takes place in the twenty-first century. The setting is in your basic, normal neighborhood and the style clothes are like any average teenager of today. It's significant because it helps us realize that this movie is made to seem like it is happening in our time and helps us relate to it better.Although lighting might not be that noticeable or that important in a film, it is crucial in Disturbia. The uniqueness in the way the director (D.J. Caruso) uses the light to create a certain mood is incredible. For example, during the scenes where Kale is spying on Mr. Turner's suspicious activity, the lighting is very dim, and at times, we are unable to clearly see the protagonist himself. The way the camera moves and the numerous different angles are really beneficial factors that help give you an idea that Disturbia is more than just one genre, but is instead, a thriller, drama, and mystery combined.Disturbia is a brilliant movie for anyone who likes the feeling of suspense and anticipation. Even though the general rating from IMDb is 7.1 out of 10 stars, I would rate it a 9 out of 10. Disturbia is not only a film that leaves you on the edge of your seat, but it is a thriller that draws you into big screen itself. The stimulating action scenes, fast camera work, and the admirable roles each actor and actress play give this movie an extra special something that captivates everyone in the audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Total Unredeemable Garbage,"I've sat through some pretty horrible films in my lifetime, but I actually had to turn this one off half way through... I couldn't bear it any longer.This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's definitely the worst film of 2007 so far... Before I sat down to watch this film I had been mislead to believe that this would be some kind of thriller... In actuality, this film takes the worst elements and clichÃ©s of every teen drama ever made and meshes them together into a nice little inoffensive package. Yeah, sure, essentially this film is about a killer who lives next door and an average teen who foils his plans and blah, blah, blah... But, there is nothing remotely interesting about this flick and it's submerged in so much putrid banality that one cannot help but to think ""hey, haven't I seen all of this before in another movie starring Tom Hanks?"" And yet this film is about a hundred times more watered down and it is loaded with the kind of sickening, corny sentimentality that can only be found in the likes of a made for TV Lifetime special. With that said, anyone equating this pile of cinema dung with the flawless classic Rear Window is just an idiot. I had been told that this was a modern day Rear Window but, if anything, it's just a hollow representation of that great film. While Rear Window had you at the edge of your seat this film has you rolling your eyes thinking to yourself ""how come no one I knew in High School acted like the characters on screen? And why must Hollywood always stereotype teenage guys as being sex crazed idiots?"" This is the type of film that represents everything that is wrong with cinema today.Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A brilliant and engaging thriller,"This movie could be seen as a rip off of Alfred Hitchock's film Rear Window, but this film is clever enough to just use the premise of that film as it's springboard changing things here and there to keep it fresh. Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is placed under house arrest after he punches his Spanish teacher. During his house-locked escapades he watches his neighbours including the new obviously has to be attractive girl next door Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and seemingly the nice Mr Turner (David Morse). Kale becomes convinced that Mr Turner is a serial killer and uses the aid of Ashley and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) to help him find out the truth. That is all I'm going to tell you because Disturbia is one of the best thrillers you will ever watch. Director D.J Caruso (Eagle Eye) gives some of the best suspense I have ever seen. This movie is a must watch.Final Verdict: 8/10 One of the best thrillers I have seen in years.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Boring and ClichÃ©d,"This movie was gawd-awful. The story is super predictable all the way. There are plot holes the size of aircraft carrier, plus a villain who acts in a fashion completely lacking in sense. You've seen the concept before, the pleasant neighborhood with the nice neighbors, and that one quiet guy that keeps to himself but seems so nice.....well maybe he's a deranged serial killer....maybe not. And as things transpire, his behavior makes little sense.Shia Lebouf, who stars as a young geekster who through bad luck is forced to spend his summer under house arrest via an electronic shackle. Of course, a beautiful but troubled girl moves in next door. Will she go geek, or hang with the cool crowd? Will the neighborhood maybe-psycho-killer turn on her? What about Mom? What about our harmless politically correct ethnic minority geek buddy jokester? Lebouf is an annoying one dimensional actor whose success eludes me.

"An entertaining movie experience all around...thrilling, funny, and sweet","Disturbia was a big surprise for me, as I went in with low expectations because of the lead actor, Shia LaBeouf. I really underestimated his ability to be a leading actor in a thriller, as he more than carries the film with his character, Kale.The movie revolves around rough around the edges teenager Kale, who is under house arrest following a mishap at school, which resulted from a life changing event. Being stuck inside all day, Kale gets bored easily, and soon finds entertainment in watching his neighbors: a bunch of young pranksters, an adulterous spouse, a man who keeps to himself (David Morse), and his newest neighbor, a beautiful girl named Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Like any teenage boy, Kale soon focuses his attention on her, and after the two finally meet, they realize that one of the neighbors may be hiding a deadly secret: he's a serial killer.The acting in the film is really well done considering the fact that this is aimed at teenagers, and sometimes the acting falls in these kind of films. Shia LaBeouf does a great job of developing a likable character that the audience really identifies with. He balances the comedy and drama very well, as the film does have some laugh out loud funny moments. You'll be rooting for Kale the whole time, even though he's not the most perfect person in the world. Sarah Roemer also provides a unique character that may seem stereotypical at first, but becomes a lot more as Ashley and Kale interact. She is likable, and it's not just because she's drop dead gorgeous. David Morse delivers as always a chilling and mysterious performance that stands above the rest. He is one of the better villainous actors around, and this film only strengthens that claim. You'll never know where he's going to go next, which adds a lot to the suspense. The director, DJ Caruso, could have taken the character in a lot of directions, but I'm glad that Morse's character is how he is. It would have been very easy to make him the classic villain who is scary, yet we know what he is capable of. Due to the mystery provided by Caruso, Morse, and writer Carl Ellsworth, we get the most mysterious villain in a long time. Carrie Anne Moss also adds some nice moments as Kale's mother. I would have liked to see more of her character and how she deals with the personal tragedy in the beginning of the film, but I understand it because the film is about Kale.Ellsworth also penned 2005's Red Eye, which Disturbia is eerily similar to. Both films have a villain who doesn't reveal his intentions at first. Both films have leading characters who have just endured personal tragedies. The main setting of both films is in one place (Red Eye was an airplane, Disturbia was Kale's house). The climaxes are similar as the lead character runs to another place to save someone they love. I almost lost faith in DJ Caruso after Two For the Money, but he did a great job with Disturbia, providing a great movie experience that you should watch in a group. Sit back, and relax as this film takes you through the funny, the scary, the thrilling, the heartbreaking, and the heartwarming emotions that make movies great. Due to some scary scenes and violent content, Disturbia isn't appropriate for those under age 12 or 13.8/10 --spy",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
That's an enjoyable thriller!,"First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not innovative because there are too many movies similar to this one. The storyline was very well written and well-explained, even though it was kinda simple and easy to understand. The characters were interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. The filming location of the movie was mainly inside a big house in a small American town. The casting of the movie was nice and their performances were good. I have to admit, it wasn't a scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares, however the 3rd act was kinda creepy. Also, the killcount of the movie wasn't bloody, at all and most death scenes were done off-screen. In my opinion, that movie should be R-rated, instead of the PG-13 rating. At least, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and there were some nice chase scenes. Moreover, the opening scene of the movie was definitely unpredictable and it was shocking. The ending scene was predictable, however it was very well executed and I really enjoyed it. The cinematography and the score of the movie were both excellent. Overall, ""Disturbia"" was an enjoyable thriller film, intense and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's the film that has Landmarked my film archive, You have Shia starring as a Teen who witnessed his father's death and is now under house arrest for punching his teacher. Shia is probably one of my favorite stars because he can make me laugh, sorry for, and make me feel as if I was right with him as he investigates the strange behavior of his next door neighbor, played by The extremely creepy David Morse. And of course what suspense/comedy/romantic comedy would be without the goofy partner in crime which is played by the funny Aaron Yoo, who is the supporting friend of Kale (or Shia) and the guy who can steal the screen but put it back with a nice card saying "" Good times"".

A Thriller with a Sense of Humour,"I saw ""Disturbia"" last night. It was obvious that up and coming actor Shia LaBeouf did a great acting job. He was perfectly cast and I think it's safe to say that most people root for him throughout the movie.After thinking a bit more today, I realized that the movie is really more clever than I had originally thought. Pulling off a thriller that's part comedy, part horror show, and part teenager romance is no easy task. Overall, the pieces fit well in this fast, energetic film.Getting back to the leading man -- Shia LaBeouf. He's only about 20 but has already built up quite an impressive resume. He's made appearances in movies including the recent films ""Bobby"" and ""I, Robot"" plus episodes of some of the best TV shows such as ""ER"" and ""The X Files."" Now he's front and center. He does not have typical movie star looks. He does not look like he spends half his day working out with a personal trainer.

A disturbing remake of a Hitchcock masterpiece,"In Disturbia, Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is placed under house arrest because he got into a fight with his Spanish teacher. It is one of many problems Kale has had at school lately, and a judge orders him to the house arrest, saying ""I just gave you a break Kale, don't test me."" Life hasn't been easy for Kale, while on a fishing trip, he was in a terrible car accident that ended up killing his father, which spiraled the normal teenage boy Kale into his rebellious ways. On his computer, Kale has a screen saver that reads ""LET ME OUT!"" He can't go anywhere or do anything outside of his home, he feels trapped. After a while, I felt trapped as well, trapped into another poorly executed remake and a bad excuse of a film. Disturbia is an obvious remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece Rear Window. There are differences, yes, some minor, for example Disturbia follows a teenage delinquent who has nothing better to do but spy on the neighbors. Rear Window follows a successful photographer with a broken leg who can't do anything, so he passes the time by observing his neighbors. His observing turns to spying once he believes he sees a murder take place.The minor differences, many like the one I just pointed out, are not the reason why Disturbia fails at what it promises, it is the major differences. Hitchcock was a master filmmaker, he would have been able to tell a story without dialogue and only with reactions to situations if he wanted to, which is called pure cinema. Rear Window is the epitome of Hitchcock's pure cinema, Disturbia differs in telling us what is going on at every moment, simply put, these types of films do not trust audience's enough today as opposed to the '50's. Another major and very upsetting difference is the setting of the film. Rear Window never left the apartment of it's protagonist, which created it's suspense because like the films protagonist, the audience could do nothing about the situation, except try to make people believe that a neighbor is committing a murder. Disturbia, however, takes Kale and the audience out of his room numerous times and into the outside world, the world that Kale is not supposed to enter.Do film studios really distrust audiences this much? Why do many of these films have to rely on cheap thrills that are seen time and time again, such as the camera creeping up behind the protagonist when he is in a dark corner of the room? Disturbia is a predictable and stale excuse for a thriller. It is troubling when films follow formulas by the letter and do nothing to advance a genre such as thrillers. I would have enjoyed the film much more if Disturbia had been a complete remake of Rear Window, never leaving Kale's room, and us only seeing glimpses of the supposed murderer. There is also a poor excuse for the Grace Kelly character from Rear Window in Ashley (Sara Roemer). I am not saying Roemer is an unattractive young woman, not many can be as attractive as Grace Kelly was, but her character is not given that same depth or meaning as Grace Kelly's Lisa in Rear Window. The Ashley character is a hole filler, we are not given enough time to care for her, because for the first half of the film we only see her from a distance, in her pool, and on the roof of her house reading.Out of all the negatives in Disturbia, there emerges one slight positive. Shia LaBeouf gives a good performance as Kale. LaBeouf is mainly known from his time on the Disney television series Even Stevens, he's grown up now, and LaBeouf is slowly evolving into a fine young actor, his only problem is that he is not picking good films to star in. He gave a fine performance in Bobby last year, however, that film was simply awful. LaBeouf reminds me of a young Jimmy Stewart, he has the look of a normal teenager that a lot of teens can identify with. Interesting how he is cast in the role Jimmy Stewart had in Rear Window. The problem with LaBeouf's character, however is that he comes off as a peeping tom, constantly spying on Ashley, at one point setting his phone alarm to go off when she is doing yoga. LaBeouf is able to give the character some depth, however, and make watching the character at least a little tolerable.Overall, Disturbia is simply another throwaway thriller that does not deliver what it promises. There are currently rumors flying that another of Hitchcock's greatest films, The Birds, is in talks of being remade. By my count, that would be the third film of Hitchcock's remade for mainstream theaters, with 1998's Psycho and Disturbia being the first two. Although sometimes I think remakes are a good idea, because hopefully they would get audiences intrigued to see the original, but in the case of Hitchcock's library of films, I have to ask, no, more like beg, that movie studios do not remake any more of Hitchcock's films. His films were perfect when they were made, if anything, draw ideas from them for a new film; please, don't dwindle the great director's finest works into this garbage.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Rear Window for teens,"I hated this movie. I REALLY hated it. The first ten minutes made me expect that much, and then... it was like some teen love flick with a few shocking moments. What saddens me is that it could have been really good, if the focus was on the main plot instead of the side story. But most of the time I found myself stalking some pubescent boy stalking his new hot neighbor chick because she's pretty, and apparently that's all he needs. Admittedly, she IS quite pretty. That might have sweetened the movie for the teenage audience, but to me it just seemed cheap, because Roemer's screen time could have been cut to a tenth without crippling the plot. I just grew tired of watching her take a sun bath, doing yoga, swimming in the pool etc etc. True, I got to watch some other neighbors doing what people do... until suddenly strange things started to happen... but by that time, I didn't care anymore. As for the actors, I think they all did okay. Okay meaning not very good, but not exorbitantly bad either. I recommend you watch Rear Window instead of this.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Disturbia disturbs suspense film fans,"Disturbia disturbs suspense film fans Kale a teenager, loses his father in a horrifying accident on the trip back home after fishing together. The accident is one of the greatest car crash scenes ever IMO. Superbly shot. Back to the topic : This accident disturbs Kale -Shia LaBeouf-. This terrible incident has after-effects on Kale even a year later. This is one of the reasons why he loses concentration in his Spanish class and is embarrassed by his teacher, who goads him about his father. Kale gets put on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher in class. This is the moment where the film starts actually. So far so good. I didn't like the rest of it to the end.He's got a distant relation to his mother, doesn't get on well with her. His only one close friend Ronnie comes by sometimes, plus Kale finds his days at home becoming increasingly boring.Under house arrest, he begins to learn the secrets of everyone surrounding him through the use of binoculars and video cameras. Spying on his neighbors throughout the day and night. And that's it to be honest. Only the finishing minutes are pretty exciting and thrilling. There are only a couple of ""shock"" moments and sudden jumps. Other than this, nothing original, nothing interesting and most of all nothing suspenseful.I had expected a more exciting, and suspenseful film to tell you the truth. Once he meets the beautiful neighbor girl Ashley -Sarah Roemer- the film takes a u turn. You become a witness of teenage lust fest, which makes you think ""am I in the right film ?"". Like most of the teen movies, there are way too many shots of the ""hot"" girl next door doing Yoga, slow-mo swimming, sun bathing.David Morse's character was the only good thing to watch in this film. David Morse, who plays the serial killer, as Mr. Turner in the film is excellent IMO.One of the bad sides is that there are parts you simply find them unrealistic. Like, when Kale claimed that his neighbor Mr. Turner kidnapped his friend Ronnie -Aaron Yoo- , and when the police didn't believe him and brought Kale back home. I wanna know ""why the hell didn't they call Ronnie to check out where he is"" ??? Why not ? Plus, when they get away with the murderer Mr. Turner which happens towards the end of the film, Kale tells his girlfriend to call the cops. However it took ages the police to show up immediately.In brief, this is a predictable, unrealistic and a fair movie that isn't't very suspenseful at all. I don't know how many of you have seen ""Above Suspicion (1995)"" with Christopher Reeve in it ?? ""Above Suspicion"" is great. I tend to think that Disturbia tried create a great suspenseful film like ""Above Suspicion"" but failed completely. For the guys who haven't seen ""Above Suspicion"" should rent and check this film asap. No no no wait. Don't make haste. To watch ""Above Suspicion"" before Disturbia may spoil the film. I'd suggest you watch Disturbia first and then ""Above Suspicion"". I bet you'll be on my side after checking both films out.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the Best Thrillers of the Year,"Disturbia (2007, Dir. D.J. Caruso)Kale Brecht is a 17 year old who is placed under house arrest after punching one of his teachers. He is refined to his house with no available entertainment. He decides to use his free time spying on his neighbours. Things start to get weird, when guests would enter Robert Turner's house and not come back out. Kale and his friends Ronnie and Ashley Carlson start to grow more and more interested in what is actually happening within the house of Robert Turner.I never got around to watching this when it was originally shown on the cinema. I heard only good things about this film, and after viewing 'Transformers' i became a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf, so this was one film which i really wanted to see. I was not disappointed. Let me get it out the way first. Shia LaBeouf was as fantastic and natural as he always is. All the other stars were great, especially Aaron Yoo and David Morse. The film proves that you don't need blood and gore to make a decent horror. Although the horror doesn't start till the first hour has gone, it builds a lot on the suspense, and really keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is definitely one of the best thrillers, if not one of the best films of the year.""You cancelled my Xbox.""""iTunes, too."" - Kale (Shia LaBeouf)""You know what else i'm cancelling?""""Maid service."" - Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well,","I actually enjoyed it. I went with friends and was in a large, sold-out theater, which added to the experience.This is the first thriller/horror movie I've seen in recent years that I actually sat through. The plot, although fairly predictable, was more than enough to entertain. The story sets itself up very nicely, and continues throughout. There are multiple moments that made me jump a little bit, and the main sequence definitely managed to get my heart racing. Also, I felt that the actors, particularly the younger ones, did a very good job. A problem with horror movies I tend to have is over-acting, but, in this realistic plot, the characters tended to react as such.There were a few points to bring it down, however. The plot and a few of the ""get-you-to-jump"" moments were altogether too predictable (although this is admittedly hard to avoid, as you're expecting to jump. It's a suspense movie).In conclusion, it really was a good, thrilling experience. There were enough unexpected turns in order to maintain the experience. I especially recommend this film to teens, as most in the theater were very pleased with the experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Am Amazed!!,"Disturbia was released only last year and I consider it a full-on classic, it is on my best films rack along with classics like Big Fish, Amelie, Lord of the Rings & The Godfather.Usually I never really feel like commenting on a movie on it's IMDb board. But I have to release my thoughts on this film. It entertains from start to finish, scaring the light out of me. I am a wimp when it comes to horror movies. Usually I don't see the point in scaring yourself. But usually I never see a film quite like DISTURBIA. I was NOT looking forward to seeing this movie, but I went because a friend wanted to, she hated it. I loved it.A rather depressed teenager who is quite misfitted & lonely a year after witnessing his Dad's death starts spying on his neighbours noticing an incredibly attractive new girl next door & a serial killer kidnapper as well. Him, his male friend & the new girl all become close friends & attempt to solve the murder man's mystery while his mother becomes the kidnappers target.I haven't seen Rear Window, I hear this rips off it. MY OPINION: If it truly does, why care? There are remakes & take-offs everywhere & it's bringing a great olden day tale to a new generation.Shia LaBeaouf is greatly fitted for the lead role, his acting is great & he really makes you believe. All the characters have little hooks & characteristics that make them really enjoyable. Good characters = Great movie.The storyline is great because it leaves big enough room for the serial killer storyline without ignoring the characters personal lives, feelings, back rounds & different story lines all together. Sure the end is expected, but not unpleasantly so.It has just the right amount of gore, without making you feel sick but still enough for some 'squeams'. I love the movie because it's scary without being graphic, leaves you creeped out, suspensed, thrilled & yet has very little violence.The start was not really fitting to the whole undertone of the movie & the songs chosen for scenes don't really fit. So I let it out, there are 2 flaws for an otherwise perfect (in my opinion) movie.It manages to be a creepy psychological horror while still maintaining it's teen dramedy. For anyone who likes films with dream sequences, girls next door, surprise attacks, serial killers, depressed kids, teens solving mysteries & widows this is a must!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best thriller in a LONG time,"I absolutely love that fact that little Louis Stevens from Even Stevens is in a mature movie like this, as opposed to his children's show. He did such a better job acting in this movie than I expected. My first thought was that he wouldn't do a good job being in a thriller because he was so juvenile in Even Stevens. But he pulled it off WELL.The story was done so well, they used not a lot of gore, but just enough.There was so much action in it too. I think this movie, and Dead Silence, are the greatest horror/thrillers in a LONG time. I saw the messengers thinking it would be awesome too, and it wasn't really.There is so much action in this movie, I never got bored. Sly sense of humour, no really laugh out loud funny parts, but at least it has a sense of humour. This movie was SOOO good, and I strongely recommend it, it didn't scare me the slightest bit, but some of my friends were close to tears. Which amused me. Haha. Go see this movie, it is SO good, all the actors did very well, there were almost no predictable parts.GO.SEE.THIS.MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Disturbia-Best 2007 film so far,"Everyone has different opinions, but being a teenage girl, I really enjoyed this film. It was funny in some parts, scary in others but it was always entertaining whether Kale (Shia LaBeouf) was hitting on Ashley or Ronnie was being a funny man.And while some may argue that because I;m young and have never seen the movie great, Rear Window, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worthy of anyones attention, because in reality it is a movie I would most definitely recommend to others.Shia LaBeouf definitely proved himself as an actor (I think he already had when he played Stanley in Holes, but he was mesmerizing in Disturbia) and should continue playing similar roles as well as expanding his obvious talent for acting.The teen actors played their roles in a strong and amazing way that would be worthy of a ""Jennifer Hudson in Dreamgirls"" stamp of approval. The older actors like David Morse, played their roles well also.The chemistry between Shia and Sarah was great and the movie was far more comedic than I would have expected.So all in all, I saw this four times at the movies and I wouldn't ask for my money back for a second. I know older people who have seen it and like it also, so check it out and make up your own mind...but if you're taking my advice...see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One word: Terrible,"A predictable 'thriller'....the entire way through. Laughable opening, laughable characters, laughable dialogue (in particular Shia's confession to his little missy)..just a mess. You see the boom mic about 50 times in the movie...seriosuly. There's the shot, there's the top pf the screen, there's the mic. Just watch....or don't..because it's horrible. Seeing it for free doesn;'t even redeem the bad taste I got in my mouth after seeing this. Only redeeming quality was Shia's pal in the movie, and even he was too tacky to give this a 3/10. This will make money, and someone of you will probably see this. Please do not go see it. Do not let these producers win.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie was so friggin' awesome!,"Disturbia had such a steady paced plot and an extremely interesting one, too. Shia LaBeouf did a great job in this thriller. The movie was perfectly made because even though it was extremely thrilling and unmistakably heart- stopping, it didn't become too serious. The best friend of the main character made the flow of the movie smooth and added a much needed break from the never- ending scares in the film. The sneaky insertions of hilarity in the film were very refreshing as viewer. Anyone who enjoys a good scare or likes to watch a teen romance form in the middle of spying on a killer should go see this movie. This movie has become my favorite movie of all time and I plan to see it at least ten thousand more times.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

shia labeouf--disturbia--great!,"Disturbia, maybe a teen thriller, maybe a insight on an over shadowed life. Shia LaBeouf, maybe the cutest guy on earth, maybe a bloody good actor. Disturbia was a little creepy, a little sneaky and a little funny. And as for the cast, a little intimidating. It was a very lonely film at the start, but it warmed up to a film that is typically teenager aimed. Kale (Shia LaBeouf), a lonely kid who lost his father at maybe his own expense, gets home detention after punching his teacher out (lovely i know) finds 'constructive' things to do, one of them being spying on your neighbours. From kids watching age restricted programmes, affairs while wives go to tennis to a killer who suddenly turns up in your house with your mother. But of course, you can't spy on this killer on your own, or get evidence when your sentenced to your home or else. There has to be a girl involved, namingly Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who spends most of her time on the roof of her house than actually in her house, more time in a pool than on her roof and more time with Kale trying to catch the killer than she does in the pool (arent i just clever). The whole movie is carried by the excellent performances of Shia, Sarah and David and a bit of thrilling nail biters. It was really awesome in the sense that it's almost a remake of a Hitchcock classic. To end it, a must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The main character sneaks into the murderer's house, and then is honestly surprised to have him lurk behind him?

Just a small example of dialouge: ""That's either the creepiest...or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.""

I Loved it!!,"Disturbia was very suspenseful and intense, but also added great comedic moments, which I think was a great mix. In Disturbia, you never know whats going to happen and all the cast were amazing. Not one bad performance. Disturbia is unique because compared to some recent PG-13 horror flicks, this one is very suspenseful and has an excellent story. All the characters have their own personality and are likable, so you do care about them and their fate. There are some jumpy scenes, but the tension mostly comes from suspense and not knowing whats gonna happen next. Is Disturbia going to be called one of the most scariest films ever? No. But will it entertain you and give you a good time? Yes. When I say, entertaining and a good time, I don't mean a terrible movie but with good gore, and cheesy popcorn scenes that are only mean't to be viewed with a group of friends. When I say entertaining and a good time, I mean that Disturbia has great suspense, is very intense, likable characters, and a bone chilling plot. Disturbia does not need to be a bad movie, to be a good movie. Disturbia may be similar to Rear Window but do not ruin your experience by comparing them and calling this a rip off. You will like this movie if you go and expect a movie of its own. Like I said, Disturbia is a great movie. Go and see it and have a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbia will give you chills through your whole body.,"PROS:Â Horrors number one goal is to keep you at the edge of your seat, to keep you uneasy, to keep you white knuckled. This movie did all that and then some. I can't even capture in words how intense this film is. Cinema is meant to put people into another realm and make them feel the emotion that the realm should be giving you. With DISTURBIA I was put into this dark and brutal place and I was scared with every scene. I am a thrill seeker, which is why I like horror movies, but this movie is much more than a thrill. This is an experience that you can't unlive. The movie just built and built until you got to the end. The resolution was the perfect dilution to a very intense climax. I liked that the film built up and built up until it exploded and then you were given just the right amount of time to cool down and process the awesomeness that you just watched.CONS:Â I wish there was more gore. I get that sometimes gore isn't necessaryÂ but sometimes it is. This was a movie where I wanted to see more to really enforce the ideas that the film wanted you to believe.

Mediocre stuff,"Very early impressions: Oy. Shia's brash approach to this character is already grating on me within the first five minutes. He's too brash, loud, and strongly NYr present...he even wears the toolish of all tool T-shirts, (""Ramones"") ('Guideto Recongnizing...too omnipresent in his blood) in the first fishing scene. Craven plays it with twinkling Irish eyes...Shia's acting if he's got something to prove. Imagine Kal Penn's bravado faux toughness, caretaker vibe in 'H & Kumar.' Oh no, the accident...Let's pour our hearts out. Only his lost puppy dog-eyes bail him out of the early scenes where he must play weak. He's stuck on house-arrest, where's his porn collection? Even Mom is totally casual-cool, 'sorry you're a felon...' I grew up in the wrong household. Rest: A by-the-books story that nonetheless pleases when it indulges its cheap, low-rent thriller pulpy origins that are a Foley specialty. Too bad it's hampered by its PG-13 rating, it should have been dirtier. Poor Morse, doomed to always play morally ambiguous creepazoids. (Even Von Trier could not resist.) However, its silly 'house-arrest' subplots and lack of honest emotional characterization made this an annoying downer for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbia is an engaging thriller,"Disturbia is a modern thriller that captures the essence of suspense through a clever blend of drama, tension, and relatable characters. The film introduces us to Kale, played by Shia LaBeouf, a teenager under house arrest who finds unexpected ways to pass the time. His curiosity about the lives of his neighbors quickly escalates into something far more gripping. The movie's strong setup in the first act establishes both the stakes and Kale's emotional depth, making the story feel grounded despite its escalating tension.David Morse's performance as a mysterious neighbor is one of the film's highlights, delivering an understated but chilling presence that keeps the audience guessing. The cast as a whole is well-chosen, with Sarah Roemer and Carrie-Anne Moss rounding out the ensemble in complementary roles. One of the more thought-provoking aspects of the film is how it toes the line between innocent curiosity and intrusive stalking, making you question Kale's actions as well as your own perspective as a viewer. This layered tension adds depth to the experience, even as the story transitions into its action-packed third act.What sets Disturbia apart is its ability to combine an intimate, character-driven story with moments of real suspense. The film may flirt with familiar tropes, but it does so with enough charm and style to stand out. With a solid script, strong performances, and a touch of modern flair, Disturbia is an engaging thriller that's well worth revisiting for fans of suspenseful storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not another Hitchcock rip-off!  Oh, hang on?  Hey!  It's actually all right!","Kale and his dad are fishing and having a good time. Their at an age when Kale's life is about to become his own. They are comfortable in each other's company and so are we. However, on the way back to town, they are involved in a car crash and Kale's father is killed. This tragedy plays on him and after getting into trouble at school one time to many and punching a teacher, Kale is giving a break of sorts, by avoiding Juvie and being placed under house arrest with an electronic tagging device. Obviously being an anxious, amorous teenager, this sucks for Kale till the gorgeous Ashley moves in next door. Things are looking up and nothing can change that. Except that Kale may be living next door to a killer, but is he, or is this all just his imagination?Thus begins the ""Rear Window"" rip-off that should have been ""Disturbia"". But of course it isn't. Thanks to the cast, the script and the director, what we have in essence is a combination, in feel anyway, of the great John Cusack films of the eighties mixed with Hitchcock's eye for mood, imposed on the modern sensibility. You watch it and feel it shouldn't work, but thanks to Le Beouf's easy charm, and skilled abilities, honed from working years on children's TV, he carries the film in a way you would not expect to work, but it does. Sarah Roemer is easy eye candy for the young males in the audience and handles herself well enough, but aside from Le Beouf the other big star of the movie is David Morse, another old pro, pretty much like Le Beouf, who relishes the role he is given as the mysterious neighbour who keeps himself to himself but is there a reason why?The director does a dynamite job of controlling the pace and the music moves the mood splendidly without you really noticing its there. The only downside to the film, and it is a minor one, is that you are always aware of the Hitchcock comparisons. You just can't shake that feeling.That said don't let that minor niggle stop you from enjoying what is a great surprise package. I know I did! Nuff said.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Very good use of tension levels, keeps you guessing, Annoying characters, but PRETTY DAMN CREEPY.","I just watched Disturbia and I thought it was quite different from what I expected. Though I picked it thinking it would be a good film, from what I read on the back, I found that it was a lot better than what I thought.One thing that I don't like is that it is very similar (the story is pretty much exactly the same, save the minor details) to Hitchcock's 'Rear Window', and I didn't find anything about this on the case of the DVD.... that gives me the impression that it's just a bit of a rip of... so it kinda annoys me that it was a successful rip off, because rip offs annoy me. >.< Though if it is accredited to Hitchcock, by all means ignore this criticism and watch it knowing it's a great re-make. :DAlso some of the timing towards the end could be a bit crazy and unbelievable, but it does add some crazy-fast atmosphere and builds tension. The only other major thing I can really criticise is that two of the main characters (Kale and Ashley) are fairly annoying... but you can live with them, I'm sure they're fairly agreeable people. And besides, Ronnie's awesomeness makes up for it.It keeps you guessing from start to end, and is constantly making the audience question if Mr. Turner actually is a murderer. I found that the use of tension levels was outstanding, as it is very rare to find a good thriller film like this that can pull off a bit off humour (that is actually quite funny) while still maintaining its scary disposition. It is not another one of those irritating films that has a complete high tension atmosphere all the way through, that is completely dense and emotionally tiring, although afterwards you will need at least a few minutes to catch your breath.A conventional misunderstood kid in a world of dark mystery and of course the occasional (or in his case frequent) peek at the sexy neighbour.

Not Bad the 3rd Time Around,"I have seen this movie three times. First, I saw the movie ""Rear Window"" that was made for TV starring Christopher Reeves. Second, I saw the Hitchcock version of ""Rear Window"". Finally, I saw ""Disturbia"" the other night. I must say that I thought the last, the best of the lot. It pains me to say this, as Hitchcock is one of the most creative and ingenious directors the film industry has ever seen, a veritable master of the macabre. Also, the Hitchcock version billed two fine Hollywood actors of the time. Nevertheless, the new movie has a lot more suspense and terror aboutit. It kept me on the edge of my seat, which the other two versionsfailed to do. (The TV version is almost unwatchable)Shia Lobeuf hasdeveloped into a fine actor since his days on Even Stevens.

Very few parts are worthy of mention although Aaron Yoo did manage to make me smile once or twice. Unfortunately David Morse played a very unrealistic bad guy. He was not in the least scary and came across more as a wimp trying to act hard rather than the chilling Anthony Hopkins. Maybe it was aimed at a younger audience but even if that is true I can't see what a teenager would think of it, unless they were ""hormones raging"" at the sexy Sarah Roemer.

I am not much of a fan romances, and certainly not teen romance, so you can imagine my anger upon discovering this. The movie is either a teen-romance with a ""horror"" subplot or a horror movie with a teen-romance subplot, I couldn't tell. The plot structure was terrible, the dialogue equally so, and the scary parts mostly consisted of clichÃ© see-scary-guy-in-the-window-with-lightning-flashes and scary-guy-shows-up-behind-you-in-a-tense-moment, among others.

Nothing Without The Actors,"After missing this movie during the cinema run, I recently went all out and ordered the DVD from a far away land (America). I had heard great things about this movie (many people have commented that this is one of their favorite movies) and since I have developed a crush on Shia LaBeouf I was pretty keen to watch this movie.I must admit I was expecting great things from this movie and was a little disappointed, the story line isn't gripping and the suspense is minimal. The main saving grace in this movie is the actors, Shia LaBeouf and David Morse.Shia's Kale is likable, well acted and is interesting to watch. Shia's movie star charm is what really carries this film. The humour and chemistry he has with each of his co-star is really felt through the TV screen, from his sexual attraction to Ashley, to his guilt/love for his Mother, the intense and mistrust of Mr Turner etc. Teeny-bopper moment: can I just say that the first kissing scene with Shia and Sarah is soo hot. Shia looks to be one fantastic kisser. It's one of the hottest screen kissers I have seen in ages which could have something to do with the tongue action (which is unusual to see in movies today, generally its open mouth, no tongue).David Morse's Mr Tuner has a freaky calmness to him. He doesn't say a lot in the movie but he conveys so much with a look or a movement. This man is a brilliant actor.Aaron Yoo is fine as the comic relief but I found Shia's character funnier, but that could just be my sense of humour.Sarah Roemer Ashley is dull and probably unnecessary. She's not a fantastic actress either.Carrie Ann Moss has a smaller role but she puts forth a motherly love brilliantly.In closing, bland movie, made bearable by brilliant acting and ""that"" kissing scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Perfect at the cinema,sense of loss on DVD","it was a film that was absolutely perfect with not a mistake in sight!Oh so scary and frightening and hilarious rolled into one!But that goes for the experience at the movies1On DVD it lost that sense of scariness as the film is not knowing who is doing what and not knowing really what is going on.in the movies,you sit in darkness for 2 hours with up to 200 strangers.this added a sense of scariness to the film.that sense was lost on DVD.it still has the odd scare on DVDand is still hilarious but through out the film i felt a sense of loss.but i would still watch it over and over for entertainment value purely but to do with scare i don't think so.it might be different for people who ONLY saw it on DVD but for those in the UK and Ireland where it is still on release,see it in the cinema first.still highly recommended outside of movies though",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An enjoyable film that could have been better.,"Firstly, Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite movies, however it is important not to compare this to that classic. Remakes are often less impressive than the originals because you know what's coming and because older films relied much more on acting as opposed to present day films which tend to rely on special effects, violence and sex.That aside, this film was overall a fairly enjoyable film to watch. My one major complaint for this one is that it wrapped up too quickly. By the time we have this guy getting accused of killing people, he's shoving the mother's head into the door and coming to the main character's house and slamming people's heads in with a bat.I think the film could really have been improved by letting the suspicions and tensions run a little longer. It seemed like we found out that he really was the killer too soon.Otherwise, I thought this was a fun film to watch mixed with some funny moments. It's worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Was  Suspenseful,Wow...this movie was good from the start. As soon as i saw it on the preview I said I'm watching it! This movie keeps you in suspense the whole time. As soon as you think you know what's going to happen next you would be surprised. What I liked about it is that it wasn't like other movies it actually keeps you thinking just like it said it would. I think that this movie was horror mixed with comedy. I was scared at times but then I laughed. I would love for there to be a second movie to it because I know that it would sell good and that I would definitely go see it. I also think that the second movie would be better because they already know to make it very suspenseful and also to use the same character because I think he did an excellent job in the movie!,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"gripping , great script, great acting","great film, very tense and at times you don't want to look! very good characters and very well acted. It is really entertaining and is fairly surprising in its intensity towards the end. The way it unashamedly runs the action alongside an old fashioned love story is refreshing, and reminiscent of classic suburban thrillers of the 80s and 90s. The script is also very good and it is not just the fear of the antagonist that creates tension, as the social tension and atmosphere between the two main characters also at times has you cringing. I would recommend going to see this film. It wont change your life but Its great fun, a good ride and will be an hour and a half well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a bit too teen-age-ish for my taste...,"Disturbia is not a bad movie at all, its just a little too teen-age-ish. And if you ask me it was not very original.

But other than that it was very enjoyable and fun. There was plenty of suspense and frightening moments. Humor was also added into the mix which is very nice except the comic relief, Shia's best friend Ronny is a bit annoying at times.The acting was good and the song choices were nice too- loved ""LONLY DAY"" by System of a down.

A Teen Movie!,"This movie is disguising itself as a Hitchcock type of movie when in actuality it is nothing more than a teen movie. The main characters are teens, the main occupation (other than spying on neighbors) are thoughts about the opposite sex, and the humor (what little there is of it) is directly towards teens. The story and the events that result from the plot are many times forced and rather unrealistic.

So well done. I loved it.,"I loved this movie. There are some heart-wrenching scenes, so if that is not your thing, beware.Kale had suffered a tragedy and acts out in school. This results in at home detention with an ankle monitor. Bored, and with his best friend Ronnie on vacation in Hawaii, Kale turns to video games for solace. Only, his mom objects. So Kale winds up spending his time getting to know his neighbors. Without their knowledge or consent.The setting of a middle class American neighborhood with all the expected and familiar tropes is pleasant and well played. There's the father and son throwing a ball, the kids riding bikes, the neighbor mowing his lawn, and the new folks moving in next door. Kale watches them all.Shia LeBouf is great in this movie. He's a natural as a bored, rebellious, teen. Frankly, he's adorable in his movie. ADORABLE. And he plays the part to perfection. His friend Ronnie, played by Aaron Yoo is also great and perfectly cast. The guys absolutely sell their roles. Add in the adorable Sarah Roemer and you have the main protagonists -- teens playing detective -- and getting in deeper than they'd expected.The movie is so well done, in my opinion and very enjoyable. It has been compared to that classic Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly masterpiece, Rear Window. It doesn't resemble that movie in any way except for the idea of someone being stuck at home and watching their neighborhood out the window. That's where the similarity ends and this story stands very well on it's on.Shia is a great actor, but I can now say the same about Aaron and Sarah. I've not seen either in anything else, but I look forward to seeing their other projects.A warning to those who are squeamish though; there is a bit of gruesomeness.

Disturb in Suburbia,"""Disturbia"", or should I say ""Disturb in Suburbia"", directed by D.J. Caruso and influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", is a very tense thriller, that despite the fact it doesn't bring anything new to the genre, thanks to its mysterious atmosphere and genuine comedy, it succeeds in every aspect.Under the tag-line ""Every killer lives next door to someone"", we go to the movies on a Friday night, we pick a seat, start eating our popcorn and prepare ourselves to enjoy a horror/suspense movie. It's been 30 minutes since it started and we don't see the 'horror' part coming. We feel like if we're watching a remake of ""The Girl Next Door"", which is acceptable for the 'average audience' but suspense fans start to wonder ""Will the scares ever start?"". After a romantic comedy set-up, D.J. Caruso brings us some of the bad color when we see some blood stains on a window, with some screaming of a woman in the background. Is in that moment when we get that breaking point we've all been waiting for.With some effective jump-out-of-your-seat scares, a typical cat and mouse game between protagonist-antagonist and a soundtrack that give you chills, in the hand of Geoff Zanelli, lead 'Disturbia' to an excellent climax that is followed by a predictable ending, appreciating the fact that it's not ruined by a 'surprise twist' we've seen lately in psychological thrillers that most of the time are not well-executed. This makes 'Disturbia' a film that appeals to all audiences, no matter how old you are.Taking away the fact that we feel like we're watching a chick flick in the first act, its third one compensates everything else, leaving everyone satisfied, from horror-suspense fans to those who don't need to watch liters of blood on a screen to feel fear. With an excellent performance from Shia LaBeouf as the typical suburban teen and a nice mixture of genres hard to put together, turn 'Disturbia' in 105 minutes of suspense, drama, comedy and mystery that everyone will enjoy, mostly if it is accompanied by a tower of Twinkies...",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a hip homage to Rear Window,"Disturbia is an updated, teen version of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller Rear Window.Shia LaBeouf (Transformers, I Robot) is Kale, who is placed under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher for a barbed comment about his father, whom Kale lost in an accident. His mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix, Memento) is frustrated, trying to find out how to keep her rebellious son at bay. Moss is underutilized but her subtle, loaded acting is effective (I've associated her so much as Trinity in The Matrix that I keep expecting her to morph into something other than the hapless housewife she plays).Good thing Kale's best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) can be relied on for comic relief and indulges Kale's voyeuristic exploits (no iPod, no TV, no PC; what's a boy to do?).Their fave neighbor to spy on is new girl-next-door Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Perpetually bored and longing for some summer action, she teams up with the boys as they play stakeout in Kale's room, trying to get to the bottom of what Kale insists is murder by Kale's neighbor Mr. Turner (played chillingly by David Morse).The dialogue is painfully earnest and realistic despite the outrageous situation. The members of the cast are likable and turned in strong performances (especially LaBeouf). Disturbia works because it involves its audience and is refreshingly sincere in its delivery. It unravels like a hip homage to Rear Window and doesn't try too hard to be liked, despite being mainstream in execution.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
boring....,"Yes, it is similar to Rear Window...unfortunately, that didn't help it in any way...where Rear Window lacked in constant thrills it made up for it with style and dynamic between it's main characters...there was no dynamic between the characters in Distubia. They were more annoying than anything. And utterly boring...I could have cared less what happened to them. And for what was marketed as a thriller - there was way too much of a cheap storyline revolving around a budding romance and less actual thrills. The only highlight was David Morse, who was fantastic, which is of course no surprise. This movie was certainly made with a target age in mind, and I'd assume that is why it did so well.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Waited for a twist, or a moderate surprise, that never came","Back in 2007, Steven Spielberg pushed for Disturbia to be a vehicle for up-and-comer Shia LaBeouf, the kid he was so impressed with in Holes. He would also later cast the young star in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and no doubt played a part in hiring LaBeouf for the lead in Michael Bay's Transformers franchise. It hasn't quite gone to plan for the once cherub-faced and effortlessly charming actor, but his off-camera antics are perhaps more to blame than his film choices, as well as his frequently bizarre artistic endeavours. Anyway, LaBeouf is the best thing about Disturbia, demonstrating the sort of motor-mouthed confidence and assured screen presence Spielberg no doubt saw in him when he was still a child actor. Still, he cannot save Disturbia from turning into a conveyor belt of clichÃ©s and slasher tropes.Traumatised by his father's death a year earlier, teenager Kale Brecht (LaBeouf) struggles to focus in school. When a classroom incident leaves his Spanish teacher with a swollen face, Kale is sentenced to three months house arrest wearing an ankle monitor that bleeps when he ventures further than 100 yards from his house. After a montage of video games, junk food and Red Bull, Kale's mother Julie (Carrie- Anne Moss) takes away all his television and music privileges. Boredom soon sets in, until he spots his beautiful new neighbour Ashley (Sarah Roemer) taking a dip in the pool. Using his binoculars, he starts to watch his neighbours intently, buoyed on by his comic-relief best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). Ashley soon joins in on their games, as their attention is turned to creepy neighbour Mr. Turner (David Morse), whose car and general behaviour matches that of a serial killer being reported in the local news.Clearly aiming for Rear Window for the teenage crowd, Disturbia forgets to add that one key Hitchcockian ingredient: suspense. If you have seen the trailer for D.J. Caruso's film, then there's really no need to see the whole thing. A fast-paced beginning that introduces the three perfectly likable teens zips by smoothly, and offers the odd genuine laugh. When the central serial killer story kicks into gear, the action descends into a series of loud bangs and quick edits, so all hope for anything resembling tension quickly flies out of the window. Almost as if film is afraid of offending its young target audience, the moments of 'horror' are frustratingly soft, and it fails to convince that any of its attractive young cast are ever in any real peril. I was left waiting for a twist, or even a moderate surprise, that never came, so I was forced to sit through a plot I had worked out within the first twenty minutes.

Nothing Good Happens in Disturbia,"So the kid kills his dad in a car wreck because he's a lousy driver and was talking on the phone and tailgating another driver., then he punches out his Spanish teacher because he's too stupid to learn Spanish (it's the end of the year as the kids are talking about what they will do that summer, so the kid has had at least one full year of Spanish, yet he doesn't know anythin), then he treats his mother like a servant, he's just under 18 and can't take care of himself, and he's basically a brain-dead product of too much TV and video games. This is how the story begins. If the kid dropped dead, I think the world would be a better place for it.This set-up was just poorly written and conceived, and I'm only 16 minutes into it. If his father was such a great guy, why is his son a moron? Of course, the family is rich (their neighbors have a pool) because this is Hollywood and they probably think that people who live like this are middle class.Yet another story that is almost entirely predicated on the fact that no one closes their curtains, ever.The girl was gorgeous, but that just ain't enough to carry such mediocrity.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I want my hour and 40 mins back,"Most of the movie was boring and sloppy and only to the end does it get interesting, i guess it really depends on what your interested in but it was not worth watching.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing,"A textbook example of the fact that making trailers is an art. The suspense that is displayed in the trailer is only to be seen in the last 20 minutes of the movie. The major part is to be compared with a classic teen feel good / romance movie. The marketing guys did a good job.Looks to me that the plot writer didn't seem to know in what direction he/she wanted to go and decided to try and make a fusion between teen comedy and cheap thriller.Trinity belongs in a nice black leather suit and not as a failing mom with two jobs, lack of personality both in the character and acting performance.Nice to watch on DVD as time pass but no big screen material.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rear Window for teens,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: this is Rear Window for teens. They watered down the plot, added some action, a new soundtrack and some sexual references and came up with something that is entertaining, but not amazing.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The only person this movie could horrify is Hitchcock.,"The first half of ""Disturbia"" shapes up to be an obvious homage to ""Rear Window,"" so I got sucked in. I had to fasten my seat belt for the second half, though; it plummets mercilessly into schlock, approaching the level of ""I Know Who Killed Me,"" the Lindsay Lohan bottom- dweller that deserved even more than its record-setting eight Razzies.Fellow time-killing IMDb.com critics have pointed out the plot inconsistencies, so I won't. I endorse praise of LaBeouf's and Morse's performances, and heartily add Aaron Yoo to the list. And I would thank the filmmakers for lighting the many night scenes so badly that I was spared from seeing much of the action.That's almost it for praise, though. The turning point toward Razzie-world occurs with the first lines delivered by the talent- free Sarah Roemer (cf. bare-breasted Phoebe Cates and masturbating Judge Reinhold in ""Fast Times..."" for real swimming girl/peeping tom footage). But let's not blame a flicker-in-the-pan like Roemer when the ""Disturbia"" authors, Landon and Ellsworth, are the real perps. The first half shows such promise that one or both obviously have talent, which makes me wonder how this movie went so wrong. Somebody (the director?) trashed an initially engaging homage to Hitchcock, which the writers had enlivened with some crisp and funny dialogue, mostly delivered by LaBeouf's Kale (who names their kid after a crop in the cabbage family?) and his sidekick, Ronnie, played by the gifted Mr. Woo.It was one of Ronnie's lines, inf act, that summed up the movie for me when the credits finally rolled: ""Operation Stupid is officially over!""",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Illogical,too much build up and unsuspenseful","Do you know what makes this movie inferior to Rear Window...everything.
Now I can't help but feel as if those who made this film were in a no win situation. If you admit and make it a close remake audiences will draw comparisons and if you don't audiences will criticize its similarity. Perhaps one should stay clear of it entirely.The movie takes a ridiculously long time to get going and it's not till about an hour in till we reach a turning point. Instead we are inundated with ridiculous 'texuturing',backstory and build up. The action and thriller moments of this film are bland unsuspenseful and rank with illogical behavior.It's an insult to James Stewart to compare him to Shia LaBeouf but even compared to a loaf of bread Shia's a poor lead. No further talent can be found in the rest of the cast except perhaps for David Morse; who's the only true redeeming factor in the film.The movie fails at every aspect and embodies the lack of talent among modern filmmaking.Just watch one of cinema's finest pieces Rear Window.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very dumb thriller,"I haven't actually seen Rear Window, but I am aware of the premise. This is a similar idea - a teenage boy Kale (played by Shia Laboeuf) just short of 18 is confined under house arrest and suspects his neighbour may be a serial killer.Firstly, the whole thing shot from the perspective of the teenage boy verges on soft porn the whole time as he spies on his female next-door-neighbour, Ashley. The story is very clumsily delivered and every setpiece is one you've seen before in this type of movie.The boy's mother is played by Carrie Ann Moss - a very good actress in my opinion who is given absolutely nothing to work with.But pretty much all the other characters are badly drawn and annoying. The big romantic scene between Kale and Ashley made me cringe and laugh at the same time.The only positive side is that a lot of it became unintentionally funny - unfortunately not quite funny enough to fall under the ""so bad it's good"" category.You're better off seeing Rear Window, Psycho or watching episodes of Dexter. In fact, I just remember thinking of the villain, ""Dexter he is not!"".",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Way Too Cute for This Type of ThingÂ…Standard StuffÂ…Slightly Overrated,"Director D.J. Caruso isn't a bad Filmmaker but is not Great by any means. He occasionally makes interesting Films like ""The Salton Sea"" (2002) and ""Taking Lives"" (2004). But ""By the Numbers"" most of the time. This is one of those.No surprises, not much Style, and conspicuously cute, this is a rather tame take on Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" (1954) by way of ""Teen Romantic Angst"". Shia Labeouf is a nervous, hyper-active Actor that has attained Star Status way beyond His ability to transform or ""Act"" like anything more than what He is. One Role is the same turn as another.Here He is upstaged on every level by David Morse, if not everyone else, who does just what the Script calls for and nothing more. The Buddy Sidekick is annoying most of the time and the pretty ""Girl Next Door"" is pretty smart but the Chemistry between the Teens is nothing short of standard stuff and ClichÃ©d.The Movie meanders along with one scene melting into the next until commonplace and complacency sets in and all of sudden the Third Act wakes from its comatose state and erupts in a frenzied finale that is all over the place and never settles in a coherent display of what is happening.The Film is Slightly Overrated and a bland, borderline boring Psychological Thriller that never quite thrills or goes very deep into the Mind of the Killer. Young People who don't have very much Film Going Experience may find it more entertaining than others. But it is just too safe and saccharine for its Own Good and is never intriguing or intense. Just another exercise in Standard Stuff Movie Making.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
