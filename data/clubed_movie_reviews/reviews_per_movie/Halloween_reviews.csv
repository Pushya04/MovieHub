The Greatest of the Slasher Flicks,"John Carpenter's Halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters.This was the first and without doubt the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date.Halloween marked the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a defining point in the late great Donald Pleasence's career. A true classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The nostalgia!,"I just love the nostalgia of watching this movie over 40 years after its release. It's super creepy and, if we're being honest, it's also ridiculously cheesy and moronic, but this is one of the most famous horror movies of all time! When that music hits, it's just so iconic. I can't bring myself to rate it less than an 8. It's Halloween, man!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sure scared me back in 78,"I was 20 back in 1978, and saw this on opening weekend.  I knew nothing of it, and after growing up on the old Hammer films, followed by a period of almost nothing, this was quite a nice surprise. It really worked! Had me checking the back seat in cars, gave me a sinking feeling when I lost my keys, etc.  The low death toll and relative lack of blood, as compared to subsequent slasher films, has me really admiring how effectively it created the atmosphere & suspense that kept me on edge, and made me jump at the right places. I certainly don't jump any more at it, but I do have fun remembering what it was like watching it when the now-cliches were fresh & new.  I laugh at the 'horror' flicks of the 30s & 40s, but when they were new, I bet they were something. And I bet in another 20 years, today's toddlers will find Scream/IKWYDLS, et al, to be tame and passe too, at least compared to what they'll (& I'll) be watching then!I'm surprised at the number of people half my age who wish they could've been around to see this film when it was brand new!Looking back, Halloween probably scared me more when it was new, than other horror movies have,when they were new.  Horror films are indebted to Halloween for breaking some new ground, and I can't wait for the next horror film that will do something on a similar scale.",,Anonymous,Horror
Greatest Slasher Ever Made,"The best slasher ever made, and arguably one of the best horror movies ever made. John Carpenter is a genius. Amazing direction, an atmosphere built upon suspense and terror, effective use of first person pov shots. Immensely influential this movie birthed the best slasher villain, the best final girl, and the best soundtrack/theme. Above average acting and great performances from Jaime lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence (RIP). Although Texas Chainsaw and Black Christmas came before, this was the blueprint that sent the 80's into a slasher frenzy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The original is still the best,"The original Halloween from 1978 is the best one for me. It more or less does what the new ones do. The masked Michael Myers chases his victims, however, it's just different here. I just have a soft spot for old horror movies and older movies in general. From a horror perspective, no one is likely to be scared with this film today, although I did get scared once here. What I did like about the film though was the overall atmosphere. The opening scene was very well done in my opinion, and the film caught my attention right away. Add to that the intro with the excellent music that plays several times here. I would more or less describe it in simplicity is beauty. No master plot. Just a 70's horror chase. I do see a kind of charm in it though, and I liked it. For me, a good movie and especially a classic that I recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Absolute Finest,"Halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever!  John Carpenter and Debra Hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller.  Michael Myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th), The Miner (My Bloody Valentine), and Charlie Puckett (The Night Brings Charlie). Okay, so I got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre.  No longer did a monster have to come from King Tut's tomb or from Dr. Frankenstein's lab. He could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia.  And on The Night He Came Home...Haddonfield, Illinois and the viewers would never be the same.  There are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies.  First is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood.  Many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters.  This is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.)  Along with the setting, the movie takes place on Halloween!!  The scariest night of the year!  While most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, Michael Myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers.  Besides the setting, there is some great acting. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date.  However, it is Donald Pleasance, as Dr. Sam Loomis, who really steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of Michael Myers and feels compelled to send him to Hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend.  However, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film.  Once you hear it, you will never forget it.  I also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture.  Nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of.  In Halloween, John Carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at Michael Myers.  He always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, I think that is what makes him so terrifying.  There are many scenes where Michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness.  If you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. Unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find Michael, he's not looking for candy on this Halloween night..he's looking for blood.  Finally, Michael Myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness.  His relentless pursuit of Laurie Strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop.  He is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life.  So,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old DVD and watch in fright.  Trick or Treat!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Despite having some great moments (cast, music, and a scary monster), Halloween as a movie is overrated.","We're going back to 1978 to one of the original slashers, Halloween. This is a movie that has not only continued to be a constant watch around the autumn season, but has inspired several imitators hoping to capture that same success. I can't blame them as Halloween was made on a very low budget (it might have been lower then John Carpenter's first film Assault on Precinct 13), yet generated a major profit. You have to give it credit that while it was not the first slasher movie ever, it was the first to be centered around Halloween.What's interesting is despite the spooky surrounding of the holiday, Halloween was the first to set a horror story on that day. I think that similar to why we don't see Christmas settings in horror stories, Halloween too has a sense on innocence that even represents a right of passage with most children with trick or treating, watching scary movies, and of course, carving pumpkins. Having a dark character like Michael Myers suddenly come into the fold takes away the intentional fun scare to make way for the true scares. So is Halloween the classic that everyone says it is? Welllet's look at the story.After a very suspenseful opening that shows a young Michael Myers murdering his older sister, he is sent to a mental hospital where his doctor Samuel Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence) looks to keep him there as he says ""I saw nothing but evil in his eyes"". One evening before Halloween, Loomis sees that several inmates have escaped, including Michael Myers, who has stolen a car to make his way home to Haddonfield, Illinois.In that same town on the same block, teenager Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is getting ready for a typical night of babysitting her neighbors child Tommy while her friends are going to do the same. But unlike her friends like Lynda, Annie and Bob who want to make it a night of romance, Laurie is single, and thus more focused on being Tommy's friends and making it a nice Halloween. But once the sun sets and the jack o lanterns light up, Myers has made up a costume from a boiler suit and a mask and is heading back to his old neighborhood where Laurie is.People are constantly phrasing Halloween as the essential John Carpenter film and one of the greatest horror movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I find Halloween overrated. Is it bad? No, not at all. In fact there are some great elements. Speaking of which, let's get into the atmosphere. The beginning, which is all shown through Michael's perspective, is a masterpiece in horror staging and setting the mood to let you know that this kid isn't turning back. He will come out deranged. The rest of the time, you only see him with that mask, giving him the same idea that was occurring with Street Thunder in Assault on Precinct 13; that he's a force rather then a person.Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect as Laurie, with a combined sense of tension along with a bookish look that makes her the best choice for this kind of teenager. Donald Pleasance is often regarded with playing the authority figure, but few point out that he has that same sense of unpredictability and crazy that would have rubbed off given his job of watching Michael Myers. It's too bad that aside from the three leads, I found non of the other characters, even the child actors, that convincing. Laurie's friends especially only seem to exist to give the movie a longer running time.It probably has to do with the script, which aside from some good lines and setup, is not that good. If you listen to the way the teens talk, they seem too dumb for the sake of the plot. Even the adult characters just seem like stock cops and stock teachers that may have given this movie more depth. Without it, your stuck knowing whose very likely to get axed off while we wait patiently for Michael to eventually get to Laurie.Even the way this movie is shot is mixed. Many of the night shots seem clumsy and rushed which I can understand some of the reasoning (there are great moments with the way Michael Myers enters through the dark), but creates an lazy look when compared to how dark was shot in later John Carpenter films. I'd say that out of the things he did for the movie, John Carpenter's score may be the best as it is chilling and of course, has a memorable synth sound that would be his trademark.I'll give this six Michael Myers masks out of ten. The setup and situation seems ready to go, but I really wanted better characters out of the teens and a bit more unpredictability with the plot. Wouldn't it have been more interesting if one of the kids had gotten killed? At least there are a lot of elements that can make it entertaining in some areas. This is one horror movie I don't come back to that often, but I understand why a lot do. Take a look and see if this is one Halloween worth celebrating.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The problem is that I first watched this in 2018,"I've already grown desensitized by so many other horror stories.
Older movies dont have the acting, sound work, or cinematography as modern movies.
So, I didn't find it scary or all that entertaining.
I can see how it would have been scary to those living a sheltered late 70s life though.
I understand that it is a classic and it was interesting to see so many cliche scenes borrowed by many movies that have followed though.

Childhood Nostalgia,"Oh the memories!  I was 9 years old when I first saw this movie on HBO with my younger cousin and older brother....it was about 1980.  It was so creepy. When the movie went off me and my cousin were too scaried to go to bed so we stayed up until the infamous ""Night Tracks"" went off on TBS (REMEMBER NIGHT TRACKS??).  The 'Halloween' Movie Theme stayed with me for years. Everytime I hear the theme I think back to when I was a kid.  I would often dread when my parents would go out on the weekends and let my older brother babysit me.  I just knew that Micheal Myers would know that my parents were not home and kill me. In my opinion, a movie should stay with you long after the movie is over. That's what 'Halloween' did for me.  Each Halloween night, I remember back to 1978, when 'Halloween' came out.  I think of the young scared child that I was and how good the first 'Halloween'movie really was!",,Anonymous,Horror
...but you cannot kill the boogeyman!!!,"I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the ""clown"" mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times!Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better?Grade: ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A classic worth the watch, but it shows its age.","The Pro's:
Halloween is a classic horror movie for a reason. Its iconic theme is at once haunting and heightens the tension, while providing an aural cue for the villain. The first installment of what would become a staple franchise, it introduces an iconic horror figure up there with Freddy Kruger and Jason Vorhees, creepy and seemingly omni-present in the now infamous white mask. Michael Meyers has a way of suddenly appearing that just chills.The Con's:
This movie was made on a shoe-string budget a long time ago, and boy can you tell. One thing I noticed first is the sound quality. The movie just sounds bad. The music and voice tracks are just grainy and not ""clean"", and that's not a stylistic choice. This movie also suffers from the all-too-common horror movie trope of characters being absolute idiots and making dumb decisions no one would ever make in real life. It's also hard to ignore that for a character who seemingly only walks slowly, he sure seems to catch everyone who is sprinting, and even driving, away from him.Consensus:
Halloween became a hit classic because it delivers a great villain and a great theme song with creepy tension, but it's just barely better than a B-movie when you strip the nostalgia away, and it's minimal budget is apparent in the production value and audio quality. 6 out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true classic of its genre,"There was once a time where I wasn't crazy about horror but over-time I have grown to appreciate it. Halloween really is a true classic of its genre, it is genuinely scary, taut and is pretty much the only movie of the franchise in my opinion that is not only truly effective after all this time but also where everything works.Halloween is very well made for starters, with atmospheric lighting and camera angles definite things to like. The score is resolutely haunting, the story is tightly paced and compelling, John Carpenter's direction is superb with some inspired, efficient techniques and while I have heard better the dialogue is good enough with some sharpness and nothing really that stands out as too cheesy or stilted.The acting is very good, and the characters especially Michael Myers are iconic. Jamie Lee Curtis is more than just a pretty face, her acting seems very genuine and she gives her character welcome gravitas. Donald Pleasance is excellent too, while Michael Myers as a character is the personification of terror.Halloween also works so well because of its atmosphere. It doesn't rely on excessive and cheap gore to make its point, or frenzied camera angles and the like. What it has is real suspense and genuine jolts especially in the last twenty minutes.All in all, a true classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The one, the only, Halloween! The scariest movie of all time!","Halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! It is in my opinion, the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a one note score, yet managed to scare the Hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78.It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes Michael as ""...pure evil. The blackest eyes, the Devil's eyes"". Michael is on a mission though, to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween, while her friends are out partying and of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;DHalloween pays many homages to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights! ""They're gonna get you! They're gonna get you!"".

"A Bit Tame By Today's Standards, But That's Good","I didn't watch these '70s and '80s horror movies like ""Halloween"" until the mid 1990s when I watched every VHS I could get hold of, so a film like this looked pretty tame to what I was already used to seeing by the '90s. However, what this film offers (see below) has some real value, and has a major lesson to learn to the people who make movies..Comparing horror series that were both popular in the 1980s, I did not find it anywhere near as entertaining as the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" horror series. Maybe I was too old by the time I finally saw this, but I appreciated the humor ""Freddie Krueger"" provided as the main character in those Elm Street stories. A little humor, sometimes, is nice relief in a suspenseful horror flick.That's not to say Halloween wasn't worth a look, especially with young Jamie Lee Curtis making her film debut. And, like many films with sequels, I found this first Halloween as the best of all of them.Also on the positive side, it's nice to see a modern-day (post '60s) horror flick without all the blood and gore. The writers here were smart enough to play on our fears, not having gross body parts flung in our face. In other words, suspense is the name of the game here, something filmmakers did effectively for years in the classic era of movies. It seems a lot of that has been replaced with shock today. Young filmmakers who are into horror could learn a lot studying this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Boogeyman's Gonna Get You!!!!,"So much has been said about John Carpenter's 'Halloween' that adding anything to it will be like adding a few drops of water to the ocean. People have their own opinions when they review 'Halloween', but I am going to share my own experiences that I had with 'Halloween'.As the opening credits begin, we are introduced to a sinister looking pumpkin (Jack-O-Lantern) that looks spooky yet funny and harmless with its eyes, nose and jagged mouth lit by the candle inside. Looking at it for a few seconds, the viewers then begin reading the cast and crew names....Donald Pleasance in John Carpenter's 'Halloween', Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie.....P.J. Soles as Lynda...Nancy Kyes as Annie Brackett....then Featuring: Kyle Richards, Brian Andrews...and by the time you reach 'Irwin Yablans' and 'Debra Hill' part.....You are just shocked to see that the 'sinister looking pumpkin' you almost forgot is now so close to you that you have no chance to escape its evil eye! That's what Michael Myers is for me! That's the beauty of Halloween.....The evil sneaks close to you and the worst thing is YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO FACE IT!!!!Michael Myers is faceless, but being faceless makes him more menacing and scary. The 'fear of unknown' is more bone-chilling than the 'fear of known'. Michael Myers is unpredictable. We know he is evil.....and he only wants to do evil for sure......but how would he do it? We never know this. He uses his silence as a cloak to hide his deadly yet unknown agendas.Moving ahead in our lives, we always think it will be like that forever. Same old routine, going to college, working part time, chit-chatting with friends, teasing and gossiping. Life seems so easy, safe and enjoyable....Isn't it? But then a violent faceless 'shape' (Guess who 'The Shape' is!), whom we never thought of, shows up suddenly out of nowhere. His path of life, his point of view, his aim and his everything is entirely different from the common definitions and stuffs of life! You never noticed him (just like the sinister looking pumpkin) and remained busy in your daily chores, and eventually when he came very close....you realize that it's too late to escape death!Halloween needs to be preserved for eternity. It's an amazing combination of horror, mystery, nostalgia and music and fortunately each of its aspects work so well that together they give us this towering masterpiece. John Carpenter taught me to believe in boogeyman. He taught me that they do exist. He taught me to keep an eye on the dangers that may be hiding in vicinity and finally he taught me to keep the lights on while watching 'Halloween'.I really thank John Carpenter for making it way better than it was expected to be and for making something that has been scaring us for the last 37 years and I bet it will continue to do so till 'Horror' genre is alive.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A solid horror film that, for some reason, doesn't appeal to me entirely","I have mixed feelings about this film. I like it and I've seen it around five or six times, but there's something about ""Halloween"" that I find dissatisfying.Incorrectly regarded as the first slasher ever made, ""Halloween"" started a trend of low budget films about mysterious killers wearing a mask and murdering young people with no specific reasons. The truth is that ""Halloween"" changed horror movies for good and served as an influence for many horror films that came after. While ""Black Christmas"" came four years before this, and it is one of my favorite slashers, I think it is less known, because we never get to see the killer, while ""Halloween"" gives us a very frightening looking villain, capable of causing horror to the most experienced horror fans. Michael Myer's design is actually very modest: a white mask with black eyes, a blue overall and a big kitchen knife that make him very sinister, without having to appeal to something more brutal and explicit, like some of the slasher killers that came after him. Michael is a very well designed horror villain and he is probably one of my favorites too (keeping in mind that this isn't the only ""Halloween"" film). So what is it about ""Halloween"" that doesn't quite do it for me?My main problem with ""Halloween"" is that I find it a little bit slow (there, I said it!) and I'm sure this is the main reason why other people dislike it as well, which automatically causes avid ""Halloween"" fans to accuse the detractors of only being capable of appreciating horror films with a lot of cheap-scares. I actually don't have a problem with slow films, but I feel like most of this film features the main character going on about her business, chatting with her silly friends about high school crushes and stuff, and we occasionally see Michael Myers appearing here and there. I do realize that this is intended to create a frightening atmosphere and it actually works well, but after a while, I find it a little bit tedious.Those who want gory murders will have to skip this film. While I think gore is not always a requirement, I would normally expect the murders to have some kind of shock value and be disturbing, even if we don't get to see a single drop of blood (it can happen). Most of the murders are rather predictable and what we see on the screen isn't too disturbing or shocking, at least not by nowadays' standards. Fortunately, the music during the murders is so powerful and fear-provoking that it makes up for the lack of brutality. For the life of me, I can't understand how ""Halloween"" got an R-rating in so many countries. Not only there's barely any blood in it, but also, the nudity is very naïf and harmless.Towards the last twenty minutes, ""Halloween"" displays a lot of suspense, mainly with Laurie Strode (the lead) being chased by the sinister Michael Myers. This part of the film is not only full of tension due to the fact that a merciless killer is out to get an innocent high school girl for no apparent reason, but also because two small kids are in danger and it's the lead girl's implied responsibility to protect them. The confrontation between Michael and Laurie is chilling, as the killer is apparently impossible to kill and Laurie, in all her nervousness, goes out of her way to make the worst possible choices when it comes to escaping the lunatic. While I find the night scenario and the dark in general to be fitting for a horror film about a mysterious killer, I find the excessive dark to also make it very difficult to fully appreciate what's going on at times.The acting in ""Halloween"" is very solid, which is unlikely to find in slasher films, or at least the ones that came out during and after the eighties. The main three actresses are Jamie Lee Curtis (unknown back then), P. J. Soles and Nancy Loomis, while English actor Donald Pleasence plays Detective Sam Loomis. I have no complaints here, like I said, I found the acting to be rather convincing and spot-on. As for the characters, the lead is a mousy girl, named Laurie Strode, who mostly keeps to herself and behaves like a nice girl. Laurie's friend however, are nothing like her; Annie and Lynda (her two besties) are outgoing, popular and fun and yes, they have sex, they drink alcohol and smoke. Now guess which ones get killed and which ones get to live for several more sequels? Laurie is a good lead and someone the audience would normally care about. She's a very mature girl, responsible, hard working, great with kids and even though she doesn't follow her friends' life choices, she doesn't judge them either, which makes her a perfectly likable lead, which is important in a horror movie, because we are supposed to like her and root for her.""Halloween"" holds up pretty well as a solid horror film that manages to avoid the campiness or the unintentionally funny moments, which is crucial if we are hoping to see a genuinely scary horror film. There are some well created moments filled with suspense and the emblematic music (composed by Carpenter himself) intensifies the feeling of uneasiness during the climax of the film. All in all, a good horror movie that is simply not one of my favorites.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An unbiased review.,"There is a major difference between having respect for a film and being truly captivated by a film. Respect is simply realizing the importance a film had to cinema, or a certain genre, and admiring it for what it was in its time. Captivation is when you watch a film and are truly amazed by what you have just witnessed: in result, you think about it for days; you buy wallpaper with the main character printed on it; you give it a perfect score; it becomes a part of your life. With that said, let me briefly talk about the two main groups that make up the Halloween fan-base.Group (1) watched the film when they were 4-years-old or when it first came out, went in their pants, and then childishly force the biased idea that it's THE scariest movie of all time into the heads of everyone who is even a mild horror fan. Because of nostalgia, they ignore the fact that Halloween is just a generic killer-in-the-house movie, even in its time, and place it high above anything and everything that has come out in the horror genre afterward. It doesn't matter how original or intelligent a modern horror movie is, in their mind, by God, it can't touch Halloween. Funny, though, if you ask them ""Why?"", they can never answer you. Group (2) watched the film in their teen years, thought in the back of their heads that Halloween was nothing special, but gave it perfect scores out of pure respect and duty. Group (3) is rare, but it's the few who saw it recently and genuinely thought it was a superior film, without being biased by positive scores. Group (4), which I include myself in, is completely middle-ground. They realize the most of the film is nothing special, but there are enough cool elements to keep them from saying its pure crap.The reason I bring up the fans is because it's a subject that no one really wants to talk about, but a subject that is very important when analyzing the film. With millions of ""Perfect!"" opinions beating down on you, honestly realizing the mediocrity of Halloween isn't an easy thing to write in a review.The main reason Halloween isn't as great as it's hyped to be is the core story. A juggernaut killer kills. Point blank: it's generic, unoriginal, and just downright boring, even in its time. As citation, the year before Halloween came out, Stephen King expressed in an introduction that he was sick of ""generic killers"" and that he could ""write this in"" his ""sleep"". (Note: This was not in response to Halloween or any other movie, but his personal feelings.) When I look at Halloween as a story and as a story alone, I cannot give it any credit whatsoever. It's pathetic. It's painfully unoriginal. Much more complex and original horror stories were told in the '70s. For one, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ('74). Another, Alien ('79). Another, The Shining novel ('77). Another, Carrie ('76). Halloween, in comparison to its peers, is just primitive in the way of plot, and that's the main reason I cannot give it a higher score. Some inaccurately credit it for starting the slasher sub-genre, but because it didn't, I can't even give it story credit for that.However, the reason I don't dismiss the movie as a total waste of time is because of the atmosphere and directing. John Carpenter doesn't quite reach the perfection here with these two elements that he later reached with The Thing, but it's still impossible to ignore how superior they are in Halloween. The opening sequence with Michael as a child is absolutely brilliant. It pays homage to Black Christmas ('74) by doing a first-person view of the killer, then takes it even further with a third-person view afterward. The Halloween night atmosphere isn't quite done to absolute nostalgic perfection, but it's done better than any other movie I've seen. The camera angles, the reveals of the killer, the shadowed faces—all clichés to us now, but this was the movie where most of them originated. And it did all of this without cheese. This aria is where Halloween deserves its credit.With that said, Halloween really isn't scary at all unless you grew up with it. Even in its time, it was a generic killer-in-the-house film, and, as I've read some reviews state, it wasn't scary even on its release night. As for gore, I'm not even sure I saw a single drop of blood in the entire film, and that got a little cheesy. The acting is also borderline cheesy at points, but nothing too distracting. What is distracting, however, is the lack of action for most of the screen time does get very boring. It is obvious Carpenter is trying to make up care for the characters by showing up drawn-out bits of their lives, but that doesn't work because they're all just cardboard, personality-less people. Halloween does get boring.I never write reviews based on my respect of a film, but rather on my view of a film. Halloween deserves the credit it receives. I won't deny that. What I will deny is that this is the scariest movie of all time, or even one of them. What I will deny is that this is the be-all-end-all horror movie, because there are far more intelligent and original horror movies out there. What I will deny is that Halloween is the ascension to heaven that the brainwashed fanboys make it out to be.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
It *is* a classic,"To begin, this is a twenty year old film.  Few films remain as suspenseful today as they did when it came out.  (see: Night of the Living Dead -- had people running from the theatres when released but is very tame today).  Clearly a movie fan brought up on the standards of today's movies will fail to find enjoyment of such 'classic' films.  But when watching Halloween today perhaps it helps to consider a few things: Halloween was a low budget film (read: bad acting, poor special effects) made for only $300,000.  It was not a product of Hollywood but a bunch of 20 year olds.  This was the first film to feature the Boogeyman that Wouldn't Die which has been ripped off time and time again in the Friday the 13th, Elm Street, Scream, etc.  You're used to it now, but Halloween did it first.  Even Scream ripped off the look of the villian in Halloween.  The theme of teenagers being stalked by a madman has been ripped of numerous times as well (again, Halloween did it first) but what seperates Halloween from the imitators is that it plays on traditional fears: The Thing that Wouldn't Die; the Boogeyman coming to get you; being followed and stalked; the boyfriend returning to the room under a bedsheet -- and it's not really him; someone hiding in the car... all things that have made our skin crawl in real life at one time or another. Watching Halloween tonight again for the first time in years I found myself again on the edge of my seat.  Classic?  Hell, yes.  Maybe not to a generation who feels Scream was a 'good' horror movie but a classic none the less.",,Anonymous,Horror
THE perfect horror film!,"Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. It is a simple movie told very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. The cast is all terrific. I wish they had never made sequel after sequel. The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even now I get a chill down the spine.,"I must have watched this movie a hundred times or more, apart from being possibly the greatest horror movie of all time, it's a damn good movie in its own right. Fantastic story, really well acted, plus it has one of the best musical scores I have ever heard. How many films can boast a soundtrack that can evoke such feelings as Halloween? not many. 37 years later and it's as watchable today as it was back then.Talk about getting the acting balance spot on, Jamie Lee Curtis made the perfect victim, brilliantly set against Michael Myers, the perfect bad guy, and Donald Pleasance was utterly flawless as Doctor Loomis. I hadn't realised just how good Donald Pleasence was in this film, the speech he made was almost iconic.It plays on so many of our fears, the young Michael in a clown mask, still as shocking today as it was back then. The thought of the bogeyman following you home, waiting on a street corner for you etc, the list is endless.I cannot believe having just watched it the lack of blood and gore, goes to show it simply didn't need it, it's the suspense and fear that creates the horror.There have been so many rip offs and 'homages' to Halloween, but there will only ever be one King of the Horror films, and that's Halloween! Thank you John Carpenter. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do Not Watch Alone!,"This was a movie that I had heard about all my life growing up, but had never seen it until a few years ago. It's reputation truly proceeded it. I knew of Michael Myers, had seen the mask, saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed. But I was growing up during the decade where Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how I was being cheated with cheap knock offs.Halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie. Now, by today's standards, it isn't as graphic and visceral, but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a quaint, mid-west town is a testament to his ability. The lighting effects are down right horrifying, with ""The Shape"" seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will. The simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense.The performances by all the players are well done, with specific nods to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Ms. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so likable and vulnerable. It is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by Michael Myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her, we want her to survive and get away.Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis like a man on a mission, and it works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets.Overall, not only is Halloween a great horror movie, but also a great film. It works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up. This should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie. And for an even more frightful time, try watching it alone with the lights off. Don't be surprised if you think you see ""The Shape"" lurking around in the shadows!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror films ever made,"One of the best horror movies ever made. The acting is nothing short of amazing. Jamie Lee Curtis gives one of her best performances ever. This film revolutionized the horror genre with its portrayal of the terrifying Michael Myers. As other films from the horror genre strive for perfection, the one movie that all of them look up to is this, the original badass Halloween. None of the sequels have topped the original, but Halloween H20 and Halloween: Resurrection have been the closest by far. The cinematography, music, and atmosphere are creepy and intense, and the whole movie is an insane thrill ride. Donald Pleasance fits right into the role of Doctor Loomis so perfectly that it is even more of a tragedy that he died before he could reprise his role in H20. I recommend this movie to fans of the genre, no matter what age. This terrifying film transcends all genders and ages (appropriate ages, of course). This is one of the scariest and most disturbing tales ever told, and the directing from John Carpenter proves why he has become such a horror movie icon. I absolutely love this movie, and if you haven't already been a witness to the wonder of the Halloween experience, I really recommend you go seek this movie out immediately--I promise you that it will blow all of your preconceptions about horror films out the window.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It may be the first, but it doesn't make it good","""Halloween"" from 1978 is a cult horror by John Carpenter, movie considered to be the first slasher horror and one of the most influential movies of all time. With all due respect, this does not automatically make it a good movie. This is Jamie Lee Curtis' debut movie, the movie that made her famous and one of the stupidest and the most boring movies I have ever seen. It practically doesn't have a story, characterization is also nonexistent, and complete lack of motivation makes Michael Myers one of the most unconvincing movie villains. The movie has no depth, no tension, and it is not scary either.One reason to watch this film could be the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is extremely hot. She changed a little over the decades, but her specific sex appeal and sensibility fits her better in her forties and fifties than in her youth. As she is buttoned up to the neck all the time, this reason falls apart. On top of that, she is a lousy screamer.The only good thing in this movie is Carpenter's simple but eerie high-pitched melody, that became one of the most famous themes in the history of horror, or even movie melodies overall.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Most Influential Of All Slasher Films!,"Possibly the most influential of all slasher films, John Carpenter's Halloween is the reason why this particular subgenre of horror even exists in the first place. Although it wasn't the first of its kind, it certainly was the game-changer for almost every other slasher flick that followed this low-budget indie horror only ended up imitating the formula that this classic originated.Set in Haddonfield, Illinois, the story of Halloween begins on the titular night in 1963 where we witness the 6-years old Michael Myers stabbing his older sister to death with a kitchen knife. The plot then jumps 15 years in the span of which Myers remained silent in a mental hospital he was confined to, only to escape from the facility and returns to his hometown to kill some more.Co-written & directed by John Carpenter, whose innate ability to churn out quality pictures from mere scraps of filmmaking elements has earned him a place amongst world cinema's most influential filmmakers, Halloween is one of the finest works of his career that presents the director in complete control of his craft, and the way he sets the pace & eerie tone from the beginning is a delight to watch.Carpenter creates an uncanny mood during the title sequence only which has nothing but a jack-o-lantern on the black screen, accompanied by the now iconic score, and follows it up with an expertly shot prologue which instantly brings the audience into the story. The script is equally impressive for the character of Michael Myers is handled with extreme care, and the writers leave no stone unturned to show him as an unstoppable force of evil.The technical aspects are skilfully executed, and every dollar of its low budget is efficiently used in service of the story. Setting the plot in a suburban location turns the very openness of the area into a playground of mayhem. Cinematography is inventive for the camera stalks our characters at all times, benefits from some ingenious placements, and is further uplifted by clever lighting while Editing makes sure that the suspenseful ambiance is kept alive from start to finish.But the biggest contributor, in my opinion, is John Carpenter's minimal, synthesised score for it elevates the tension to a whole different level and greatly amplifies the desired effect of its disquieting camera-work & editing. Whenever its main theme surfaces on the screen, there's an uneasiness felt in those moments & whispers of an ominous presence dominate those sequences. It's one of Carpenter's most notable musical pieces & is a major reason behind this film's success.Coming to the acting department, Halloween features a budget-friendly cast in Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, P.J. Soles, Nancy Loomis & Nick Castle. The film marks Curtis' acting debut and she does a neat job as Laurie; a high-school student who's continuously stalked by Myers throughout the movie. Pleasence is in as Myers' psychiatrist and the only person who knows what this homicidal maniac is capable of. And Soles & Loomis do a fine job as Laurie's friends who are also pursued by Myers.But it's the character of Michael Myers and how he's portrayed in this film that establishes him as one of the greatest antagonists in cinema history. Using nothing but a cheap mask that conveys no emotions, keeping him mute throughout the story & giving him an almost mythic strength that renders him invincible, Carpenter presents Myers as a devil incarnate who kills without empathy, and intelligently uses his presence in the film to build a sinister aura, not to mention the very aspects of this character has gone on to inspire many more villains.On an overall scale, Halloween remains one of the genre-defining films of the 1970s whose narrative structure has been adopted as a blueprint for slasher films ever since and its vast influence on cinema & pop culture cannot be downplayed. There were a couple of moments that bothered me but for the most part, this is a thrilling, entertaining & satisfying ride from Carpenter that is every bit worthy of its legendary status. A lesson in horror filmmaking that downplays the elements of gore & graphic violence to show the lasting effect a consistently maintained tense ambiance can have on the viewers, Halloween is the very definition of a slasher film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Another movie I never miss during the Halloween season,"The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. I expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :P). The fact that I couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book. Predictable horror movies bore me. Now, I know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie reveres John Carpenter, I have high hopes for his take on this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overrated in some respects, but a fine movie nonetheless","HALLOWEENAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: MonoFifteen years after he was institutionalized as a child for murdering his sister, psychotic Michael Myers escapes from custody and returns to his home town on Halloween, where he stalks and kills a group of teenage babysitters.Dismissed by many critics on its original release as a routine quickie with few redeeming features, this low-budget shocker - director John Carpenter's follow-up to another cult favorite, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976) - established its reputation via word-of-mouth at a time when movies could sustain a prolonged release schedule, and it finally emerged as one of the most successful independent productions of the 1970's. Aided immeasurably by Dean Cundey's expansive scope photography - his autumnal color schemes and deep, deep shadows suggest a feature-length extension of the similarly-styled Halloween sequence in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944) - and an unforgettable music score (composed by the director himself), Carpenter's film is stronger on mood than narrative, and builds slowly - too slowly, for some - toward a climactic set-piece in which the killer pursues his final victim.Donald Pleasence toplines an impressive cast (in a role turned down by Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, amongst others!) as an obsessive doctor who arrives in small-town America to convince local authorities that 'boogeyman' Michael Myers is nothing less than Evil Incarnate, while second-billed Jamie Lee Curtis - a little too old to be playing a frightened high-schooler - acts up a storm as the vulnerable heroine targeted for destruction by an unstoppable killer; her climactic face-off with 'The Shape' is a technical tour de force. An exercise in relentless terror for some viewers, an overrated bore for others, HALLOWEEN has nevertheless withstood the test of time, and its influence on the modern horror genre is undeniable. Followed by HALLOWEEN II (1981) and a host of increasingly lackluster sequels, until the franchise was dusted off and revitalized for a whole new generation in Steve Miner's impressive entry, HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER (1998).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mixed Feelings,"This is one of those film that I wish I could appreciate a lot more than I actually do. It created many of the common horror and slasher tropes that we have become accustomed to. However, I just did not feel any connection to this film.One of the main things I can appreciate is the slow build up to the deaths in the film. The gradual stalking that eventually leads to murder was much more effective than some films that worry the audience will get bored if violence does not happen every ten minutes. Jamie Lee Curtis gave an iconic performance, but I just wish there was a little more of her character. Obviously the score is amazing, with the phenomenal main theme!I do not have any severe criticisms with this film. Maybe sometimes some of the side characters lacked development as a whole.

Absolute timeless classic.,"31 Days Of Horror: Day 31Here it is, kids. The third corner of the slasher triangle that's essential viewing for any horror fan. John Carpenter made a no budget, streamlined little horror flick back in 1978, one that would start an eight film legacy of mania and legendary prolofic culture in the horror genre. The eternally relentless boogeyman Michael Myers has become an iconic movie monster, and my personal favourite of the slasher stable. From the moment that Carpenter's nerve jangling, haunting synth score kicks in, framing a half lit jack o lantern as the main credits start, we're lulled into a hypnotic, ambient atmosphere of sometimes unbearable tension and razor sharp sound design. The film opens as young Michael Myers snaps, grabs a kitchen knife and murders his teenage sister upstairs. Flash to fifteen years later, mute adult Mikey escapes from the sanitarium he's spent the last decade and a half in, much to the frantic dismay of his bug eyed psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Pleasence took the role and ran with it, and is at times even crazier than Michael himself, and just as iconic. Jamie Lee Curtis plays sheltered Laurie Strode, living in Michael's sleepy hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois and a prime target of the boogeyman. Carpenter wisely saves the chases and violence for the latter third of the film, and choosing to make Michael an almost unseen presence, lurking in shadowy corners of the unassuming suburbia he makes his playground out of, a vaguely threatening gust of unease in the fringes of the character's awareness. When the chases and kills do come later on, we're so wound up from the tenuous waiting, watching and wondering that the shock hits us harder at its sheer arrival. It's that mounting tension and reverence paid to the sickening anticipation of the horror as opposed to the horror itself that makes the film so special, influential and timeless. It's like a bad dream where something is inevitably, slowly waiting to get you. A horror classic, (hell a classic in itself), the king of slasher flicks and one of the most atmospheric movies ever crafted.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Light the pumpkin,"John Carpenter directed this low budget classic horror film.Carpenter also provides an irritating slasher style soundtrack that is louder than the dialogue.The film opens with a young boy called Michael killing his sister in Halloween.

The setting is perfect and Carpenter's score heightens the tension and suspense. Perhaps Carpenter's score is the crowning jewel in this film and is synonymous with the film. Although there is virtually no blood throughout the film, the audience can't help but think the murders are incredibly brutal and violent. Perhaps it's because Carpenter had no budget for this film, and therefore and had room for special effects or perhaps it was done by design, but directors of this genre should take a lesson from ""Halloween"" Less is MORE!

Outstanding,"Halloween(1978)stars a very young Jamie Lee Curtis, the late Donald Pleasance, and, among others, P.J. Soles(the cap-brat from Carrie).

One of the best films of all time,"This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, he made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early 80's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer.

the night of the masks,"The escapee of a psychiatric hospital comes back to a small town, Haddonfield where fifteen years ago, he was in prey to a deadly madness.

His thoughts will be confirmed when Laurie's friends (Jamie Lee Curtis) are murdered and she might also be one of his victims.""Halloween"" (1978) which put Jamie Lee Curtis on the map (but she would do better with Charles Crichton's so British ""a Fish called Wanda"", 1988) heralded a genre or sub-genre which has been thriving on the North-American continent for nearly thirty years now: the teenage slasher movie. The majority of these films are modeled in the same mold: a group of teenagers wrestling with an invincible, sanguinary serial killer who slashes them one after the other. This genre will be tapped again and again and will give masterworks like Wes Craven's terrifying, terrific ""Scream"" (1996) but also turkeys by the dozen: the likes of ""Friday the 13th"" (only the very first one is good) and saucy spoofs: the ""Scary Movie"" saga.John Carpenter isn't a mastermind of the horror/fantasy film even of the B movie. In general his camera work, some of his technical abilities are plagued by weak screenplays and irritable features pertaining to him. ""Halloween"" is his most palatable effort, though. The thrifty scheme according to which he builds a latent tension to make the audience wound up and queasy is perhaps easy, simplistic (long travelings and camera movements to delay the murders) but rather efficient although not mind-boggling. I blamed Carpenter for the limited potential of his scenarios, it's a bit evident in ""Halloween"": different steps of the story interlock often in a predictable way and some well-worn tricks aren't very welcome (Laurie's little brother who claims having seen the bogey man (the monster in reality) outside. The latter looks out of the window and... you guessed it). That said, Carpenter's expertise to make fear last makes forget the drawbacks of the scenario.Maybe the ones who will discover the film today will be disappointed.

There's very little violence (to be honest, an average Jerry Springer episode has more of that-and bear in mind that it's even more phony on his show)and just a hint of the vein filler and the ending is so unexpected and unfulfilling it should be given a slap. On one side, I admire the movie makers for creating a big-budget-ish movie with flying colors and John Carpenter for creating the suspense he did, but on the other side the movie miserably fails the test of time since the level of violence and brutality in the present time is much greater and today's youngsters (me including) don't find it nearly as petrifying as our parents.

THE staple of modern horror!,"Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween.Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis, Soles, Castle, and others are good too.So like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. It is a MUST for all genre fans!**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hands down classic horror film,Halloween is a hands down classic horror film. John Carpenter made a film that was often imaited but never duplicated. The camera angles are one of the many things that make the film scary. Carpetner allows the viewer to see through the eyes of the killer with the subjective camera and then there's the classic music score. Jamie Lee Curtis had a star making role in this movie and if you've never seen the film you should.,,Anonymous,Horror
The Standard,"IN 1978, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" set the standard by which all horror flicks both emulated and came to be judged by.For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween"" tells the story of psychotic killer Michael Myers, who (15 years after murdering his sister in cold blood) escapes a mental institution and returns to his old stomping grounds to wreak havoc once again, this time on a group of young teenagers on Halloween night.Basically, everything you are accustomed to seeing in a horror film has its roots here, including:-The blood-curdling score, which has never quite been duplicated. -The terrifying, weapon-wielding antagonist who knows nothing but murder. -The standard prey, that being young, sex-crazed teenagers who are so caught up in themselves that they become oblivious to their surroundings. -The ""jump scenes"" (often accompanied by loud music crescendos) that make your heart skip a beat, whether true or fake-outs.What's really impressive about this movie, though, is the fact that it was THE standard of horror films for such a long period of time. Until ""Saw"" changed the game with its graphic violence and outwardly moral musings in 2004, ""Halloween"" was the king of scary movies. ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" may have had their followings, and ""Scream"" did a great job of poking fun at the genre, but it was this flick that still remained on top of the heap (it helps to have your own built-in holiday, too!).Thus, if you are a fan of fright fests whatsoever and haven't yet seen this film all the way through (hard to believe, I know), it is a must-see. Or, if you don't have trick-or-treating responsibilities on October 31st, then settle in for another go-round of the seminal horror event.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overrated Film,"I thought this movie deserved a 7.5/10 but after thinking about it yea that's a no from me! People consider this movie one of the best movies ever and I disagree a big time. You know it isn't that great of a movie when I prefer the remake, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers and Halloween Resurrection! In fact the only Halloween film (not counting Season of the Witch) I consider worst is Rob Zombie's Halloween II (2009). The deaths in this movie are too tame and it's kinda boring. I did get a few laughs but it doesn't make up the fact that this movie isn't that great. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael himself, the plot and the music is the only reason it gets a 5. A story can have no story and still be a good movie or at least in my opinion. The sad thing is that Scooby Doo on Zombie Island is a better horror film then Halloween (1978) will ever be! It's not the worst horror film I've seen but I can grantee that this movie is not a movie I have to rewatch anymore and I've seen it three times. This really doesn't deserve the hype it gets. It's just a uninteresting film. To me a horror film can be good yet not scary yet this is neither good nor scary.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Slasher Of All Time,"There really isn't much left to be said about John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". However I am re-watching the whole Halloween franchise since Halloween is only a little over a month a way (stretching I know but I will take any excuse to re-watch these films) and I felt like it couldn't hurt to post another positive review gushing about this excellent movie.I'm fairly young so unfortunately I didn't get to experience this in the cinemas when it was first released, but I did get the chance to grow up with this film and it haunted me every Halloween since I was 12. The first time I watched it I was legitimately scared that a mask wearing psycho was stalking me in the shadows. Watching it today doesn't have the same effect, but it is a lot easier to appreciate the film when I'm not being scared to death.""Halloween"" does everything right, every scene of the film is just perfect and every time I watch I feel like I find a new scene that really gets to me and creeps me out a bit. Although the kills are very tame by todays standards they are still very well done and pretty terrifying. Sure the acting is a little over the top and some of the character's reactions while they are being murdered are pretty unrealistic and cheesy, but that is all forgivable just because this is such a classic.Like I said before, there isn't really a lot I can say that everyone hasn't already said, but if you are reading this and you actually have never seen this movie then I cannot stress to you enough that you need to watch this immediately.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pioneering Carpenter film,"Imitated, ripped-off and stricken with sequelitis, Halloween made its mark as the original slasher movie back in 1978 when it scared audiences silly and, as word-of-mouth spread, went into the record books as ""the highest grossing horror movie ever"".It has lost its power somewhat over the years. Now that we are familiar with stalk'n'slash flicks, such as Friday The 13th and the overly contrived comeback of the genre when Scream made them cool again, a masked killer lurking in the darkness just isn't scary anymore. It's too brainless and uncomplicated to make us think twice about the plot.The tagline was ""The night HE came home"" and the ""he"" in question is Michael Myers - no, not the guy from Austin Powers. I'm talking about a cold emotionless killer, who pointlessly murders teenagers while his face is hidden behind a William Shatner mask. It wears thinner than Calista Flockhart and the body count is lower than this reptile's blood/sugar level.As a six-year-old child, Michael killed his older sister for no reason on Halloween night. Now, 15 years later, he escapes from the loony bin (suspiciously easy) and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield to kill random teenagers and, for some reason, picks Jamie Lee Curtis as his ultimate prey. I guess at the time the senseless killing was scary in a way, but recent attempts to give it logic are plain laughable. The sequels just got worse and worse, more so than any other smelly franchise. The only thing that improved was the score.The 2.35:1 photography is quite good and it's bizarre that the rip-offs were never shot in full Panavision-anamorphic widescreen, because this is definitely the film's best quality. Director John Carpenter knew this and has stuck with the format ever since. The POV camera and the gradual fading-in appearance of Michael in the background is clever and quite cinematic, something the imitators and sequels never were.No matter how tame it may seem by today's standards, this is landmark film will always remain a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fear of Evil,"Made after Someone's Watching Me but released just before, John Carpenter continued his low-budget streak of filmmaking with this deceptively simply horror film set on the titular holiday. That it went on to gross more than 100 times its budget is a testament to how it triggered the cultural moment at the time. That it's actually a great little thriller is just icing on the cake.As I get deeper into John Carpenter's filmography (skipping around a little bit for different reasons), I've noticed a particular motif running through things. It's this idea of people becoming isolated from civilization or society or family and having to deal with threats. I'd never really considered that idea in his work until recently, and now since it is germinating in my brain I'm beginning to read all of his movies through that prism. The way that manifests in Halloween is in the relative absence of any parental figure. We see two fathers, Laurie Strode's father and Annie's father, the sheriff, and that's it. Mr. Strode has a single scene at the very beginning, and Sheriff Brackett stays on the sidelines, never becoming involved directly in the action. The only adult who comes to any sort of rescue is Donald Pleasance's Dr. Sam Loomis.What does all of this mean to me? It means that Carpenter is painting a generation of people, in this case a small group of teenagers, who have no concept of evil and being confronted with it for the first time. As Dr. Loomis explains, Michael Meyers, the child who murdered his sister and spent the next fifteen years in a mental hospital, is nothing but an engine of violence with no conscience. What Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Annie (Nancy Kyes), and Lynda (P. J. Soles) are concerned with that Halloween day is not evil, but their babysitting jobs and boys. Their grasp of the real world seems extremely limited with Laurie responding to a question in English class about fate being a natural force like she's reciting something she's memorized and doesn't really understand through anything she's actually done. So, one night, they face evil, and they don't have their parents to help them, they have to face it on their own without any concept of what they are up against. What nails this idea down is that the Meyers house still stands empty and abandoned in the middle of the town, and Laurie has no concept for why it stands empty. She views fear of it as childish, and yet she seems to have no idea what actually happened there. Her parents never told her.How does all of this manifest? Well, through Carpenter's Howard Hawks' inspired sense of storytelling. Much like in Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween is a character driven story. The movie takes its time to establish its tone, setting, and characters long before anyone gets a knife through the heart. The town of Haddonfield, Illinois feels safe and even kind of boring. Children wander down streets without any concern for their safety, even when there's a psychotic killer in a William Shatner mask driving right alongside them. Laurie's concerns about this figure that the child she babysits calls the Boogeyman all fall on deaf ears because there couldn't possibly be anything dangerous in Haddonfield. This threat that has been absent, has been forgotten even, lurks in waiting for its moment to strike, and it strikes when its victims are at their most vulnerable.The convention of the sex crazed teens contrasted with the virgin heroine arose from a practical storytelling concern: How do you kill a handful of teenagers while having one of them be cognizant enough of her surroundings to notice the death going on around her? By giving the teens something teens are already kind of obsessed with (sex) and removing it from the one who needs to survive to the end. If she's not concerned with sex all the time, then she can be clear-headed enough to fight back in ways that her friends can't. That is, of course, Laurie. She's unsuccessful with boys, too smart for them she thinks, and so, that Halloween night, she isn't expecting some boy to come over while she's babysitting. Instead, she's the one who takes up the slack of her friends, in particular Annie who decides to go off to see her grounded boyfriend, leaving her charge with Laurie.Meyers, as the evil that Laurie is up against, is a completely dehumanized threat. One of the reasons he seems to register so well is the William Shatner mask itself. A rubber mask, painted white, and cleared of all eyebrows seems to exist squarely in the Uncanny Valley, that space where something looks almost human but not quite, creating a sense of unease in most people. He also has no motivation or even dialogue. He's a walking killing machine, out to murder for completely unknown reasons. Even his doctor, Dr. Loomis, has no idea and simply wants to lock him up away from the world. He is just the manifestation of evil.The steadily building conflict between pure evil and the unexpecting good represented by Laurie comes to its explosive finale in an expertly delivered bit of both tension and thrilling chase as Laurie fights to survive against the threat that she's completely unprepared to fight.There's something subtly intelligent about Carpenter's work, especially when he's at his best. He's working firmly within genre filmmaking, but there's obviously some very smart stuff going on underneath the surface. This is a young man looking at a world and feeling cut off from the previous generations, feeling like he's been abandoned by those who came before, and making films that spoke to those concerns. He's building these ideas into his films at the most basic levels, suffusing the stories with the ideas and never needing to address them directly. There's something special about this Carpenter kid.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary slasher classic.,"Without much money to work with John Carpenter directs, writes and produces original music for this stalk, rip, slash, stab, psycho thriller. A young boy becomes a thrill killer on Halloween and is placed in an institution for the criminally insane. As he turns 21, he threatens to do so again. He escapes in time for Halloween. Very well made with plenty of scares, tension and sex driven teenagers.Tony Moran plays the bumbling, stumbling slasher Michael Myers. Donald Pleasence is Michael's doctor and leaves the institution to find his psycho runaway patient and bring him back before he does more harm. The alluring Jamie Lee Curtis plays Michael's sister and next intended victim. Also in the cast are Charles Cyphers, Nancy Kyes and Kyle Richards.

There Are Monsters Out There,"On 31st October 1963, a six-year-old boy named Michael Myers stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife. Don't ask why. It's just the sort of things six-year-olds do from time to time. Or at least they do if they happen to be criminally insane. Michael is committed to an asylum, but fourteen years and 364 days later, on 30th October 1978, he escapes and returns to his home town of Haddonfield, Illinois, pursued by his psychiatrist. The film tells of the havoc he wreaks there the following day, which is of course Halloween. He might now be an adult, but he still has a fixation with teenage girls, primarily a babysitter named Laurie and her friends Annie and Lynda.""Halloween"" was clearly influenced by ""Psycho"", one of the first ""slasher films"" from eighteen years earlier. Director and co-writer John Carpenter paid tribute to Hitchcock's film by calling the psychiatrist ""Samuel Loomis"" and his female assistant ""Marion"", both names of characters in ""Psycho"". Another link between the two films is the fact that the heroine Laurie is played (in her film debut) by Jamie Leigh Curtis, the daughter of Janet Leigh who had played Marion in the earlier film.Carpenter, however, succeeded in doing something which Hitchcock did not; starting a vogue for slasher films. Relatively few were made in the sixties or early seventies, with ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", allegedly based on the same real-life killings which inspired ""Psycho"", being one of the few exceptions. The late seventies and eighties saw a glut, so many appearing that the period became known as the Golden Age of the Slasher Movie. These included innumerable sequels to ""Halloween"" itself, and even three belated sequels to ""Psycho"", made after the death of Hitchcock who would probably not have approved.There is, however, one major difference between ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween"". Hitchcock was fascinated by psychology, particularly the psychology of the criminal mind, and was therefore at pains to explain the actions of his anti-hero Norman Bates in terms of his psychological history. Norman, who suffers from schizophrenia, is at one and the same time a polite, inoffensive young man capable of carrying on a perfectly normal conversation with the heroine, Marion, and the insane murderer who kills her. (Was the Christian name ""Norman"", I wonder, chosen because of its closeness to ""normal?"").There is no attempt to explain Michael Myers' psychopathy in the same way. Unlike Bates, whose actions can be explained in human terms, he is presented as a malevolent, inhuman force of nature. According to his psychiatrist he cannot be cured, and trying to explain the psychology behind his crimes would be as pointless as trying to psycho-analyse a whirlwind or an earthquake. We never see the adult Michael's face; we normally see him from behind, and when we see him from the front he is wearing a mask. The fact that it is Halloween allows him to wander the streets in a mask without anyone thinking this is anything out of the ordinary. Nor do we hear him speak; the normal indication of his presence is his heavy breathing. (Loomis, in fact, tells us that Michael has not spoken since killing Judith). When the child Michael kills Judith he is dressed as a clown; killers who wear masks or who dress as clowns were to become standard features of slasher movies.Although ""Halloween"" features a psychiatrist as a character, his function is not to provide explanations. Dr Loomis is more of a Cassandra figure whose function is to warn the people of Haddonfield of the danger they face but who is not believed. One of those who fails to take him seriously is the town's Sherriff, whose daughter ends up as one of Michael's victims.Carpenter's direction is skilful and, combined with the spooky music of the sort which was also to become a standard feature of this sort of film, creates an atmosphere of unease and terror without relying on excessive amounts of gore. There are, of course, violent incidents- you couldn't make a slasher movie without them- but they are not dwelt on in the way that some directors might have done. As slasher films go, this is a pretty good one, but it lacks the psychological depth and power of something like ""Psycho"". Carpenter is telling us that there are monsters out there. Hitchcock is not only telling us that there are monsters out there, but that some of them are seemingly normal human beings, which makes them all the more frightening. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Halloween: 4/10,"Each of the three pivotal teen slasher movies had one rising star. A Nightmare on Elm Street had Johnny Depp, Friday the 13th had Kevin Bacon, and Halloween had Jamie Lee Curtis. While the former two were just side characters, undeveloped and there for slaying, Curtis was given the lead role of Laurie Strode (her first movie role, too). And, amazingly enough, she performs quite well. The rest of the movie doesn't perform as well, though.Michael Myers (Tony Moran) killed his sister when he was six years old, and then locked up in a mental institution for fifteen years. He escapes and returns to his hometown, where babysitting highschool/thirty-year-old Laurie (Curtis) is. Myers proceeds to wreck havoc on the town for no reason at allwell, he doesn't really wreck havoc, all he does is indiscreetly murder a few people while Jamie Lee Curtis screams.I've heard this referred to as being `the scariest movie ever,' blah blah blah. There was almost no horror to it; the way director John Carpenter sets it up is so blasé and dull. He didn't create any tension leading up to anything: all he did was have a couple murders, a bland sex scene, and young kids. Usually those three things can be put together for an entertaining ride, but here they don't add up to anything.Technically, however, Halloween was good, considering its small budget. Its cinematography was almost too good for the movie itself. Many shots seemed like on take, and the angles were impressive. I've always liked when first person shots were done, and many times we saw things from Michael Myers's point of view, which was more impressive, too.On the other hand, not only was it not scary, but it wasn't believable. I know that movies weren't as violent back then, but there was absolutely no blood throughout the entire movie. I'm not much of a gore hound, but I actually wanted some to add some authenticity. When someone is stabbed, blood comes out, whether the knife is taken out or not. Also, I find it kind of sad when I know more about and care about the cold-blooded killer than the heroine. The character of Laurie is not only the world's worst babysitter but isn't a pleasant character. I almost hope that Carpenter remakes this movie.One thing I abhor about movies like this is that they almost know that there's going to be multiple sequels, so they don't explain everything, especially about Michael. I won't be seeing the sequels, that's for sure, so I would have liked to know what actually happened. Then again, that's some clever plot to make me see them. Although I may grow to like it more, which I probably will, Halloween is not the horror classic everyone makes it out to believe.My rating: 4/10Rated R for scary situations?",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Musical,"I either forgot, or never appreciated how darn good this is.The engineering of the thing is splendid. It was the first of a genre, so there was nothing to build on. It uses three building blocks.— It uses the notion of an evil, unstoppable force. It even features the three iconic films that set the precedent for this: The Thing, Forbidden Planet and Psycho.— It is basically wrapped around the fear of being watched. Sure there are violent murders, but the tension is built from what is seen and unseen, the notion that Myers watches and extensive POV shots. Especially the one at the beginning. This is what I call narrative folding where the watchers of the film and a character are merged.— Carpenter wrote and directed it. That you know. But you may not appreciate that he wrote the music. It is fantastic. He has said that he heard the movie before he imagined it in visuals. It shows. The score is not quite programmatic — that it annotates the screen. Instead it anticipates what is coming. The sense of foreboding is in the music, and gosh it is good.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Horror
Very effective and atmospheric horror classic,"Greetings from Lithuania.I won't going to say anything new that wasn't said before about ""Halloween"" (1978) therefore i will be short.

The whole third act was done superbly as well the whole movie. This is John 's Carpenter's masterpiece and he directed the hell out of this movie. The budget was ultra low even by 78's standards, therefore only genius like him could have pulled of such a movie.Overall, while its far from being perfect, this movie is a very effective horror film with superb mood, unforgettable soundtrack and amazing directing.

A fun cliché storm,"How to rate Halloween? As a casual viewing experience or as a piece of filmmaking? It's a toss-up as it's a fun experience I enjoyed watching, taking me back to the simpler stories of my youth, but it's also an amateurish and clichéd production that looks like it was made by the higher schoolers featured therein.So maybe a fun experience is all it's going for, and I can give it credit for that. The shocking opening sets the tone, the build-up of Mike Myers adds some suspense and the narrow survival of Jamie Lee Curtis' character is a genuinely nail-biting scene to watch. However, I can't ignore how the film is just so shallow and cheesy. There's no character depth as Mike Myers is just there as an implacable villain, the protagonists barely have anything distinct and the doctor is there just for exposition. Even worse, the number of times the Mike Myers stands in the distance just to freak out other characters (behind a bush, in a car, on a porch, etc.) is repetitive to the point of comedy.I get that Halloween is the film that kicked off the slasher genre, so it pioneered a lot of the clichés now repeated and done to death in the genre. As a cultural icon and historical influence, I can give it credit. As a viewing experience, I can also give it credit as an absorbing but cheap ride. However, I still can't shake off the feeling that I just watched a low budget Goosebumps episode stretched out to 90 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Film That Started The Horror Boom of The Eighties,"John Carpenter's masterpiece 'Halloween' is the film that started the slasher craze of the eighties.

Tommy keeps seeing ""the boogeyman"" but Laurie thinks he is just spooked.'Halloween' owes a lot to films like 'Psycho' and 'Black Christmas' but nearly every horror film that followed owes a lot to 'Halloween'.I feel that this film is a must watch for those who like horror but also for those who don't necessarily like horror as well, because it does not rely on gore or jump scares and it is very suspenseful and intriguing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overrated but is still good,"Many people praise Halloween as the ""Original Slasher"" and the ""Greatest Horror Movie ever"". Although I do like the movie a lot and John Carpenter is a terrific director, I have to say that both of those are false. The ""Original Slasher"" would have to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre which beat this by about 4 years. The ""Greatest Horror Movie Ever"" is always won by The Exorcist (I would disagree but hey, I'm not here to push my values on everyone else). I think this movie was slow and predictable at parts, and some of the kills took way too long to build up. Enough bad talk about this movie. Time for the positive. This movie has a good music score and some interesting scenes of The Shape sneaking around. The kills weren't half bad either. The lighting and music really set the mood. Dr. Sam Loomis was very interesting as well, much different than the modern stereotypical protagonists. I would say this movie gets a 7/10. Good, but not fantastic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A True Masterpiece,"Halloween (1978)**** (out of 4)It's hard to believe its been thirty-years since this thing popped onto screens and it's even harder to believe all the countless imitators that have followed. It's hard to do so now but if you clear the needless remake out of your mind and the various plot twists that would follow in all the sequels, this film remains incredibly true to form and hasn't lost one bit of its power. The story is pretty simple as Michael Myers returns to his hometown fifteen years after killing his sister and begins to stalk three babysitters. Such a simple plot line yet this film is the perfect example of not needing money to make some terrific and in the end this film remains one of the greatest horror films ever made. I've always loved the bit from Roger Ebert's review where he quotes Hitchcock as saying he loves to play an audience like playing a piano. That's pretty much what Carpenter does here as we haven't an idea why The Shape is stalking these girls or even what he is exactly. This entire mysterious form would be lost due to various elements of sequels but, again, it's best to put those elements out of your mind if you can. Carpenter's mastery behind the camera can be seen early on with the brilliant opening sequence that takes us from outside the house, to the murder upstairs and then back outside. This is a now classic sequence and it still holds up well today. The middle sequence of the film is perfectly written for us to get to know the characters but I love how Carpenter also uses it to build up the atmosphere of it being Halloween. The various pumpkins, the horror movies on television and even something as simple as the leaves falling perfectly puts us in the mood for everything that's going to follow. Then there's the final fifteen-minutes, which are just downright brilliantly executed and I'd say some of the best moments the genre has to offer. There's enough suspense in this sequence for two films but the same Carpenter builds everything up when The Shape is walking across the street with Jamie Lee Curtis' character pounding on the door is remarkably done. The performances by the entire cast are top-notch as everyone from Curtis to Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles fit their roles wonderfully well. Then there's Donald Pleasence turning in a now legendary performance in the role that he will always be remembered for (which is saying a lot when you look at how many wonderful films he was in). I love the way you can read his eyes to feel everything that he's feeling and the way he delivers the lines are top-notch. Then we have the terrific music score by Carpenter, which is scary enough on its own without anything we then see in the movie. Thirty-years later many, many films have come along with the same formula but nothing has ever come close to capturing the power of this film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Nice slasher movie,"Halloween (1978) was good. I that much out of it as I had hoped,the reputation of the film being really out there and had a good story. I thought it was a fun Halloween slasher movie and I do think that you should watch this movie before something like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street and definitely watch it before Scream. With all the backstory behind it like how the budget was $300,000 and the actor bought their own clothes, I was expecting something above-average, and I guess that's what I got it was a tad bit disappointing though so let's get into that.First the good things. The character Dynamics I really enjoyed. I like how Jamie Lee Curtis's friends do drugs and she doesn't smoke like how they do. I like Donald Pleasence as the doctor who took care of Michael Myers for 15 years. I like the concept of Michael Myers, he's kind of like Darth Vader except not as super-powered. I like the cinematography and the music used in this film. I also enjoyed how the filmmakers knew when to use the music and what not to like in the Dark Knight. The opening credits are cool with the pumpkins slowly revealing itself using them. I think the cheapness of the phone actually kind of helps it in terms of anesthetic makes it look more gritty the scary than it would with a big-budget 100 million dollar movie. Interior of a movie you watched during Halloween really fun and it's really good you can watch it with friends or if your mom and dad is really cool they watch that kind of stuff with you.Now for some of the problems I had with it. That last line was a good segue into this one. As a Halloween movie I enjoyed it, but as an actual film it didn't really have an effect on me or surprise me and anyway. Some of the acting from the kids and Jamie Lee Curtis' friends is really bad. Michael Myers wasn't as scary as I had hoped. And I guess people just built this movie up too much and the point where it got disappointing when I watched it.The reason I gave it a 7/10 was because of prison been some of the tropes of horror movies maybe you should all of them and it was really entertaining. Good definitely outweighs the bad. No Masterpiece Though.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A groundbreaking horror film.,"Released in 1978, John Carpenter's Halloween was shot in 21 days and on a low budget but somehow, the filmmakers were able to pull off an effective movie. What makes this movie work so well is that it's very simple but proves that simplicity can work if it's done the right way. This was a very ambitious film despite the budget it was made on. It's visual style is filled with class and very detailed. The direction and cinematography is some of the most haunting I've ever seen in movies. It never feels like a low budget movie in my mind, director John Carpenter truly cared about the camera and how it was going to tell the story and he also used the anamorphic wide screen, that and Dean Cundey's lighting give the film a very timeless feel. Most low budget movies that were released in the late 60s and 70s are grainy and have a more documentary like feel but Halloween is truly more cinematic.It is now considered a classic and also the film that launched the slasher films of the 80s. It's become so iconic that it's hard to imagine it being scary anymore. It was the highest grossing independent film in its day. I look back at this movie now and even myself wonder why is it so good. What was it about this movie that made it become the classic that it is now? I can understand why some may not like this movie, I recommend looking at it from a visual standpoint and maybe you will like it but if not then you may be disappointed.The film launched 7 sequels (all of which I consider to be good films) and a remake from Rob Zombie in 2007 and a sequel in 2009. Maybe I am taking it too far by saying this is my favorite movie but it truly is. It never looses it's power and it reminds me of why I love movies to begin with. It's a great film because it works for what it is, a horror movie. Halloween 2, released in 1981 is equally as good I think. The rest of the series was very well done also. Avoid the remakes though.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Still a good film, but doesn't completely stand the test of time","When I saw this movie for the first time, it scared the crap out of me. Now that I've seen it about 10 times, the film has kinda lost its edge.  Other than the death scenes, the film pretty much bores me.  But for those who haven't seen it before, it'll be a much more fun ride.  John Carpenter did a fine job at directing, especially on a low budget and scaring audiences with the absence of gratuitous gore.  The score, composed by Carpenter, still gives me chills.  Along with ""The Exorcist"" theme, there has never been a scarier theme song to a horror movie.  It's still creepy when you sit in a dark room and watch the opening credits with the theme playing over the image of a flaming Jack-O-Lantern.  However, as I watch the film more and more, I notice more and more flaws.  For example, the plot is pretty thin and the characters are uninteresting, except for Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis.  The dialogue is bland, and (with the exception of Pleasance, Jamie Lee Curtis and Charles Cyphers) the acting is bad.  But as a horror movie, it works out well.  The cinematography is great, and there are some signature shots that lend inspiration to many aspiring horror directors. The opening tracking shot with Michael Myers (as a boy) murdering his sister is a classic.  It's always great to see scenes like that which don't try to throw off the audience with frequent, unnecessary cutting.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There is something utterly terrifying about the masked Michael Myers,"Halloween is a classic. It may have spawned a slew of gory slasher movies, but this movie is actually quite tame in comparison -- it focuses more on suspense than blood. So even though it's slow, dated and predictable, this low-budget movie hit a nerve and started a trend, and you gotta respect that. Plus, there is still something utterly terrifying about the masked Michael Myers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
a great horror/thriller,"halloween is a film that is intelligent in its suspense, its scary. The plot is simplistic yet great the music suits the film so well it sets every scene you can hear it in. michaels mask is great the way it is so drawn and neutral looking you know its hiding some dreaded horror underneath.the plot is on halloween night a six year old michael is across the road from his house, he walks around the side of his home to a window where he watches his sister and her boyfriend go upstairs where he then goes in and gets a butcher knife from the kitchen drawer and goes upstairs and murders her. the mother and father comes to their horror to find what their son done. he then gets sent to a mental institute.fiftheen years later he then escapes to haddonfield to reapeat what he done fiftheen years earlier to three teenagers.what halloween does it does so well and what it does really is keep you the audience guessing for example, is he gonna go into the shed already and kill her, what was that noise upstairs, why is it so dark in here, why is he turning the lights on and off. one of my favouite scenesis the one where jamie lee is walking across the street to the house. i think that is why they call john carpenter the master of suspense",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Created a Blueprint for a genre,"Rating a movie this long after its release is certainly challenging as you miss the context of the time in which it was released. However, I will do my best.Overall Halloween seems to have set out the blueprint for what plenty of slasher types have tried to follow. Many of these films were not able to replicate the successes of Halloween. One thing I think that was critical to the success of this film and even franchise was the ability to produce a very catchy Michael Myers theme. The use of that little beat adds so much to each scene. If you try watching without the sounds it's really not all that scary at all. The acting is fine but not exceptional and at least comparable to the level of other films in it's time. The plot is pretty common nowadays, but if this was one of the earlier stalker / slasher films I can see how it would have appeal in 1978.This film itself standing on its own I think is a tad overrated but it's contribution to establishing and advancing the slasher genre is noted.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A relic,"""Halloween"" may be interesting as a historical piece, and it may even be entertaining if you scare extremely, extremely easily.Otherwise, this film has nothing special to offer. The story never even tries to be thought-provoking or inspiring. The plot is paper-thin, as a murderer comes to town and kills 3 random teens for no reason. The film is very overt that there is absolutely no reason; the killer is nothing but a vehicle for overwrought ""suspense.""There truly is a lack of suspense here. Most of the movie features the average main characters going about their boring lives and occasionally noticing Michael Myers appearing on a street corner, then disappearing. This could be an evocative and tantalizing effect, but each of Michael's ""surprise"" appearances are extremely predictable and usually accompanied by a melodramatic, campy musical cue.The murder scenes are quaint, with no thrill or shock; at best they give a glimpse into '70s filmmaking style.The worst aspect, though, was in most of the character interactions. Audiences want an exciting thriller from Halloween, but a ridiculous amount of the movie consists of bland, mildly annoying teenagers chatting mindlessly. I suppose this material is an attempt at realism, but when it contributes nothing to plot, meaning or character arcs, it's just an insulting waste of the audience's time.As for good points, the film is competently executed (with no glaring faults but also no outstanding cinematography), and the character of Dr. Loomis had the potential to be interesting or entertaining. Unfortunately these aspects are nowhere near enough to complete the movie.If you want to check out a real museum piece, take a look at Halloween. If you want a film that will excite and thrill you, or a film that will make you think, you'll be wise to look elsewhere.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Slasher Film to Start it All,"I have to say that I have fond memories of this film. I watched this when I was a kid with my mother. It scared me then and I have to say that this film is very well done. I did get the pleasure of seeing this in 4K at my local theater for the 40 anniversary as that was in preparation for the 2018 remake. I actually have the pleasure of seeing it now third time in the theater by taking Jaime who had never seen this. To get into this first, the official synopsis is fifteen years after murdering his sister on Halloween night 1963, Michael Myers escapes from a mental hospital and returns to the small town of Haddonfield to kill again.The story isn't complex, but it doesn't need to be. Writer/director John Carpenter started the slasher genre to what it is today, so its historical significance is huge. The idea of a killer who doesn't talk and just stalks his victims is amazing. He is somewhat creative in that he switches up his kills. Even more than that though, this film is a slow burn. The first half of the film is Michael seeing Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) drop off a key under the doormat of his former home and he is fixated on her. Also with her was Tommy (Brian Andrews), a little boy she babysits, so it makes sense he stalks him as well.There are a lot of things that people bring up as issues for the film. An example is if Michael was locked up for fifteen years, how he learned to drive. From what we see in this film, he is a crafty person. I'm forgiving of this plot-hole. He is driven to do what he plans on doing. I do think that he could figure it out, especially if the car is an automatic which it looks to be. Maybe not drive as well as he does in the film, but still able to. There is also the issue with an interaction between Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) with his daughter Annie (Nancy Kyes) and Laurie. It is relayed that a Halloween mask was stolen, but we already saw him wearing it. I wish this line wasn't there, but again it doesn't ruin it. The one that bothers me the most is weapon dropping from Laurie. It is annoying, but fear makes people do dumb things.It wasn't until this last couple viewing that I appreciated the film as much as I did that first time. There are many subtle things in the film that I didn't pick up on until this film. When Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) arrives in Haddonfield and meets with Sheriff Brackett, you can see Michael in the car drive past without Loomis noticing. There are also times that the white mask appears in the dark background and the characters can't see it. These made my anxiety go up and I loved it.With that being said, this film is great at building suspense. It actually is paced well despite nothing happening for a good chunk of it. It feels that this film benefits from building suspense through the stalking scenes that we get. When Michael starts to murder, it is non-stop and I think that balancing it very well. I think the ending is also fitting for the character they build. I almost wish they would have went with the original idea and left this a one off.The acting in this film is great for what they were going for. Curtis is one of the greatest final girls of all time. It also gives her that status for scream queens in the genre and this is where it started. Going from that, she is such a timid young woman and has low-self esteem. Her character transformation fits. Pleasence is wonderful as the doctor. He is almost as intense as Michael himself in trying to hunt him down. Their obsession is opposite of what they are trying to do, but very similar. P. J. Soles is an underrated horror film actress and I liked her in this film. We also see her topless, which I won't complain about. I loved Kyes attitude and I was a big fan. These three young women just play well off each other so it feels like they're actually friends. The two kids did a great job in showing their fear as well. It helps build the tension. Shout out to the actors that portray Michael, Will Sandin as a boy, Tony Moran as the adult and Nick Castle as The Shape. They all do well in my opinion. If I have an issue though, I think the direction for the acting is an issue. Michael is an unstoppable killer, yet Laurie does some minor things that cause him to fall. It is a bit problematic for me.Taking this back to a positive, which would be the effects in this film. They were done practically and look amazing. I was impressed there as well. There were subtle things here that I didn't realize until this viewing either. There really isn't a lot of blood, but when we do see it, it looks good. The death of Bob (John Michael Graham) probably couldn't happen, but I still love it. I also like when Michael is stabbed in the eye with a hanger, we see the effects when his mask is ripped off later. This was a strong point of the film for me. I should also give credit to the cinematography as well.I couldn't go through this without talking about the score, which was done by Carpenter as well. It is the other part of this film that I love. The main theme is iconic and helps to make the scenes even more eerie feeling. They build as much tension as seeing Michael walking slowly toward our innocent characters. There are also musical cues throughout the film that work very well.Now with that said, this film is one of the greatest horror films ever made. The story isn't complex, but it unintentionally defined the slasher genre. The rules of them were invented and films would follow suite to what this one did. It is a slow burn film with a great payoff. The acting in this film is solid. The score is perfect for what it tries to do. The effects are solid and the editing of the film builds the required tension that is needed. I would highly recommend seeing this film if you are a fan of horror or not, it truly is a masterpiece and worth a viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

An honorable achievement in atmospheric horror in spite of its flaws,"Looking back at Halloween after a series of intermittently passable and utterly distasteful sequels, one may lose an objective sense of the methods by which it was created, and really how good it is.Being introduced to a boy so consumed by an indescribably untainted and dangerous evil that he is able to remorselessly kill at an age meant to comprise innocence raises many questions. Firstly, how did this evil ever begin to flourish? Where did it come from and how? What gives it the strength to disallow the contaminated being to speak, but instead gives it the power to destroy his family? In future years and subsequent theatricalizations of ""The Shape"", the audience and the filmmakers alike sought to answer these questions. But now, twenty-nine years after the iconic killer was conceived, people still realize that some evils are not meant to be explored. They are supposed to remain mysterious.That is what allows for the films greatness. From the commencement of the simple yet piercing and shrill noises that compose the music of this film, the mystery becomes enshrouded in shock and becomes completely enigmatic as a young woman is ruthlessly murdered by her six year old brother. The only dialogue encompassing the event is a few insignificant sentences irrelevant to the utter horror about to commence.Over the years, the doctor doing his duty becomes compassionate and obsessed to save the people from what he believes only his own mind can conceive. There is an evil that has escaped and it aims to destroy the lives of young teenagers and over an hour and a half period he stalks them, becoming more and more evident until the unknown deaths become known and The Shape has reached his target. But as we become aware that this evil is immortal, even the good doctor, Loomis, is shocked and quizically looks out into the night. His omniscience is then consumed by the thought that the evil will never stop.Halloween was based upon a simple atmospheric premise. There was no need for a high body count or excessive gore. While an adept horror director can use such elements to his advantage, Carpenter did the converse in not so much a brilliant way, but in an adequate way.It would not be so bold for me to say that this movie is overrated, because it most certainly is. It takes a basic observation of what scares people to craft a thriller out of simplicity. The sharp and abrupt music in a dark setting that was simply made scary due to a lack of film quality. The atmosphere of this movie can much be attributed to a lack of quality that inadvertently made positive contributions.The heroine does not need to be excessively developed and we get all the imagery we need to realize that she is a simple embodiment of innocence that will face torment and disaster in the face of relentless terror. While her friends may not be as likable and visibly innocent, they effectively add to the idea that benevolence and youth are of no significance to cold and thoughtless destruction.This film can't take all the glory from the genre and it isn't unmatchable. Some sequels posed worthy executions and characters to follow in the footsteps. As the franchise progresses, we realize that the simplicity of the antagonist, conceived out of simple atmosphere and hated through empathy for his innocent victims, has allowed for so many additional entries that while being able to succeed on their own, have not mastered the same art that Carpenter created in 1978.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Night HE Came Home!,"I'll start by saying this, I am very gald that HE came home because as a result, movies of this genre were never thesame. First off the bat let me dismiss the rest of the series that followed this, especially HALLOWEEN 3 SEASON OF THE WITCH & HALLOWEEN:H20. These examples were in a word, pathetic, but I am not here to speak about those films, I'm here to sing the praises of the original classic! This film combined with Friday the 13th confirmed the era, it upped the ante and made horror directors have to work on their contributions. In my opinion the beginning of the film begins in typical stalker fashion, but when the murderer is revealed to be a knife wielding child in a clown suit, the audience becomes uncomfortable, it's a urban myth on film. Attend to your children or they will become deviant murderers.The sheer idea that evil can be born into a child and linger and fester to become an evil force is unnerving and is probably more frightening to the audience than the actual murders that are committed on screen. Carpenter captures the mood in every scene, when the Jamie Lee Curtis character feels afraid and enclosed on an open street in broad daylight, the audience feels that with her and the classic ending of the villain-ain't-quite-dead-yet, which has been used in multiple films over the years, still unnerves me when I watch it. When I fist saw this movie, I knew in my heart that at the end of the movie, the villain would die, so when Jamie looked out of the window and saw an empty space where Michael Myers should have been lying, I shouted ""NO!"" with her,because that meant that he was still out there.Halloween is a classic for both Horror and John Carpenter, an achievemnet he has rarely attained to since.",,Anonymous,Horror
Dr. Loomis ruins it for me.,"I like this movie enough, but Dr. Loomis is... not among my favourite movie characters. I could already do without a character who's only purpose is to repeat the exact same exposition every 10 to 15 minutes (seriously, why?), but what's even worse is that these scenes actually bring down the rest of the movie for me. All of the best scenes are the ones that treat Michael Myers as a mysterious stalker who's motives and intent are unclear, but thanks to Dr. Loomis, I already know exactly who he is and exactly what he's up to. In my opinion, all of the context we needed was in the opening scene, and once it was over they should have left it at that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is one of the best horror movies made,"""Halloween"" is not only a slasher movie classic, but a horror movie classic as well. Much like his other movies such as 1980's ""The Fog,"" John Carpenter does not rely much on gore, but more on suspense and creepiness. The movie is almost 30 years old, and it still holds up today. If you are looking for a horror movie classic, forget about renting it because it is good enough to buy.On Halloween of 1963, 6-year-old Michael Myers murders his sister, Judith Myers. After the murder, he is locked into a mental institute where Doctor Sam Loomis supervises him. 15 years later, Michael has escaped from the mental institution. He returns to his hometown to stalk a teenager by the name of Laurie Strode and her two friends. Luckily, the only person able to stop Michael is Doctor Sam Loomis.Since ""Halloween"" is a horror movie, it needs to do its job in being scary and it did just that. ""Halloween"" is most famous for that chilling soundtrack composed by John Carpenter. It is hard to make a good scary movie without an excellent soundtrack because it is the music that helps build the suspense. As mentioned above, the movie relies mostly on the suggestive violence then the actual violence. That can be scarier then just showing someone's limbs cut off and blood splattered everywhere.The real accomplishment of this movie is not of its suggestive violence but from the influence this film has made. Without the first ""Halloween,"" there would be no Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees because there would be no ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Friday the 13th."" This movie started the slasher film craze of the 1980's and 1990's. The ""survival of the virgins"" theme is also commonly used in those slasher movies and without this movie, that theme would be nonexistent.The acting is wonderful. Jamie Lee Curtis, in her movie debut, shows why she is the ""scream queen"" by playing Laurie Strode. The best character is Doctor Sam Loomis played by Donald Pleasence. Tony Moran was scary playing the non-speaking Michael Myers himself. Nancy Kyes as Annie Brackett, and P.J. Soles as Lynda van der Klok, get minor roles as Laurie's friends. Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and Brian Andrews as Tommy Doyle did a good job as the kids that Laurie is baby sitting. There is also Charles Cyphers, who was also in ""The Fog,"" who played Sheriff Leigh Brackett.There is nothing wrong with this film, but if there had to be one, it would the fact that if ""Halloween"" had come out today, it would seem very cliché. If you are a first time viewer, view this as if it was 1978 instead of 2006. There is one minor script error, but most probably would not catch it. In conclusion, if you are looking for the perfect scary movie, skip the rental just purchase it. ""Halloween"" is extremely recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Halloween remains sharper and creepier than an expired jack-o-lantern.,"A film that hosts the most formidably foreboding group of followers since the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Many have claimed this to be the perfect slasher. Whilst I disagree with the subjective consensus, it is irrefutably influential and a milestone in the horror genre. Michael Myers slaughters his sister and is sent to a mental institution. Years later he escapes and terrorises babysitters on Halloween night. Carpenter is a renowned horror director, particularly for his inventive utilisation of prosthetics. The low budget of this slasher forced him to be creative. Surprisingly the blood and gore is minimal. The tension and suspense is upheld by what the viewers do not see, and it's incredibly effective. The vast majority of the film relies on Myers stalking his sexually promiscuous victims by appearing and disappearing in the camera's backdrop, or by the exhaustingly heavy breathing beneath his mask. These aspects complement Carpenter's astute directing in creating horror. The introductory POV long take is a perfect example to illustrate this. Curtis somewhat broke the typical ""damsel in distress"" cliché and stood confidently against a physically intimidating Castle. The noteworthy score also elevated the suspense even further, and remains memorable to this day. The film however is equipped with a double-edged knife. The simplistic approach enhances the realism of the situation, without conforming to exaggeration. Yet, it's because of this that the pace is stagnant for a large portion of the film, lacking character development for both the protagonist and antagonist. The constant stalking rapidly becomes tedious, finishing off victims with badly acted deaths. The final ten minutes then exhumed surrealism which detracted from the film's realism. Shot six times, stabbed three times and fallen off a balcony. His supposed invincibility makes him less remarkable, which is a shame. Is this Carpenter's best? No. Is this the best slasher? No. However it's certainly an appropriate film for Halloween.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I could watch Halloween (1978) every day, it's aged so well. I'm at a loss for words, it's just a pity they don't make them like this anymore.It's a perfect 10/10 all the way!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
No Treat,"An unstable boy who killed his sister on Halloween grows up into an unstable superhuman who escapes from an asylum so he can resume his hobby of killing people on Halloween. How he turned into a superhuman (he simply shakes off stabs and gunshots) while in captivity is never explained. This cliché-ridden thriller is praised (blamed) for spawning the slasher films of the 1980s - a dubious distinction. Of course the teens all behave stupidly, making themselves vulnerable to the killer. Carpenter gets the blame for not only the direction but also for the terrible script and the score that he swiped from ""The Exorcist."" Curtis is pretty good in her film debut.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best,The movie is clearly the best horror in all time. The movie brings together all the elements of good horror and does not take away anything to be questioned.It provides you with a detailed story line and brings you closer as you continue to watch the movie. The designs portrayed in the movie give it that classic feel. The quiet yet surreal facts are evident this movie will scare even the most unafraid person who views it.It offers you a realization that this could actually happen. The movie is giant in that it brings you another side of a story that not too many people dive into. It will keep you asking what if. It truly is the best out there.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the scariest movies ever made - a real classic!,"One of my all-time favorite fright flicks!! I was 13 when HALLOWEEN was released in 1978 and the local film critics here in my area, the late Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert, praised it highly. The movie poster itself was scary! Of course, being the 13-yr old that I was, I pestered my older sister just enough for her to give in and take me to see it. To this day, I'm glad she did - my love for horror films had started!The story is simplistic in itself - on Halloween 1963, 6-yr old Michael Myers murders his older sister with a large butcher knife. For 15 years, Michael is kept institutionalized until one night - October 30, 1978 to be exact - he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois to relive his crime again and again. Hot on his trail is Dr. Loomis, who tries to 'stop the evil'.Until THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, HALLOWEEN was praised as one of the most successful independent films produced. One does not notice that the film was shot on a shoestring budget, nor does one care. While there is much talent in front of the camera (Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis), it is the behind-the-camera talent that really stands out. Dean Cundey's photography is incredible and really sets the scary mood Carpenter creates. Using blue light to simulate moonlight in the night scenes was just a stroke of genius! Ray Stella's use of the Panaglide is great - the stalk/chase scenes when seen in their original widescreen format are tense!! Yes, many ripoffs and sequels came and went in HALLOWEEN's wake, but the original is the best!! I wholeheartedly suggest that viewers watch this film in its widescreen format and not in alternate pan-and-scan versions!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

One Of My Favorite Horror Films Out There,"Halloween is definitely one of my favorite horror movies. It has just what every good horror movie needs -- a haunting murderer, suspenseful moments and interesting murder scenes. The film is about Michael Myers, a killer who murdered his sister on Halloween night when he was only 6. He was put into an institution where he has been studied by Dr. Sam Loomis. But now Michael Myers has escaped unexpectedly and returns to his home town, where everyone remembers what happened Halloween night all those years ago. When he returns, he is stalking Laurie Strode, no matter where she goes and this terrifies her, seeing she has no idea why. Suddenly Laurie's baby-sitter friends Annie and Lynda are murdered and Laurie fears she'll be next. Halloween is filled with jump scenes and suspense. The famous opening scene of this film made my heart pump as it went on and my eyes were glued to the screen, just wondering what would happen next. This film was also one of Jamie Lee Curtis's firsts and she does a great job as her character. Halloween certainly is a frightening horror film, a must-see for any horror fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Possibly my Favourite Slasher,"Coming out in 1978 this film still feels suspenseful today. The cinematography, score and acting has all aged phenomenonally and while I wasn't per say scared I think it is probably my favourite of the slasher genre. Micheal Myers is a great antagonist who works as a shadowy figure in the background but loses his sense of scariness slightly when he is wondering around a house. Still, this is a great slasher and one I see myself watching for years to come. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Halloween (1978) Review - A Timeless Horror Classic That Defines the Genre,"""Halloween"" (1978) is an iconic horror masterpiece that has stood the test of time and remains the quintessential slasher film. Directed by John Carpenter, this genre-defining classic introduced the world to the relentless and malevolent force of evil, Michael Myers, and cemented its place as a pillar of horror cinema.The story revolves around the silent and seemingly unstoppable Michael Myers, who escapes from a mental institution on Halloween night and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. His sole purpose is to terrorize and murder babysitters, particularly targeting Laurie Strode, portrayed brilliantly by Jamie Lee Curtis, in a night of terror that will be forever etched in the minds of horror fans.John Carpenter's direction in ""Halloween"" is masterful, meticulously crafting an atmosphere of dread and tension that intensifies with each passing moment. The movie's slow-burn approach allows the suspense to build steadily, creating an unsettling sense of unease that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The use of atmospheric lighting, Carpenter's haunting musical score, and the chilling POV shots from Michael Myers' perspective all contribute to the film's haunting impact.The character of Michael Myers, portrayed by Nick Castle, is an enigmatic and terrifying presence. His relentless pursuit of his victims, coupled with his emotionless expression, makes him an enduring embodiment of pure evil. The choice to keep his motivations shrouded in mystery adds an extra layer of horror, leaving audiences with a sense of unease long after the credits roll.Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a standout performance as Laurie Strode, the resourceful and resilient final girl who finds herself in a fight for survival against the embodiment of evil. Laurie's character subverts typical horror movie stereotypes, providing a strong and empowering portrayal of a female protagonist that was groundbreaking for its time.The film's practical effects and minimalist approach to violence add to its chilling authenticity. ""Halloween"" relies on tension and psychological terror rather than excessive gore, showcasing Carpenter's skill in creating a horror experience that lingers in the mind of viewers long after they've left the theater.Beyond its status as a slasher film, ""Halloween"" explores themes of fate, the nature of evil, and the darkness that can lurk in ordinary places. These deeper undertones elevate the movie beyond a mere horror flick to a thought-provoking and enduring work of cinema.In conclusion, ""Halloween"" (1978) is a timeless horror classic that continues to captivate and terrify audiences over four decades later. John Carpenter's visionary direction, Jamie Lee Curtis' stellar performance, and the enigmatic presence of Michael Myers have solidified this film's place in the pantheon of horror greats. If you're seeking a spine-chilling and masterfully crafted horror experience, ""Halloween"" is an absolute must-watch for any cinephile or horror enthusiast.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slashes and Scares With a Rare Sense of Subtlety,"A small group of teenage girls are stalked and bludgeoned by a masked psychopath with a lifelong vendetta against promiscuous babysitters. Planted right in the middle of slasher tentpoles The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Friday the 13th (1980), Halloween is distinguished by its dense, creepy aura and selective restraint. Its bursts of violence are brief and final, more potent for their scarcity.Much of the film is dedicated to a pair of chases: the notorious killer's clandestine search for suitable victims and the worried psychologist's hunt for his escaped mental patient. Stalking through suburban bushes and staking out abandoned houses may not sound like particularly intense material, especially compared to the more viscerally-rewarding exploits of Leatherface and Jason Vorhees, but in John Carpenter's hands, both manage to reach peak intensity. Through patient storytelling and effective cinematography, not to mention a shrill, unforgettable score (also composed and performed by the director), Carpenter weaves a masterpiece of suspense that pays dividends when chaos finally explodes in the climactic final act.Jamie Lee Curtis, soon to be well-known for her lungs, really shines as the key figure: a studious, responsible bookworm who discovers her friends in various states of dismemberment and quickly descends into fight-or-flight desperation. That sudden, essential transition tightly mirrors the film's relaxation from a simmering, eerie piece of '70s filmmaking to a wild exhibit of pure, reckless chaos. My only real complaints revolve around the killer's blatant, unexplained invincibility and the psychologist's near-total detachment from the main storyline.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Prototype,"No, it's not the first slasher movie, far from it. But it granted legitimacy to the genre. The setup and the quality of the acting and the timing of events is startling. We are brought into the insanity that is Michael Myers. The initial event that brought him to the asylum is graphic and horrifying. This movie begins later and Myers is on the loose. Jamie Lee Curtis is the teenager that becomes central to the plot. She is a good choice because she is no pushover. As Myers attacks and attacks and attacks, she uses he resilience to withstand his assault. It's a little remindful of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (the second movie) when there is so much to lose, you are going to go down fighting. Of course, this film launched a bevy of sequels and copycat teenage slasher films, but this one is so nicely crafted that it rises above the rest.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best slasher franchises,"This is where the slow-footed killer began ""chasing"" after Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).

Halloween 35 Anniv Blu-ray A Superb Facelift of a Horror Classic,"Overall, the slasher film genre is pretty pathetic, most films so insipid as being worthy of the proverbial trash can. Save one. The original ""Halloween"", which brought intelligence to the slasher film, is still the best of its sub-genre, or one of two, the other being the original ""Psycho"". Sadly, its sequels, and other films it spawned, such as the Friday the 13th series and other films associated with holidays like ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" don't just scrape the bottom of the barrel, but aren't worthy to be in the same company as barrels. Other films, aside, ""Halloween"" is both scary but also has a somewhat literary context, as far as a slasher-horror film can muster. It was recently released in a 35th Anniversary edition on Blu-ray, and it looks and sounds better than ever.First what the Blu-ray offers: the look is cleaner and more vivid while simultaneously retaining the subdued colors and hues of the original. During Halloween day, the sky is overcast which is a spooky prelude to the horrific events which will occur in the evening. Apparently, there had been released a previous Blu-ray version where the colors were brightened, ruining the spooky and even misty feel of the original film. After many complaints from fans, this 35th Anniversary edition essentially solves the problems of the former release. It retains the less saturated filters of the original while simultaneously appearing much cleaner and more vibrant than previous DVD and VHS releases.What makes ""Halloween"" such an effective film of a genre replete with so many irredeemable examples unworthy of your time and expense is that there's more to the story than simply a mad guy in Halloween mask running around killing people. Yes, that is more or less the main plot. However, there is a subtext. An effective plot device which becomes the springboard of the story is that the baddie, Michael Myers, murdered his sister in a suburban home in Haddonfield, Illinois in the early 1960's which is the first sequence of the film. The story then jumps ahead to 1978. The night before Halloween, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and a nurse are traveling on a rainy night to an insane asylum. The inmates are wandering around the grounds in the rain. They realize something has let them out, and suddenly their car is hijacked, the nurse nearly becoming the first victim of the baddie in 1978. It's most certainly Michael Myers, the ""Evil"".Loomis suspects Myers plans to return to the town of his boyhood. Part of the story is Loomis following Myers' footsteps. Loomis travels to the suburban town Haddonfield, a good 150 miles away from the asylum. For a boy who has been locked up for 15 years, he seems to drive a car fairly well, which gives a somewhat supernatural aspect to the Myers character. Then we meet Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) who has to leave some keys at the abandoned Myers residence, which has become the local haunted house. A figure stares from inside the house when Laurie makes her deposit of the keys. For the next several hours, Laurie sees the strange figure of Myers off and on which is one of the most effective aspects of the film. In other words, there is great build-up before the horrific events actually transpire. Laurie and her teenage friends, Annie and Lynda, become the focus of Myers' wrath. Laurie and Annie babysit two children who are watching ""The Thing"" on television. The three young women, the two children, and one young man become unwilling characters of an horrific reenactment of the events of Halloween night 15 years earlier. Other subtle hints that there is more to the story than simply the slasher aspects, such as the reference to the mythological monster, the ""boogeyman"" and Laurie's vow to keep the children safe. Not to give anything away, one of the most disturbing and yet brilliant scenes is not when Myers is doing what he has come to do, but one of the characters discovering the nature of the reenactment.No question, even the original ""Halloween"" is a terrifying example of fright-cinema. This film is not for all tastes, and if you would rather not be scared into submission, do NOT under any circumstance see this film. Simultaneously, if you desire to be scared and not necessarily ""grossed out"", ""Halloween"" is quite possibly the best slasher film of the genre next to ""Psycho"". And it's a real treat on Blu-ray. As a codetta, ""Halloween"" redefines the concept of ""Trick or Treat"". Are the other films and similar offerings in the genre worthy of being seen? In my humble opinion, only ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" is worthy of viewing. The rest have no redeeming qualities at all, particularly ""Friday the 13th"" and its sequels, as well as the other Halloween films. I don't know how any other film can say more than the original ""Halloween"" without it becoming merely a cinematic blood-fest.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best Horror Movies of All Time!!!!,"For 40 years now, people have been obsessed with the sub genre of horror known as the ""slasher"" genre. Hundreds and hundreds of slasher movies have been made but why? Well, that's because of this movie. This one independent film that had a tiny budget of $300,000 was able to make a massive $70,000,000 at the box office and inspired hundreds of movies. Halloween is probably the most popular and influential horror movie of all time so I am here to give you my thoughts on it although you can probably tell what my thoughts are by my rating and the heading. Oh, well, I'm gonna give my thoughts on it anyway.Starting with the positives, the biggest positive I can give this film is Donald Pleasence as Doctor Loomis. His performance is breath taking. He has so many brilliant lines and delivers them excellently like the famous line about ""The devil's eyes"". I think he is probably the best character within this franchise. You can tell he had so much passion for this because character. Donald Pleasence is a true legend and is one of the best characters in all of horror history.The second biggest positive I can give this movie is the score, brilliantly composed by John Carpenter. This score is by far the most popular in all of horror history and it deserves that label. It perfectly blends suspense and tension, and is just a really kick-ass score that will never be forgotten.My third positive is the brilliant cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is great. It has so many brilliant and iconic shots like Michael appearing behind Laurie and the wardrobe scene. I love all of this shots pretty much equally but if I had to pick a favourite one, I would say the shot where Michael appears behind Laurie. It's such a brilliant shot that uses atmosphere and a sort-of jump scare to scare us.My fourth positive is Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. Other than Michael Myers, she is probably the most iconic part of this franchise and for a good reason. She gives a brilliant performance and has one of the best scenes in all of horror with ""The chase"" scene. This scene alone makes her one of the best final girls in all of horror but including her inclusion in the rest of this movie and the 3 other movies she is in, makes her the second best.This is where I would talk about the negatives I have with this movie but there really isn't any. There is a bit of bad acting here and there but other than that, it's a flawless movie that is my 4th favourite horror movies of all time. It obviously gets a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"While not the ""first"" slasher, it set the bar!","Few people can do what John Carpenter did when it comes to making the almost-perfect horror movie. To get the story structure like that was a feat. To sell California off as Ohio (minus one mountainous shot and one palm tree) was a real feat. To line up the characters, the kills, the score, and everything else so perfectly is hard to do by any metric, and was quite hard to do then for sure.There are also a lot of subtle elements within this movie that one might not notice with a single viewing. Few people can do what Carpenter and company did with this film, and it holds up almost fifty years later for a reason. A must see for the season of Samhain!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Overestimated Mediocre B Movie.,"I really can't understand why this silly movie is considered a classic. The script is typical of B grindhouse flicks, with many plot holes and absurdities. Why Michael Myers has super powers, appearing and disappearing like a ghost when is convenient? And why he is obsessed with Laurie? How is it possible that Michael Myers runs from the mental institution driving a car??? Where he learned to drive? And to make things even more absurd, he keeps driving the same car he stole from the mental institution without being noted!!!!!!I could forgive all this if this film was considered what it is, just another B slasher. However, for some unknown reason, ""Halloween"" is worshipped not only by fans of horror movies, but also by cinephiles in general! And it definitely doesn't deserve such a good status. Besides being full of nonsense situations, the film is very boring! And no one in the cast has charisma. The soundtrack isn't bad, but plays over and over to the point that becomes annoying!If ""Halloween"" is so good, so what is the problem with its sequels and imitations? Let's gonna be fair!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Perfect Horror Film,"John Carpenter and Debra Hill understand that simplicity and mystery are the fastest ways to get an audience to bite their nails in terror and they exploit this beautifully in Halloween. It's a simple story of a young boy who murders his sister on Halloween night and returns to the small town to stalk babysitters after breaking out of the asylum where he'd been for the past 15 years. Gorgeous and atmospheric camerawork, solid performances, and well-timed shocks that build in intensity throughout the film are some of the many reasons Halloween still impresses and terrifies to this day.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Easily the best of all slashers,"Ask people what scares them the most. What is the greatest imaginable fear possible? If I was asked this very question, I'd say Halloween. It is quite simply, one of the cleverest, edge of your seat slashers. There rest are pointless and are really only made so they are given he opportunity to flash a woman's breasts or exhibit lots of blood and violence. Halloween isn't about that, it is about clever thrills. What is probably so scary is that Halloween takes place in a setting we should, and usually do feel secure and safe in - suburbia.See Halloween, and avoid the recent remake. I am hoping that the Robie Zombie's disaster remake will only draw audiences closer to the original.",,Anonymous,Horror

Halloween is a very suspenseful movie that will give you the creeps and make you feel like someone is watching you at all times!

Halloween 1978 is a great movie and holds a special place in my heart and I do recommend this movie if you're thinking about watching it!,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why is this film so popular?,"Before reading this review, you have to understand that I am really not a fan of the horror genre on the whole.  Most horror films are boring, plot-less, and just all around uninteresting.  So, that is probably why it has taken me 24 years of life to finally get around to watching the first of the Halloween films.  ...And on top of my dislike for horror films, I also have a strong dislike for John Carpenter.  He's had a few good ones here and there, but some of his films could have been great, but he screwed them up (in my opinion).  Anyhow on with the review.I realize that this film as made in 1978, so it's somewhat hard to gauge the scary-ness of this film.  Personally, I didn't find the film to be very scary at all, creepy ok, but scary no.  I guess I can see how this would be scary back in the late 1970's or early 1980's, but not so much today.The plot was just terrible in my opinion.  I was expecting more of a back-story for Michael Myers, but all I got was that he was a psycho little kid and he grew into a psycho adult.  Not terribly interesting.  I don't really know what I was expecting, but whatever it was, I didn't get it.  I was also expecting some sort of explanation as to why he wears the white mask.  But...all I got was that it was Halloween, so it was fitting for the killer to be wearing a mask.  Also, while I'm thinking of it.  Why did they credit the character of Michael Myers as ""The Shape""?  STUPID!!!  I'm sorry, but that is a retarded name for the killer, just call him what he is, Michael Myers.I've read numerous reviews saying how much they loved John Carpenter's score.  I really feel like the minority here, but you have got to be kidding me?!?!  John Carpenter is a terrible composer!  I can't believe people actually like his so-called music.  There were actually a few times I wanted to mute the tv because the music was so awful.The acting is this film was nothing spectacular.  Donald Pleasence was ok, but nothing great.  Just another horror movie actor to me, they're all pretty much the same.  Jamie Lee Curtis was pretty good in her role, but again, nothing great.  I've never heard of any of the other cast members, both good and bad acting.  Typical horror movie acting, what can I say?I don't really think I'm in a position to recommend this film to anyone, but if you're a fan of horror movies that you probably ought to see this.  I only say that because obviously a lot of horror fans like this film, so perhaps you'll like it too.  There's also a huge number of allusions to this film in other films, so it's good to be able to spot them.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chilling and atmospheric horror film...one of the last 'good' slashers,"Halloween is a genuinely scary, influential, stylistic and tasteful, extremely well-crafted slasher/horror classic from young film director John Carpenter (who had previously directed two cult cinema classics, the sci-fi film Dark Star (1974) and the riveting crime genre film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) - a modern-day film often compared to Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo (1959)). Throughout the manipulative, morbid film, the suspenseful stalkings and killings are seen from the subjective vantage point of the killer's or 'peeping tom's' eyes, a few times while looking through a mask. (The mask was a costume store William Shatner-like faceplate, turned inside out and painted white, and inspired by the B-grade campy witchcraft film The Devil's Rain (1975) - featuring John Travolta's debut performance.) Other scenes are viewed through the subjective POV eyes of the characters in danger, or accompanied by the heavy breathing of killer Michael Myers, referred to as the 'bogeyman' or ""The Shape"" in the credits. Almost every scene is filmed with a constantly-moving camera (the Steadicam variety) to make the audience feel disordered, totally insecure, unsettled and paranoid, believing that every ominous corner, shadow, noise, or space is potentially life-threatening or dangerous and that everyone will be a helpless victim of random violence. Often, nothing is revealed when something is expected, but sometimes the unexpected is shockingly viewed.Most of Halloween is at all explicit, and surprisingly, contains little gore or graphic violence. It, instead, relies on pacing and suspense to keep our viewers on the edge. And it works. I'd like people to stop watching those pathetic slashers of today, made only for shock value, and see a genuinely scary horror film that has the skill to scare you witless.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Every Halloween,"Every Halloween actually the majority of October, I consider it to be my horror movie month. I watch as many as I can. It amazes me that I'm still drawn to these types of movies considering they're low budget, and filled with actors and directors who were pretty much unknown at the time.I'm still very entertained even with the cheesy special effects, bad acting in most cases, and poorly written scripts. One thing for sure is that the only music/tune more haunting is Tubular Bells from The Exorcist.Unlike the past where I always wanted the boogeyman to die, I now, (as if anything is going to change), pull for the bad guy. Why? Because the stupidity on display in every character deserves death. Well, it makes it a bit more entertaining in a humorous way. Horror movies are just a lot of dumb fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good for a scary Halloween treat...still has raw power to frighten...,"John Carpenter put together a pretty fascinating little scare film with this Halloween treat that was so successful it spawned a couple of less worthy sequels. Here the chills are genuinely frightening, as is the overall atmosphere aided and abetted by one of the creepiest background scores ever to occupy the soundtrack of a slasher film.The frightened heroine is JAMIE LEE CURTIS, babysitting on Halloween night and being told by her young charges that something strange is happening at the house across the street. We switch back and forth between Jamie and her charges and another girl whom we know is about to be visited by escaped lunatic Michael Myers.The suspense is maintained at high level the moment the first attack takes place--and from then on, the scares become more intense as Jamie realizes she and the kids are in real danger.Takes its place among the great horror classics, thanks to some superb photography, direction and music--as well as some convincing performances from a relatively unknown (at the time) cast, with the exception of DONALD PLEASENCE as Dr. Loomis.A Halloween delight.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary....,"I only first watched Halloween on October 31, 2004, and it sure frightened me that Halloween night! John Carpenter directs a low budget shocker detailing the horrific night Michael Myers 'came home'. What a memorable night indeed!Cue frightening horror moments, equally harrowing background music, and credible performances from all concerned, and you've got yourself one of the best horror movies of all time! Halloween doesn't actually contain many stomach-churning or gory scenes, instead any murderous happenings are done with both quickly and straight to the point, and there's always that last bit for the viewer to fill in, which makes the film even more captivating. Great ominous dark settings too.Halloween is not a movie that simply deals with murder: we can actually feel some compassion for the main characters, and you sometimes can't help but scream at the TV screen, where a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse is in full swing, and nothing can be done to stop it.Donald Pleasance suited the role of Dr. Sam Loomis extremely well, despite turning down the role to start with, while Jamie Lee Curtis proved herself a versatile actress with her portrayal of vulnerable and simply ordinary Laurie Strode.Halloween sure has a nail-biting ending, and is simply a terrific horror movie, remaining far superior when compared to the countless sequels that followed it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Modern Classic - Really,"Whilst always hesitant to label anything under 25 years old a classic, Halloween is now over 25 years of age, has withstood the test of time, spawned so many numerous sequels directly and indirectly, and made John Carpenter, Donald Pleasance, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis rich and famous - not to mention brought Michael Myers into the collective consciousness of our culture. Series like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street owe their existence to Carpenter and this low-budget horror film centered around the most fitting of all holidays for murder - Halloween. We all the the story. We all know the great direction and musical score Carpenter contributed. We all know that Jamie Lee Curtis started out here on her way to becoming a competent actress(as well as lovely one). What some of us sometimes forget(especially those that label this film as trash and have never seen it) is how bloodless it really is. Carpenter gets far more out of what he doesn't show than what he does show. His knack for creating suspenseful, jump-out-of-your seat scenes is legendary in this film and his subsequent ones. Carpenter pieced this one together just right at just the right time. He picked good actors. Curtis is good as the heroine Laurie Strode. Credibility is brought by English stalwart Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis - a role turned down first by Peter Cushing and then by Christopher Lee. I am sure both would have been great(I particularly would have love to have seen Cushing in that role), but fortunately for all involved Pleasance was cast and makes the most out of the role. He is in many ways the backbone of the movie - a center of reality to be brought back to again and again. Anyway, I could...and should...gush on and on about the importance of this film to all horror after 1978. It is undoubtedly the most influential horror film of the last 30 years in terms of its long-lasting staying power, and its has been used as the model for many, many, many horror films since that year. Carpenter has since gone on to direct many fine features; some of them are even better films than Halloween.

I've never found Jamie Lee Curtis to be a particularly skilled actor, but in this , she is so terrible its almost laughable, but really with her father being Tony Curtis and all of the resources and acting classes that should have provided her its really more sad than anything.

Not for today's Brain Dead Teens,"This film has a low body count. It builds on the terror between the kills. The film is almost bloodless but everyone thinks its a blood bath! It is a classic film! It ushered in a new type of horror and movies have never been the same.John Carpenter and Debra Hill's screen play is a lean mean terror machine! In case you did not know the story in a nutshellIn 1963 a 6 year old boy stabs to death his older sister. 15 years later he breaks out of the mental hospital and returns to his hometown to begin anew!This film will be ""slow and boring"" to most teen today because they have the attention span of a fly. They also will not look closely at was is going in the background in this film and that is sad. To me seeing what is going on in the background is what gives this film its iconic status!This film is a classic. The success of this film ushered in the slasher films of the 1970's and 1980's. If it wasn't for the success of ""Halloween"" there would of never been a ""Friday the 13th"" Film or ""Nightmare on Elm St"".This film is flat out frighting. What scared me here is the fact most of us at one time felt someone was watching us. This movie plays on that fear. However hardly anybody in the film realizes they are being watched by an escaped mental patient.The widescreen frame adds scares because John Carpenter will show the killer (the shape aka Michael Myers) in the frame but then he is gone and you don't know where he is.Now anybody under 30 will find this film slow because there isn't a kill every 5 minutes. What we have is a slow build up of terror and the past 15 minutes of this film will have you screaming for mercy!Again today's teens have a limited attention span and will find this film a bore.

"Influenced by Giallos, Influenced Slashers","While many people would say that the slasher genre started with Halloween, I would have to disagree. Halloween didn't start the slasher genre by any means. Halloween mearly set the ground rules for slasher movies to be made in the following decade. Halloween itself was influenced by many films to come before it. To start off with, the whole slasher template was started with the 1960 classic, Psycho. This would soon be followed by many Italian crime films known as ""Gialli"" films. These Gialli films were the exact definition of a good slasher film. Twitch of the Death Nerve (aka Bay of Blood) directed by Mario Bava influenced the slasher genre to a great extent, which would influence Carpenter to make Halloween.Halloween is recognized in pop culture very easily. Everyone has heard of Halloween, rather it be due to the very creepy theme music, the Michael Myers mask, the remake, or the countless sequels. After pop culture has turned the image of the film, it is hard to remember what it was originally; The original Halloween had very little gore, if any at all. The movie relied suspense and atmosphere, rather than severe brutality like many other films to follow. John Carpenter used pure talent when it comes to film making, rather than relying on cheap special effects or loud noises.Another great attribute about Halloween is the strong female characters. In movie after movie we have pathetic female characters with a fairly smart killer. This is the exact opposite here. The female characters in Halloween are well developed and acted out (by Jamie Lee Curtis in particular). Halloween has great performances all around the coating of it. With a strong cast of Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasense, and Nick Castle, you can't go wrong with the chemistry, the performances, or even the overall look. Halloween is a horror movie where the audience roots for the characters. This aspect would become very well for slasher films to follow, where the audience usually roots and relates with the characters (this is the absolute truth when it came to the 2007 remake directed by Rob Zombie)All horror fans have seen Halloween, and while it didn't quite START the slasher genre, it still layed down a great set of rules. Halloween is also recognized as one of the most suspenseful, frightening films of all time up there with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and the Exorcist (1973). No one is truly a horror fan until they have experienced Halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

All those movies are iconic on their own and (still) outstanding contributions to the horror genre.Halloween: still a fine gem (together with its continuation Halloween II) - even if the gore level is rather low compared to new productions, but the violence somehow ""feels"" the more realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Trick Or Treat, Or else...","Director John Carpenter's horror masterpiece, HALLOWEEN is a relentlessly terrifying, almost mystical experience. The story is basic: As a young boy, Michael Myers murders his older sister, and spends fifteen years in a mental institution. Upon escaping, he heads for his hometown of Haddonfield Illinois with the obsessed Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) on his trail.Meanwhile, teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) prepares for a boring Halloween night of babysitting. Unbeknownst to her or her friends (Nancy Loomis and P. J. Soles), Michael has zeroed in on them for reasons he alone knows. An evening of deadly terror unfolds.This is low-budget, independent filmmaking at its best! Carpenter creates a claustrophobic, suburban nightmare world where Michael roams the quiet streets like an invisible automaton. In this movie, he is simply evil with no need of explanation. He's a shadow, like a murdering ghost. Laurie is his polar opposite, seemingly drawing Michael to herself by some unknown magnetism. Carpenter uses fate / destiny to bring about their inevitable meeting.Absolutely packed with classic sequences, this movie reinvented the ""stalking maniac"", making him a seemingly immortal juggernaut on a singular mission of doom. Among the best films of its genre.Special mention must be made of Carpenter's theme music, which is simple, yet perfectly haunting and unnerving!...",,Anonymous,Horror
A classic in the annals of horror filmdom,"John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is basically a must-see for any discerning horror fan. It is a touchstone in the 'slasher film' sub-genre and has spawned hordes of imitators. Also, it is among the most profitable independent films of all time.The story is fairly simple. A killer, institutionalized since childhood for the murder of his sister, escapes and preys again on Halloween night. It's basically a high-concept premise meant to set up a suspenseful series of set-pieces culminating in a climactic showdown late in the movie.On the acting front, ""Halloween"" launched the career of Jamie Lee Curtis. She stands out among her co-stars, though that's faint praise considering the rest of the cast. I make exception, of course, for Donald Pleasance, who lends the film some credibility.John Carpenter's direction is nicely handled and the film shows some interesting touches from a visual standpoint. Carpenter takes the time to establish atmosphere and create suspense, aided in part by his own moody score.In the end, ""Halloween"" is a good low-budget picture but (inevitably) some of the acting and writing is a bit amateurish. However, the movie is still worth watching as a straightforward horror flick whose success is based more on suspense than blood and guts.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mostly formulaic and made with the lowest common denominator in mind.Halloween has some of those clichés and formulaic elements, but it largely invented them!What sets this apart is the plot development and tension. John Carpenter builds the story slowly, drawing you in. You know something is going to happen, but you don't know when, and to whom.Then, when it does happen, it becomes a roller-coaster ride of terror and action.Ending is a bit disappointing, especially as now, 36 years later, you know it was set up for a sequel, and another, and another, and then a remake... The sequels severely devalued the original movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
That  Final  Twist  ...,"+++++++ THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS +++++++John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is no doubt a very good horror/thriller product. Right from the start little Michael Myers brutal murder of his own sister in Halloween night is quite shocking; and years later as he escapes his psychiatric imprisonment and comes back to town for more savage killings the film sustains its high tension and interest all along.My only complaint on this excellent film comes from the very end when Myers ""body"" disappears in a sort of supernatural focus after being shot no less than five times by Donald Pleasence from no more than 10 feet away and falling out from a balcony. What I mean is that when it turns into something supernatural, the story looses credibility and all the fear the film transmits during its running time -and it surely does- sort of looses a bit of impact. I think that either Michael killed or escaped alive would have made a better finale.That aside, ""Halloween"" is indeed a very good picture in its genre and the first kick for all those teenagers-chased-by-mysterious-murderers products such as ""Prom Night"" and ""I Saw what You Did Last Summer"" as a couple of examples, none of which came out better than this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Everything has already been said about this classic n ther seems to be lil left to say but as a fan of horror films, lemme contribute by praising how good this film is.","I first saw this in the mid 80s on a vhs. It did scared me then. The mask, the music, the knife, the empty suburban area, the absence of parents, found all these things truly terrifying.
Saw it again in the mid 2000 on a dvd which i own.
Revisited it few days back (Oct 2019).On Halloween night a six year old kid stabs his older sister to death. Was it cos she did fornication or the kid possessed or the kid simply a psychopath?
New generation fellas watching this film in today's time may find it difficult to digest that how can a six year old stab a grown up. Pure evil may be.
After spending fifteen years inside a sanitarium, without talking to anybody for fifteen years, the now grown up insane fella escapes by stealing a car. Even his psychiatrist (Donald Pleasance) thinks maybe the doctors must have taught him to drive. Pure evil maybe.
Our psycho returns to his hometown to buy a mask, a knife n to desecrate his sister's grave. He visits his now abandoned home. He carries his sister's tombstone so that he can place it next to a victim's body.
He starts killing promiscuous girls n boys n goes on a rampage with his unique mask n knife, until he comes face to face with a sexually repressed girl (Jamie Lee Curtis) who unleashes her energy.This film is without a doubt a very influential film within the horror genre and shud be seen by lovers of horror films.

A Definite Pioneer in Its Class,"This movie begins on October 31st, 1963 in Haddonfield, Illinois with a 6-year-old boy fatally stabbing and killing his older sister. Because he is so young, he is incarcerated in an insane asylum. Fifteen years later ""Michael Myers"" (Tony Moran) escapes and heads back to the same small town with the same psychotic mindset. Attempting to apprehend him is a psychiatrist by the name of ""Dr. Sam Loomis"" (Donald Pleasance) who treated him during those years and fully understands just how evil Michael really is. But in order to stop Michael he has to find him first. Now, as far as this movie is concerned, I will just say that this particular film was a definite pioneer in its class in that it took over where movies like ""Psycho"" and ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" left off and brought everything to the next level. I especially liked the way the music and atmosphere combined to heighten the suspense and sense of foreboding. Likewise, the fact that it was so financially successful led to a large number of clones and sequels over the course of the next decade (or two). At any rate, even though it isn't perfect, if you like horror movies then this is one that you definitely need to check out. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The suburbs ARE the horror,"We who grew up ""different"" in the suburbs always knew there was something, some ineffable thing, that was dead wrong with our environment. Halloween, like Blue Velvet (1986) vindicates that feeling. While ""the city"" is typically cast in pop culture as the setting for rampant immorality, murder and general debauchery, ""The Suburbs"" are the REAL creepy, borderline psychotic, and all too often death-dealing American institution.The news media is littered with daily stories of ax murderers, serial rapists, gun freak vigilantes, and other barely-human opportunists who are either products of, or thrive in, the suburban environment.Halloween brings exactly that creepiness to the fore. And made a mint doing it, because as everyone in America knows: the suburbs breed DEATH. Don't believe me? Just put ""Dr. Ossian Sweet Detroit"" in a search engine, see what I mean. The very thing you're running away from is right in your face. In fact, it's you, because you also thrive in it, and allow it to persist.Halloween never tells us what made 6 year old Michael snap, we're left to guess whether nature or nurture (or both). My guess: nurture. That is what makes Halloween so disturbing. Halloween, while routinely compared to Psycho and other Hitchcock thrillers can also be viewed as a throwback to The Bad Seed (1956), which no doubt served to reassure middle class white suburban parents that sociopath child murderers are the product of nature, and all the middlebrow breeding in the world can't alter that.Halloween is also one of those movies like Birth of A Nation or Gone With the Wind, in which it's impossible to approach the movie with any kind of objectivity. Sorry, this is what happens when you grow up in LA suburbs and remember the constant news reports of celebrity sickos at the time Halloween (and its imitators and followups) was released and made it big: the Hillside Strangler, Patty Hearst, Manson family, and Night Stalker Samhain aficionado, Richard Ramirez...incompetent Christian rightwing hysterics about ""backward masking"" and hidden messages in rock and roll songs by Abba (no joke), (sub)urban legends about razor-laced apples and poisoned mini-Snickers...did art imitate life in late 70s Los Angeles, or not? Nature or nurture or not? Yeah yeah, the sexually active teens get hacked to death, but not even dorked-out asexual babysitters are safe.They never were. Michael doesn't like them much, either. Or you and your posh lawns, family cars and fancy brand name cookware.That sad fact is what makes Halloween so effective, still, in 2005.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A true masterpiece of horror,"HALLOWEEN (1978)  **** Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance, PJ Soles, Nancy Loomis, Nick Castle.

Pleasance is memorable as the dogged killer's shrink Dr. Sam Loomis (a nice homage to Hitchcock's `Psycho', named after one of the film's characters), who knows `evil' when he sees it.    Curtis became a huge star as her Laurie Strode did what few genre characters did: think and fight back!  Spooky, spine-tingling musical theme written by Carpenter and Castle as Michael Myers aka `The Shape' mershed together provides the right menacing tones.

Iconic slasher killer mixed with old school horror,"This horror classic is a grand example of how a great, low budget movie with production flaws can be so entertaining that nobody cares about those flaws. In some ways, the amateurish approach of flicks like this is even a plus, since no one asks a movie like this to make sense anyway.There is no logic whatsoever to the Michael Myers that we see in this film. One moment he's just a human whack job; the next, some kind of paranormal entity that defines evil and malevolence. For example: how did he learn to drive if he was institutionalized since the age of six? If he magically learned it because he's supernatural, then why does he need a car in the first place? Can't he just ""beam up"" like he does in the clothesline scene? Guns and other weapons stop him; then, he gets up like nothing happened. The great thing about this flick is that it doesn't matter. John Carpenter fashions the character in such a way that he has a dual-nature, making him that much more frightening. The iconic killer's mask and the simplistic but spooky theme song identified with him add even more.The movie's flaws are all small problems, and so easily overlooked. Since most horror films don't bother to try to make sense, we're all used to this formulaic approach, anyway. Carpenter knows his audience well; just make them squirm and squeal. To no surprise, the characters go through all the clichéd motions of doing just the dumbest thing at the worst time. Except for Donald Pleasance who is superb, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who is fair, the acting is some of the most laughably forced mugging ever. At least, it's the worst anyone will ever see in such a popular film as this one is. The lines they utter are pretty unrealistic, as well. Some scenes are dragged out deliberately to crank up the fear factor, but end up being way too long to maintain it. One example of this type of scene involves a laundry room and then proceeds to go absolutely nowhere.Not a genius work like Night of the Living Dead, which was made on an even more shoestring budget. However, it is definitely entertaining in the same way, and succeeds in what it set out to do: just give some hair raising chills and scares. With the less than creative title, that's all you should expect from this. From that point of view, it's a scary classic that every horror fan should watch and re-watch about 500 times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A succesful, creative and scary film","Nowadays horror movies rely on cheap jump scares, this trend makes horror movies predictable and lazy, however, Halloween is a creative and original film that doesn't rely on these trends. It tells an intriguing story that leaves you wanting more. This movie is old (1978) and despite that it stills manages to scare the audience and in creative ways, it perfectly uses the shadows to hide the horror from the film, making you doubt if you're even safe in your own house at night. The acting is also very pleasuring, using a cast formed by teens and kids. The main protagonist expresses herself perfectly in every situation and the kids manage to act naturally and without exaggerating like most kids do in movies.

Years later it can still bring some fear.,"Micheal Myers has always been one of my greatest fear and even at 20 years old, I will admit he still petrify's me.Walking through a video rental store I thought I would revisit one of my greatest fears as a child and pick up the 25th anniversary DVD.Years after first watching this movie, some things are still in-tact and others I realized were not as good as others say.This movie is not for people who get bored easily. The first hour of this movie is so slow, you'll be crying for something that is more then a glimpse of a white mask.I don't find the dialogue in this movie to be all that impressive, even for the 70's. Although some of the dialogue will keep you entertained, most of it will seem like nothing more then a time-filler. I also understand this movie was created on a 320,000 dollar budget but that doesn't mean it had to be so slow.That's really my only beef with the film. There are some really impressive things in this movie. For instance: when she tries to trick Michael by opening the balcony door and hiding in the closet. You don't see that kind of intelligence in horror films anymore. Also the way she got herself out of the sticky situation in the closet was pretty cool.Being one of the first stalker movies around, this was a very nice thing to see.

This is what fear is---this movie has no equal,"What is there to really say? This is a classic by all means and it hasn't truly found an equal in the slasher genre since. While Friday the 13th had a 'party' vibe to it, and Nightmare on Elm Street was over the top and filled with crazy gore and violence effects. This one was different...quieter, subtle, more mature and scary then either of the aforementioned films.It had very little gore or nudity, and yet it was more of a horror movie then Friday the 13th and all of that film's clones ever was. It was scary because of the realism, the fact that this stalker was roaming a quiet suburban neighborhood and entering dark houses and killing people. It was scary because HE HAD NO MOTIVE. That's why this film trumps all of it's mediocre sequels, because Michael Myers didn't even have a name yet, and he was just some creepy stalker going around murdering teenagers in the dead of night on Halloween. You'll be looking over your shoulder for a while after the credits roll for this one.Acting is good, especially by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Even the supporting cast and the children did good jobs, odd for a slasher film like this. But this isn't a normal slasher film, again, this is something else. The slow, menacing directing that plunged you into darkness and fear at every twist and turn, splicing your heart with true horror, and that dark, grainy picture quality...this is just amazing. Most horror movies today barely muster a scream or a shudder. You hear me, Boogeyman? The Messengers? Ring Two? This is a horror movie. This is what fear means. And this is far scarier then anything you can think of in the last 10 years. Bah to modern horror, this is where it's at if you're just starting out in the genre.There is really not much you can detract for this film except for the shoddy picture quality, especially at the beginning of the movie. Very dark and grainy, you can't see anything except for Donald Pleasance's face and his assistant. But it gets better later on, when we're out of such a dark and dank setting. This was 1978 though. So Halloween is excused in this department.Halloween is a timeless horror classic, and defies any stereotypes of the genre being 'brainless', 'just about gore', or 'pointless.'

Whole plot seemed very simplistic, none of the characters were likeable, and the acting, particularly of the victims, were unfortunately terrible.

Favorite horror movie of all time,"There are two movie experiences I will always cherish. The first was seeing ""Star Wars"" for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother. A close second is sneaking into Halloween at the Tripple Plex with my good friend, Trevor, in late October 1978. Halloween left me breathless, speechless, and downright scared. Everyone knows the story. Young Michael Myers decides to kill his sister on Halloween 1963. He escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to Haddofield to wreck havoc once again. He spots Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), a shy senior who enjoys babysitting, and begins stalking her. Her partying friends across the street are killed, one-by-one as Michael sets his plot to get her. Ironically, the young boy she tends on Halloween is afraid of the ""Boogeman,"" and can see him outside. During the murder spree, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) works hard to find Michael before he unleashes his fury. He has no proof, no evidence, just a hunch he has to sell to Sheriff Bracket (Charles Cyphers). As the plot unfolds, you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare. Alfred Hitchcock once said, ""You can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off. That is a cheap thrill. However, put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off, then you have suspense."" Director John Carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in Halloween. The audience will see glimpses of him outside, watching, stalking his victims. We gasp. Will he kill her? When will he kill her? Then, Michael disappears. Carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore. This movie has little blood, but still provides good scares. One of the best scenes is Michael lifting Bob off the ground. He rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight, then he drives it. All you hear is a loud thud, then the audience sees Bob's feet drop lifelessly. Carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer. This also peaks our audience. What will he do? What's going on inside his mind? Finally, Carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension. Moreover, the tandem screen writing he did with Debra Hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about. The teens are not ""party mad,"" but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland. Finally, there is some decent acting in this ""B,"" low-budget thriller. Nick Castle who plays ""the Shape"" (Michael) adds something to the mindless killer. It is cold, merciless, and without any pathology. Moreover, the personality does everything the same way. He kills only when trapped, or to set up a trap. He splits the victims apart. He also relies on brute strength. And that mask used (a bleached William Shatner mask) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion. While Pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues, he comes across as someone scared, desperate, and determined. It made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil. The crown jewel, though, is Jamie Lee Curtis' debut. She plays the Laurie character as someone scared, but also determined and strong who fights back. The end is one that left me speechless. This was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped. Movies like Star Wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times. Halloween, and other scary movies, though, do not have that advantage. So if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new, Halloween would be the movie I would choose.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

My personal favorite horror movie,"First of all I love the action in this movie. Even with the low buget John Carpenter and Debra Hill managed to create a revolutionary slaher movie . I also loved the atmosphere wich this movie made where Michael killed some pepole without you expecting it.

Out-dated in 2018 but still a decent movie!,"Well, let me start off by saying that I only really watched this because I wanted to get some context for the 2018 sequel of 'Halloween'. Do I regret watching this movie in 2018? The short answer is no I don't. You can tell that movies nowadays and even TV Shows of the same genre have taken a lot of inspiration from the formula and story of this movie. Look at Friday the 13th, Stranger Things, Don't Breath and more. All of these in some way have taken a fair amount of inspiration from this movie. The problem in watching this movie in 2018 though is simply that it is out-dated. Whether it's the acting, scenery, music and basically anything else but that's to be expected. If you go into this movie thinking you're going to watch something similar to the movies nowadays, you'll be disappointed. This is a movie you watch and shouldn't take too seriously, watch with a few friends and you'll most likely get a laugh out of it. It's a classic movie and honestly if you're a fan of the genre, you should acquaint yourself with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Lower Grade But Groundbreaking,"45 years later amidst the mass of about a dozen direct sequels and countless imitations John Carpenter's Halloween gets sort of lost in that mixture. To see it as just another one of those slasher movies. However, its vital to consider the landscape when it was made back in 1978/77. The closest thing to this was Black Christmas, which is really more of a Giallo type, and that was pretty much it. And on a paltry budget Carpenter took a schlocky concept and changed the face of cinema. The movie is very straightforward, a bit redundant, a number of things that dont quite add up and it has its share of rough edges. But its concise enough to move quickly, competently made, done with style and has a few moments which are done well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Start of Some of the Weakest Films Ever Produced,"""Halloween"" could be considered the ""Citizen Kane"" of modern horror films in the fact that it paved the way for numerous other films of the kind (seven ""Halloween"" films, nine ""Friday the 13th"" films, and seven ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films).  Unfortunately, as far as the cinema is concerned, this was not the start of anything special.  The evil Michael Myers is a masked and crazed slasher who will do anything to kill his little sister (a very young Jamie Lee Curtis).  It is never really explained why he is after her, but he is.  Psychiatrist Donald Pleasance is the expert who knows that Myers must be stopped.  Pleasance is solid (as he usually is in these films) and Curtis shows a glimmer of potential here.  The screenplay is pretty weak, but the direction over-achieves.  Overall a fair horror film that is nothing special, but looks like a masterpiece when compared to its tireless sequels. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Horror

Pleasents surprise.,"I wasn't expecting halloween to be good, I'm not sure why. I totally get why this has such a huge following, I don't think it's the best horror movies but it did a lot for horror movies, but especially slasher movies. It popularised a lot of slasher tropes and inspired a lot of people to make slasher movies of their own.I really liked the classic, haunting synth score and the brilliant set design, but the best part of this film, by a long shot is the way Michael Myers character is treated. The whole reason Michael is terrifying is because of the ambiguity that surrounds it and the way Dr. Loomis talks about him. Loomis says things like ""death has come to your little town, sheriff"", death being Michael. By saying things like this and ""I met this... Six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes - the devil's eyes"", it dehumanises Michael to the point where your not even sure if he's human. I might be overthinking this but I believe there is a possibility that Michael isn't human. When it disappears and Laurie is staring right at him and not blinking or looking away, this happens many other times throughout that is just the most interesting example. Sadly I don't think this is the case but it's a different, more interesting angle on this movie in my opinion. In reality Michael's disappearing acts are very stupid and don't make any sense. It still helps create such a uneasy feeling around Michael Myers, even if it is dumb.Halloween was only made for 300 thousand dollars which is just ridiculously low even in 1978, this really impressed me when I found out, it looks great. You can tell the budget affected some moments though, when Michael and Annie are in the car the same scream is looped and the cold open kill looks pretty terrible.The acting is pretty awful except for Donald pleasence, Nancy Kyes and P.J. Soles are hilariously bad, but they couldn't really do much with the dialogue given to them, all the young people talking in this movie are pretty much intolerable.This was a pretty enjoyable movie that you might love if you don't get caught up on stupid things and careless inconsistencies like me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
October 31st - Happy Halloween!,"Before Halloween, there was Psycho (1960), Dementia 13 (1963) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), but there hasn't been a better slasher film than John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). For a long, long time it was the highest grossing independent film ever made and it is this low-budget aspect of the film, that makes it a genuine horror film. It also spawned a whole new sub-genre that continues even today. I have always been a big fan of this movie. It is in my top 40 favorite movies of all time. It also boasts one of the best soundtracks ever in film, or at the very least, one of the most recognizable. Plus, it is the first screen appearance of Jamie Lee Curtis and you can't tell me that you don't love Donald Pleasance in this movie.There is nothing wrong with the film. John Carpenter's patented use of long angled camera shots are tremendous. The musical score (all done by Carpenter), along with a drum-beating thriller-suspense pace, combines into a great moment in film history. If you don't believe me, watch it again, and I bet you realize that the daytime scenes are actually scarier and creepier than the night scenes. It does have the stereotypical hot chicks, along with their idiot teen-age boyfriends, who seem to always meet their end. It has the stupid girl, who gives the bad guy every chance to kill her, but Carpenter's execution is flawless and remember, it was the first of its kind.9.2 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

In broad daylight i sat on the sofa with all the doors open and pressed play.. opening scene is great, i love how the film eas shot and the heavy breathing amd death staring creates a great suspense! I enjoyed the film on a whole and don't get me wrong it did make me jump in parts, but mostly I could see what was coming before it happened and started to relax around 20 minutes in.

Surprisingly lightweight..,"Of course, here we have the original slasher movie, the one where countless imitators started popping up after. The success of Halloween has been documented thousands and thousands of times, and it was actually quite interesting to come back to it, after a good 20 + years of last seeing it. Jamie Lee Curtis is of course, The Girl in Peril who for unknown reason (at least until the later sequels) An Unknown Killer Is After Her. And of course, if her friends get in the way, well, I'm sorry, but they'll just have to go! I was quite surprised at this as the body count is quite low (4) and the violence is quite tame. I guess it's one of those things where your memory suggests that this movie is much more gruesome then it actually is, and I do believe that contributes to it's success. Nowadays (going into my old fogey pose) the horror movies aren't made like this! Sometimes you gotta say, is to keep it simple, stupid.

"Halloween review - mediocre tricks, mediocre treats","For some, ""Halloween"" recalls the first time they saw it, watching between their fingers as Michael stalked through Laurie's quiet home. But for me, this represents the most overrated movie I've seen in a long time. What begins as solid, spare suspense devolves into a clichéd mess of narrative plot holes and amateurish acting.Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is hunted by psychopath Michael Myers (a sufficiently creepy Nick Castle) after he escapes from a sanatorium after the sororicide he committed as a young boy. He picks off her friends in a blank, expressionless mask (an excellent wardrobe-department decision) until he reaches Laurie. But despite the high body count, the plot armor, particularly for Laurie and Michael, is laughable, as are the many tropes. The final girl. The unnecessarily topless female. The indestructible villain. The ""Let me go see what it is with no flashlight or weapon"" bit. Michael isn't that cunning, but he's successful thanks in no small part to the stupidity of his victims.Of course, credit is due for ""Halloween"" revolutionizing of the horror genre and inaugurating the slasher subgenre. It did make plenty of innovative decisions, and they paid off in some respects. But the movie also began clichés that have shackled the horror genre for decades. And for those who say it set the horror standard, I'd have to say I agree. It did set the standard for B-level flicks that rely on lazy writers unwilling to give their characters much reason and instead feel content coasting on tiring jump scares. Even this movie's wonderful score, particularly its one memorable tune, and eerie atmosphere can't raise this film past mundanity. By the end, I did leave scared, not of Michael, but of the masses showering their praises on this underwhelming film.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jami Lee Curtis is the Horror movie Queen,"Classic is the only for to describe for John Carpenter's Halloween films, and masterpiece. So does John Carpenter. ""Halloween"" is an absolutely merciless thriller, a movie so violent and scary that. There's this six-year-old kid who commits a murder right at the beginning of the movie, and is sent away, and is described by his psychiatrist as someone he spent eight years trying to help, and then the next seven years trying to keep locked up. But the guy escapes. And he returns on Halloween to the same town and the same street where he committed his first murder. And while the local babysitters telephone their boyfriends and watch ""The Thing"" on television, he goes back into action. It's easy to create violence on the screen, but it's hard to do it well. Carpenter is uncannily skilled, for example, at the use of foregrounds in his compositions, and everyone who likes thrillers knows that foregrounds are crucial: The camera establishes the situation, and then it pans to one side, and something unexpectedly looms up in the foreground. Usually it's a tree or a door or a bush. Not always. And it's interesting how he paints his victims. They're all ordinary, everyday people -- nobody's supposed to be the star and have a big scene and win an Academy Award. The performances are all the more absorbing because of that; the movie's a slice of life that is carefully painted (in drab daylights and impenetrable nighttimes) before its human monster enters the scene. We see movies for a lot of reasons. Sometimes we want to be amused. Sometimes we want to escape. Sometimes we want to laugh, or cry, or see sunsets. And sometimes we want to be scared. I'd like to be clear about this. If you don't want to have a really terrifying experience, don't see ""Halloween."" You don't want to be scared? Don't see it. Credit must be paid to filmmakers who make the effort to really frighten us, to make a good thriller when quite possibly a bad one might have made as much money. Hitchcock is acknowledged as a master of suspense; it's hypocrisy to disapprove of other directors in the same genre who want to scare us too.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"An innovate, frighting horror pic for its time.","Director John Carpenter is a true master of horror, and he's got this 1978 slasher film to prove it. As the film that truly put him and leading lady Jamie Lee Curtis on the cinematic map, ""Halloween"" is bound to make your heart race and bring you on the edge of your seat.The film made great use of the POV shot, as mostly used by classic director Alfred Hitchcock, but made use of a horror film technique that even though is a cliche now, it wasn't then: The jump-scare. The technique is never overused and in some scenes, it doesn't usually rely on a simple sudden loud musical cue. The score, however, when not being used as an easy way to scare you, is brilliantly made, as Carpenter himself composed and performed it.As for John Carpenter, who contributed to the film as a co-writer as well as a directer and composer, this film proved to audiences that he is the master of horror and one of the most underrated directorial talents, even when he makes a crappy film like his future efforts such as ""Ghosts Of Mars"" or ""The Ward.""Considering that this was Jamie Lee Curtis' first major film role, it's safe to say that she speaks the language of acting brilliantly, especially since she most likely gets her acting genes from her talented mother and father, acting veterans Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh.Overall, when October 31st rolls around, make sure to give ""Halloween"" a go, with the doors in your house locked of course.",,Anonymous,Horror

Textbook low-budget flick.,"Regardless of genre this movie, like ""Chinatown"" (1974), should be required viewing and study for all film students. This is how you put a film together. Simple, understated, but at the same time thrilling and horrifying. This is how you make a movie for just over $300,000 and make it look like it was made for millions. Beautiful story telling because there's no peripheral garbage to distract the audience. This movie respects its audience, perhaps out of necessity, meaning it couldn't afford more reveal of the ""shape"" or more time for background. Whatever the circumstance it was perfect.

Everything Has a Beginning...,"Everything most start with something. In case of slashers, Halloween was the seed that was put in the ground, that later unleashed other slasher movies like Friday The 13th or Scream, and all of that franchises are pretty similar too each other. It is always the final girl, erotic scenes, a mysterious, silent killer, that kills everyone one by one, and in the end it is the finale fight, where most of the time, the killer get killed, but not always! Halloween was pretty like the other slashers I have watched, but I have to remember that this was also the great beginnings. About the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is first time on the screen as Laurie Strode, a nerdy teenage babysitter where life is going just fine. Except the annoying kids, of course. She is having a just fine Halloween night, but suddenly everything changes, when the killer comes home, and seeks only one thing: Too kill all of his family members, it's pretty like when Jason Voorhees has only one thought, too kill every teenager in his area. Maybe you noticed that I compare much, but it is important to talk about how the slasher genre began and what can be comparable. The suspense was good, sometimes a little weak, especially when I knew that he is going to get his victims and kill them, but I liked that before all of that stuff happened, they made a great uncomfortableness and unpredictableness, that made my unsure many times, when the killer just stared at them and stalked them, with no sign but, discomfort. The shape did really great with the empty look of rage and lack of emotion. The music was good, classic, but it could have been some variation, not only the same music soundtrack all of the time, because I feeled like the scene lost atmosphere, and with more creativity and different music, many scenes could have been much better. Everything is about suspense, right? Mostly, because let's be honest: The story isn't much to get, and this is a movie just made for the slashers sake and the suspense. About the acting. Well, Nick Castle as The Shape did the job, he was just amazing as the silent psycho. Jamie Lee was just similar to Neve Campbell, she has to be scared and unsure all the time, but later she strike and defeat the bad guy. Nothing new, her acting wasn't the highest shelf, but for the role she got I think she was just fine. I actually think she plays better now as an adult than before, now she plays more real and natural, of course, I think everything is about experience. Concluding everything I mentioned, Halloween was an ok movie. Could have been much better, especially with music, plot and the acting, but it got good pros, like suspense, mysteriousness, and action.

Pure evil,This is the original stalker-slasher movie. The violence is almost implied rather than graphic but this works really well in building tension and creating a sense of death in the air. You never really see the killer and you never really need to. All you need to know is that he is inhuman and pure evil! This is explained anyway. The acting is great and the long shots almost create a sense of heightened foreboding. This is a must-see for any horror fans. It killed a generation of free-love and spawned countless copies. Only gripe is that it plays as a comedy to modern audiences. A piece of horror film history even tributed to by Scream (1996) and many others.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A true horror classic,"Now we all know that Halloween didn't start the slasher genre, that was ""Black Christmas"". But what Halloween did do was make the slasher genre famous.Halloween did many things as well, like being so succesfull that it spans 11 more sequels and a confirmed ""Halloween Ends"".A film that inspired so many films including ""Friday the 13th"".A film which made one of the most iconic movie villains.""Michael Myers"" with an iconic white mask which makes him 10 times scarier.No wonder this film is highly appreciated.Now even though the film doesn't have a high body count doesn't mean it's bad. It makes the film much scarier as it gives more time to introduce Michael Myers and giving him more time to stalk and make him creepier.One thing which makes those things happen is John Carpenter's theme. The iconic theme which everyone has heard at least once in their lives keeps you on the edge of your seat.Another thing John Carpenter does is direct the film, which he does well. With the eerienes of the deranged psychpath Michael Myers. But one thing which annoyes me a lot is the sound mixing. With the music so loud and the dialouge so quite makes it so uneven. I found myself changing the volume time and time again.But Jamie Lee Curtis's performance which is amazing. From and unknown actress to a houshold name starring in many Halloween sequels, Knives out and A fish called Wanda, Halloween (1978) started it all.But in general the movie is great.

I like it and I can't stand it,"I have seen this movie at least forty times, it was released the year I was born and I love to look at the 1970's clothing. I suppose those are odd reasons to keep looking at a movie you can't really stand, but I suppose I kind of like it too.Halloween is very creepy towards the start. The scenes where the doctor and the nurse are driving to the sanitarium are excellent. I get chills just thinking about them! I would have to say that only other truly scary scene is the one where the camera pans the room at the end of the movie.It's unfortunate, but too many things got on my nerves. Annie spilled a little butter on the bottom of her shirt and for some reason feels the need to strip and wash her clothes in the laundry room outside the house. The way she rubs at the stains you would think they were all over her chest, but you can clearly see the butter only splashed on the bottom.Once the terror begins for Laurie, she becomes incapable of doing a scene that does not include a bunch of groaning and grunting. I could barely stand it!The young boy in the movie hears Laurie banging on the front door like a crazy person, but he takes his sweet time opening it for her. I wanted to punch him.I always hated that Michael was able to do things no human should have been able to do. Somehow he could pop up in front of you from nowhere and he could fall several stories and get up. Michael could also vanish when he wanted to.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Great for an indie movie of the 70's, but...","I just watched this movie again after seeing it 20 years ago. I think it has good moments, good music and creates a good atmosphere, but I also think it has some really bad moments. For instance, the silly thing they do with Michael all the time, kind of NOW YOU SEE ME, NOW YOU DON'T, NOW YOU SEE ME, NOW YOU DON'T, after the 3rd or 4th time it REALLY gets irritating and predictable. Also there are lots of very illogical stuff (I'm not talking about the reactions of people in panic situations)like for instance: Where did Michael learned to drive ?? only God knows, and don't tell me they explain it in the next movies, that's a bad excuse for poor storytelling. You don't let your viewers guessing on things like that. But the most illogical and cheap NONSENSE in the whole movie is that Mr. Meyers simply refuses to die. And guess what ? nobody explains in the film why. Seems to me like a cheap resource to force you to see the next, and the next, and the next, to find (maybe) an answer. To me, IMHO, that is bad storytelling. Don't get me wrong. It is fun to watch, and worth the rent, but is no way near to a good terror film. My 2 cents, anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The film that created every slasher film trope.,"I just want to say right off the bat that I feel bad for giving this film a 6. And I am being a bit biased here. If I had some sense of nostalgia with this films I would probably give it a higher rating. But the sad thing is, I wasn't shocked or surprised by anything this film did.It spawned so many replicas that I can't help but to notice that it no longer holds up. I don't feel like I should blame this film for the flaws of others, but I'm not blind and I have to be honest. This IS a very flawed film. And I am very disappointed since everyone holds this film to such a high standard, but I can't help but to feel like I've seen this before.Now if I can try and be a little bit unbiased when critiquing. There's a lot of frustrating things that happen in this movie. The acting is bad(especially from the child actors), the dialogue is terrible, there's absolutely no characters, and characters make a lot of dumb decisions. How am I supposed to care or feel scared for these people when they aren't convincing and make poor decisions?Fairly disappointed with this film, especially when it compares to John Carpenters The Thing. Where characters are convincing and intelligent. Don't understand all the critical acclaim and hype surrounding this film. But I'm descensitized beyond return by this point so maybe I just watched this at the wrong point in my life. But that still doesn't make up for the other flaws with this film.Sorry for being vague, but I don't want to spoil this for anybody else.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I've Come Home - Let's Have A Home Coming Party! 1-2-Watch 1-2-Own,"Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Halloween; here's the breakdown of my ratings:Story: 2.00
Direction: 2.00
Pace: 2.00
Acting: 1.50
Enjoyment: 2.00TOTAL: 9.50 out of 10Halloween is my favourite horror movie of all time. Why? It's simple; almost everything about this little picture is perfect.John Carpenter and Debra Hill's story doesn't overcomplicate the narrative. A psychotic killer has returned to his hometown - His killing grounds. What this allows them to do is build the characters and their circumstances. It gives the audience credible and believable folk and situations. Nobody in this tale cheerfully enters a murder house singing the ""Let's Go Die"" song. These guys and gals are not cannon fodder. Plus, it allows the writers to subtly infuse Michael Myers with a shadow of the occult. They do so by insinuating he's pure evil. They also have him stabbed in the neck, the eye, and the chest. He gets shot in the head and five times in the chest. Then falls twenty feet from a balcony. And, every time, he gets up. This guy isn't human. And that solidifies him as a supernatural horror icon.Then we get onto Carpenter's direction, and he is a master. Every scene is pitched and timed to perfection. There are so many fantastic segments that it's hard to describe how good his filmmaking is. My favourite scene in any movie comes from Halloween. Bob and Lynda have just bumped uglies, and he's popped down to the kitchen for a brewski. Unfortunately, he bumps into Michael, who pins him to a wall. We then get a long shot of the pair side-by-side. Bob hangs lifelessly on the wall, two feet above the floor. Michael stands opposite and stares at him. Slowly he tilts his head one way, then the next. This action not only chills your bones but also adds to Michaels's character. His inquisitive regard reminded me of how a dog will look at something they can't quite understand. Carpenter uses the natural bright moonlight and dark shadows to exaggerate the atmosphere. There is also one scene I had forgotten: One reminiscent of Hitchcock's directional style. Annie is driving Laurie to their respective babysitting jobs when she sees her father across the street. He's the Sherriff, and he's investigating a break-in at the hardware store, where somebody stole some knives, rope, and a Halloween mask. As they pull in to talk to him, we see Lommis' car pull past them. As they pull away, we see Loomis walk down to the Sherriff. Behind them, at the junction across the street, Michael's car is stopped by traffic. He soon pulls away and continues to follow Annie and Laurie. It is one classy piece of direction.The acting is superb, and there are no small parts. The cast is flawless in their performances. The only reason they didn't score full marks is for my small niggles - like the over screaming. Granted, it's a horror film, and people scream in horror films. It's just that I didn't really feel their terror when they did, especially Laurie's (Curtis). I prefered the startled yelp and run. But these are only my annoyances, and they are slight, and they are few.Halloween is the film I would recommend everyone to watch. Everyone should come away with something from this film. I must have watched it a dozen-or-so times now, and it's yet to get stale. It stays fresh, and it always entertains. It's a Must Watch and a Must Own. Forget the sequels; they are only pale imitations.Please feel free to visit my Absolute Horror list to see where I ranked Halloween.Take Care & Stay Well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Underrated as a great film.,"Halloween by John Carpenter, is a masterpiece, not only as a horror film, but a film period. It is told greatly and very thrilling.

Well directed but very boring,This is an very well directed yet extremely boring film that really got on my nerves. The film takes an hour until there is any real action and even then the film is not particularly exciting. The film is just one big build up to nothing and the eventual bloodless knife attacks in almost pitch darkness are unscary and fail to satisfy. It is very hard to see how such a dull film has come to be regarded as a horror classic.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The film that launched a thousand sequels,"John Carpenter is widely acknowledged as the 1970s master of low budget shockers; 'Halloween', a tale of teenagers attacked by an escaped killer, was arguably his most influential film. I quite like some of his other films from this era, but, watching this one, I was mostly amazed at how bad it was. The acting is poor, and there's none of the atmospheric Gothic atmosphere of the equally influential 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. Most crucially, the murderer is a man who wears a mask, betrays no expression, and kills for no discernible reason, not even his own pleasure: a less interesting, or plausible, bad-guy, is hard to imagine. Eventually there are some tense (though surprisingly un-graphic) scenes towards the end, but even their impact is reduced by repetition, and by the poorly worked-out zombie-theme that is added onto the end of the film. To me, it's odd that this movie was so widely copied; but as few consider its sequels to be improvements, I doubt that I'll be watching them.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is composed of not only style, but the forever classic horror plot line: a set of vulnerable (and attractive) victims must battle THE SHAPE in a startlingly claustrophobic 24-hour time frame.  But, then again, one has to wonder: is this the ever infamous plotline that was used in ""HALLOWEEN"" or *created* from it?To top it all off, the compact, 90 minute film is layered with an intense, haunting score, for which ""HALLOWEEN"" was given the first word in fear.  If anyone has always been skeptical about the horror genre, this is the perfect film to realize the quality possibilities it has to offer.  It's just too bad that films aren't made to this caliber anymore... but on second thought, that would render art works such as this average, which they are anything but.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Scary Film Ever!!!,"We all know that Halloween is the original & probably best Horror/Scary film ever made & probably will never be bettered. Made in the 70's & without the help of today's technology, it relied on great vision, acting & the brilliance of director John Carpenter to deliver a classic. I have seen it so many times over 20 years & still today it makes the hairs stand on my body & gives me shivers down my spine. You know your watching a great film, when that happens to you. Brilliant movie.But in sayin this, my opinion might not agree with everyone or even anyone, but the only modern day film that has come close to giving me that same feeling is ""The Strangers""
Not on the same level as Halloween but it does put that feeling through your body that makes you scared, makin sure your doors are locked at bedtime & checking every room in the house to make sure there is no Stranger hiding in your house. If you haven't seen, I'd seriously recommend you do.From a massive Halloween fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The King of all Horror Films!,"Halloween is simply the King of Horror films. It is so suspenseful, has amazing long tracking shots that make it so scary and thrilling unlike any other film in history. The opening sequence, one that makes us see everything Michael Myers is seeing and we follow him through his point of view, it is so well done and one of my favorite scenes of film. What Can I say that has not already been said. Halloween (1978) is a classic, and no horror film ever will touch it's scare factor. There are a lot of other almost equally as great horror films, like The Evil Dead, but that in a milestone in horror/comedy, and ultimately different. One of my all-time faves, horror or not, Halloween proves a force to be reckoned with.",,Anonymous,Horror
Timeless,"I honestly don't understand how anyone could give this film anything lower than a 10. It is a staple of the horror genre and is the building block for the slasher genre, which we all know and love.

The small continuity problems should be overlooked, especially after taking a look at the budget. This is perhaps my favorite horror film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fantastic, I normally don't like horror but this is amazing.","(Closest you can get to spoilers without having spoilers) I have never liked horror all that much but this movie taught me that even my least favorite genre can be great. There are quite a lot of flaws though, and a lot of them are very easy to point out, but it doesn't drag this movie down to a 7 or 8. Some of the flaws are the fact that it has the ""Teenage girl falls"" trope and the ""Girl can't unlock door"" trope, but it is not as annoying as this was one of the first movies to have those tropes. You could also argue that it has a pretty generic plot, a murderer trying to kill a teenage girl, but once again, this is one of the first, if not the first movie like that. This movie also has a very low budget, I am pretty sure it is around the 330k mark, but this movie does such a good job at not making that too apparent, it is a little bit cheesy sometimes, but for the time, you would expect something much more cheesy. John Carpenter was smart with the money, and made the plot something that could easily be done without too much money spent on it. Normally I don't really talk about scores for films, as I don't find them really noticeable, (with a few exceptions) but this one was to noticeably amazing for me to not talking about. There are about 2 songs, and although they can get repetitive they fit Michael Myers and the theme of the movie so well. Another thing that fits the movie very well is the camera angles and darkness of the entire thing, for the first third of the movie, you barely even see Michael, and it is very well done. It is also very dark, almost all the scenes outside take place at night and a lot of the scenes inside are very dark, it fits the film so well and I can't recommend it more. 8.7/10 easily.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I wanted to like it more than I actually did,"Halloween (1978) starring Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously a huge hit and is beloved by horror movie fans around the globe. I really did want to like this movie, but I just didn't like it all that much. OK, my big problem with it, is it just kinda dragged along at the beginning, i felt like it took way too long to get going. So because of that, I became sort of bored at the beginning. Now, I did enjoy Jamie's strong performance as Laurie Strode, the main victim. And I liked the other actor's performances, pretty good acting in this movie. Once the killings started, it started getting better, and I became interested in the film. The movie had a good script and pretty well written dialogue. Was it scary?? Well...... Sort of/not really. Halloween had it's scares at times, but overall not all that scary. 6/10 for Halloween (1978). Now let's see how the rob zombie remake is.

THE GOAT,"I will never forget this my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and my dad had to take me and 2 of my friends to the movie, he's was going to buy our tickets and leave , being we were only 12 at the time the ticket guy said he would have to go in and boy was he mad! But as soon as the previews started he bolted and we strapped in for the ride of our young lives. I was a HUGE movie buff at such a young age, especially scary movies which they were called back in the day now know as Horror or slasher movies because of this one film. There was no digital computers, no huge budget, just a masterpiece of a movie unleashed on millions of people that now consider themselves Horror movie junkies that were now unbenounced to us getting ready to watch the GODFATHER of all slasher movies, I affectionately call the GOAT (greatest of all time). Teenagers nowadays say it isn't that scary because there was no internet or computers at the time, we were lucky in a way back then, we were seeing something not seen before just virgins of Horror, but let me tell you after that movie impacted my life, well I mean in the movie junkie way I am now. I've seen every horror movie over the last 40 years good or bad (not really into the sci-fi horror) more into the slasher movie that could actually happen in ""real"" life. And this my friends is the best and the music score of Halloween is down right awesome and will never be repeated though every since 1978 everyone and everybody has tried (Friday 13th, Nightmare on ES,) good in their on way will never match the impact the way HALLOWEEN did for the Slasher-Horror genre in a small town named Haddonfield, Ill. with Michael Meyers did for this wide eyed 12 year old in a small theater so many years ago. I write this review eagerly anticipating OCT 18th for the new release of HALLOWEEN 2018, and I will take my own wide eyed little son and I assure I'm not leaving the theater til it's over!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It'll leave you screaming for gore...,"It's hard for me to gush about ""Halloween"" like others do...even seeing it during its recent nationwide, two-night engagement in a tiny theater jam-packed with college-age couples didn't much change my opinion of the film. While hailed as a masterpiece by the likes of Siskel and Ebert (among others, circa 1978), I can't say I've ever really understood why. It's not a 'bad' film, but it ultimately isn't all that good, either. The reason, and perhaps this is just my 25-years-later, misinformed opinion, but ""Halloween"" is just too damn SUBTLE for its own good. While I am of the notion that subtlety and atmosphere can produce more scares than gore (check out ""Carnival of Souls""), director John Carpenter takes it to such a level that his shortcomings become painfully apparent. The chilly Midwestern setting sets an appropriate mood, and the scenes with the late Donald Pleasance possess an effective fearfulness; Carpenter knows how to frame a great shot (the scene of Michael Myers standing behind a tree watching his future prey is a fine example), and his score is minimalist and spooky. Unfortunately, the dialog is trite to the point of tedium (generic girl-talk from the girls; vague 'evil-speak' from Pleasance) and the characters are so ill-developed that it's hard to get excited, scared, or upset at their eventual demise. And it comes to a point where all the declamatory musical cues hinder the scares instead of heightening them; it's as if Carpenter had little confidence in his scares working on their own merits, and inserted the 'stingers' to make it blatantly obvious. Personally, I think Carpenter scored more successfully with ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and post-""Halloween"" efforts like ""Christine"" and ""Prince of Darkness.""After that long laundry list of complaints, there are some tidbits of quality to be seen: a young Jamie Lee Curtis, well-cast as The Final Girl; the subtle menace of Myers, when shown, is effective; Carpenter's establishment of the 'indestructible killer' cliché; and during its most suspenseful parts, the director does put us on the edge of our seats. The widescreen print I viewed recently presented information I'd never seen in any of the cropped VHS releases (including Michael Myers ascending the staircase at the very end), which was cool. And watching it in the theater allowed me the pleasure to imagine that great ending being the ABSOLUTE end, and that no other sequels ever came about (it's a pity reality dictates otherwise). ""Halloween"" is well-made and highly influential, but in all honestly, its imitators (""Friday the 13th"") and predecessors (""Psycho"") hold more entertainment value.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
How many clichés can you take...?,"I remember my first attempt to watch this movie, it was about 5 years ago and ended after about 10 minutes. I remember the impression the opening scene made on me. I thought: ""What a cheap, cheesy and bad movie this must be, no thanks."" After a while I decided to give it another shot, also based on the 8.0 rating on this website. I rented it again, and I deeply regret it.I love horror movies, I love to get scared, and I do not need blood, gore, splatter and the liking. I need an intelligent plot, a good, creepy atmosphere and a capable director who can tell the story well. ""Halloween"" has nothing of that.""Halloween"" has a really poor plot (a madman escapes from prison and kills people), a low-budget set that looks low-budget, an incredibly cheesy screenplay (the doctor about the madman: ""I have worked with him for 15 years and he is pure evil"" or something like that), a lousy, lousy soundtrack that should win an award for the worst movie score (composed by Carpenter himself btw.) and so on and on.""Halloween"" is a typical teenage low-budget horror cliché, full of bad dialogue and bad story telling. Since the sceneries are so dumb and hence so predictable, the movie is not scary at all. Actually, it is boring. I had a hard time not to close my eyes or do something else.For my taste, this movie shows how not to make a horror movie. It is not scary, not intelligent and (on top of it) takes itself dead serious. Again, I have to say no thanks.John Carpenter has become a ""no no"" to me. As a teenager I was kind of fascinated by ""The Thing"", but having seen it again as an adult, I'd have to say that it probably was because it was so disgusting. ""Assault on Prencict 13"" was one of the worst movies I have seen so far, and ""Halloween"" was not so much better than that. I will never watch a Carpenter movie again.Anyway, 2 stars for not being as bad as ""Assault"" and for having Lee Curtis and Pleasance in the cast - the latter though with dialogues that make your mind boggle.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Boogeyman cometh,"A soulless killer, Michael Myers, escapes from the asylum and returns to the Illinois town where he murdered his sister 15 years earlier to wreak havoc on Halloween night. Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers' seriously concerned doctor.John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, ""Halloween"" was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like ""Psycho"" (1960), ""Dementia 13"" (1963), ""A Bay of Blood"" (1971) ""Torso (1973), ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and ""Black Christmas"" (1974). ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) and its sequels took the ""Halloween"" template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.Whilst I prefer the ""Friday"" films, ""Halloween"" has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.Although the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What's NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it's not late October.Other problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls' conversation walking home from school, which doesn't ring true. Speaking of the girls, they're decent, but not nearly as good as the ""Friday"" films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in ""Psycho""). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers' abode speaking portentously.I appreciate ""Halloween"" because it's classy, atmospheric and it's a superb pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it's a tad overrated by gushing fans.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Greatest slasher? Yes! Greates Horror? YES!,"John Carpenter's Halloween is nothing but a masterpiece. Jamie Lee Curtis is a great lead role and of course; Michael Myers (The Shape) is an amazing killer, he kinda feels supernatural and that is what makes him so scary.

Golden Age of Horror,"Michael Myers kills his older sister Judith Myers when he was six. Fifteen years later, Michael escapes the sanitarium. He returns to Haddonfield, Illinois. It's Halloween and he grabs a white William Shatner mask. He starts stalking Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Her friends Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes) and Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) dismisses her concern. Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is on Michael Myers' trail.It's the movie that launched endless sequels, and the careers of Jamie Lee Curtis and even John Carpenter. This is his first big hit. But there is more. It's the start of the golden age of horror. There are killers with name recognition. We get scenes from the killer's POV. Horror is moving into new territories. Michael Myers is possibly the first well known killer movie character. It's interesting that the adult Michael Myers really doesn't start killing until later in the movie. There isn't as much slashing in this slasher movie as most would expect. It is more creepy than gory. The iconic music just adds to the creepy atmosphere. It's also such an incredible idea that this low budget indie horror would become so iconic and have so much influence. Considering that Donald Pleasence is the most experienced of anybody on the set, it is truly amazing that this was so well made.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This was not the re-invention of horror - but it's a good movie nonetheless.,"I have never quite understood the hysteria which surrounds this film. Though it is a good film, and the soundtrack by director John Carpenter must rank as one of the most memorable ever composed, to suggest it is a movie which reinvented the horror genre rather begs the question as to exactly what people had been watching for horror prior to 1978.The opening ten minutes are well-staged and the child's-eye view of a house at dusk and a girl changing upstairs is both eerie and full of anticipation. Fact is I can't fault the opening, and when Donald Pleasance enters the frame as Dr Loomis, desperately trying to find his most infamous patient before the madman strikes again then you sense you're in for something rather creepy.But while the film certainly starts creepy, my suspension of disbelief started to evaporated as Michael Myers slowly took centre stage. For those who think this film is terrifying - and some reviewers really should look up the meaning of that word - I suggest you check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or the second half of Wolf Creek.There are some genuine scares in Halloween, and Donald Pleasance is suitably sinister as Dr Loomis, insisting to the police of Haddonfield that they are looking for an incarnation of evil. The police don't seem all that convinced by his insistence, and neither was I in the end, but I did enjoy the film.It reportedly cost less than $1million to produce, yet when re-released in the autumn of 1978 ended up raking in more than eighty million dollars. A staggering return, and perhaps one reason for its iconic standing today.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ultimate Halloween Scare Film,"I can't believe someone just had the nerve to try & remake this John Carpenter classic. This film is outstanding as a Halloween scare film all the way through.Jamie Lee Curtis really gained her fame in her role for this film, initially. She is the baby sitter who keeps just missing getting killed. Donald Pleasance is excellent as the Doctor who is going overboard & is making his career out of pursuit of this killer. A lot of the support is good in this too.The main image from this film that is ingrained in your head upon viewing is the classic jack-o-lantern lit on the front porch of the house. It's symbolism just stays with you the entire film. This is a modern classic which should be left to stand on it's own merits. Even a second viewing & you catch subtle things Carpenter put into the film which you might have missed the first time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good view.  Perfect starter for the ""Queen of Scream""","Despite the fact that they make the police look like complete moron's in this movie, and the annoying repeatedness of the eerie music, this movie still pulls off a realistic and highly entertaining view. For Jaime Lee, it is by far and away one of her best, which goes to prove once again that when you start out on top, the only way to go is down (Freaky Friday anyone?).It is good though, especially since it ushers in the whole slasher phenom from the '80s. And it is much better than any of the sequels, including the newest one coming out I am sure.Overall, worth viewing more than once, but probably only about once a year (you can figure out which day).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A True Slasher Flick!,"The original Halloween is definitely a true slasher flick, as well as a horror classic. Even though this is an independent feature and at the time had a relatively unknown cast, it became one of the surprise hits of the late '70's. Halloween more than most modern horror movies relied more on scares and suspense than extreme gore to help make it a success.Here scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis has her real first big screen role. At the time her mother the late Janet Leigh was also known as a screen queen as the doomed motel tenant in Psycho another landmark horror movie. Like mother like daughter!When Halloween was first released Donald Pleasance was probably the only star of the film that was already a household name. Most moviegoers best knew him as one of the all time James Bond villains, Blofeld from You Only Live Twice. This time around Pleasance plays one of his few good guy roles in that of the obsessed, but determined Dr. Loomis. However, Dr. Loomis's adversary would not be a super spy who has at least two lives, but a supernatural serial killer who the doctor will eventually discover has anywhere between 2 and 2 million lives.The well known serial killer is known as Michael Myers, who was also the doctor's patient for 15 years. Even though Michael was a major headache for Loomis, he mostly likely helped launch the careers of Jason and Freddy. Michael is first introduced to us a 6 year old, who on Halloween night in 1963, brutally butchers his half naked sister to death. Then the evil child will spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum. However, Michaeal would not have it that way.Fast forward 15 years later, Dr. Loomis and one of the hospital nurses are under orders of the law to bring Michael Myers to court to stand trial for his sister's murder. The doctor and nurse shockingly discover that Michael has made an elaborate escape plan, and decides to come home to Haddonfield, Illionis.Now that Michael Myers has returned to his hometown, we are first introduced t Jamie Lee Curtis's character, Laurie Strode who is a rather shy high school student. Once Michael first lays his eyes on her, he begins to stalk her and her two girlfriends Annie and Lynda. All three notice the masked figure, but have no idea who he really his. As Laurie and Annie are both off to their baby sitting duties, Dr. Loomis finally arrives in Haddonfield. When he finally make his presence back in Michael's hometown, he requests the town's sheriff who is also Annie's father to aid him in tracking down his patient before he commits a major murder spree.Dr. Loomis decides to hang out in Michael's childhood home, believing he will actually decide to return. Sheffir Brackett somewhat skeptical about the doc's theories, agrees to patrol the streets of Haddonfield in an attempt to find the escaped patient before it's too late. However, both men have no idea that Michael is stalking the two girls who babysitting two different kids. Michael makes Annie his first victim of the night, then murders Lynda and her boyfriend in the same house where Annie was babysitting.This is where the major scares really start to pick up. Laurie who is babysitting across the street, believes that her friends are playing a Halloween prank. So she decides to walk across the street to where her friends are hanging out. Unfortunately, Laurie discovers that's it's no Halloween prank and three of her friends have been murdered. Laurie herself miraculously escapes from the house and heads back over to the house she was originally babysitting in to hide from her attacker.As Michael is about to claim Laurie as his next victim, Dr. Loomis sees two screaming children running out of a the house that Michael is now in. The doctor decides to go into the house and finds his patient at last trying to murder Laurie. The doctor saves Laurie by shooting ol Mike approx. 6 times before falling out of the window to the ground. As Loomis looks out the window he like everybody else discovers that you can't kill the bogeyman.Now we know there will be numerous sequels, as well as similar style slasher films.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of a Kind!,"Halloween is one of the those classic horror movies that everyone must see at least once. With little gore and violence, I feel that Halloween is very much a part of the 'it's not what you see, but what you don't see' club. The subtle quizzical look that Michael Myers gives to his victims is more frightening than any amount of blood can do. This movie will make your hair stand on end and send chills down your spine! The character development is excellent; you do not want these characters to die, unlike many horrors that are made today. It is one of the few scary films that the audience is not rooting for the killer! Jaime Lee Curtis plays an unassuming babysitter and her performance is very believable, making it hard not to sympathise with her as she struggles to get away from Michael Myers. I cannot recommend this movie enough. If not for the great casting, music and originality, watch this movie simply to appreciate the simplicity and eeriness of what Halloween has to offer. A must see for both horror movie fanatics and casual viewers!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Movie,This movie is incredible. I absolutely love it. It holds up very well and is still creepy. This movie is very simple and very effective. The score is iconic and Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are amazing. Iconic performances. The key to watching this movie is that you have to ignore all of the sequels and look at the movie in a vacuum. Michael Myers is as mysterious and creepy as you can be. We have no idea why Michael is doing anything. Why does he behave the way he does? We don't know. Thats what makes it scary. Classic movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very scary! Loved it!,"HALLOWEEN is the first film in the HALLOWEEN franchise and I will reviews the sequels, with the exception of Halloween III: Season of the Witch. The plot is set in the fictional Midwestern town of Haddonfield, Illinois. On Halloween night in 1963, a six-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister by stabbing with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode and her friends. Michael psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael's intentions, and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent him from killing.The story is just amazing and John Carpenter & Debra Hill wrote a very good story and they really did a very good job bringing it on screen and this film shows that it's about building up suspense and characters and story , not about the violence and gore, which was something that the other films lacked.The acting is okay. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Laurie Strode and she is amazing in that role. Donald Pleasence plays Dr. Loomis and this was his breakout role and he was amazing in that part until the last one that he was in. Nick Castle plays Michael Myers and he is great. P.J. Soles as Lynda is really cool in her role and she was spectacular.The rest of the cast is just amazing. The music is just amazing and I love that Halloween theme song, because they have done different versions of the film and it was really cool. The kills in this movie are not as bloody and that's what I like about this film. My favorite kill that has been re-enacted a lot of times is Lynda's death and I saw the remake and it stays true to it's source material.Overall, I love HALLOWEEN - the 1978 version, but there are some problems with this film and the 2007 remake fixed those problems. 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A simple yet effective horror movie.,"Most people consider ""Halloween"" to be the first true slasher film, and from watching it it's easy to see why. All the conventions are there: the unstoppable faceless killer, promiscuous teens who are killed after having sex, steadi-cam shots from the killer's point of view, and the virginal heroine. Despite these conventions, I just don't think it's fair to call ""Halloween"" a slasher film; slasher films are cheesy exploitation films that seem to only exist to spill as much blood as possible, while ""Halloween"" is actually a creepy and effective horror movie.""Halloween"" is about an escaped mental patient named Michael who was committed after he murdered his sister as a child. He returns to his home town one Halloween and immediately begins stalking a local teenage babysitter named Laurie. No reason is given for Michael's obsession with Laurie or why he's been mute since he stabbed his sister to death as a child. All that matters is that he wants to kill Laurie and possibly anyone else who gets in his way. It's an incredibly simple plot, but somehow the fact that we know so little about Michael and his homicidal tendencies makes for a better and much scarier movie. It also helps that the entire movie is all about Michael stalking Laurie. There are other victims who get in Michael's way, but unlike most slasher movies the murders seem less random and more like a means to an end, which of course is to further terrorize Laurie.The plot may be frightening enough, but what really makes this film work is the outstanding cinematography. Much of the film is made up of long tracking shots of the characters and steadi-cam shots usually from Michael's point of view that really give the viewer the impression that there is somebody watching these people. Even when nothing bad is happening, I would still get the impression that something was going to happen very soon. It creates a very intense atmosphere that, when added to Michael's heavy breathing that we hear whenever he comes close to killing somebody (getting excited, perhaps) and the simple yet creepy musical score make for a genuinely scary movie.I would probably recommend this movie to anybody who really likes good old-fashioned horror and knows that a horror movie doesn't need to spill buckets of blood to be entertaining. A remake directed by Rob Zombie is coming out soon, but I would be very surprised if it manages to top the original. This one is truly a horror classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Halloween 1978,"Ohn Carpenter's Halloween is the evolution of modern horror. Carpenter's low-budget psychological slasher films are one of the greatest horror films of the 20th century. It uses all of your senses to navigate this edgy film that spawned the modern-day slasher film and a series of mediocre sequels, culminating in the atrocious Halloween Ends. Jamie Leigh Curtis is phenomenal as the quintessential damsel in distress who has to muster courage in the face of a monster. The supporting cast is small but strong. The way Carpenter uses limited finds but creates visually frightening shots and his own eerie score combine to make this one of the best. What an incredible movie! The very beginning of the Halloween franchise. The beginning of the legend that is Michael Myers. Now I didn't know anything prior to watching this movie; apart from that, the killer's name is Michael Myers and what his mask looks like. Other than that, I knew nothing, so I was very excited to see what this movie was actually about and how Michael Myers became the iconic Halloween killer that will always be iconic throughout cinema history. I love how simple yet mysterious this character is. The overall story was amazing, and it kept me on the edge of my seat as it progressed. That returning Halloween theme music that was composed by the director was amazing. Overall, this movie was fantastic, and the fact that everything was simple, not over the top or complicated, no wasted moments, made every second of this movie extremely enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror films should be scary,"Definition of the term horror: ""intense and profound fear"".Surely then, a HORROR film should contain intense and profound fear. So why is it then that most horror films are not very scary, and just contain grotesquely disturbing and violent images. Well, its probably because most people who watch modern horror films are mostly underage and get off on graphic violence. It's a shame really, because these films do so well, why would anybody go out of their way to make a genuinely scary horror movie? James Wan's Saw is an exception, but like all other actual good horror films, it has been exploited by making pointless sequels.Thankfully, we'll always have the legendary John Carpenter. Halloween is by far the scariest film I have seen. Instead of going out of his way to put graphic violence on camera, he instead creates unbelievable suspense by making us wait, setting the film at night, the heavy breathing sound, and adding a supernatural element. Notice there is no blood and gore in that list. Michael Myers has no lines in the whole film. He also has no back story. He is seemingly normal, that is perhaps the scariest thing about him. So many villains have been made so much less scary by giving them a back story - even Hannibal Lector was ruined by his own creator! Ignore the fact there has been a recent remake of Halloween, because it hasn't aged one little bit. It isn't gory at all, but remains terrifying in a way that no other film can. This is a milestone in film horror, and a true classic. Because what Carpenter lacked in budget, and some of the actors lacked in talent, was more than accounted for by superb technique, something that many budding directors should take a look at.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kind of Boring,"When I started to watch this I thought great I'm watching a real classic, unfortunately the movie doesn't really get going till halfway, all though I guess if you've watched clips, countless trailers and the ending it isn't going to be that exciting. But I feel great to have watched a classic like Halloween with out being scared all though nothing scares me. Anyway back to the point the movie kind of drags and the kills aren't that interesting they sound more like there having sex than being killed, if you're a horror fanatic watch this if you're more interested in blood and gore stick to scream. overall I found this kind of Disappointing compared to other movies I've watched",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

But that peace is about to be put to rest. Jaime Lee Curtis stars in her first role as Laurie Strode and is pursued by Michael Myers throughout the entire movie. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time.

Classic Slasher,"Halloween, believe it or not, was not the first slasher film of it's kind. It was also not the last and continues to spawn imitators to this day.  Four years before ""Halloween"" was released, the slasher film ""Black Christmas"" came and wentwithout much notice, even though it boasted a more seasoned cast and aslightly better budget.  So why was Halloween more popular than itspredecessor?  I don't know for sure, but I have a few theories.  #1  It has a great, catchy score going for it.  #2  It didn't take itself quite as dead-serious as Black Christmas did and provided more than a few laughs, and #3 SEX!!!  Halloweenmay not have been the first slasher film, but, if memory serves me correctly, Halloween was the first slasher film to suggest a direct correlation between sex and death.  The point of Halloween seemed to be that young, sexually activegirls die and good, virginal girls live.Michael Meyers, very much like Rhoda in ""The Bad Seed"" was just born bad.He is six years old when he commits his first murder, stabbing his sister to death after she finishes having sex with her boyfriend.  Showing no remorse, or any other kind of emotion for that matter, Michael is locked away in an insaneasylum to await his 21st birthday, when he will stand trial for his crime. But on the eve of the trial, Michael escapes and heads home to Haddonfield.No reason is ever given for Michael's urge to kill, nor is it explained (in the first movie, anyway) why he chooses the three main targets of the film; Annie, Linda and Laurie.  Laurie is the good girl, the plain Jane with a brain wallflower played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Her two friends, Annie and Linda, are far more popular, better dressed and more confident, and seem to like having Laurie around ifonly to make themselves look even better.  Both have boyfriends and aresexually active.  Laurie is a little afraid of boys, and this may be what saves her. She is suspicious of the mysterious man who seems to be following her and her friends around, but her friends never take the threat seriously.  For them, the shadowy form of Michael is either a potentially cute guy to flirt with, or a creep who needs to ""buzz off.""  Linda and Annie never consider the danger.  Lauriedoes, and she is on the alert for the rest of the night.  Annie is the first to die, after stripping down to her underwear in front of the window and having asexually explicit phone call with her boyfriend, whom she is on her way to pick up when she is murdered.  Linda drinks beer and has sex with her boyfriend in the parents bedroom, and even flirts with Michael (thinking he is her boyfriend in a ghost costume) brazenly baring her breasts.  Her boyfriend is stabbed todeath, she is strangled, and Laurie, left alone across the street, is next.Laurie, shy and afraid of men as she is, cannot seem to fight back at first. She runs, screaming for help after finding the dead bodies of her murdered friends. But when no one will help her, she learns she must help herself if she wants to live.  Her maternal instincts kick in when the killer invades the house where she is babysitting two small children.  Laurie screams and whines and doesn'talways use good judgment (and, compared to today's butt-kicking heroines, she seems pretty wimpy and spineless) but she manages to fend off her attackerlong enough for help (in the form of Dr. Loomis - Donald Pleasance) to arrive. Laurie has survived, but the boogeyman is not dead.  She will have to bestronger next time.Halloween showed us what happens when young adults engage in premaritalsex, the consumption of alcohol and marijuana and attitudes which suggest that they are too big for their britches.  But it's also just a good, scary little film to watch with the lights off, if you're not one to be bothered with pseudo- psychological insights.  Michael Meyers is a dark angel of judgment and death, making examples of Linda and Annie and pushing Laurie back into her place.Laurie, who chokes and coughs over a joint that Annie has no problem with,now understands; she is not meant to fit in with That Crowd.  She has beensingled out forever, and now sees the danger that awaits her there.Halloween is a classic of the genre and should not be missed by  horror fans. No excuses: you cannot call yourself a true fan of horror until you've seen this film.  Michael Meyers has indeed achieved immortality, right up there withJason, Freddy, Pinhead and many others.  He will never die, and neither will the impact this film made on history.",,Anonymous,Horror
MY REVIEW: Horrific Halloween Night!!,"Halloween. The cult horror from 1978. It might have been one of revelation in its days because of its tone, background score and the idea of scare being personified so diligently but I think it had dated pretty fast because of absence of a puzzling screenplay. In a short run time of 91 minutes, nothing much happens in first 60 minutes apart from the first scary scene at the very start of the movie. You just anticipate that it is going to be chaos soon. It happens but then things get wrapped up pretty fast. At the end, you feel like movie has just started scaring you and this should have been the interval time rather the end itself. Nevertheless, it makes a nice watch because of its idea and relating the every scare to the day of scares i.e. Halloween.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true and deserving horror classic. Thanks John Carpenter.,"Whenever we talk about the classic slasher films, we must mention at least two names - A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Halloween (1978). That's what this movie is - a pure classic. You know what Friday the 13th films are? Something that started with a RIPOFF of Halloween. That's how important this film is! Who knows? Had it not been successful, we might have never got a Friday the 13th films at all!Good : This usually is in my negatives in a slasher film, but here, it is in the positives - the characters. The characters we get introduced to in this film are very interesting. It doesn't feel like as if they're there to get killed, except for a final lady character. Laurie, our main girl played by Jamie Lee Kurtis, stands out to be one of my favorite final girls in the so-called classic slashers. Her friends are not just blant and useless characters either. They are not as interesting as Laurie, but they do entertain us either by getting killed or by interacting with other characters. I won't say all the characters are memorable, that's (perhaps) never the case in these type of films, but at least they don't feel forced and boring. Michael Myers. The tiny introduction to the character, for me, was sufficient to get behind him. We actually get to see what happened to him, or what made him the killer that he was. In short, Michael Myers was a good antagonist for me. However, all these are the secondary factors, which make this film good. The main aspects that need to be acknowledged for making this film so good, even after 40 years, would be John Carpenter. His imagination gave us Michael Myers. His screenplay served as the basis of this film. His music in this film gave chills. His direction made it a classic. I don't think the screenplay was a unique piece of writing. It could've been used to make a dumb Friday the 13th film too. It's the direction of Carpenter that made the movie so good. Throughout the film, we can feel the creepy presence of Michael Myers and we do not have a single moment to relax. That's something which makes a film like this work. Not just kills. Or loud sound effects. This movie apparently understood it very well. The suspense and the thrills are built very effectively and all of the thrills are worth the respective conclusions. The third act is a rollercoaster ride, to be honest. What I am going to say now can be put in ""mixed"" aspects, but I am not going to do so. If you show this movie to someone who has watched the modern day slasher films, he or she will definitely say ""what's the big deal, the movie is clichéd"". I would definitely agree to that - had it been a movie made in this date. It was made back when such films weren't so popular and if you think that this movie is obvious, you must know that movies like these are the ones which apparently gave us the clichéd template of slashers. It is a trend setter, in that respect. A movie being a trend setter is one of its biggest accomplishments. One more positive about this film. Compared to Nightmare and Friday films, the ending works in this movie. I would definitely say that the ending is quite similar to that of the first Friday and first Nightmare movie. There's a lot of mystery behind Michael Myers and they barely acknowledge him as ""inhuman"" - not confirming as if he was a supernatural entity or just an emotionless killer - and, he looks like a human. Even though we know enough about Myers to get behind him, even though Myers gets over with us, we still don't know many things about him. So, the ending makes us more curious about the character and hypes up for the sequel, even though it wasn't meant to be given sequels. It absolutely wasn't shoehorned to make room for the sequels like in the other two franchises I mentioned. Yet another positive. The character of Dr. Loomis is an integral part of what makes the story engaging. If you compare the first Nightmare film with it, we like the first Nightmare film because we get to know a great deal about Freddy and the psychological horror aspect of the movie was engaging. So, it didn't really need a ""stopping agent"" like Loomis. But comparing with Friday films, it lacks a character like Loomis to hold the movie tightly, which becomes a weak compilation of slicing scenes (roughly speaking). Dr. Loomis may not seem like a character which was integral to the movie. But, had he not been there, the movie might not have worked so well. I often get confused about which movie - among this one and first Nightmare film - I like the most. But, I always tend to put this one above just because of the ending that doesn't bug me.Conclusion : It's one of those movies which deserve to be called ""classic"". Even though the tropes may seem familiar, it was perhaps the first one to use such tropes so effectively. Thus, viewing in the retrospect will make you enjoy this movie even more. .

An uneven yet effective classic,"Being the movie that popularized many of the tropes we see in slasher movies, does it still hold up? Much like Night of the Living Dead, the film manages to surpass the limitations of its budget and deliver a scary, occasionally uneven, experience. The slow pace and use of John Carpenter's minimalistic, yet effective score builds an atmosphere of dread, and the relatively smaller scale of the movie (the main setting is basically a single neighborhood, three houses at most) lets the viewer become familiar with their surroundings before the killings begin. The shots of Michael Myers appearing in and out of the darkness, as well as long shots of him from across the street, help give him a real presence and make him an effectively creepy villain. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are both excellent in their roles, with much of the supporting cast doing decently as well. Unfortunately, the film isn't without its moments of narm. While some times they're used effectively, the movie has an annoying habit of playing some loud, piercing sound effect whenever Myers does anything in the background, and it's not as effective as just having no sound effects and letting the audience take in the shot he appears in. A lot of times the dialogue can be hokey, and the ADR of Curtis' voice during the final chase can be pretty laughable (""THE KEEEEEEEEEYS!""). There's also the unfortunate matter that many of the scares can be seen as predictable because the film practically codified them as clichés, so modern viewers may find the movie boring as a result. That said, I still highly recommend Halloween as a great seasonal movie. The acting is mostly solid, the score is iconic and used well, Michael Myers makes for a great, creepy villain, and the smaller scale of the movie gives it a unique feeling of familiarity. If you're interested in the origins of the modern slasher movie, this is the movie to watch. Seven fake out scares out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic slasher from John Carpenter,"A true classic of a horror film. The makers of Halloween used their low budget to their advantage creating a story with a small bunch of likable characters in one filming location. The score is simple but ever so effective. Sound quality on this Blu ray was very good throughout. The night time scenes are slightly grainy as you'd expect.Don't expect lots of blood and gore, the lighting of the indoor night-time scenes leaves more to the imagination. The cast all give a good performance and the characters were well developed although there isn't really any character development. Creating a horror film in a quiet suburban neighbourhood instead of a Gothic mansion has become cliché today but was quite original in 1978. The colour palette is quite pale, lots of browns, pale or dark greens, greys and browns, skin tones are natural and the whole film has a cool touch to the colour. I really felt the Blu Ray version breathes new life into the picture, colour and detail of this older film. For some reason all the girls dress for high school like their grandma's would probably have done, blouses, floral skirts or trousers and earth tone jumpers and cardigans and dated hairstyles all make that early scene feel very retro. The early fleeting sightings of Michael carefully build the tension for what's coming up during the approaching night.

Possibly the greatest over-hyped piece of junk,"I would put spoilers if there was anything to spoil but there really isn't..hailed as a masterpiece perhaps the greatest horror film that's all perception and years of fans feeling they have to like it Because it's part of history (which it is it spawned a lot so I give it props for that)There is absolutely no story in this film other than Michael is EVIL, he shows up kills teens on Halloween for no real reason..people build this film into this iconic status about how intricate Michael is and how deep he goes and because of that you don't need to know why..which is BS I'm sorry but if this movie had been made today the exact same no one would have payed attention and everyone would've hated it BECAUSE it has NO story, that's an excuse that's just wishful fans painting over the films biggest problem...Michael has no character or soul He isn't entertaining to watch as he slowly Moaps around the film he sucks the life out of it.. The acting too is bad except Donald pleasence who is a legend, th other actors go around their mundane life talking useless dialogue irrelevant to the film then they get spooked by Michael watching then they go about their mundane life again. Another problem is John Carpenter who did go on to do great work this isn't ,not really a look or feel absolutely lacklustre cinematography when it doubt this film will go to long shot and you will be sick of hearing that keyboard play that theme tune (which is played in place of showing us any suspense, feeling or emotion)It hasn't aged well at all it, no style, and no story This movie got lucky and made millions that's it",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
No need for blood.,"This is probably one of the greatest horror films I have ever seen, especially because it's Old School horror. John Carpenter helps prove a very important point with this movie - you don't need buckets of blood pouring out of people's bodies to make a movie scary. You only saw one or two places where there was blood and even then it was just enough for you to understand the person was dead, which made the movie very suspenseful. This movie was what also helped create all the many different parodies of ""The Silent Killer in the Mask"" series, like Friday the 13th's 2-10, the Scream trilogy, and countless other examples that weren't even half as good as Halloween.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
halloween,"Surely one of my favorite horror movies of all times. It's so simple and strightforward. Stylisation. Pure and simple. We' ve got a ghoulish figure with a butcher knife (can anyone find more simple weapon than that? It's used for slaughtering pigs. We've got an average man, not some musclebound 300 pounder. His mask is white painted (we can call it blank either - no emotions, no nothing, just work. A machine). No psychological profile, no torturing in his childhood years which brought him to this psychotic state, no hopes, no dreams, no higher purpose in his acts. Pure evil. That kind of purity is the signature for all of Carpenter's work. Look at the Assault on the precinct 13 or Prince of the darkness, or The Fog.",,Anonymous,Horror
Goodish,"For me a good comedy is one which makes me laugh, a good drama one which makes me weep or at least feel a lump in my throat, a message movie one which makes me feel the message and agree with it and a horror movie one which scares me indeed. Well this movie scared me enough though not too much. Its slow rhythm keeps us waiting for the climax all the time playing on our nerves and when it comes it doesn't disappoint us. That means that the movie is well balanced in terms of images and suggestions. Are we before a man which is insane beyond any limits and has got almost superhuman powers or are we before a creature which is human only in appearance and is indeed an evil supernatural being in human shape? The movie never explains it fully which adds to its terrifying power. A few flaws here and there are mere details and don't spoil much the logic of the plot. We can ask for instance why the plate number of the car stolen by the murderer isn't communicated to all authorities in which case he would have been quickly caught. But maybe it was and doesn't need to be mentioned in the movie because everything happened so quickly and the murderer went to a small town where that information would perhaps not get quickly enough. Well anyway if the murderer was caught too soon the story could not be told and the movie could not be made. Summing it up we can call this movie goodish after all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still so good after all these years.,"Sometimes it's hard to review such well-known films, classic films. It feels everything has already been said before. But old films and classics certainly do age, some of them well, some of them not so well. Watching them in different time periods certainly gives you a fresh perspective, but always keeping in mind the time and context in which the film was made. Having said that, I rewatched this horror gem a couple of months ago and the more you watch it, the more enjoyable it gets. This is the original, the ones that follow are just mediocre. This one is quality, the real deal. Here is the beginning of the battle between Michael Myers and Laurie, and is always so delightful to watch it gestate from the beginning until the end. So many cool scenes, and I don't know if this gets mention often or not, but I truly appreciate this movie's photography work. So many incredible shots that are a testament to this movie's classic status.Jamie Lee Curtis is great, this role came natural to her and she shows that on screen. I'm sure she inspired many that have attempted to portray her essence to a certain extent but have failed miserably, for she's one of a kind, as her performance is. You know how it is, it's so hard to fine convincing (let alone good) acting in these kinds of films, but you have one here. A timeless classic, to enjoy every month of October, or any time of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thrilling masterpiece!,"John Carpenter's classic horror thriller with one of the most iconic horror film villains of all, Michael Myers. An absolute masterpiece to say the least, with plenty of scares and shocks for everyone, without having to be too gory as well.Starts out with a terrific music theme by John Carpenter himself, and begins on a perfect note. 8-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister on Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, and is sent to an institution. 15 years later, his doctor comes to take him to court to be executed. However, he escapes in a car and returns home, where he stalks a teenage babysitter named Laurie Strode, (Jamie Lee Curtis's first role). The doctor returns and teams up with the police sheriff to hunt him down.It really starts getting good when he starts stalking Laurie and her friends. Not being too gory or graphic, this film will still without a doubt scare the hell out of you, that is if your a beginning horror film watcher. It mostly depends on shocks and edgy stalking scenes.John Carpenter also devotes his love for horror films by having scenes of people watching such films as The Thing from Another World. The characters do get kind of stupid, pretending like nothing would happen and get themselves in easy to kill situations, like Laurie locking herself in a closet, hoping he's dumb enough not to check there. But with the seventies new slasher genre, you can't expect much. Its also eerie how Michael is referred to as the boogey man, which he kind of seems like.Its only a matter of time before a few more directors get together to make a crap load of sequels, and mock the crap out of the freaking movie. Whether unneeded or not, it could've been find with just this one. But no, they just had to make more. f**k that s**t!I recommend watching it. But don't waste your time watching the others like I made the mistake of doing. This is truly the only good one, so the others are just for nothing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Horror Film That Started It All!,"1978's Halloween is the definitive horror film. Without this classic, there wouldn't be the 80's slasher flicks we come to know and love today (or do we?). There would be no Nightmare on Elm Street. Genre films are important in today's cinematic world, but would they be if John Carpenter decided not to direct this little tiny horror film? This film went on to spawn endless amounts of sequels and reboots and they practically all failed quality-wise when compared to this film (although the 2018 sequel that ignored the previous movies was very good).Honestly, it amazes me how John Carpenter was able to create one of the scariest movies ever made. The movie was made on such a low budget, $300,000 to be exact. The movie ended up grossing 47 million dollars domestically and an additional 23 million worldwide thus making the movie the most successful independent movie of all time. The film was well-received when it first appeared onscreen. In fact, esteemed critic Roger Ebert placed the movie in this top ten films of 1978 and he is often a vocal critic of slasher films.The movie itself is very scary and it works just as well as a psychological thriller as a slasher movie. There is very little gore and hardly any blood, which absolutely surprised me. The majority of the violence takes place offscreen. It is a testament to the uncanny craftmanship of director/screenwriter/composer Carpenter, lead actress Jamie Lee Curtis, screenwriter Debra Hill, and among others to create a franchise that made Michael Myers a forever legend.I mentioned earlier that Halloween was a movie that popularized the genre, thus creating similar slasher films in the 1980's and beyond. Besides that, this movie made many horror movie tropes we see today popular. For example, this movie had the final girl trope, it made a daring movie killing off any characters with a hint of promiscuity or substance abuse, and also Carpenter had scenes showing murders from the killer's point of view. The whole opening sequence involving 6-year old Michael Myers killing his sexually active sister was shown through the little peephole eyes of Michael's costume. Perhaps the most important is the portrayal of women. Critics are vocal how later slasher films are misogynistic and they blame Halloween. Even so, women are given a more stronger stand in this movie and in later movies. Prior to this film, women were helpless people that were saved by the strong male character. Here, Jamie Lee Curtis was able to fend for herself mostly without the help of any male character.It's a cold night in Haddonfield, Illinois in the year 1963. Michael Myers, a 6-year-old boy, murdered his sister in cold blood. He was taken away to the Warren County Sanitarium and placed under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Dr. Loomis was able to see the pure evilness of Michael Myer's soul when no one else could. 15 years later, Michael escapes and Dr. Loomis witnesses the escape. Loomis heads to Haddonfield to warn the town because he knows that is where the villain is heading. Teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), and her friends may be the next victims of Michael Myers. Can they do anything to save themselves?The performances are excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis was an unknown at the time, although she happened to be the daughter of Janet Leigh, the star of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Hitchcock was one of Carpenter's idols when it came to the making of this movie. Anyhow, Curtis was a revelation and ultimately gave a convincing portrayal of a quiet, small-town girl turning into a badass warrior in a way. Donald Pleasance added veteran poise to the movie as the male hero, and he had some fantastic scenes and memorable lines of dialogue. His quote, ""I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil,"" may be the best quote of the movie as he describes what we are dealing with.Overall, Halloween is one of the best films of 1978 and it is the horror movie that set the ground for future horror/slasher films. The tropes we see in today's horror films were introduced in this film. The movie does not rely upon gore or blood as it more wants to play tricks with your brain. It's scary, visceral, and suspenseful. The acting, the direction, and music are what made this movie so good. The ever-famous score by Carpenter gave much suspense to the movie just like John Williams did with 1975's Jaws. Before Freddy Kreuger or Jason, we got Michael Myers. If you like horror films, this should be at the top of your list. If you do not like being scared, give this movie a pass.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
the music...,"i think most of this movie's rating is because of the great music, which should have won several prizes. Heck, i would watch this movie just to see the beginning theme! But it's not only that which makes this movie as good as it is, of course. It's actually the last horror film to be actually suspenseful. Think about it: all that came after ""Halloween"" were the friday movies and the halloween sequels, which were all pretty bad. This movie is certainly than the modern day horror films to which i am used to, but that doesn't take away i didn't like it! In fact, i think i liked it more than Scream, of which am the biggest fan. I saw this movie very recently for the first time, but i can understand that it was such a big success in 1978.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One Of The Most Overrated Movies Ever,"I really don't understand the hype around this movie. I will say its not as bad as some of the trash thats churned out today but at the same time i just don't know why this is considered an amazing movie. The characters are the most annoying stupid teenagers that are just 'totally' insufferable. There isn't much of a plot here either, just a masked man who was sectioned as a child for killing his sister comes back to randomly try to kill a girl that has nothing to do with him, how creative. The doctor guy was the only realistic character.The horror itself is ok, i'm glad its not heavily relying on jump-scares as much but its really not very scary. Your typical horror stuff. Doors shutting, a man hiding behind a bush, staring through a window. The kills weren't very realistic looking either. The music was good but they just used the same two tracks through the entire film so it got kind of comedic after a while.Maybe this was good at the time of release, but even then, you had Alien come out a year later which is my 2nd favourite film of all time. The Shining 2 years later and The Thing 4 years later which are phenomenal horror movies so it isn't just because Halloween is old. Its just not particularly well done in my opinion.

They don't make movies like this anymore!,"Halloween is one of the most influential Horror/Slasher movies ever made while there were certainly other influential horror movies that came before it such as Peeping Tom (1960) and Psycho (1960) which both greatly influenced this movie and many other horror movies but it was Halloween that started the Horror/Slasher movie craze that dominated the 1980s.Halloween is a genuinely creepy and unnerving movie from the very start when you first hear the now classic Halloween theme play during the movies opening credits watching as the camera slowly zooms in on the smiling lit pumpkin you feel a tingle down your spine from there the movie takes it time building tension. During every scene your attention is not focused on what's going on in the scene instead your eyes are drawn to the movies background seeking out the masked shaped figure who has been stalking our main characters as they are ""Totally!"" oblivious of what's to come we know what will happen it's fate but the fun is in the hunt not a jumpscare which is something modern day horror movies have yet to learn.The beauty of this movie is in it's soundtrack and the atmosphere it creates during key moments of the movie the sound of the sharp and low tones of the piano make the hairs on the back your neck stand up making you fear what maybe waiting in the dark.Halloween also introduced (Jamie Lee Curtis) who plays the main character Laurie who thanks to the massive success of Halloween Curtis made a name for herself and became the original scream queen for her role in Halloween and many other Horror/Slasher movies.Halloweens main star was veteran actor (Donald Pleasence) who played Doctor Samuel Loomis and who's performance is definitely the best part of the movie so much so that (Donald Pleasence) took part in four Halloween sequels and after Halloween II he became the only memorable thing about the sequels and the only reason anyone went to see them was because of his amazing performance as Doctor Loomis.Halloween was made by then unknown director and writers (John Carpenter) and (Debra Hill) and it wasn't common for such veteran actors like (Donald Pleasance) to take a role in such a low budget, independent movie but after reading the script and getting to know both Carpenter and Hill and seeing the unique vision they had for this movie he signed on and his part as character Doctor Samuel Loomis would become one of the most memorable of his career.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a horror/slasher movie fan and if by some miracle you haven't already seen this classic movie do yourself a favour and watch it if your of a new generation who hasn't seen the original Halloween movie yet I recommend watching it properly not just a casual viewing.As a quick side note I reviewed Halloween after watching the 35th Anniversary edition on Blu Ray which is a fairly decent transfer the lighting is a little better the sound is a little clearer other than that it's pretty much the same as the DVD version of the movie although the special features are decent and includes an over 50 minute featurete entitled ""The Night SHE! Came Home"" which follows Jamie Lee Curtis stepping back into the spotlight in horror movie conventions after many, many years an interesting watch also in the special features is footage that was included in the cut for TV edition of the movie which are nothing special but do give us a look at a young Michael Myers in Doctor Loomis care and a scene that shows Loomis meeting the hospital board trying to get Michael put away for life. Having never seen the TV cut version myself I liked that this additional footage was added as a bonus feature.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Halloween-A classic, but overrated","Halloween is one of the last in the ""classic seventies horror"" era before we went into the sequel-thon camp of the 80s and the toned down turmoil of the 90s...Now this movie is fairly entertaining. The story has already been explained tenfold so I won't bore you with the details. But some of the stuff in this movie is simply plain brillant. Firstly, the opening scene is pretty scary stuff with the Killer's POV and all [not Carpenter's invention but it was still a good idea to use for this scene]. Then 15 years later Mr. Michael Myers is all grown up and he's stalking three teen-age girls for some unknown reason. In hot pursuit, is Sam Loomis played by the great Donald Pleasence. Pleasence is hands down the best actor in this film but we also get good performances by Jamie Lee Curtis as virginal babysitter Laurie Strode and Nick Castle as the psychopathic maniac. The rest of the cast is actually quite decent with little to no bad acting. This movie is loaded with sex and nudity but surprising kept it low with the gore. Nowadays, it's the opposite. In my opinion, Blood in some scenes could've added to the atmosphere, such as the kitchen scene.Besides being a movie with good acting, a fair story, and great visuals/directing, it did have it's flaws. At times I found the dialogue between Laurie & CO. very BORING. Fans will say it was to develop the characters. Well there is a thin line between dialogue meant to develop the characters and dialogue meant to take up space. Halloween goes back and forth. And because of this, the film gets very slow between the 20 min-50 min mark. The first twenty minutes are a great set up and the last forty are pure brilliance, but the inbetween isn't anything special. Plus the movie's influence is heavily overrated. Halloween proved that slasher flicks were marketable, but did not invent them by any means. Not the best horror movie ever and it doesn't crack by top ten, but still a must-see for those with an serious interest in the genre.What's the Bogeyman?-Laurie Strode As a matter of fact...that was.-Sam Loomis",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

And has no interest.Psychological horror is about ""to suggest"". And keeps you guessing.With a low budget and almost no SFX all the suspense charge lies on pure cinematic means: camera and music.

An Undeniable Classic,"Fifteen years after killing his older sister, Michael Myers escapes from the asylum to wreak havoc on the town of Haddonfield, Illinois. At the same time, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) uses her time to babysit two youngsters and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) begins to hunt the madman. When the three collide, the you-know-what hits the fan.What do you say about a film that has been analyzed for over 25 years, praised by almost everyone and copied by some of the biggest people in the horror industry (although it is hard to be bigger than John Carpenter, really). Everything has been said, but I will try to say it again in my own words.This movie does everything right for the budget it was given and the time period it was filmed in. Mixing innovative new ideas with several homages to Alfred Hitchcock (not least of which is casting Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of ""Psycho""'s Janet Leigh). We have scenes that are much too dark to see what is going on, but set a very good mood. We have first-person perspective from the killer or from over the shoulder of the killer (an often imitated technique). But best of all, I liked how the film constantly built suspense without ever letting the viewer relax (you never knew when the killer would strike).A criticism could be that there is absolutely no gore in this film at all... maybe only a spoonful of blood. But somehow Carpenter does what others have failed to do and made the deaths such an inconsequential part of the killer genre. Unlike Freddy or Jason, who hack their victims in half, Michael can kill off-screen and still be menacing.I was a bit curious how scary a killer could be when he stalks his prey in a station wagon, because nothing says terror less than the soccer mom vehicle of choice. But it worked. Carpenter employed many distant angles, as if we were watching the prey from a distance, tracking them, closing in for a kill.I could complain that the women of this film were not attractive at all (especially the hermaphrodite Jamie Lee Curtis), but somehow it did not seem to matter. PJ Soles, who played Lynda, totally kept my interest as a victim. And I mean totally. The other girl, Annie, I could have done without. Writer and producer Debra Hill was allegedly ""unusually thin-skinned and defensive about the film's sexual side.""As much as I would like to give the best actor award to Nick Castle (who played Michael Myers and later became the director of the crappy ""Major Payne"" movie), no one would deny it to Donald Pleasance. Already a veteran actor, Pleasance is now pretty much known best as his role as Dr. Sam Loomis.After seeing the film a handful of times, I still notice new things. I think that is a testament to some of the subtleties of the film. That, or the theater version has scenes that were not on the home video, because I watched it on the big screen and heard lines I never recall hearing before...If you enjoy modern horror films, give this one a shot and see why it remains ""the most profitable independent film ever made."" Before Freddy and Jason, there was Michael Myers... and not the crappy Michael Myers from ""Halloween: H20"" or ""Halloween: Resurrection"", but a real ruthless killer from the 1970s. (Also, ""Halloween 2"" is alright, just do not bother wasting your time on the third part unless you want your brain scrambled.)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The Trick is the Scares, The Treat is The Film Itself","In 1978 John Carpenter introduced Michael Myers to the world in his mega-hit blockbuster ""Halloween"". Starring Donald Pleasance as the obsessed doctor hunting down psychopathic Michael Myers, the low-budget film immediately became one of the most successful films ever made and spawned seven sequels plus a remake, as well as countless knock-offs. With its introduction of modern day star Jamie Lee Curtis as well as appearances by legends Charles Cyphers and PJ Soles, ""Halloween"" landed a spot for itself as being a classic, and a well deserved title it is.The plot is standard and has been copied so many times that you would think the world would be tired of it, but the world will never be tired of the immortal ""Halloween"" story. It is about a man who murdered his teenage sister on Halloween night fifteen years ago, but who escapes his mental hospital and heads back to his home town where he stalks three teenage girls around the same age as his deceased sister relentlessly. Meanwhile, his obsessed doctor tries to track him down, understand him, and ultimately destroy him with the help of local police.""Halloween"" still has the power to scare people nearly thirty years after its initial release. It is one of the few slasher films that doesn't rely on gruesome deaths, such as ""Friday the 13th"", in order to deliver a shock. The stalking scenes involving the three teenage girls are unforgettable and realistic - making them all the more terrifying. John Carpenter truly mastered his camera-work to give us not only the point of view of the killer (earlier seen in ""Black Christmas"" and ""Jaws""), but to also give us truly eerie shots involving lighting as well.Unlike many of its imitators, ""Halloween"" will keep most everyone entertained while still having the power to scare you. It is not a film people will be turned off due to gore and blood (there is very, very little shown), however slasher fans will enjoy the thrills that the film has to offer (the last chase scene is the one that set the standard for all to come). If you are a slasher fan, this should be a no-brainer, but even if you find those particular films to be nothing but nonsense you should still check out John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" - its bound to give one good scare and the trick is that you'll find a treat is this nice American classic.""Halloween"" has had a lot of DVD editions due to its popularity, but the one that would most satisfy a fan would definitely be Anchor Bay's 25th Anniversary Edition, which features commentary tracts, radio spots, TV spots, a trailer, an 80-minute documentary, a re-visiting the sets tour, actor and director profiles, photo gallery, and more!

"A landmark of the slasher genre, always imitated but never equalled (not even the sequels)...","As if it personified its antagonists, the slasher genre has always targeted youth, seeking the kind of scares that give you a good excuse to grab your girlfriend while holding your pop-corn box. But just because it aims low doesn't mean that some seemingly B-movies shouldn't be put very high on the cinematic Pantheon.John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is one of them (and ""Friday the 13th"" is not).As a child of the 80s; I remember my father bringing some very gory and disturbing slashers, one that affected me was ""Maniac"" where I still remember that nurse escaping from the killer during a harrowing five-minute chase and getting stabbed to death once she started recovering and smiling frantically.. and then there were all these films with a mysterious murderer wondering in a neighborhood and whose chief target was women living alone. I have dark memories of such films and I guess their success was due to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and perhaps the earlier pioneers such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". But just because they owed their existence to masterpieces don't make them any closer to them.I have a feeling that ""Halloween"" has started a sort of sick trend whose whole purpose was to show innocent but rather cool-to-hate characters getting killed in the most possibly gruesome way and perhaps many viewers were titillated if not aroused by the damsel-in-distress trope and the point wasn't: ""will she escape?"" but ""how she'll be killed"". , The point has been intelligently raised by Ebert and Siskel during a 1980 Special you can find on Youtube. Both critics dismissed the new slasher films and their utmost disrespect for women and their cheap attempts to create an atmosphere where the viewer might actually root for the killer. This is where ""Halloween"" stands out, it it a slasher film that uses many tropes inherited from Hitchcock such as the villain's POV, the long tracking shot from the beginning inspired by ""Touch of Evil"" and that foreshadowed ""Scream"" with the helpless person stuck at home, phone calling, a few jump scares etc.... but what it did not is make us root for the killer but on the contrary, establishing the evil presence, one to be feared, not cheered at.Now, the purpose of a good horror film is to scare the hell out of you, to be as terrifying as you'd expect a comedy to be hilarious. But on that depends the amount of empathy invested on the protagonists, if not, it becomes pornographic appeal to some degree, the fact that many cheap flicks use beautiful women as victims shows that the point is indeed to degrade them. Carpenter, however, puts all his effects and efforts in the creation of an unsettling and eerie feeling whenever the shape and silhouette of Michael Meyers appears, of if his mere presence of Michael Myers is suggested. Just the way he moves, the way he breaths, the smallest detail, created one of the scarier villains of horror movies, scary for what it does, and what it doesn't yet... preying at the young baby sitters like a predator ... we have no motive either, only a flashback that establishes how dangerous he is and a long monologue from Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) to tell us that it means business and doesn't even deserve to be referred to as ""him"" or ""he"". Notice that I didn't.With such narrative ingredients and the artistry of Carpenter, you already have the premise of quite an experience. The cast does justice with to the story, a trio of young babysitters is played by Nancy Keyes, P. J. soles who was the wisecracking cap-wearing bully in ""Carrie"" and Laurie played by Jamie Lee Curtis is the perfect match as the nerdy bookworm, the less bratty and most gentle and reliable of the three and her reactions feel so authentic, her shocks and her screams so real that I would smell a psychopath in any viewer who'd wished she would get killed. It's very fitting that the daughter or Janet Leigh who had played in ""Psycho"" (another first-rate B-looking movie) starred in its spiritual successor, she's got that girl-next-door appeal combined with Big Sis bad-ass strength when the danger threatens little children (among them Kyle Richards whom I knew from ""The Housewives of Beverly Hills). Contrasts make for great conflicts and Laurie by being so vulnerable and yet strong is as human as one can get while Myers is an emotionless creature, with a bland mask and nothing remotely human about him... about it, sorry.Movies like ""Halloween"" were simply bound to be made, produced by the late Moustapha Akkad, on a shoestring budget of 300,000 dollars, it became the most successful independent film of all-time, without any marketing campaign (not the budget for it) just the power of word-of-mouth the trust that sometimes with one camera, a simple William Shatner mask, a score composed in two days by the director himself and a great deal of creativity, you can accomplish miracles. Perhaps the most auspicious sign of its success was that over the course of cinema's history, although horror movies had been prevalent since the 1930s, there were no movies using ""Halloween"" in their title. There was a blank to fill and Carpenter not only did it but set all the templates, making a landmark horror-film relying on the fear of having someone in your house and trying to figure out what to do at the heat of the moment.The film is surprisingly gore-less but that doesn't make it any less violent, it says a lot that the sequels and the franchises to come would rather depend on gore, imitating the original for the wrong reasons. ""Halloween"" is untouchable, efficient, and whose bone-chilling score is so effective I believe it's the best thing about it. And that says a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Impressively made low budget shocker,"John Carpenter's canny little exploitation film suffers some from its reputation; nothing makes a rickety shocker made on the cheap less potent than the complicated analysis of its characters' motivations.As a shock machine, it leaves no stone unturned; it comes across as an enthusiastic low-budget film whose maker had just seen a couple of Dario Argento movies (the comparison in some scenes, such as the eerily lit driving-in-the-rain sequence early on, is striking). Many of what would be determined as the slasher film's worst excesses are here, as in, for example the topless-girl-getting-strangled scene, but the main problems with the movie are its intrusive soundtrack (telegraphs more than its share of scares) and the fact that Carpenter goes to the well too many times with scenes where a group of people have a conversation, and a cut reveals the killer observing them, stripping this ploy of its effect early on. The Steadicam work was influential but somewhat amateurish. However, effective use of sets and lighting work wonders for increasing the on-screen tension.It isn't one of the great horror films of the 70's (its lack of anything but the crudest and most forced subtext makes it seem small-time in comparison to more challenging movies), but it's great for its genre, even if its phenomenal success helped doom the horror film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Beat of the Stalker's Gaze,"Even for one who isn't a fan of the slasher sub-genre, I appreciate something as well made as this progenitor, ""Halloween."" Director, co-writer and scorer John Carpenter and team pay homage to some of the right horror films to precede it, too, including playing ""The Thing from Another World"" (1951), which Carpenter would remake a few years later, and ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956) on the TVs--two other monster movies of seemingly unstoppable evil creatures. Moreover, there's the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis in the central role (even though the doctor standing in for the detective part receives top billing), the daughter of Janet Leigh, the star of ""Psycho"" (1960), which is often cited as the first slasher film. Like Bernard Herrmann's score for ""Psycho,"" Carpenter's one here has become one of the most iconic in horror film--or even general cinematic--history, and it's largely responsible for much of the picture's tension--beginning as the screen is black, even before the picture appears on screen.The role of the camera in conjunction with the monstrous Michael Myers is remarkable, too. Usually in film studies classes when the ""male gaze"" is discussed, including in Laura Mulvey's seminal essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,"" it's illustrated by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, although probably most often with ""Rear Window"" (1954) and ""Vertigo"" (1958), but ""Psycho"" would work about as well with the peeping-Tom antics of Norman Bates and, perhaps, ""Halloween"" would be even better. Cinema is a voyeuristic art form, primarily concerned with the spectator's gaze upon its visuals, which consequently rely for their effect on the spectator's identification with the surrogate gaze of the camera, which in turn may be identified with the gaze of a certain character--in this case, mostly with the knife-wielding serial killer, Myers. Indeed, he's merely acting out what we voyeuristically came to the film to see: him terrifying and killing people. In the opening scene, the camera and the eyes of Myers are one in the form of an extended point-of-view shot. From there, he continues to stalk his prey--sharing with us the pleasure of watching them. Meanwhile, his face is mostly covered by a mask, which like the spectator, prevents the gaze of other characters upon him and, likewise, us.Mulvey and her followers get into a lot of Freudian psychobabble, but there's undeniably a psycho-sexual element to the gaze of Myers. There's the by-now cliché plot of his killing promiscuous, mostly female teens--all of which seems to stem back to his simultaneous incestuous desire for and repulsion of his sister. I'm sure any Freudian would also say that the knife is a phallic object, penetrating the victims. Then, there's the virginal heroine, with the story spending quite a bit of time on establishing this fact, who, nonetheless, seems to be paying for the sins of her mother's character in ""Psycho."" More interesting than that, though, methinks, is the playing around with the thrill of voyeurism, via the gaze of Myers, while also experiencing the unease of being gazed upon, which is mostly associated with the Laurie character played by Curtis. One effect to come from these switches from identification with Michael to that of Laurie is the jump scare. If little else, subsequent slasher filmmakers grasped the effectiveness of this trick and, perhaps, too much so. But, it's effective here because it occupies that space between the pleasure and horror of the gaze, all of which is underscored by the terrific beat.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent, but a bit slow at times",The first movie that paved the way for many sequels. The acting is actually good to be a bunch of teenagers. Jamie Lee Curtis acts like an adult rather than a teenager. Nick Castle plays the serial killer Michael well. Donald Pleasance shines in the movie as well.Two of the things that I didn't like about it was that it seemed slow at times. Two out of the four kills are pretty tame. While I wasn't expecting a decapitation it would have better than just strangling. Maybe the girls that Michael strangled he could have slit their throats instead.  Its a good movie with a great suspenseful ending.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My brothers keeper (not),"So watching this again after a long time (it was a double bill with the new Halloween from 2018) refresehed my memory in a good way. First of all the movie really aged well. I was a bit surprised about the nudity and all the teenage talk in general, but most of all I was surprised to see that Jamie Lee's character was or rather is not the sister of the killer.That is clear pretty early on in the movie and something that would ""change"" in the sequels. Now having that out of the way and a very violent POV beginning, this really stirs things up. The original music that is so famous, even people who haven't seen the movie know it, is giving viewers a chill. And while the hairdos actually may be the one thing that has aged, the performances are really good. This is a classic for a reason, even if it may have the occasional flaw",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Disappointing Revisit,"I hadn't seen this film in over twenty-five years, so I decided to give it another look. I remember going to the movies as a teenager to see this film and being scared to death, so I was looking forward to seeing it again. I can only say I was sorely disappointed. The film I thought was basically an inferior remake of ""Black Christmas"" (1974) with Olivia Hussey, which was a film Carpenter was obviously familiar with, and I feel he copied many film techniques and plot lines from. The fact that Carpenter has never repeated this success speaks volumes to me as his skill as a director. Carpenter is an excellent mimic but not an original.",,Anonymous,Horror
Great!,"A young Michael kills his sister. Now, fifteen years later, he's escaped from a mental hospital... and he's coming home.This film undoubtedly kick-started the ""slasher"" trend as we know it to be today. It was relatively low budget and proved to be rather successful with minimal advertising.This is a slow-burn horror movie. It doesn't rely heavily on the number of people killed, nor are you watching the movie to root for the bad guy. This, quite simply, is what horror should be. There's been no demystification of the villain, so you're not rooting for the character, and there's a degree of fear when contemplating the character.This film - perhaps as a result of desensitization, which is always an issue with horror movies - doesn't pack the punch it may once have offered, but it's not hard to see what made this movie so effective and scary back in the day. The low budget filmmaking made it a more frightening experience and, perhaps, continues to this day with the imperfections in the digital transfer from 35mm film.It's a certified horror classic and, despite its flaws, is well worth its place in horror history.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic horror fun.,"While a typical slasher film at its core, John Carpenter's 'Halloween' remains one of the most important horror movies ever made, and a worthy watch all these years later.Some aspects of the movie don't hold up the best, which is expected of a film like this. Some of the dialogue feels sketchy, the over-use of the word 'totally' gets on my nerves, all of the teenage-love affairs feel extremely of-their-time and the special effects are, naturally, rather outdated. This said, I think 'Halloween' excels in many ways that modern horror movies could only dream of.Most notably, the movie sustains a notable atmosphere of intense dread for a lot of its runtime. Where the movie really works for me is in all of the drawn-out and tense shots that seem to go on forever. The best example of this is the opening tracking shot, which is, for me, an easy highlight of the film. Michael Myers is iconic, and so is the phenomenal score. When you really think about it, a lot of the tropes that have now become overused in slasher movies originated from this one. Its impact on the horror film industry cannot be overstated and it's a must-watch for that reason alone.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I understand now why they called it a classic.,"I'm not really into slashers so much these days but this stands out as an admirable, archetypal tale of raw fear that I sort of wish I'd seen a long time ago.They invest a lot in build up, in believable characters and giving us only glimpses of our antagonist who is somehow at once unhuman and all too human.There is macabre from the first seen but the whole thing slow boils with characters unaware of exactly how much danger they're actually in until it might just be too late. Michael is special. You never really know what he is. He commands a quite, nondescript power.Jamie Lee Curtis as the inoffensive teenage babysitter makes a heroine you really want to root for (more or less).The whole thing just oozes off the screen. The idea of the masked killer escaping from an institution may seem a bit hokey now but this movie makes it possible to remember why this was such a great concept for horror once upon a time. One day another human decided to end lives. We are all mortal and it could happen to any one of us. Not that ""it could really happen"" is ever valid praise for a review the *purity* for lack of a better word is the movie's greatest charm.That '80s synth, the low key cinematography, the incidental dialogue, the cute festive rituals, it could never be recreated now.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Halloween: 7/10,"I saw Halloween in a theater a few days ago. The opening gave me high hopes for the film, but what followed (and I'm being serious) got more laughs than screams out of the audience.There was good to it. John Carpenter's soundtrack has the same effect as films like ""Jaws"", and ""Halloween"" wouldn't be half as scary without it. Also, there were good acting performances by Pleasence, Curtis, and whoever acted Mike Myers, but pretty disappointingly, good deal of the acting was pretty bad.The film, as some say, slowly builds tension. And I agree. There are time where Carpenter build tension up, but there is a line between building tension and just being slow paced, and It felt like ""Halloween"" crossed that line several times.Now let's talk about the script. It has pretty much every slasher film trope, cliche, and stereotype in the book. Characters that make illogical decisions, or doors being inconveniently locked for no reason, or random teen sex, or cars not starting, or a seemingly invincible killer. It just felt very cliche at times.I still liked it though, and there were times in the film that scared the piss out of me. I think Carpenter, overall, did a pretty good job with this movie. 7/10.Also, everything stated in this review is just my opinion, and it's completely fine if you disagree with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Landmark of Horror Cinema!,"Halloween is a remarkable horror film but this in largely down to Carpenter's wonderful ability in building up and creating suspense. Using the POV approach, and a chill-inducing score whenever Michael Myers appears, Carpenter certainly does an effective job of immediately drawing the viewer into the proceedings. But it's the unconventional way of anticipation is the most terrifying thing about the movie.I loved how Carpenter keeps us hooked for most of the movie (the first hour) just by making us waiting for Myers to strike, and yet nothing happens till the third act. That really made the movie an unsettling and unnerving experience, but also so captivating; my eyes was glued to the screen, TOTALLY!Leaving us hanging for nearly an hour before Myers begins killing was a difficult challenge, and Carpenter just knocked it out of the park in terms of keeping me enthralled and riveted. That said, the slow-burning narrative and sinister atmosphere weren't enough to make this movie scary for me. Usually, I don't blame the movie for not scaring me when I find there are many things that the movie got right, such as the use of jump scares, simply because I don't get scared from horror movies at all! But I get nervous quite a lot when I watch decent horror flicks, and that didn't happen to me until the last, say, 15-20 minutes of the movie.Another issue I have with this movie is everything about Donald Pleasance's character. Besides Pleasance's stilted performance, his character's presence along with the Sheriff don't seem to be necessary, and I felt that there would have been no much difference if both Sheriff and Doctor were cut from the film. I found Loomis is just an expository tool that also hasn't been utilized well.The characters, in general, aren't smarter than those in other slasher horror movies. Case in point, Thomas Doyle who I would only believe his actions if he was 3 or 4 years old! Not to mention, Brian Andrews's performance that was really bad. The character and the performance are the exact opposite of Danny in Kubrick's The Shining!Needless to say, Jamie Lee Curtis's performance as Laurie is simply stellar. The same goes for the rest of the cast regardless of those who I've mentioned above.I also didn't like that Myers was depicted as superhuman. I don't know whether the sequels justified that or not, but this definitely didn't work for me. However, I liked so much how Myers looks, and how we didn't see his face as much as we hear him breathing under his mask from a first person POV.For all its flaws, Halloween will remain a landmark of slasher horror cinema, simply because it has set the standards for horror films in general. Standards that slasher movies have never surpassed to date.(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Halloween,"I really enjoyed seeing this on the big screen again, 40-odd years after John Carpenter introduced us to his brand of slasher-horror with Jamie Lee Curtis great as the flighty young girl ""Laurie"" who finds herself caught up in the revenge antics of the faceless ""Michael Myers"" that perhaps only Donald Pleasence (""Loomis"") can save her from. The pace and tension build really well - helped by some good use of sound and light (I didn't much care for the over-synthesised score), the supporting screams from PJ Soles and Nancy Kyes and the occasional intervention from Pleasence. The sequels never reached the heights of this, original psychological horror - there are precious few special effect to laugh at or even speak of, really - and if you get a chance to catch up with it as intended on 35mm then you should certainly give it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror masterpiece,"One of the best horror films of all time. None of the sequels or imitators even come close. Halloween is a true work of art from Carpenter. His long, uninterupted shots adding to the foreboding sense of dread. The soundtrack is utter perfection and likely the single best film soundtrack of all time. So many of the sequels failed to understand why the original was so effective. Myers is ""The Shape"", he shouldnt have a back story or a motive. He is a force of nature, like a hurricane coming into town every Halloween and wiping everyone out without rhyme or reason. This is something that all sequels (except the great 2018 sequel) failed to recognize. He is not a man. Donald Pleasance is fantastic and Jamie Lee Curtis just nails it in her first major role.

Pumpkin busted by Boogeyman. The contribution of this film to setting the slasher genre across the globe is certainly big,"Halloween (1978) :
Brief Review -Pumpkin busted by Boogeyman. The contribution of this film to setting the slasher genre across the globe is certainly big. The slasher genre will forever be grateful to Halloween (1978). Unlike Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and Clark's ""Black Christmas"" (1974), this one is more curved towards slasher genre material and does not follow the traditional themes like suspense and mystery. We know who the killer is, and we don't need to go mystical about it. From the very first scene, we know that he is a mental patient and is on a killing spree on one fine Halloween night. That's the story they have, and you don't need any brainstorming to understand it, like ""Psycho."" This is actually more like an original slasher film, and no matter how long and how boring the franchise got later, the first one keeps its place intact as a trend-setter and as an influential slasher flick. So, Halloween is about a boy who kills his sister in childhood on a Halloween night and is sent to a mental hospital. Years later, he escapes and enters the town on one dark Halloween night to kill more people. As the boy calls him Boogeyman, we can surely feel the scare. The mask is frightening. The graphical presentation is mostly set in the dark, and that's why it creates that atmospheric impact. You don't need to watch ""The Thing"" on TV for that, as this film sets the mood right with its terrific use of background score and cinematography. In one scene, we get to see the face of the killer, and gosh, how terrifying it was. That's how you set footprints through your filmmaking so that others can follow them after years. The performances were fine, and those two sexy chicks were stimulating. John Carpenter transforms a gripping thriller into a modern slasher genre that deserves to be hailed as one of the best and most influential films ever. That ""thing"" just didn't die at all. Bullets, knives, fall-nothing worked. How??!!RATING - 7.5/10*Bh - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A classic, genre defining. Timeless it still frightens after almost three decades.","""Halloween"" is by far the most genre defining classic horror film of the modern age. I first saw the film probably in the mid 80's when I was still young, this is a special film to me for two reasons one it was released in 1978 the year I was born, and second it was one of the first horror films I saw. Good story here for a horror film, you have Michael Myers escaped mental patient who after being away for years, returns home to his Midwestern town on Halloween night to terrorize the town as a psychotic murderer. This time Michael focuses his attention mostly on young teenage girls, a hobby he still remembers from the murder of his sister years ago. This film introduces us to scream-queen and later Hollywood legend Jamie Lee Curtis who is terrific as baby sitter Laurie Strode, one of the few that gets to stay alive! Donald Pleasence is great as the determined but yet worried Dr. Loomis who tracks Michael's every move! Also John Carpenter must be given most of the credit for the way he directed this film with the camera angles, and his use of dark shadows and the way he hides Michael Myers around corners, it's what you can't see that frightens, then no look out he comes out of the darkness! Most of the music and the score of the film is great, probably one of the best for a horror film. The score is pulsating from start to finish which was done by John Carpenter himself this music just gets under your skin. Watching this film thru the years it was finally good to get the 25th anniversary edition on DVD, the special features disc is good with information many didn't know. You find things out like the film was done in California even though portrayed in Illinois, plus Carpenter's father was music department director at Western Kentucky University, and finally just how cheap the Michael Myers mask cost! John Carpenter changed the shape of terror forever believe me this is why many young girls will not baby sit today! Also many horror films have tried to mimic this but have failed, this is simply and always will be the granddaddy of horror flicks of the modern day, a timeless classic that will never get old.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The founder of the 'Slasher' genre,"As a Gen-Xer (whatever the hell that means) I spent most of my summers from age 10 to age 19 watching slasher films, as this was the only genre of movie that directly targeted people of my demographic.  As I the genre moved on (I do not say 'evolved') I wearied of it, and as an adult I can see some real problems with the core conventions of it.  However, being stubborn, I cannot bring myself to simply dismiss the films out of hand (well, definitely some of them).  I refuse to believe that I wasted all those hours doing something that is inherently stupid, or wrong-headed.  Thus, as an academic, I decided to 'study' them... now I can legitimate my vices by using big words like 'semiotics' and 'cultural signifiers.'  This makes me happy, and allows me to conveniently sidestep hypocrisy. ;)With that introduction, I would like to point out that John Carpenter's Halloween is actually a pretty decent movie.  It brought together several disparate genres and conventions and melded them into one interesting (and highly marketable) genre.  The original Halloween is much like the original Jaws and should be viewed independently of its many, sub-par sequels (although, of all the sequential horror films, this one was probably the best... not particularly high praise).The wonderful thing about Carpenter, is that he can do things that would make another director look foolish, and pull them off.  His soundtrack is LAME...  but for some odd reason it works really, really well and has become the cornerstone for horror movie soundtracks.Carpenter's rampant homages to other directors and other films throughout Halloween are both fun and give us a certain insight into the character of his film-making.However, the most interesting thing that he does, the most innovative and groundbreaking thing, is his use of the 'killer's eye camera', Carpenter claimed that this was simply a device to mask the identity of the killer, but that is patently stupid.  This camera perspective identifies the audience with the killer and creates a wierd sort of relationship between audience and action.  I find this to be at once disconcerting and again brilliant.  Carpenter really creates a mood and an attitude for this film that would be copied again and again.Although the film is relatively shallow in the characterization/story department, it does manage to establish (or re-establish) the conventions of the horror genre, but also lays out the essential archetype of the slasher film.  I love this stuff.  Carpenter was either lucky or a visionary, or perhaps a bit of both.Even 20 years after this film was originally made, and after countless viewings, there are still scenes that are surprisingly frightening: the scene in the laundry room, Myers rising from the floor behind Laurie, the confrontation in the closet with the weird lighting through slats.The one thing that Carpenter really accomplishes is the feeling of isolation.  He manages to make you feel completely isolated while living in a suburban neighborhood.  You realize that even though these characters cannot be more than a few hundred feet from another person, and have phones and radios and TVs, they are still completely vulnerable to the killer. Halloween did for suburbia what Jaws did for the ocean, made you realize that you were vulnerable in a place that you wouldn't have believed. Truly an astounding feat.This film is quite simply brilliant.  now I am not praising it too highly. Let's face facts, it was a low-budget monster movie, with lousy special effects, a relatively lame story, a terrible soundtrack (synthesized keyboards, come on ;) and some truly bad acting (although Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis did quite well for themselves).  However, with all this going against it, you really can't take your eyes of the movie.  It has become a cultural icon (and rightly so) and has generated countless rip-offs.  I can only say that Carpenter possesses a kind of magic that is impressive (well, usually).  This film is a must-see for any aspiring, low-budget film-maker, anyone who likes to be scared, and anyone that has a real passion for interesting cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Purely and simply EVIL!,"While today it might be hard to see the impact John Carpenter's Halloween did because of everything thats came after, it's sheer terror and suspense is why it's still remembered. There were films before this that could be identified as slashers such as Psycho and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But unlike those films where the victims come to the horror, here the horror comes to them. With the help of cinematographer Dean Cundy Carpenter crafts Haddonfield Illinois as an authentic quiet small town that seems peaceful during the day but haunting at night with tall shadows consuming every dark corner in sight. These Shadows help hide the looming presence that is Michael Myers. With the white blank emotion of his mask, method of picking and choosing when to go in for the kill, as well as Carpenter's now recognizable eerie score, makes this local boogeyman a terrifying force of nature. And it doesn't help that it's also Halloween night where hardly anyone will take it seriously.His choice of prey is babysitter Laurie Strode, the original final girl. Although we've had many more fleshed out Scream Queens after it's likely every single one of them took a page out of Laurie Strode's book & Jamie Lee Curtis's now iconic performance. Along for the hunt is Dr Samuel Loomis played by the legendary Donald Pleasence. His determination to capture his patient mirrors that of Van Helsing to Dracula. I still get chills everytime he monologues about Michael being simply pure evil & he convinces you to believe every word of it.The film's only shortcomings for me are some weak and excessive dialogue exchanges, particularly from the character Lynda. Ive thought about doing a drinking game every time she says ""Totally"" but it's likely to be fatal. Still Halloween is and always will be a quintessential classic and next to Black Christmas Kickstarted the slasher genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is incredibly nostalgic, especially to a Halloween holiday season loving human, and carries significant emotional weight for a really memorable experience.I miss many of my life's moments surrounding when I would watch this movie.

A film that would be thrilling for its time but fails now.,"Finally got a chance to watch John Carpenter's 'Halloween.' After hearing so much hype about it, I was disappointed to say the least. A film lacking a terrifying and well developed villain, Michael Myers is there to kill, but we don't have any reason to be scared of him, falling back on the only evidence that he killed his sister years ago. Compared to the horrific character of Freddy Kruger, who we immediately fear from the fact that he can kill you in your dreams, Michael Myers failed to capture my imagination and did not frighten me at all.Now I get to the film's characters, Jamie Lee Curtis plays the good stereotypical girl who is the last man, or in this case woman, standing. But with her lack of character development, knowing only simple things such as she goes to school and is a baby sitter, I failed to grasp her as a true human being. She needed a back story, she had none and the reason why Michael Myers is going after her remains vague (of course it is revealed in the sequel that SPOILER, Michael Myers is Laurie's brother. If we had known that she was adopted from the start, throw in a couple of subtle hints of the connection between Laurie and Michael then I may have been able to connect to her character. Alas she had no impact on me as a character.With all the scenes of the film, it was utterly filled with irrelevance and, what appeared to me, slapstick comedy. Every time Michael Myers was seen across the street, around the corner, in his car, staring at Laurie and her friends, it didn't come off as terrifying, it came off as silly. The music cued every time we see Michael standing tall just adds to the hilarity of what should be frightening scenes. Also, a lot of the first hour of the film is filled with boring and not very necessary scenes filled with pointless chatter about sex, school and babysitting when it should have been filled with back story, reasons they should be killed or reasons they shouldn't. Ultimately I think the film succeeds as a horror film for when it was released in 1978, but watching it now in 2014, as a 19 year old (and keep in mind a huge horror fan as well as film fanatic) it just utterly fails to impress me like A Nightmare in Elm Street and Fright Night did.In the end, this is my opinion, people who were around in the 1970s will enjoy this film, but for those who only get truly frightened by horror films such as Insidious and The Conjuring (Yes I believe James Wan is the NEW horror Master) then you will only laugh at this film.Verdict 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Iconic Horror Flick has some flaws, but still remains enjoyable","John Carpenter's iconic slasher flick certainly has moments that don't hold up today, however, due to his fantastic score and directing skills- this film still remains one of the most essential horror flicks of all time. I'll start with the flaws. Besides leads Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, the actors in the film are quite mediocre, and even at times funny by how bad their acting is. It not only shows they are not good actors, but seems too obvious that they are nearly incapable of doing so. Some of the dialogue is a bit off, some of which could also apply to the mediocre actors themselves. Although the film may not get into the real action of what you thought it may be until the last third, Halloween does prove to be a rather suspenseful, frightening, and atmospheric little flick. Carpenter's score truly propels the film to greatness, by causing tension at every turn, and its cinematography is also a delight, proving to be grounded while also remaining nostalgic and beautiful today. In the end, Halloween doesn't hold up as well as some may claim it does, but it still proves to be a decent and interesting watch for any horror fans to enjoy.My Rating: 7.7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The scariest night of the year.,"The scariest night of the year! While most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, Michael Myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers. Besides the setting, there is some great acting. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date. However, it is Donald Pleasance, as Dr. Sam Loomis, who really steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of Michael Myers and feels compelled to send him to Hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend. However, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film. Once you hear it, you will never forget it.The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.The technical aspects are skilfully executed, and every dollar of its low budget is efficiently used in service of the story. Setting the plot in a suburban location turns the very openness of the area into a playground of mayhem. Cinematography is inventive for the camera stalks our characters at all times, benefits from some ingenious placements, and is further uplifted by clever lighting while Editing makes sure that the suspenseful ambiance is kept alive from start to finish.On an overall scale, Halloween remains one of the genre-defining films of the 1970s whose narrative structure has been adopted as a blueprint for slasher films ever since and its vast influence on cinema & pop culture cannot be downplayed. There were a couple of moments that bothered me but for the most part, this is a thrilling, entertaining & satisfying ride from Carpenter that is every bit worthy of its legendary status. A lesson in horror filmmaking that downplays the elements of gore & graphic violence to show the lasting effect a consistently maintained tense ambiance can have on the viewers, Halloween is the very definition of a slasher film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The classic that start it all,"On an eerie night, a child slashes to death his own sister. That boy, Michael Myers, than became the living legend of terror, return to the 20 year later, to kill his other sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee-Curtis). Laurie survived that night. But Michael is unstoppable then.Halloween is the first that came out in the slasher genre, and on that time, Halloween was surprisingly good, an independent movie that carried a new dimension of terror (and many of copycat, of course).Jamie Lee-Curtis is the original Scream Queen. All my salute to her. In general this movie is fairly entertaining, but don't expect too much for the viewers of posh Scream era, because it's a bit lame. Anyway, thanks to Halloween, and John Carpenter, now we have another variant in the horror genre.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"An Edge of Your Seat Horror that Set the Standard for all Scary Movies,","Halloween is a great movie with a well developed plot and a great cast. It is a top notch horror that kept me at the edge of my seat from start to finish. It had an excellent use of music that perfectly builds up the tension and suspense, it never rushes the plot, allowing the audience to feel fear long before anything ever happens.The only thing that really bothered me was that you knew when every death was coming from a mile away. There were no surprises, no characters who I thought would live ended up dying and no characters that I thought would die ended up surviving, it was all very expected.The films two main stars, Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance, are excellent in their roles. Curtis takes on a very strong female lead and provides several traits to make her character unique. Meanwhile, Pleasance classes up the joint with his experienced acting, it really is a pleasure to watch this man perform and naturally slip in to every role.It may have set the standards for today's horror films, but it is better than most of them, it maintains a structure throughout that works and remains thrilling, unlike most that get boring and predictable after awhile. Thrilling and suspenseful, Halloween is a very enjoyable film that I would certainly recommend to all fans of horror.After escaping from an asylum, maniac Michael Myers haunts the streets he use to live on during Halloween night.Best Performance: Donald Pleasance / Worst Performance: Brian Andrews",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Transcending independent cinema.,"Now Halloween (1978) isn't a perfect film. In fact it really does have a lot of problems. For one the acting is at times just plain bad, the story has more than a few cheesy turns and of course round and about every horror trope can be found here. Okay so I was joking about that last one. I know very well that Halloween helped create these tropes to begin with.As i got to mentioning a little just now, this film is indeed incredibly influential and a true classic of the 70s. The slasher genre would undoubtedly not be what it is today, without this here film. So ingenuity is one-hundred percent not missing here.There might be quite a few issues to be had with the movie, but to be completely honest I really don't care that much. This film has an incredibly large ammount of charm and the way the cast and crew worked around their budgetary issues via for example painting pieces of paper, so they look like leaves, is just so inspiring. Another example is how they used a Star Trek mask for the now world famous mask used within the film. These are just a few instances of exactly what I find so inspiring when it comes to filmmaking. In other words the love and care is for us all to see here, and I love that.Anyway let's stop beating around the bush. The score that Carpenter created for this film is among the ten most iconic scores ever composed. It is not only memorable, but also incredibly stimulating and haunting. A perhaps lesser talked about aspect of this film is the expert cinematography, which helps immensly to create the thick, dark atmosphere the film has.If Halloween it came out today, I might not be as leniant toward it, but I mean it came out in 1978 which all things considered is pretty damn impressive. I really like this film and I honestly really miss these incredible 70-80s horror films that defined the genre.7+/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Before Friday 13th, before Prom Night, there was 'Halloween'","The original Halloween, a very creepy and tense horror movie that rebooted the slasher franchise, ranks high in the horror system, appreciated for it's originality and starting the 80s slashers (Friday 13th, A nightmare on elm street SEQUELS). Although it takes its time in moving forward, and some people may find it boring, John Carpenter's 'Halloween' sends chills down the viewer's spine, with the eerie imagery and tense scenes. The shape, Michael Myers, has remained as one of the biggest horror characters in history. Halloween portrays the terrifying feeling of being stalked by a complete stranger, and it's climax will without a doubt get you hooked onto the entire franchise. Unfortunately, not one of the sequels has matched the original, although some have come close (Halloween 2).All I can say is that if you are thinking about watching this movie, I would definitely recommend it, and my word of advise when you are viewing it is: be patient. It may be a slow burner, but when it gets going, Halloween matches A nightmare on elm street level creepiness.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best Performance of Donald Plesance,"Halloween was about a child sociopath who murdered his sister at six years of age, and is released back into society after fifteen years of unsuccessful psychiatric treatment.Jamie Lee Curtis was very good playing the killer's sister.

I love the other scenes when Lori Strode and Tommy Doyle are watching ""The Thing"" and ""Forbidden Planet,"" unaware of the danger. It's a tongue in cheek homage to the other horror films as well as a clever way to build tension.""Halloween"" is more interesting than ""The Thing.""

An Outdated Masterpiece,"So I love horror and so I ended up watching the Halloween series, The first movie I ever saw from this franchise was Halloween Resurrection and at the time I thought it was awesome as a kid but now I can see it's laughably bad. I finally got round to see the original and even though the movie itself has not aged very well I was blown away to say the least.This movie was made on a small budget of $300,000 and ended up being a huge success. It is recognised as the movie that kicked off the slasher genre, as well as inspiring a ton of slasher movies and icons that never quite got the same recognition. The plot was very simple yet so sinister as we rarely got these types of movies at the time of its release, People being stalked and killed by a unknown serial killer and it was effective due to its realistic nature.The acting comes across as quite cheesy at times but that is down to the movie being released in the 70's, for its time it was probably considered Oscar worthy. The cinematography is well done putting the lightning to good use and overall giving the film eerie vibes. The score is amazing, the music is always occurring at the right moment and it is one of the most recognisable soundtracks in cinema history.The suspense of this movie is where the talent truly shines. Tracking shots from the killers POV has you on edge of your seat, the movie is a slow burn for the first 50 minutes relying on intense build up and the final 30-40 minutes is non-stop horror, thrills and scares. The movie also introduces favourite horror trope such as the final girl and the killer hiding in the back seat.Overall, even if you are not a fan of the horror genre this is definitely a movie you should watch and not miss. I give this movie a 9/10 and would rate it higher if it wasn't for the fact the movie seems too aged.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good fright flick,"For the past twenty years, the horror genre has been in a quagmire of extreme disrepute. Since the early 1980's, there have been a seemingly endless number of slasher movies, the vast majority of which were nearly unwatchable exercises in nihilistic gore. It seemed as if the directors have forgotten what a good scare truly is, or have never known it. Nonetheless, there are a handful of good efforts that stand out from the mire. One of them is John Carpenter's ""Halloween.""It's a rare animal indeed, one of the few horror films to receive positive reviews from professional film critics. Time has been kind to it; ""Halloween"" still holds up nearly a quarter-century later. The basic plot is nothing special; in terms of structure, it's very much the same as any other slasher. What makes it different? Simply put, the level of skill that was invested in it elevates the material. This movie's no hack job; it's clear that for once, the filmmakers actually put some time and effort into crafting a good, scary movie.The object of the film is not to show an excessive quantity of gore, but to frighten the viewer. The film succeeds in doing just that, establishing an atmosphere of dread. Even when it's light out, you are keenly aware that no one is truly safe. The gore factor is practically nonexistent, but the human imagination is capable of imagining things that are much worse than can be visibly portrayed. The director usually acts as composer for most of his films; this project has yielded his best work in that area. The ""Halloween theme"" is simple, yet elegant and chilling, resonating in the mind long after the credits have rolled.Another noticeable quality is the fact that its teenage characters are not nearly as annoying as they came to be in most of its clones. They may not be model citizens, but they come across as realistic human beings for once. The solid performance of Jamie Lee Curtis helps to make the proceedings more credible, its effect is to put the audience in her shoes instead of making us root for the killer.Do I consider ""Halloween"" a masterpiece? No, I personally feel that the film is somewhat overrated by horror fans. However, no one can dispute that it is one of the most influential genre films ever. Donald Pleasance does a fine job in the lead, lending a gravity and reality to the situation that it otherwise may not have had. When he says that Michael Myers is not quite human, we believe him. Subsequent installments may have linked him to the occult, but even without a supernatural explanation, we just *know* there's something otherworldly about him.*** (out of ****)Released by Compass International Pictures",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Horror Moive everyone must see!,"Halloween is exactly what you hope to see! I watched it today for the first time and I was surprised that it was actually very good!Expecting screaming, over the top and poor acting and stupid script, Halloween turned out to be a bit of that, but only to the extent that you get what you want. The acting by some of the teenagers are very stocky and almost like ""Now it's my line..."", ""...and now it's my line"" etc. and a lot of the stuff gets no explanation, but now more than 40 years after Halloween premiered this works to its favor.The music is excellent and has a theme that is recognizable. Jamie Lee Curtis does a fantastic role as the Main Character and since she's only 19 years old in this her first ever movie she is very good! The Villain Michael Myers is a creepy stalker and never talks which builds the mystery of his character. The suspense is of course really well done and I like how they work with the psychological aspects more than jump scares or the actual slashing - Well done!Halloween is a perfect example of how less is more and is today a cozy horror movie with a classic feel that delivers exactly what you want.

A horror classic marred only by poor acting and frustrating plot devices,"It goes without saying that this 1978 John Carpenter classic helped pioneer the stalker-horror sub-genre that has served as an inspiration to such films as the 'Friday the 13th' and 'Scream' franchises. Unfortunately, it also helped inspire a sleuth of unworthy sequels and a Rob Zombie remake that should probably never have happened.The brilliance of John Carpenter really shines through in this movie as he creates an uncomfortable bond between Myers and the audience itself by making them FEEL that he is there alongside them, watching the protagonist and her friends just as they are in meta-theatrical genius.In such a way, there is much to be praised in the film's execution as well as the portrayal of the silent killer archetype. However, the film contains two striking shortcomings, rendered even more astounding due to Carpenter's otherwise flawless record. The first is Jamie Lee Curtis' poor and sometimes irritating acting which almost makes you want to watch the film in mute during the second half of the film. The second shortcoming pertains to the very conveniently-placed plot devices which either defy logic or beg for an explanation.As a whole, this is a 'must-see' for every horror and suspense fan, but prepare yourself for a few head-scratching moments along the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Supernatural suspense drama...,"I'm not here to toot my own horn (my neck isn't long enough), but, if you look real close, I think you'll find that Yours Truly was the first person in this country to praise HALLOWEEN in print (way back in Famous Monsters of Filmland #155, I believe it was). I felt then (and still feel today) that it's one of the finest supernatural suspense dramas ever lensed. The premise is simple but effective and John Carpenter, by focusing closely on his cast of characters, manages to evoke edge-of-your-seat suspense from beginning to end (it helps that his characters are believable, and sympathetic); his chilling score only serves to (quite literally) underscore that effectiveness. The HALLOWEEN ""formula"" is relatively simple: put sympathetic, well-drawn characters in jeopardy, and you're halfway home (something the makers of the plethora of slasher films that followed in its wake didn't seem to be capable of doing). HALLOWEEN has been ripped off more than any other film I know of, but remains the unequaled original.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Second, the cinematography is fantastic. The movie is lit in a brilliant way and through the imagery a sense of fear is projected directly on the screen. Last, but not least the score is amazing. The simple notes create anxiety and sometimes even sheer fear. Yes, the story is very thin, but it is still very cleverly made and it just works - without blood and gore. The acting is sufficient, as only one experienced actor has been cast, but everyone did a good job - so the inexperience of the actors did not have a negative impact on the final product.In Comparison to other Slasher-/Horror Movies Halloween deservs a high ranking spot, as being one of the best in the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not a slasher, not a psychological thriller","The whole plot of the movie is a boy kills his sister and is placed in prison, he breaks out and kills four people. Generally to be classified as a serial killer a person needs to kill three people at the separate times. So he isn't a serial killer and you can barely say he went on a killing spree. The prime criteria for a slasher is people dying, which barely happens in this film. A psychological thriller is a movie that gets into your head and messes with you. In this movie you don't know why he is killing people or the importance of Halloween, you don't see him stalking and planning anything he just kinda shows up walks into someone's house and kills them. Maybe the idea was that this could happen to anyone but considering you never seem him actually ""breaking in"" he just seems to open the door and walk in lock the door and you'll be fine. We live in a world where people build bombs in their basements so a movie about a mute crazy guy who breaks out of police custody to kill people one day a year is less than exciting.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic Thriller,"Halloween, filmed in 1978 by John Carpenter, is a thriller that captured the attention of all viewers when it was released. It has been imitated and remade many times, but no other work lives up to the original 1978 classic. It begins with a six-year-old boy named Michael Myers (Nick Castle). He murders his sister on Halloween night of 1963 and is shipped away to a psychiatric facility for fifteen years. His doctor at the facility (Donald Pleasence) attempted to assist him for the first eight years and then spent the remainder of the time trying to keep him locked up. Michael escapes and returns to his hometown on Halloween, while all of the teenagers in the area are babysitting, leaving him countless choices for his next victims. Out of these teenagers, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Lynda Van Der Klok (P. J. Soles), and Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes), and their boyfriends are the unlucky few that encounter Myers while babysitting Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) and Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews). Halloween incorporates eye-catching camera work, a horrifying slasher, a plot that disregards current events, and a setting that suggests that you could be terrorized as well.
Halloween is a movie that makes you feel like it is happening to you. Its use of foregrounds is particularly effective in making that point. The camera presents the room, and then shifts to one side, generally with something unexpected looming in the corner of the screen. Most of the time it is a tree, door, bush, or corner, but not always. Namely, in the movie, Carpenter never really lets the viewer get a complete look at Michael. He always seems to be lurking in the shadows, and I conclude that is what makes him so terrifying. Similarly, there are various scenes in which Michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens, which aids in the creepiness. The fantastic camera work is who to thank for that. If you think about it, some creep could be watching you right now, and you wouldn't even know it.
The slasher, Michael Myers, is a dreadful, borderline inhuman being. The fact that a person could kill a loved one at the age of six with no remorse is truly chilling. In fact, Michael Myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired numerous other characters, such as Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th) and The Miner (My Bloody Valentine). All you can see through his mask are lifeless eyes that house an evil soul. Michael enjoys watching, and often seems more interested in the scare factor rather than the kill. To illustrate, in a scene towards the conclusion of the film, he stages three victims to pop out at Laurie, nearly scaring her to death. He doesn't run after you; he walks at a steady pace, but always seems to catch up. The timing of the chase scenes reveals a director that acknowledges exactly when to insert suspense and one that has an absolute understanding of fear. Even with being stabbed, shot, and thrown off a balcony nonetheless, Michael never dies. At the end of the film, Michael escapes once again, evoking a sense of dread for the characters in the movie. Conversely, Michael doesn't speak a word and hasn't for fifteen years, offering no reasons or thoughts for his killings. The only details we know about Michael come from his psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence). I deem that if Michael verbalized in the movie, it would've distracted from his originality, as it makes him unique from most slashers. Furthermore, I found it more alarming to observe him looming around without speaking. You can hear Michael breathing in several scenes of the movie. The air moving in and out of the mask creates a feeling of being surrounded as though he is always there. He is everywhere and nowhere.
Most horror movie slashers are stand-ins for cultural bases like racism. Part of why the movie has aged so well is that it pays no interest to current events, and it wastes no time for character development, theme, or any other elements outside of the critical business of sending shivers down your spine. For instance, Carpenter has been denying rumors for years that the females in the movie that are promiscuous are slain while the ""goody-two-shoes"" survives; however, I see a moralistic point formed in the movie as that is exactly what occurs. I also find it interesting how he paints his characters. The victims are all ordinary people, with no one character taking away from another. In fact, the performances are more striking because of it. Carpenter also creates immaculate tension throughout the film, and he avoids excessive blood and gore in the murder scenes. Specifically, the violent actions are mostly implied more than graphically shown, which serves to heighten the suspense effect. The director also wrote the eerie music you hear in the film, music that still petrifies me to this day. From the first shot to the last, this movie is guided by a specific and determined vision of a simple thrill.
The movie takes place in a old-fashioned town in Illinois called Haddonfield. It is typical small town suburban America. Anyone could assert that they grew up in areas just like this; that is what makes it greatly horrifying. Besides, these are the neighborhoods that make its residents feel secure, or at least it is supposed to. Moreover, the movie occurs on Halloween, hence the title of the film. Halloween is notoriously the ghostliest night of the year, and it only makes sense for a man in a mask to not appear suspicious. While all of the kids and their babysitters are carving jack-o-lanterns, Myers is waiting in the darkness to carve them up.
To conclude, Halloween is one of the eeriest films I have ever viewed. From the camera work to the ordinary characters to Michael Myers himself, every aspect of this 1978 horror engages the viewers, creating a cult classic adored by many, including myself. Without a doubt, I would recommend this film to anyone questing for an exceptional scare. I would award this film five stars, as it ticks all of the boxes on my horror movie checklist. Creepy rural small-town: check. Eerie houses: check. Terrifying slasher: absolutely check. If you don't want to have a remarkably terrifying experience, don't see Halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nicely Filmed, but Ultimately Disappointing","Before I even saw this movie I had practically made up my mind that it was going to be one of my favorite movies of all time.  I love well-constructed stories, especially ones that keep you on the edge of your seat, tensely wondering what's going to happen next.  After reading so many glowing reviews on this comment board, I knew Halloween would be the movie to end all movies.I was wrong.  Maybe I built the movie up in my mind that no film could meet, but whatever the reason, this movie disappointed me.  Although it is nicely filmed with interesting camera angles, light and shadows, and good direction, it just isn't at all scary.  Yes, yes -- I know that we should look at it in the context of the time it was made in, etc., but it still didn't work.  The single most damaging thing to this movie's scare factor is the speed that Michael Myers walks.  He practically inches forward in every scene!  All he does is stiffly step forward with his knife held high.  If he were really that intent on killing, I think he would have a little more urgency in his step.  To see what I mean, watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.At least Leatherface knows how to run, and it makes all the difference!  To see Michael walk so slowly makes it just look like a cheap excuse to give the heroine a chance to get away and make the movie last a little longer. Also, the touch of the supernatural at the end makes things even worse. It's much scarier to believe that Michael is a normal human being who has gone terribly wrong than to think that he has some type of magic powers.  In any event, watch it and decide for yourself.  It might not have worked for me, but apparently it worked for a lot of people here, so give it a try.",,Anonymous,Horror
I Wish I Had You All Alone,"While dropping off a key at a house her realtor father is showing, a young babysitter attracts the attention of an escaped psychopath who murdered his sister on Halloween night 15 years ago and is ready to continue his rampage. That is if his obsessed doctor doesn't find him first.The beauty of John Carpenter's Halloween is its simplicity. The three leading ladies are depicted as your average, normal high school girls with your average, high school girl problems. Who will they take to the dance? What will they wear? When will their parents be back so they can sneak out and see their boyfriend?It's this almost mundane simplicity that makes the film all the more effective. Even the killer, Michael Myers, is a faceless and emotionless void. We know he killed his sister at 6 years old, but we don't know why. Maybe he was just born evil. The film is so much more terrifying by not every diving into his backstory more than it needs to and it allows Myers to be a stand in evil in general. He's almost mythic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the few decent slasher films,"I admit that I am not a fan of the slasher genre, I neither find it entertaining or scary. But I am a fan of John Carpenter's films and Halloween is meant to be the best of it's sub-genre.The film starts in 1963 when a six year old boy Michael Myers murders his older sister who was babysitting him on Halloween. 15-years later he escapes from prison and returns to his old town on Halloween. He starts to stalk Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), and her two friends Annie (Nancy Kyes) and Lynda (P.J. Soles). They are normal girls, Laurie is smart girl who on Halloween is going to babysit a local child. Michael Myers starts to hunt them down. Only Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) can stop him.With a budget of $320,000, Halloween was a massive financial success, making $60 Million in the US alone. It also had a good critical response, having 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was so successful that became a massive series and recently been remade by Rob Zombie. This was a film that also gave Jamie Lee Curtis her first film role. This film tells a basic story of a killer hunting the streets of a small town. A more realistic setting to say the Friday 13th series where the kids go to an abandon camp with electricity or phones, take drugs, have sex and end up getting killed by a killer with a knife. One of the best aspects of Halloween is that it doesn't try to explain why Michael Myers is a killer, he just does it because he is evil. That is a more interesting and scary then when a film tries to justify why the killer is the way he is. The other decent aspect is the film doesn't such too much violence, unlike modern films where they show everything. It's more effective when there is little violence. John Carpenter also does have some good shots and scenes during the film, particularly in the beginning when 6-year-old Michael kills his sister.But there are sadly some problems. Except for the acting of Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, most is weak. There is also weak characterisation, making out that of the girls is a sex-crazed cheerleader. There isn't much dept to the film. As well there is a leery nature to the film, with Michael spying on teenage girls being his targets. I also have to question did women just not wear bras in the 70s? Also if there was some real-world logic behind the film, surely wouldn't there be a bulletin to warn people that a there was a killer on the loose?But it is possibly the best of it's genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Seminal Horror,"I love the first hour. Obviously it takes an incredible amount of craftsmanship to build a film the way Carpenter does with this one. My biggest complaint however, is with the Donald Pleasant character (Loomis). Not because of the performance, which I truly admire, but with the way the character is written into the fabric of the story. Primarily, Loomis is used as a means of delivering expository information about Michael's nature. While Pleasance does deliver this information in a very affecting way, these breaks from the rest of the film which does a fantastic job of creating tension and establishing milieu, bog down what is otherwise a tour de force of independent movie making. The less we know about what makes Michael tick the more terrifying his is, as far as I'm concerned.It's Loomis' ineptitude which also bothers me. When we cut back to him, still standing behind the bush at the Myers' house (which he's apparently been doing for the last hour or so of screen time), and when he finally notices the stolen cop car not 4 houses up the street from where he's been standing, my patience with this ineffectual character finally ran out.It wasn't just this one instance in which Loomis' actions made my eyes roll - a notable prior example being how he seemed so completely oblivious to the probability that Michael would return to his childhood home, and therefore was slow in employing the sherif and setting up a defense for the night in question. These character choices seem to exist out of necessity rather than for any artistic reason. Loomis' ineptitude doesn't make the character any more nuanced or relatable, it simply allows the rest of the plot to unfold in the desired manner.That being said, the film is understandably an iconic piece of horror and the granddaddy of the slasher sub-genre. The performances are perfectly stilted in the direction of camp without being ludicrous or inert. This is especially true for JLC, who I read was so discouraged with herself after the first day of shoots that she assumed she would be fired. When Carpenter called her that night to tell her how pleased he was with the way things were going, he had to shout over the sounds of her tears. And, of course, the film would not have worked if it hadn't understood how to craft the perfect killer. Enourmous, silent (retarded even) and expressionless, all Michael has to do is stand there, and it's enough to just kill you with fear.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The original...,"""Halloween"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch Michael Myers escaping from a mental hospital after fifteen years and returning to a small town nearby in order to kill again.I liked this movie because it had a simple but interesting plot and contained plenty of action and suspense. The interpretation of Jamie Lee Curtis who played as Laurie was simply amazing and she made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Donald Pleasence's who played as Loomis, P. J. Soles' who played as Lynda and Nick Castle who played as The Shape of Michael Myers. The direction which was made by John Carpenter was also very good and he presented his main characters very well, something that made possible for the audience to relate to them and follow them on their way to survival. Finally, I have to say that ""Halloween"" is a nice horror movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
10/10 One of the best horror movies of all time!,"This has got to be one of the best horror films ever made. John Carpenter made this creepy masterpiece in just a little over three weeks. Thinking it wasn't going to do pretty well, it surprisingly became the highest grossing independent film of the time. And it started a whole new sub genre in American cinema, The Slasher movies. Prior to Halloween, most American horror movies dealt with unrealistic premises that usually dealt with spirits, monsters, and so on. There were murder movies, but they were seen as more Thriller/dramas than pure horror flicks. But Halloween changed all that, it introduced a new concept to American audiences. I emphasize American because slasher movies were already being and made in Europe, but still weren't mainstream in the US. Halloween took a simple premise and made a cinematographic masterpiece out of it. Everything from its music, to its lighting, to its suspenseful pace. The movie became an instant classic. Jamie Lee Curtis truly owned the character of Laurie Strode, and this was the movie that started her career. Donald presence also did a great job playing doctor loomis, Michael meyres psychiatrist. The movie was so good and so successful, that immediately Hollywood flooded the cinemas with largely cheap imitations of Halloween during the 80s(Esp early 80s). And a new sub genre was born, all thanks to this great movie that I personally can watch over and over without getting bored. I highly recommend Halloween to not just horror fans, but to any movie fan. Because this is cinema art.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a standard slasher movie,"Of course I am well aware of the fact that ""Halloween"" (1978, John Carpenter) is an all time classic. I always thought however that it also was a standard slasher movie, just like for example ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"" (1974, Tobe Hooper). When it was broadcasted this year on Dutch television (of course in the Halloween period), I read the review of Roger Ebert and much to my surprise he did like the movie. This was for me the main reason to give it a try.""Halloween"" is a low budget production in which John Carpenter does nearly everything himself: he is both producer and director, co-writer of the scanario and (most surprising for me) wrote the (very scary) musical score.The acting does not rise above the level of a standard slasher movie. Lead actress Jamie Lee Curtis earned the nickname ""scream queen"", and this nickname is well deserved (especially in relation to her acting in the second half of the movie).The cinematography however is very fine. Techniques such as the subjective point of view (we see through the eyes of the killer but (of course) we do not see the killer himself), the slow tracking shot and the alternation of foreground and background focus (sometimes something moves into the foreground from an unexpected angle, sometimes something scary happens in the background but because the background is blurred this is hardly visible) contribute a lot to the tense atmosphere.With respect to the storyline two elements are noteworthy. In the first place Michael Myers is ""purely and simply ... evil"" in the words of his psychiatrist. No attempt is made to give an explanation, where in other films (""The omen"", 1976, Richard Donner) the evil for example descends from the devil. Also the apparant immortality of Micheal is never explained, but more or less confirms that we have to do with pure evil (which is also timeless).More controversial is the question to what extent the killings of Michael Myers (or, more general, the killings in much of the slaher movies) are sexually motivated. In the film almost all the teenage girls see a baby sitting job as an opportunity to make love with their boy friends. The exception is lead character Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Although John Carpenter has always maintained that it was definitely not his intention to make a moralistic movie (sex = dangerous), it is a fact not to be missed that in the end Laurie Strode is the only teenager that survived. The hypothesis of the sexual motivation of the killer is moreover reinforced by the references of the film (for example the first killing) to ""Psycho"" (1960, Alfred Hitchcock). The hypothesis is weakened however by the fact that the first killing takes place when Michael Myers is only six years old.A final word about the relationship between Laurie Strode in ""Halloween"" and Carrie White in ""Carrie"" (1976, Brian de Palma). Both are outsiders in the sense that they are slow to discover their sexuality, although Carrie seems considerable more frustrated about that. Remarkable is however how much nicer the classmates of Laurie are. In stead of making fun of her some of them are really trying to get her more involved.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horror the way it should be,"I'm almost a bit ashamed to say, but I watched it for the first time this year (as if this year isn't scary enough...)First off I'd like to say that I don't watch a lot of horror films compared to many others, and I have a sort of love-hate relationship with the genre, so I started off a bit sceptical. There are many films which I don't like due to bad plots or simply being just clichÃ© horror film that doesn't really portray any originality or creativity. To sum it up, I'm sick of films just focusing on jump scares and creepy dolls or exorcism. Not that such aspects are necessarily bad, but if that's all the film has to show for, I'm not personally a fan.However, if films have, for example, more of a well thought through plot or good acting, or a psychological focus, I'm all in. Some of my favourite films are horror films, so when it's made good the genre is excellent. I love The Shining, The Cabin in the Woods, Us, Get Out, (ANYTHING) Hannibal and Hereditary.I do respect that it's a lot about personal taste when rating a film, and that the quality is somewhat subjective so naturally I can only give my own opinion. However, I do think it is possible to partially judge a film based on techniques which are used or other specific bits, and I believe this film has some objectively good qualities regardless if one find the film exciting or not. What I find good about this film, and what makes it truly nerve-wrecking, is for example the stalker aspect. The teens in the film are stalked for the most part, and are mostly unaware of it, but the audience watches it and becomes anxious on the character's behalf. Sure, there are some jump scares, but I don't think they're not overused, and it accompanies the stalking. We're just waiting for something bad to happen, and when the jump scares finally arrive, they are rather more effective because it's been building up to it.What makes a horror film truly chilling, and which Halloween successfully does, is to have a meaningful slow progression that makes the audience sit on the edge of their seat as they watch the creepy parts unfold. It plays on something which I think everyone can relate to; the feeling we sometimes can get of people following us or watching us, but when we turn around there's no one there. That's what we watch happening onscreen, and it's exciting being able to watch it whilst we sit safe at home. We get to experience the adrenaline that comes from the fear of being followed/watched, but without experiencing it personally or in real life.Although this is not my absolute favourite of all horror films, it's certainly up there among the best I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Halloween = Hack'a'teen...,"When John Carpenter made Halloween in the late 70s he practically redefined modern horror. This seems strange now, when Hollywood can scarcely go a month without releasing yet another 'bad guy stalks pretty young girls' film.It's easy to see how this film influenced others though, it is well made and boasts extremely patient pacing, which must've kept the audiences perpetually on edge.It's harder to see how this was ever truly scary The film opens in Haddonfield, Illinois in 1963. It is Halloween and in one long unbroken – mostly dialogue free – scene we meet young Michael Myers for the very first time carrying out his very first kill. And by young I mean around 6 or 7.The next time we meet Michael he is in the process of escaping from the psychiatric hospital which served as his home ever since that initial 'unpleasantness', in a bizarre scene indeed. Dr Loomis (more on him later) and a nurse are headed to the mental hospital that has served as Myer's home/prison since his youth. As they approach in the pitch black darkness and driving rain they can see several 'free range' patients roaming about in their whites.After pausing to ponder if this is usual practise Myers commandeers the vehicle and drives off. As Loomis himself later wonders, it isn't a bad effort to be a skilled driver seeing as you've been locked up since you were 6So where does a social menace go to savour his first taste of freedom in over a decade? Home of course. Back to Haddonfield. But things done changed just a little, the Myers' residence is a little run-down and something of a haunted house already to the local kids, which is only exacerbated by the fact that it is once again Halloween and tykes are scampering about collecting lollies and otherwise getting up to mischief.The good Dr Loomis shows and heads immediately to the local police. He knows just what is coming having dealt with Myers for years, and he tells anyone who will listen, which is practically no-one. Even the police only show a passing concern at the potential psychotic killer in their midst on the night that practically every kid is roaming the streets at nightFor some reason Myers headed all the way home to try to kill random strangers, in this case three young schoolgirls, one of whom is conscientious and sensible, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), and two who are, for lack of a better term, sluts.This solid build up slows dramatically from here during the mid-section of the film. In short Myers dons a boiler coat and the admittedly eerie melted-Shatner mask and spends what seems like eternity lurking in the edge of every scene. He's practically everywhere! Standing. Watching. Looming silently. Always where those that he is observing will be or were just – but rarely where they are – looking.Once Michael finally makes his presence felt things finally get to moving, the finale involves the (what has become) usual stumbling, screaming, sobbing and stabbing, with a slow shuffling Michael always a step or two behind the fast moving prey. Michael himself takes a licking but keeps right on ticking, something that he only got better at the further the unnecessary sequels went.Halloween is rightfully renowned and still pretty effective – if not very scary – in the present day. The piano tinkling score is unnerving and like a video game seems to signify that Michael is in close proximity. Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis add credibility to the film with sincere performances – in fact the entire film is far less campy than many of its peers from the 70s and 80s – and the film helped write the modern slasher rulebook, notably the sections that demand pretty teens who covet alcohol and sex must be killed, and the fact that a slow shuffling pursuer somehow always manages to catch the fast fleeing teens.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Like fine food in expensive restaurants I can appreciate Halloween for its quality and better attributes, but like the flash meals it just isn't my bag and the scary portions are just too small to satiate me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
From someone that watched this in 2018,"Do not waste your time. I strongly disagree with a lot of the 10 star ratings that said this is a classic and a must see. It is not at all, it's really bad. I can see it being good in the 70s but every single cliche or scare tactic is in this film. Yes, they might've been the first with these scare tactics but if you want to see a ""classic"" scary film in 2018 then this is not it.I'll go even further to say that this is not even a classic. Just because it is the first slasher it makes it a classic? The writing is terrible and the acting is even more ridiculous. I was even glad when Michael killed off those teenagers.

The night he came home,"Eerie music, a small isolated town and a great villain. Halloween is a true classic, not only for the slasher genre wich it started, but also for having given birth to Michael Myers, the sadistic, careful, ruthless murderer who can only be described as pure evil. Set in the town of Haddonville, it follows the story of Laurie, a high school girl who comes into contact with Myers, who has just escaped the insane asylum and come back to his home, where he killed his sister 15 years ago. All happens on Halloween night, the only night where capturing the attention is impossible.
Complimented by John Carpenter's direction and music, the movie truly gives a good scare.

A minimalist slasher classic!,"There have been many emulations and sequels inspired by John Carpenter's 1978 slasher movie, but very few that exemplify so perfectly that a movie genre with a spotty reputation can also be a pure, laborious work of art.The screenplay by Carpenter concerns a six-year-old boy who murders his seventeen-year-old sister on Halloween night and returns to his quiet hometown looking for his next victims. The script is ruthlessly simple in terms of motivation or character development, but it works truly in terms of horror and suspense.What's on screen is a psychotic killer stalking teenagers in empty spaces: Bare rooms, abandoned streets, darkened house which is heightened by gracefully orchestrated camerawork, which often puts the killer near the audience, lurking at the corner of the screen with his back to us, keeping us adrift, moment by moment, as the stripped-down, primal, enthralling notes of the soundtrack remind you of something terrible is on the way and it gets a little more menacing as it goes along.The movie creates tension throughout with virtually very little gore on screen and has earned its reputation as one of the most merciless and terrifying thrillers ever.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Original Slasher Film That Remains A Classic.,"Released in 1978 by director John Carpenter, Halloween remains the quintessential slasher film. What makes this better than many of the films it influenced, is how well made this film is. Produced on a low budget, but hardly looking it, the film succeeds based on the efforts of the filmmakers.The story, which deals with three high school friends being terrorized by a masked killer on Halloween, could have easily been the stuff of schlock, but everything from the script, to the performances, to the camerawork, are all top-notch. The music, composed by Carpenter, is also a highlight. Simple piano notes with minimal electronic flourishes create an atmosphere which perfectly suits the film.What I particularly admire about this film is the lack of excessive gore, which some would argue is an essential element to any slasher film. Carpenter simply replaces shock value with genuine suspense, and it ultimately pays off.Definitely in my top ten of favourite horror films of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yes, acting is a bit cheesy, but who cares. Yes, Loomis is a bit over the top whenever he speaks, but who cares. It just adds flavor to the whole mix mentioned above.One of the best descriptions of this movie and Michael Myers actually came from first Scream movie, where main villains simply explain why Michael Myers is so perfect as a villain.

"Classic, scary","Halloween is one of the most suspenseful films ever, The story is extremely original and the music is on point, it is not like most other horror films which just include of a killer slashing, Halloween has a good story and build up to the killings, personally I find it to be extremely creepy, the way Michael stalks Laurey is so well done and scary, there are a few jump scares but it's not very violent at all, it has some incredible acting and as you can see while watching it created all the original horror ideas, ie Michael in the back of a car waiting, Michael watching laurey but when anyone goes to look Michaels gone, it is such an influential film to almost all horror films and is my favourite slasher, Michael is such an incredible character in this which I think is lacked in other horror films, and also it opens up the best horror franchise in history, in my opinion if you want to watch an incredible franchise, watch Halloween 1 &2 then watch Halloween 2018, Halloween kills and then Halloween ends and you'll see why everyone is so obsessed with the franchise, And Jamie Lee Curtis is such an incredible actor her and Donald Pleasence (Dr Loomis) is what makes it such a good film, and although some of it is dated we have to appreciate its extremely low budget and how old it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
best horror flick of all time!!!,"Just bought the DVD after renting it every year around this time. This movie is an all time classic must see horror flick. Although done on a tight budget, this movie dosen't need the high tech special effects of todays horror movies. Its a suspense filled movie, from Michael Myers standing between the sheets on the clothesline...to following Jamie Lee across the street to the house. Even though the character Michael Myers doesn't speak, he made the movie with his famous ""sit up"" scene. The way he sat up...turned his head toward an unaware Jamie Lee...spooky stuff. Not to mention the music score for this flick, is another reason why this movie is so good. Highly recommended around the trick or treating time of year.",,Anonymous,Horror
The best,"John Carpenter's original HALLOWEEN is by far the best of the series. This ""economically"" produced horror film started the Slasher Movie craze, made Jamie Lee Curtis a star, and held the record for highest grossing Independent Film for many years. It's become a staple on TV during Halloween season, and has been re-made (badly) by Rob Zombie. There's talk of yet another reboot, but it I doubt another director can recreate the simplicity of the original.

Fun to See Orgin of Horror Tropes,"It didn't scare me like it might have people back in the day because it feels too slow and predictable by today's standards, but, I think that is testament of its effectiveness.The movie throughout knew it's style and stuck to it - the characters didn't experience much development but that is not necessarily what we were looking for when watching.It falls short of suspense but is a precursor to many suspense themes - seeing something no one else sees, people not believing the person to their own peril, the steady closing in of the murderer, isolation of the victim, and the hunt around the house. Solid formula, it's just been done plenty since.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Purely and simply evil!,"As there have been many film sequels and remakes of this, many people just assume the original 1978 version is also very tame and very bad. This is not so! This is a classic!John Carpenter wrote this original screenplay with his partner Debra Hill and together, they created a film with vivid characters, tension, scares, thrills and made a monster out of Michael Myers, who became for me, the best cinematic serial killer and Boogeyman.I have watched this film many times, and watch it now, with an interest in how the music was made, how costumes and sets were created. How the writers wrote the spine-chilling scenes of murder, and a back story of a young Michael with a giant knife.The music of this film is unbelievable. Often a simple piano giving a steady beat as if to say evil is very close by.Whilst there is little blood in this film, the film relies upon giving the audience scares every now and again, little, but often. This, for my money, is much better than the blood, guts and gore served up by more recent films.If there was no Michael Myers, there may not be a Freddie Krueger, nor would there be the 'Scream' series, 'Friday the 13th' series, 'Hellraiser' series, 'Chucky' series, nor 'I know what you did last Summer' to terrify cinemagoers.This film was the original and in my opinion, the best horror film ever made!10/10.Amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A really depraved film.... difficult to watch!,"I can appreciate the amount of suspense generated with the small budget and Carpenter really evokes a creepy-as-hell mood with his music but overall the subject matter is absolutely disturbing and depraved and thus a huge turn-off for me. And no I'm not entertained by promiscuous teens (and one that is not promiscuous at all) being hacked to death. I understand that this film must seem fairly tame compared to the blood-curdling garbage being churned out today and indeed I can applaud the fact that very little blood is shown here and that Carpenter relies mostly on suspense to generate terror. Still, it's an uneasy experience and for someone like myself (who absolutely hates the slasher genre) this is a turn-off. Hitchcock's PSYCHO was a masterpiece. This is not.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Horror At It's Best,Halloween is one of the best horror movies ever made and that is just my opinion. With just a small budget and this movie was put together perfectly. I have seen so many horror movies try to use the same formula and they don't come close to this movie. Of course using a spooky holiday is one ace in the hole and creating a killer that is pure evil. This movie will stand the test of time and will forever be a classic horror movie. Worth checking out if your interested in horror movies and overall just a great piece of film history.

Halloween is a masterpiece for the horror genre.,"Halloween (1978) Directed by: John Carpenter Starring: Donald Pleasence Jamie Lee Curtis Length: 91 minutes Rating: RHalloween is not only one of my favorite movies, but it also is the best horror movie ever created. Made in 1978, this movie was criticized for too much violence. I laughed when I heard that comment. The first question that came to my head was: ""What violence?"" Unlike most horror movies and horror movie sequels today, this movie had only 1 scene where you even saw any blood.The movie was directed by John Carpenter. He is a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock and some of Hitchcock's techniques are used in this movie.The movie is about a man or 'monster' named Michael Myers. After killing his sister on Halloween when he was only a child, he escapes from an institution where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He comes back to his childhood town of Haddonfield, Illinois after 15 years of being confined to the institution.Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is in charge of finding Michael and bringing him back to the institution. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a teenager in Haddonfield and is in high school. She also babysits as a job. The night is Halloween. Michael Myers has returned.

Review of the audio commentaries.,"This is my favorite film of all time, and yet I've never written a formal review for it. And that ain't about to change now -- much too overwhelming.I would, however, like to review the various audio commentaries that have been done over the years, starting with one featuring John Carpenter, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis. I chose this one first because I have an inkling that it's one of the older ones, considering Debra Hill is present.While I did thoroughly enjoy this commentary, I have a feeling some of the later ones will be much better. About a month or so ago, I listened to John and Debra do a commentary for The Fog. It instantly became one of my favorite commentaries. Why this particular commentary falls short for me is simple... They aren't in the same room together! The best I can tell, separate commentaries took place with John, Debra and Jamie Lee and were later spliced together. How bizarre! I learned a lot nonetheless but to say this pieced-together format is annoying/distracting would be an UNDERSTATEMENT.Any sense of flow is tarnished when you hear the speech-program announce to you who is about to speak. Plus, when people are in the same room together, there's a certain type of energy that can't be replicated, say, over Skype -- but ESPECIALLY when the recordings are COMPLETELY SEPARATE and spliced together like some elementary school kid's photograph collage project...I'm fairly new to commentaries, so I hope this is a one-off and not some bizarre subgenre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror films ever made!,"What makes Halloween one of the best horror movies of all time? Why does it have such a cult following?The simple answer is that this movie was so well done in its simplicity, that each one of us can picture our hometowns falling victim to a murderer on Halloween night. Almost everyone who is a horror movie buff will watch this movie around Halloween time. It's a tradition just like watching A Christmas Story around Christmas time.The difference between Halloween and most other horror films that followed is that director John Carpenter was working on a minimalist budget. He had to use creativity and imagination, not money. This created a masterpiece in building suspense without the need to kill off someone every 5 minutes. This movie featured almost NO blood at all, and aside from one scene, it also wasn't built around exploitation killing.The best feature of this film is the way Carpenter was able build suspense. He used Hitchcock style camera angles & power shots. He created tension by having Michael in the background for almost half the movie...this is ultra creepy and effective. Sometimes blood, guts, explosions, etc. All blend together to make a non-memorable movie. This movie leaves a lasting impression in that sometimes we aren't sure who is around the corner or hiding in the bushes or staring up at your bedroom window for NO REASON AT ALL.The best piece of advice I have for first time viewers is to not expect a bloody horror movie with 45 kills. This just isn't the objective of the movie. The objective is to build suspense in really creative ways. It set the pace for horror movies to follow for a reason.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anyone for pumpkin?,"A classic film, genuinely full of suspense and with more then its fair share of brown trouser moments! The first and by far the best of the series it catapulted Jamie Lee Curtis' career into the limelight. John Carpenter provides a memorable and haunting score that complements the on screen action. Perhaps the only down side to the film is the super human status afforded to killer 'Michael Myers'. This factor sometimes detracts from certain atmospheric moments that the film contains. This guy has every thing done to him as his victims try to escape; yet bullets seem to simply bounce off him. The film actually benefits from not having a copious budget. Script is relied upon to good effect. There is a look to the movie that may have been absent had a big money budget been available.

"""It's Halloween. Everyone's entitled to one good scare.""","""Halloween"" is rightfully considered one of the greatest and most influential horror films ever made. It has spawned a franchise consisting of thirteen films which would in turn would help build a complete backstory of Michael Myers. Some may argue about the quality of the sequels, but there is little doubt that the franchise has been highly successful in terms of a collective gross in the region of over 800 million USD at the box office worldwide. This is a fine accomplishment considering the original was made on a budget of around 300,000 USD. This is before you even consider the impact the film has had on American cinema, and by extension the horror genre.It has been credited for helping create and define the slasher subgenre. It has served as a source of inspiration for subsequent slasher films. ""Halloween"" was one of the first horror films to integrate and elevate the horror tropes that we see today to help craft the ultimate horror film. The casting of ""Halloween"" included the great veteran actor Donald Pleasence and the then relatively unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis. The tight budget meant the number of big names that Carpenter could attract was limited, and most of the actors received very little money for their roles. There are many elements present in ""Halloween"" that makes a horror film a success such as: memorable characters, character development, an unforgettable score, noteworthy protagonist and antagonist etc. The simplicity of ""Halloween"" has been celebrated as its greatest strength. It doesn't rely on elaborate or bombastic special effects, too much gore, or complicated plot twists. Instead, it relies on suspense through the combination of the score, the atmospheric cinematography, and the perpetual malevolent presence of its antagonist. In essence, ""Halloween"" is a classic, a classic that lives up to modern expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Carpenter had to be resourceful and efficient with the low budget which makes this taught and effective,"In the history of the horror genre John Carpenter's Halloween is an important milestone because it bridges the gap between Alfred Hitchcock's seminal shocker Psycho (1960) which began the modern 'slasher' sub-genre, and all the rest that followed such as Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, April Fool's Day, My Bloody Valentine, Maniac, Prom Night, Happy Birthday To Me, He Knows You're Alone and Child's Play to name but a few.Of course there were other slasher films made prior to Halloween, notably Bob Clarke's Black Christmas (1974), Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis in the 1960's and Italian 'Giallo' master Dario Argento's films in the 1970's, but it was Halloween that put the genre back into the mainstream and captured audiences imagination with it's simple story of a deranged killer let loose on teenage victims racking up an unstoppable body count. It's the ultimate 'bogie man' tale of being stalked by an unseen killer that jumps out at you when you least expect it.By today's standards Halloween is quite restrained in that there's not as much blood and gore as seen in other slasher movies and with it being such a low budget Carpenter had to be resourceful and efficient which makes this more taught and effective than most that followed. This is a classic case of less is more and Carpenter's own stripped down electronic score only serves to heighten the tension in a most effective way.It also marks the debut of 19 year old actress Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, who herself appeared in Psycho. She is perfect as the feisty Laurie Strode who faces stalker Michael Myers and went on to be known as a 'scream queen' appearing in many more sequels and other slashers similar to this one. Veteran actor Donald Pleasence has just the right oddball quality as Dr Loomis who unwittingly unleashes the deranged Myers onto the outside world who escapes from his asylum.The movie also marks the beginning of the iconic horror villain, thanks to the creepy mask worn by Michael Myers which makes him seem cold and faceless to his victims and to the audience, a device copied in Friday the 13th (1980) with the hockey mask worn by Jason and the Ghostface mask in Scream (1996).Halloween was the most profitable independent film in the history of cinema earning over $150 million worldwide on it's meagre $300,000 dollar budget until Paranormal Activity (2007) broke that record 30 years later. Like a favourite Christmas film Halloween is an event movie to celebrate a certain time of year that guarantees repeat viewings, as well as spawning 11 sequels and countless copy cat movies in the 40 years since it was released onto an unsuspecting audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The ultimate original Halloweeniest of all time,"Classic. Original. Vintage. Retro. And still the all time ultimate Halloweeniest of all time champion. Nothing else compares. Every time any other movie comes out on the Halloween genre it is immediately held against Halloween as THE standard. The original movie was made with such a low budget, in such a short time, in Southern California, with mostly new/young actors, and it still holds up and holds itself out and apart from anything before or since. The text in this review will not allow me to include a pumpkin emoji, so just imagine you see it. The movie is absolute Halloween perfection, and it pains me that given the winning Halloween formula no one has been able to match it or surpass it. Not even the Halloween franchise itself. They can't even recreate the magic of their original offering. Not even close in fact. Every time I watch any of the other Halloween franchise movies, in immediately reminded of how great the original is and how lacking everything else is. In fact I will posit that stemming from the original the Halloween franchise movies have gotten progressively worse. Ranked in order they go: 1) Halloween 2) Halloween 2 (since it's merely a continuation of the first) 3) Halloween 3 Season of the Witch (which is a great stand alone movie in it's own right, and I wish the franchise would've capitalized on this by continuing in that direction by making independent stand alone Halloween movies in the series eventually and gradually reintroducing Micheal Meyers in various scenarios and teasing his character existence throughout). 4) Halloween 4. 5) The Rob Zombie Halloween ""reimaginings"" which are a couple of 'ok' renditions, but didn't really hold up well over time. 6) Everything else in the Halloween franchise is absolute crap that denigrated the original name and only serves to remind people of the purity of the original Halloween movie. One of the worst offenders is the 2018 self-titled 'Halloween' movie. It portends by it's nomenclature to be a juxtaposition of the original. It is not. It is crap. But I'll save that venom for my review of Halloween (2018).

The original and still the best,"A small fictional town called Haddonfield in Illinois, it is Halloween night 1963 and a very young boy called Michael Myers stabs his teenage sister to death. This opening scene features some wonderful point of view shots and must be one of the greatest scenes in horror movie history. Present day 1978 and Michael escapes from the mental institution in which he was being held and makes his way back to his hometown for Halloween, intent on cold blooded murder. Dr Loomis (played by the excellent Donald Pleasence) teams up with the town Sheriff to track Michael, aka The Shape, down. I watched the British TV premiere of Halloween when I was a school kid and can remember feeling disappointed by the lack of blood or gore. Decades on and having re-watched the movie several more times (it looks great on Blu-ray) I can now see and appreciate it for the classic that it is. A simple plot combined with superb cinematography, a fantastic musical score and interesting characters played by good actors make this a perfect exercise in suspense and terror, it is genuinely frightening. Unlike the later entries in the (too) long franchise it doesn't need splatter to impress its audience. It is not all perfect, for a start how does Michael know how to drive a car, having been incarcerated since a very early age? (Even Dr Loomis asks this question!). Another thing is that it is set in Illinois, a State with very cold winters yet palm trees can be seen (it was shot in California). Directed by John Carpenter Halloween is not the first slasher movie, however it is the film for which the term was coined and it triggered the Golden Age of the Slasher Movie. It also became a template for the countless slasher movies that followed, for example having a baby sitter stalked and slashed, for having a Final Girl (in this instance played by the lovely Jamie Lee Curtis), etc. Personally my favourite slasher movie is ""Friday the 13th"" (1980), however I will concede that technically Carpenter's masterpiece is superior.

"Halloween: A Masterpiece of Suspense, Terror, and Unforgettable Iconic Moments","John Carpenter's Halloween is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films of all time, and for good reason. This seminal slasher film, released in 1978, is a triumph of suspense and terror, offering an unforgettable mix of memorable characters, iconic moments, and expertly crafted suspense. It is a movie that continues to hold up decades later, inspiring countless imitators and fans, and remains a towering achievement in the genre of horror.At its core, Halloween is a movie about Michael Myers, a masked serial killer who returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois on Halloween night, 15 years after he murdered his sister. The movie opens with a prologue that sets the stage, establishing Michael as a mysterious, almost supernatural force of evil. As he makes his way through the town, systematically killing young women who cross his path, we come to understand that Michael is not just a killer, but a monster.The film's strength lies in its simplicity. Halloween is a movie that doesn't rely on flashy special effects or convoluted plotting, but instead uses its suspenseful score, expertly crafted shots, and well-timed jump scares to keep its audience on edge. Carpenter's direction is top-notch, with his clever use of long shots and wide angles allowing the audience to sense Michael's presence even when he is not physically seen on screen. The film's cinematography, combined with its eerie score composed by Carpenter himself, creates a mood of dread and tension that permeates every frame.Another standout aspect of Halloween is its cast. Jamie Lee Curtis, in her debut role, shines as Laurie Strode, the film's final girl and Michael's main target. Curtis' portrayal of Laurie is smart and nuanced, and her performance provides the movie with an emotional core. The film's other supporting characters, including Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis, the psychiatrist who has been pursuing Michael for years, and Nancy Loomis as Annie, Laurie's best friend, are equally memorable, rounding out a cast that perfectly captures the mood and tone of the movie.Halloween also had a huge impact on the horror genre as a whole, establishing many of the conventions that would come to define the slasher sub-genre. From its iconic villain, to its final girl trope, to its use of a holiday as a backdrop for terror, Halloween set the bar for what a slasher film could be. The movie's impact is felt to this day, with countless filmmakers and fans citing Halloween as a major influence on their work.It's difficult to overstate just how influential Halloween has been, both in the horror genre and in popular culture more broadly. From its iconic opening credit sequence, to its haunting score, to its memorable kill scenes, Halloween is a movie that will stay with you long after you've seen it. For anyone who loves horror, or is simply a fan of great filmmaking, Halloween is a must-see movie.In conclusion, Halloween is a masterpiece of suspense, terror, and unforgettable iconic moments that deserves its place in the pantheon of great horror films. With its expertly crafted suspense, memorable cast, and iconic moments, Halloween is a movie that continues to thrill audiences nearly 45 years after its initial release. Whether you're a fan of horror or simply a fan of great filmmaking, Halloween is a movie that deserves to be seen, and its legacy will continue to influence the genre for generations to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Of all the slasher films that followed, this will always be the one with the best music, best use of quiet moments. The jump scares are so much different than the jump scares of the day. Varying from slow and methodical, to quick and unexpected. Whether you see Michael coming from a mile away, the idea of someone lurking in the shadows at any given moment is terrifying.

"Halloween, more suspense than terror","""Halloween"", released in 1978, is an American film packed with suspense and intrigue, with slight touches of terror in its dark scenes. The film, although long and with a slow transition between events, manages to construct a shocking atmosphere with the permanent atmosphere of suspense, the dark places of the houses and the streets on Halloween nights, with the presence of the iconica music theme of the murderer Michael Myers and his sudden appearances. Halloween is a movie that makes the viewer look over the shoulders of the characters in anticipation of seeing the feared villain. With a permanent Halloween mood, it's a movie that catches you in the plot, waiting for any glimpse of the feared killer and hoping that the poor victims have some chance, albeit minimal, to escape their masked threat.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The worst movie ever made.,"Yes that's right. This isn't just the worst horror movie ever but The worst movie ever made. A ridiculous and completely pathetic movie like this isn't worthy of the high ratings it has currently. Even for a film that came out in 1978 it's too utterly ridiculous to be even called a film. It's a disgrace to cinema.I've seen movies from the early 30's that are 10 times more well made than this piece of trash. Firstly this horrible film has no story whatsoever. You wait and wait but nothing happens. No explanation is given as to wtf is this boogeyman idiot targeting these people. What's his story and why these people only.This could have been such a great film had they explored the halloween culture a little. There's just pumpkins kept outside houses to indicate that's it's the halloween season. No people or kids on the street. No trick or treating and the makers dare to call it a halloween film. Utter bs.I'll do you one better.It's the day of Halloween. There are people out in the streets. Kids knock on peoples doors to collect treats. There are lights and colours all around the block. The celebrations are over and people head back to their respective homes. Then this boogeyman guy appears and does his thing. We are given a backstory of the people so as to relate a bit to them. (Mind you these guys have not given the slightest hint what their stories are and thus don't care whether they get slashed or shot).The Halloween theme could've been explored so beautifully. But from what they showed in this film, this could have been any damn day of the year. It was so bad. Words cannot describe how awful the screenplay was.Not to forget the wooden acting of every character. They have all acted so badly that I couldn't care less about their fate. This film seriously has no redeeming qualities at all.There's a scene in this film where the guy whose about to smash this girl says something like, ""First I'll tear your clothes, then I'll tear mine and then I'll tear Lindsey's clothes. Btw Lindsey is the girl's LITTLE SISTER. Disgusting is the word! Really it doesn't get worse than this film. If you are sceptical about any other film, remember that film will still be at least 3 times better than this load of crap and you could watch that but save yourself the torture of watching this rubbish film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Remains a Classic for the Ages,"All the way back in 1978, an independent slasher flick from newcomer horror director John Carpenter came out called Halloween. Not only was the film a colossal hit upon release, but it spawned a long lasting franchise and brought the serial killer Michael Myers instant iconography. Looking back at the film so many years later, regardless of it being inspired by the likes of Psycho, it manages to play up the suspense pretty well in the long run.Set 15 years after mental patient Michael Myers murdered his teenage sister on Halloween night, he escapes and returns to his hometown Haddonfield, Illinois where he creepily stalks teenage babysitter Laurie Strode and her friends. As a simple tale of stalking and persistence from a severely dangerous monster, Michael Myers remains a truly frightening foe due to his limited screen appearances and pantomime performance. The wheezing looming predator of a man makes for an intimidating presence, although some of his antics could lead to more laughs due to the low budget thrills not coming off super strong today. Fortunately, the shift from mindless gore towards moody atmosphere sells the film's creepy factor effectively well, especially thanks to Carpenter's pivotal score. Much like the finest horror tunes out there, the music is played with minimal keys and repetitious beats that could send chills down anyone's spine.But beyond the minimal atmospheric approach, the cast is also pretty solid, most notably through the main character Laurie. In her very first film role, Jamie Lee Curtis proved to be a strong lead player in making Laurie appear normal and chill before her mundane Halloween is threatened by a mysterious killer. Because we're able to spend a good amount of time getting to know Laurie and her friends before Myers comes in for the worse, the stakes are raised to a large degree. In addition, Donald Pleasence sells the stern paranoia of Myer's psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis, quite well, delivering successful desperation gestures and bold monologues on the true evil state of the killer. Many of the other characters are either victims of Michael's murderous spree or typical out lookers on the events proceeding everything. That said, much like the two leads, they're all sympathetic enough to hope that the murderous serial killer doesn't get them too soon.While Halloween has garnered an endless amount of sequels, spinoffs and reboots, the original John Carpenter helmed feature works great as a slow paced yet chillingly haunting treat for the season. In blending teen relatability with a striking sense of fear, Carpenter and producer / co-writer Debra Hill managed to pull off a thoroughly inspired slasher with a concise premise and quality low budget elements. They say to watch out for the boogeyman, but what they really mean is to watch out for it on Halloween night, questions asked.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A classic horror for viewers who don't usually like horror.,"I've never watched Halloween before. It's such a pop culture behemoth though, I feel like I have. Right from that opening piano line in John Carpenter's score. It gives an instant feeling that you're in good hands. So it's 1963. Halloween (obviously) in Illinois. That detail isn't important, but being in small town America is. It's that sleepy, all is well, nothing bad ever happens here tone... and the shattering of it that's important. There's no waiting around as young Micheal Myers dons a mask, grabs a knife and butchers his older sister. Honestly it's pretty tame scene considering, but then he is just a kid. Fast forward to 1978. Donald Pleasence as Loomis buggers up a visit to grown up Myers at the hospital he's locked up at and only succeeds in providing a getaway car. He's not happy, he knows Myers wants to kill again and he's not wrong. Enter Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) as the shy bookish babysitter he sets his eye on. She lives in his old neighbourhood, where Myers has returned to stalk her, wandering around the streets in broad daylight in his soulless mask and boiler-suit. These shots are perfect. Classics. Beautiful and clearly set the bar for horror films for the next five decades. Aside Pleasence (who really doesn't feature all that much) and Curtis, the acting is pretty ropey and there's some needless nudity which I guess is explained by the era. It doesn't matter though. This is all about building tension. Myers standing stock still behind bushes and next to clotheslines. Freaking Laurie out and making her more and more paranoid as the evening draws in. The music and camera are characters of their own. The whole thing cut together deftly without a single ounce of fat. Before we know it, it's Halloween night and we're all in for some classic jump scare slasher mayhem. Like I said, I don't count myself as a horror fan which is why I've not watched this before. This though is a wonderfully simple thriller, perfectly constructed, lots of fun, with a genuinely hair raising evil protagonist. I'm not in a hurry to watch the myriad of sequels that followed, but I can see why the franchise has done so well. This alone though is the near perfect horror film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true scare fest.,"Just as Jaws did for horror beneath the sea, Michael Myers did for horror behind the mask. This low budget, independent film was an instant success, and proved that originality can be created, regardless of budget. It may be a little bit dated, a little rough around the edges, but it's that lack of polish, of over editing that works so well. I cannot decide which scene I'll be reimagining tonight as I try to drift off into the land of nod, possibly the grim death in the garage, but this a film i won't be forgetting in a hurry. That music!!!Rob Zombie later remade this film, but be honest, it wasn't a patch on this, a pale imitation.Watched 06.01.23.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"John Carpenter's film illustrates the endless possibilities of achieving something of quality with limited resources, with creativity and a sophisticated vision","Simplicity is the key to Halloween success. Crafted under a modest $300,000 budget, Carpenter and his then-girlfriend Debra Hill's script focuses more on creating suspense and atmosphere than a very elaborate plot, setting the formula that would then become enshrined in the genre. : group of friends that one by one succumb to the murderer's clutches, usually enveloped by malice and sex as a ""catalyst"" of their deaths. Previously designed as a serial killer of nannies (since Laurie and her friends act this way in their free time at school), the premise is made even simpler by being a killer - until then - who starts his murders at random, using the Halloween night terror as the perfect weather.With a limited budget, it's fun for aspiring filmmakers to see how limited finance can be a spur to creativity: the iconic Michael Myers mask, for example, was a Captain Kirk mask by William Shatner purchased for less than $2 at a store of fantasy, while the tiny crew owes tasks and duties - with Carpenter himself being responsible for the soundtrack. With the exception of the upscale guest appearance by veteran Donald Pleasence (the first Blofeld of the 007 franchise, topping in Only If You Live Twice), most of the cast was made up of fresh faces, most notably Jamie Lee Curtis, here in her role as debut. Daughter of the legendary Vivien Leigh (Psycho's scream in the shower), the actress would give life to the first final girl of the genre, performing perfectly the role of the shyest and ""innocent"" girl of a group of libidinous friends.At first, it is necessary to put aside the errors of the script (how did Myers drive a car if he was in a psychiatric hospital since childhood?) and the truncated performances (more because of the unidimensionality of the characters than because of the cast). What matters is how Carpenter manages to capture the essence of horror and suspense, without resorting to blood and death at all times. So much so that the most interesting is not knowing ""who will be next?"", as happens with many franchises derived from the same essence and that came later, such as Jason from Friday the 13th (1980), Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or even the Ghostface of Scream (1996). What draws attention here is the construction of fear and paranoia experienced by Curtis' character for being chased by a man she doesn't even know who he is and, mainly, because she chose her as an object of admiration.Right in the first scene, we have something that was previously unheard of in the genre: Carpenter puts us in the perspective of the killer, not the victims. We follow young Michael Myers' POV as he walks through his house in a mask and coldly stabs his sister, in a shocking and memorable way to start a feature film. This technique extends through the rest of the film, where Carpenter's open shots allow us to see Michael walking and approaching through well-drawn shadows by director of photography Dean Cundey, in a setting where the viewer has more information than the character in the scene - and the director uses them to build suspense. We rarely have a jump scare to demarcate Michael's appearance in this type of sequence, with anticipation being the trigger for fear and anxiety in the viewer.It's such a safe drive that Myers isn't limited to just dark environments. Even before the ""night of terror"" begins, we have several moments where the killer walks the sunny and colorful streets of the American suburb, with the mere contrasting image of his dark overalls and mask over the vibrant color palette of green bushes being enough to make us shiver. And the fact that we have several children and teenagers walking down the street in costumes throughout the film is the perfect excuse for the figure of Myers not to provoke strangeness or suspicion during his appearances, really living up to the Halloween ambiance.Michael Myers becomes an entity without even having the supernatural involved in the story. There are no explanations for what he did fifteen years ago and there are no explanations for what he is doing now. He is simply Evil and the lack of explanation is crucial to delineate this mystical aura around the character. You don't need to know this. You just need to know that he won't stop until you kill whoever he wants. Few villains gain this power over audiences in their films. The figure's association with the ""boogeyman"" myth, constantly mentioned by Tommy throughout the film, also contributes to this. Despite the lack of complexity of the characters, Myers' obsession with killing ""little girls"" is clear, leaving the virgins (in this case, Laurie) as a result of the representation of the murderer's lost innocence. So much so that the same virgins from similar later productions would follow the same path as heroines of history. It's a dubious question about ""morals and good manners"" that runs through the film itself and goes back to the period in which the film was conceived.Some horror movie musical themes are so well-crafted that they become eternally remembered and associated with their origins, as we noted for example in the music of the famous murder scene in the shower of psychopath Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) in the classic Psycho (1960), directed by Alfred Hitchcoch, or in the theme of the television series The Twilight Zone (1959-64), created by Rod Serling, or in the ballad of the absolute classic The Exorcist (1973), by William Friedkin. On Halloween, the musical theme, also written by John Carpenter, is a memorable piano ballad always associated with the film, which also joins the group of unforgettable themes of horror cinema.But the film is not limited to working only with the soundtrack and characters in danger. The setting is fundamental to the objective proposed by the script. The town of Haddonfield is presented as a peaceful and safe place. There doesn't seem to be any threat that puts the city at risk, so it becomes natural for the villain to walk around without causing fear before the attack - Laurie herself (and her friends) are slow to see a risk in the picture. Masquerade that chases them. And it is at this point that the figure of dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence, from ""With 007 You Only Live Twice"") assumes fundamental importance, and would be reused until the sixth chapter of the franchise. It is he who shows us the danger that Michael Myers poses, as well as he who makes it clear that the person behind the mask lost his humanity when he murdered his sister.Another interesting detail, which we often see in cinema, are the tributes that directors pay in their films, referring to other productions from the past. In the case of Halloween, when babysitter Laurie is taking care of two children, the television was showing scenes from two great classics of the world's science fiction. These are The Thing, filmed in 1951 by Howard Hawks for RKO, and Forbidden Planet (Forbidden Planet, 1956) by MGM, in which the nostalgic scene appears in which a spacecraft slowly lands on the planet Altair IV. These were two very fair and opportune tributes that John Carpenter provided in his film. In fact, in 1996 it was Halloween's turn to be honored by Wes Craven when in a scene from Scream, a group of teenager's watch Carpenter's classic on television and revere Jamie Lee Curtis.""Halloween"" ended up becoming, at the same time, a consequence of the works that came before, and the essential basis of the slasher subgenre. Films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Terror Night"" - both from 1974 - had already walked through the narrative of the tormented murderer, but without offering the solid foundations present in Carpenter's work. Decades later, the first Halloween remains one of the definitive classics for the horror genre. The popularization of slasher and valuable narrative resources, John Carpenter's film illustrates the endless possibilities of achieving something of quality with limited resources, with creativity and a sophisticated vision as a driving force.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Iconic Horror Flick has some flaws, but still remains scary","John Carpenter's iconic slasher flick certainly has moments that don't hold up today, however, due to his fantastic score and directing skills- this film still remains one of the most essential horror flicks of all time. I'll start with the flaws. Besides leads Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, the actors in the film are quite mediocre, and even at times funny by how bad their acting is. It not only shows they are not good actors, but seems too obvious that they are nearly incapable of doing so. Some of the dialogue is a bit off, some of which could also apply to the mediocre actors themselves. Although the film may not get into the real action of what you thought it may be until the last third, Halloween does prove to be a rather suspenseful, frightening, and atmospheric little flick. Carpenter's score truly propels the film to greatness, by causing tension at every turn, and its cinematography is also a delight, proving to be grounded while also remaining nostalgic and beautiful today. In the end, Halloween doesn't hold up as well as some may claim it does, but it still proves to be a decent and interesting watch for any horror fans to enjoy.

"An Effective, Stripped Down Slasher","John Carpenter's Halloween is a masterful example of a minimalist slasher film. The movie's uncomplicated plot and limited budget create a sense of realism which only add to the terror. However, what truly sets it apart is the bone-chilling portrayal of Michael Myers, a psychopathic killer devoid of discernible motives.Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a great performance in the lead role, capturing the character's timidness and kindness with remarkable finesse. It's easy to empathise with this young, innocent protagonist.The lean, straightforward narrative is the film's biggest strength but the franchise's biggest weakness. Its simplicity doesn't lend itself to multiple movies. While it enhances the original film's impact, it restricts the potential for numerous sequels. As subsequent instalments were released, it became evident that the franchise had limited avenues to explore.
